in their performance. Our people are committed 
and enthusiastic. Although our operations are
geographically diverse and many functions are
decentralised, we take great pride in teamwork and
sharing best practice across businesses and regions. 
Part of Tomkins’ strength is its global reach, and 
the product and market diversity of its businesses. 
We manufacture a variety of products, from
synchronous belts for engines to whirlpool baths 
and the key to our progress is that these diverse
businesses are bound together by a common factor 
– manufacturing excellence. Our geographic spread
across 21 countries together with the range of 
end-markets we serve make us not dependent 
on speciﬁc industries or regions. 
RESULTS
In 2005, revenue was up by 7.0 per cent at £3,182.4
million (2004: £2,974.1 million) and proﬁt from
operations (before restructuring initiatives) rose by
1.4 per cent to £308.5 million (2004: £304.3 million).
Proﬁt from operations at £296.7 million (2004: £286.3
million) rose by 3.6 per cent. Fully diluted earnings 
per share were 23.79 pence (2004: 22.81 pence). 
Cash ﬂow for the year was positive after interest, 
tax and dividends, despite a signiﬁcant contribution 
to the Gates pension fund.
DIVIDEND
The Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 
8.16 pence per ordinary share which, together with
the interim dividend of 5.07 pence per ordinary share
paid on 14 November 2005, brings the total dividend
for the year to 13.23 pence per ordinary share, 
an increase of 5.0 per cent. The ﬁnal dividend, 
if approved at the Annual General Meeting, will 
be paid on 31 May 2006 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on 21 April 2006. 
We continue to extol the importance of cash ﬂow
generation to our business managers, as this supports
our progressive dividend policy. 
The Board has decided to offer again the Dividend
Reinvestment Plan in respect of this ﬁnal dividend.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
We aim for the highest standards of governance and
transparency throughout the businesses and in all 
our market operations. Although the Operating 
and Financial Review (Reporting Statement 1) is not
mandatory, we used this as a guide, since it will help 
our shareholders to better assess our strategy and goals.
Over the course of 2005, we made further progress
in preparing for compliance with Section 404 of the
We continued to make good progress in what was 
a challenging year for Tomkins. 
We experienced weaker automotive production
volumes in North America and Europe, the delay in 
the implementation of the Transportation Recall,
Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation
(“TREAD”) Act, the continuing softness of the 
non-residential construction market for most of 
the year and the effect of two severe hurricanes in 
the southern United States. Despite these difﬁcult 
end-markets, the Group achieved good growth and
operating proﬁt margins. This reﬂects the ongoing
commitment of our executive management team
to ﬁnd pragmatic solutions to improve performance.
OUR CULTURE AND OUR COMPANY
The introduction of our annual bonus incentive plan 
in 2003 has been a great motivator for our managers
and has contributed to a more entrepreneurial focus

challenging conditions and produced good results”

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which we will implement
fully in the current ﬁnancial year. 
As shareholders will be aware, Tomkins reports 
to the markets on a quarterly basis. Our quarterly 
press releases are available on our website
(www.tomkins.co.uk) and hard copies can be
requested from ir@tomkins.co.uk. As we are
committed to keeping our corporate costs low, 
we have decided in future, in common with a 
number of large public companies, to place an
advertisement in the national press and no longer
produce a printed interim report.
THE BOARD
After ﬁve years with Tomkins, we are sad to be losing
Ken Minton and Norman Broadhurst, who will be
retiring from the Board at the conclusion of the
Company’s Annual General Meeting on 22 May 2006.
Following the substantial reduction in the Gates
family’s interests in the Company, Marshall Wallach
has decided to step down from the Board with effect
from 1 May 2006. On behalf of the Board and
everyone who had the pleasure of working with them,
I would like to thank all three for their outstanding
contribution to the Board and our Company and 
wish them well for the future.
I am pleased to welcome to the Board Richard
Gillingwater, Head of the UK Government’s
Shareholder Executive, Struan Robertson, formerly
Chief Executive at Wates Group, and David Richardson,
formerly Group Finance Director at Whitbread PLC, 
who have joined the Tomkins Board as non-executive
Directors. They bring to Tomkins broad and invaluable
experience that will assist the Board in its work and we
are looking forward to working with them.
EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND INVESTORS
On behalf of the Board, I should like to thank all of our
employees for their commitment during the past year.
With the support not only of our employees but also
our customers, suppliers and business partners, we can
continue on our path of sustained proﬁtable growth. 
I would also like to thank our investors for their
continuing support of Tomkins. 
VALUE CREATION
Our strategy remains focused on creating shareholder
value through organic growth, geographic expansion
and strategic acquisitions. We apply disciplined criteria 
to all potential acquisitions and capital investments 
to ensure that they are expected to enhance value. 
A chart seen below shows the Total Shareholder 
Return in the Company’s shares for each of the 
past ﬁve years ended 31 December, measured 
against the performance of the FTSE Engineering

OUTLOOK
During 2005, management dealt efﬁciently with
challenging conditions and produced good results.
Overall, the outlook for our markets in 2006 
remains positive. By adhering to our strategy of
achieving organic growth, geographic expansion 
into higher growth markets and the acquisition 
of value enhancing businesses, our strong
management team should again deliver value 
for Tomkins shareholders in 2006.

A key component of this is new product development
in order to maintain our market leadership. 
In 2005, Fluid Power opened a Customer Solutions
Centre in Denver, Colorado, in part to support its
leadership position in the port-to-port environment 
in industrial machinery and equipment. Its patented
Quick-Lok™ product has already captured a leading
market position in leak-free applications.
In addition to Quick-Lok™, other innovations 
in 2005 included hurricane-resistant louvers and 
windows in our Building Products group and several
new power transmission innovations in our 
Industrial & Automotive group, such as variable 
vane transmission pumps, six-speed carrier 
systems and advanced drive belt technology.
GLOBAL MARKET EXPANSION
The Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) of China and
India are expected to grow 9.0 per cent and 6.8 per
cent, respectively, in 2006. To further service the
domestic industrial and automotive markets of these
countries we opened two new facilities in China in
2005, increasing our total facilities there to seven, and 
one new facility in India, increasing our total facilities
there to four. Geographic expansion in high growth
markets, such as India and China, either through
greenﬁeld development or through value-enhancing
bolt-on acquisitions will remain a key focus for 
2006 and beyond.
STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS
Since December 2004, we have added more than 
$250 million (c. £140 million) in annualised revenue
through acquisitions of industrial and building products
businesses. Each of these businesses is meeting or
exceeding the ﬁnancial performance criteria used in
the business plans to justify their acquisition. We have
identiﬁed further acquisition opportunities and hope
that we can achieve our stated annual target of $300-
$500 million (c. £160-£270 million) of additional
revenues through acquisitions in 2006.
KEY GROWTH AREAS
Power Transmission remains a growth area as industrial
and automotive original equipment manufacturers
(“OEMs”) look for innovative new products and the
trend continues in automotive OEM outsourcing.
Governments, OEMs and end-users are increasingly
focused on products that provide fuel economy and
reduced emissions. With operationally efﬁcient
products such as our stop-start system, variable vane
pumps and six-speed carrier systems we are ideally
placed to take advantage of this trend.
OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2005
In 2005, we increased revenue and proﬁts,
notwithstanding difﬁcult end-market conditions,
through our managers’ focus on operational excellence.
This included lean manufacturing and new product 
and process innovation, as well as the successful
integration of businesses acquired during the year.
Lean manufacturing initiatives across our businesses
resulted in annual lean savings continuing to run in
excess of £25.0 million, in addition to increasing 
both available ﬂoor space and machine capacity.
Our managers will continue to focus on operational
excellence with a view to achieving growth in sales,
operating margins and returns in excess of our cost 
of capital in the years ahead.
NEW PRODUCTS
Strategically our primary objective is the creation 
of shareholder value through the development 
of our businesses. 
“Our businesses are focused on delivering dynamic growth
in value through new products, global market expansion
and strategic acquisitions”
JAMES NICOL
CHIEF EXECUTIVE TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
REVIEW 2005

Industrial and automotive aftermarket revenue showed
good growth in 2005 and is expected to grow steadily
in the future. We plan to expand our market share 
by growing our product lines and leveraging our 
strong brand names and distribution network,
especially in China where aftermarket sales grew 
in 2005 by 9.6 per cent.
The businesses within our Building Products 
group performed well in 2005, helped by new 
product introductions such as the Lasco “Contours
™
”
luxury whirlpool and shower range. Lasco is one of the
largest manufacturers of bathtubs in the United States.
In 2005, we made signiﬁcant investments in our
bathware manufacturing facilities to increase efﬁciency
through robotics and to comply with increased
government emissions requirements through the
installation of concentrators. We believe this will give
us a signiﬁcant competitive advantage going forward
in dealing with those national and regional competitors
that have not made these necessary investments.
Our Air Systems Components group also introduced
a number of new products in 2005, such as the
hurricane-resistant louvers and energy recovery
ventilators, and is expected to continue to grow
through product innovation and bolt-on acquisitions,
beneﬁtting from an anticipated upturn in the
commercial construction sector in 2006.
MARKET DRIVERS
The 2006 outlook for our end-markets is mostly
positive. In our Industrial & Automotive group,
automotive production is expected to remain ﬂat in
North America and in Europe, with accelerated growth
in South America and China. We expect to beneﬁt
from increased outsourcing of highly engineered
power transmission systems in automotive original
equipment and from a continuing growth in industrial
production – industrial sales becoming increasingly
important, as our exposure to automotive original
equipment has decreased to less than 22.0 per cent of
sales. The industrial and automotive aftermarkets are
expected to stay strong.
In our Building Products group, the residential
construction market is expected to fall slightly from the
record level of 2005, but to remain very healthy, while
commercial construction is expected to grow steadily
over the next few years. 
OUR PEOPLE
We closely aligned the interests of management 
with those of our shareholders through our annual
bonus incentive plan introduced in 2003 under 
which managers participate in the value creation 
of the businesses they manage. This has changed 
our corporate culture by creating an entrepreneurial
spirit within the Tomkins Group. Our managers
understand the importance of value creation and in
addition to operational excellence are now focused 
on key growth objectives such as new product
development, geographic expansion and acquisitions.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
Our solid performance this year reﬂects our commitment
to strengthen our businesses. I am particularly pleased
with the success achieved on our strategic initiatives,
including our new product introductions, the integration
of our ﬁve recent acquisitions and our expansion 
in China and India. The operational initiatives taken
during 2005 should result in our Group continuing 
this success and achieving growth in 2006.

The Quick-Lok
™
Growth Story
THE FLUID POWER BUSINESS
Fluid Power manufactures hydraulic hoses,
assemblies, connectors and port-to-port solutions
that are the arteries and veins of the mobile 
hydraulic equipment used principally in the
construction, mining and agricultural industries. 
The global business operates in 19 plants in eight
countries. Fluid Power is a leading player in a 
market estimated to be in excess of $2.5 billion, 
with a market share of around 20 per cent.
THE FLUID POWER MARKET
Each year there are over 400 million connections
made in hydraulic equipment and with existing
threaded technology the key issues are the time taken
to make a connection and the difﬁculty in controlling
the process to ensure a leak-free environment. Fluid
Power has responded to the customers’ needs and
developed a new technology known as Quick-Lok
™
that provides a quick and leak-free solution to
hydraulic hose assembly. 
WHAT IS QUICK-LOK
™
?
Quick-Lok
™
is a family of threadless hydraulic
couplings that have a simple snap-in and veriﬁable
connection that eliminates torque and requires no
assembly tools. Since the process is virtually error-free
there is a reliable, leak-free connection. Once in place,
the assembly cannot be inadvertently disconnected, 
or released under pressure, which is an important
safety feature.
WHY IS QUICK-LOK
™
A KEY GROWTH STORY?
Quick-Lok
™
provides a solution to the problems 
of threaded couplings and will be the product of
choice in a wide range of applications. By reducing
installation and maintenance costs, Quick-Lok
™
lowers the customer’s cost of ownership dramatically
when compared to threaded assembly. 
In 2005, Fluid Power was awarded $3.5 million 
of sales of its new Quick-Lok
™
technology and this
contributed to total sales growth in the business of 
10.6 per cent over 2004 and double-digit operating
margins. Looking to 2006 and beyond, a number 
of signiﬁcant new Quick-Lok
™
contracts have 
been awarded. 
Customers who are using Quick-Lok
™
include
major industry names such as Gehl, Bobcat, JCB 
and Workhorse Custom Chassis.
“We like Quick-Lok
™
because it’s simple, easier
to put together and saves on re-work, which
allows us to produce more machines.”
TIM WOLLES, FROM THE ADVANCED PRODUCT GROUP AT GEHL
EASY TO SERVICE, NO
SPECIAL TOOLS NEEDED
No special tools are needed 
to remove the Quick-Lok
™
adaptor from the port – just 
a common wrench.
FOR SPEEDY CHANGEOVER
Live ﬁeld demonstrations showed
that it took one tenth of the time 
to assemble the Quick-Lok
™
connectors compared to the
standard threaded connections.

THE LASCO BATHWARE BUSINESS
Lasco Bathware is one of the largest manufacturers 
of bathtubs in the United States, producing nearly 
a quarter of all bathtubs sold. Lasco’s products include
luxury whirlpools, bathtubs, showers and shower
units. The business operates from nine manufacturing
facilities across the United States with national
distribution to builders, home centres and wholesalers.
THE BATHTUB AND FIXTURES MARKET
Since 2000, the United States bathtub, shower 
and whirlpool baths market has been growing at 
an annual rate of around 3.0 per cent. In 2005, 
the overall market was estimated at $1.9 billion and 
by 2013 is forecast to be around $2.4 billion, with 
a particularly strong annual growth rate in showers
and whirlpool baths. The drivers for this growth are
record new housing sales to historic levels and a trend
towards increased re-modelling spend, with more
people renovating ageing properties and installing
additional baths and showers in their homes.
WHAT IS THE CONTOURS
™
RANGE BY LASCO BATHWARE?
By positioning itself at the high-end of the product
offering with the Contours
™
range, Lasco Bathware 
is gaining market share through both the quality of its
products and design features. The Contours
™
range 
of baths and showers includes features such as an 
air-and-water hydrotherapy system that creates a
stress-reducing massage and an in-line heater that
guarantees a constant temperature while bathing. 
The showers feature steam and body spray systems
and a teak ﬂoor insert to create a spa-like environment. 
WHY IS THE CONTOURS
™
RANGE A KEY GROWTH STORY?
The Contours
™
range has created a higher proﬁle
brand recognition of Lasco Bathware in multiple
market segments. The exposure the Contours
™
product range received at the International Builder
Show and the Kitchen & Bath Industry Show has
resulted in increased sales in all product categories. 
In 2005, Lasco Bathware achieved 15.7 per cent
sales growth and double-digit operating margins, 
in part due to the success of the new Contours
™
range. Lasco Bathware’s market share is expected 
to grow in 2006, as new products are added to 
the Contours
™
line and exposure to the hotel 
and leisure market increases.
Customers who are featuring the Contours

product range in their showrooms and new homes
include industry leaders such as Ferguson, Hajoca 
and KB Homes.

WHY IS INNOVISION
™
BEAM BLADE A KEY GROWTH STORY?
The Innovision
™
line continues to grow because Trico
is able to offer the latest technology to ﬁt the vast
majority of vehicles on the road today. Consumers
appreciate the unique styling, performance and easy
installation of the beam blade. Innovision
™
has
created a new Premier category in the wiper market. 
Innovision
™
was launched in 2004, and during 2005
revenue capacity was tripled to meet the continually
rising demand, with nearly 2.6 million units sold.
Management estimates that in 2006, the beam blade
aftermarket will be approximately $100 million, with a
growth rate of 10 per cent in each of the next few years.
Innovision
™
is currently being supplied to major
names in the North American automotive aftermarket
including Canadian Tire, NAPA, CARQUEST, Pep Boys,
Fred Meyer and O’Reilly Auto Parts.
THE TRICO WIPERS BUSINESS
Trico is one of the world’s largest windscreen wiper
blade manufacturers and a leading producer of wiper
systems. Trico operates eight plants around the world,
supplying customers in 67 countries, including General
Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler, Honda, Inﬁniti, Land
Rover, Jaguar and Nissan. Sales to the automotive
aftermarket now represent over 40 per cent of 
Trico’s total sales.
WIPER BLADE TECHNOLOGY
The main requirements of a wiper blade are that it
delivers a consistent wipe and is durable. Traditional
wiper blades have struggled to deliver the required
performance, especially in bad weather conditions
such as snow and ice. Trico has developed a
revolutionary wiper blade design known as the
Innovision
™
beam blade that provides a solution 
to these problems.
WHAT IS THE INNOVISION
™
BEAM BLADE?
The Innovision
™
beam blade features a unique low
proﬁle that reduces wind lift at higher speeds. The
blade has an inﬁnite number of pressure points that
provide continuous pressure across the length of the
blade. The design of the blade with a jointless structure
also maximises durability and ensures a quieter, more
efﬁcient operation. Innovision
™
blades outperformed
traditional blades in all snow and ice tests.

2005: 21.1 per cent of Group sales 
Global automotive production in 2005 increased by
3.9 per cent compared to 2004 according to CSM
auto database, with a total of 62.2 million light
vehicles manufactured. In North America, 
15.8 million units were produced, which was the
same output as in 2004. According to Ward’s Autos,
production volumes at General Motors and Ford
were down by 8.4 per cent and 10.5 per cent
respectively, whereas DaimlerChrysler increased
volumes by 3.7 per cent. In Western Europe,
production declined by 2.2 per cent to 15.8 million
units, but in Japan and Korea production grew by
5.1 per cent in 2005. There was continued strong
growth in South America and the emerging markets,
including China, which grew by 14.0 per cent and
13.8 per cent respectively. 
Looking ahead to 2006, CSM is forecasting North
American production to remain at the 15.8 million unit
level, Western European production to decline by 
1.5 per cent, and production in Japan and Korea to 
be ahead by 3.9 per cent. The strong growth rate 
seen in 2005 in South America and the emerging

2005: 21.3 per cent of Group sales
The global automotive aftermarket showed steady
growth in 2005. Factors such as the weather, stock
rebalancing and customer consolidation are all
variables that can impact the market on a quarter-
by-quarter basis. While the hurricanes in the United
States in the third quarter of the year had 
a negative impact with a number of distribution
stores closed, a strengthening of both the US and
European markets in the fourth quarter of the year
had a positive impact on the full year. In 2006, we
expect the market in North America and Europe 
to grow in line with GDP.
INDUSTRIAL ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT 
Encompassing: Power Transmission, Fluid Power, 
Fluid Systems and Other Industrial & Automotive
2005: 16.3 per cent of Group sales
In 2005, the market continued to show good 
year-on-year growth in all regions. Total industrial
production as measured by the US Federal Reserve
was 2.9 per cent higher and capacity utilisation was
1.3 per cent higher when compared to 2004. The
construction and mining sectors rebounded strongly
in the ﬁnal quarter of 2005 following the negative
impact of the two US hurricanes earlier in the year.
The market is expected to show continuing modest
growth in 2006.

given that square footage was lower by 9.5 per cent
in the ﬁrst half. The US Census Bureau measures the
performance in dollar terms and reported that the
market was ahead by 5.7 per cent. It appears that 
a slow recovery in the market has begun and Dodge
has forecast a 4.0 per cent increase in 2006.
The remaining 5.5 per cent of Group sales relate 
to other varied markets, including recreational
vehicles and manufactured housing.

rates in an economy. The relative prices of the vehicle
and population growth are also key factors that will
impact demand for new automobiles.
Demand for our products will also be impacted 
by inventory or stock levels of vehicles or replacement
parts. A number of factors drive the long-term demand
for aftermarket products such as the number of
vehicles on the road, the age of the vehicles, the
distance travelled and the average cost of repair.
The demand for industrial products is driven by
industrial production levels in the economies of the
world, with capital spending by the major
manufacturers of mobile equipment used in the
construction, mining, and agricultural sectors directly
impacting our business. Sales of products into the
industrial aftermarket are affected by stock levels 
in the distribution channel. 
OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND STRATEGY
The businesses in the Industrial & Automotive group

the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing
market. The products are sold through a variety 
of manufacturers’ representatives, wholesalers,
distributors and retailers. A list of the top ten
customers in the Building Products group is shown 
on the next page. These customers represent 
15.7 per cent of Building Products sales in 2005.
KEY MARKET DRIVERS
Sales to the residential construction market are driven
by the level of new homes constructed and the home
re-modelling market. Both of these markets are linked
directly to consumer spending in the United States,
which is affected by interest rates and taxation rates 
in the economy.
The long-term trend of new home building is
related to the balance of demand and supply, which 
is determined by demographics and affordability and 
is connected to disposable income and interest rates. 
The re-modelling market is affected by the age of the
housing stock and the disposable income of home
occupants in the United States.
The non-residential market is driven by rental 
rates and occupancy rates that are affected by
macroeconomic factors such as growth in GDP , the
level of employment and industrial production levels.

leading market share. The business has national
manufacturing and distribution capabilities and 
an established relationship with manufacturers’
representatives, architects and engineers. In Other
Building Products the Lasco Bathware business
manufactures nearly a quarter of all baths sold in the
United States, and has positioned itself at the high-end
of the bathtub, shower and whirlpool market with the
new ‘Contours
™
’ range. This market has grown with
record sales of new homes and a trend towards
increased spend on re-modelling of homes. Lean
manufacturing continues to be extended across 
the businesses. A number of new products were
successfully launched in the year and some examples
are included in the new products section below. The
acquisition of Milcor and NRG Industries Inc. has given
the group access to new product lines and customers,
and a manufacturing base in China. Milcor has been
successfully integrated and NRG is nearing full
integration. Both businesses are performing ahead 
of expectations, with additional synergies expected 
to be realised in 2006.
NEW PRODUCTS
In 2005, new products developed in the past three
years accounted for 6.5 per cent of Building Products’
sales. Examples include:
• Hurricane-resistant louvers, Ruskin: in response to 
the widespread failure of the various buildings in 
the southern United States, Ruskin has developed
hurricane-resistant louvers. The louvers can hold up
under pressure in severe weather by preventing wind
and rain damage. This technology is helping Ruskin
to win signiﬁcant new contracts, including the Miami
Performing Arts Center in the state of Florida. 
• Energy recovery ventilators, NRG Industries: in
September 2005, Tomkins acquired NRG Industries
which manufactures commercial air conditioning
products including energy recovery ventilators (ERVs).
The ERV meets the growing need for energy
conservation among building owners.
• The Contours™ bathware range, Lasco Bathware:
during 2005, Lasco Bathware launched a new range
of luxury whirlpools, baths and showers known as
the ‘Contours™’ range that is receiving industry
acclaim and has helped the business to grow sales 
by 15.7 per cent in 2005.
NRG INDUSTRIES
The energy recovery ventilator has 
a patented wheel design that rotates 
out of the airﬂow when not needed.
This means the incoming outside air 
is not warmed, only then having to 
be cooled back down again.
RUSKIN HURRICANE-
RESISTANT LOUVERS
The hurricane-resistant louvers 
are able to withstand wind loads 
of up to 160 psf and nearly 9 inches
of rainfall. Ruskin was the ﬁrst
manufacturer to gain approval 
for its louvers from the Florida 
Building Compliance Ofﬁce.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
Corporate Social Responsibility
2005 has seen continuing improvement in the
social, environmental and ethical standards
prevalent throughout the Group’s operations.
Tomkins believes in the importance of social
responsibility in its business practices. This is consistent
with a growing regulatory environment that requires
greater emphasis on social responsibility in the conduct
of the affairs of a public company. To this end, the
Company and its businesses seek to achieve the
highest standards consistent with its obligations to 
its shareholders, employees and customers to provide
products and services that customers are prepared to
buy, whilst continuing employment opportunities 
and providing an acceptable return to shareholders.
Tomkins continues to take a number of initiatives
that advance these principles including lean
manufacturing which has seen, amongst other things,
cost-savings through a reduction in the use of raw
materials, levels of waste and use of energy, together
with a substantial improvement in health, safety and
environmental performance in many of the Group’s
facilities. In the design, engineering and production 
of the Group’s products, consideration is given to 
the environmental impact of the manufacture of such
products and use to which they are put. Emphasis is
placed on reducing waste and the use of energy in
production processes. The Board of Tomkins
encourages such policies within its businesses.
This report sets out initially the Tomkins’ Code of
Conduct and Ethics and Human Rights Policy. It then
provides a summary in three parts of the work the
Group has undertaken during the year in the area of
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) consistent with 
the principle of continuous improvement, and highlights
the main achievements. The ﬁrst part of the CSR Report
deals with health, safety and the environment; the
second part covers Socially Responsible Investment (SRI)
and ﬁnally Community Involvement.
CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS & HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
Tomkins’ Code of Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”)
and Human Rights Policy form the basis on which
uniform standards are applied across the Group in all
countries where the Group operates. The Code sets
out a series of ethical policies and principles of conduct
to be followed by all Tomkins’ companies and applies
to all Directors, ofﬁcers and employees, who are
expected to conduct Company business with integrity
and in compliance with the laws of the countries in
which they operate. The Code covers a number of
important areas including competing fairly and
complying with anti-trust and competition laws,
employee health and safety laws and environmental
laws. It also reafﬁrms Tomkins’ commitment to fair
treatment of all employees, ethical and lawful
behaviour, and sets out some general principles, which
are important in dealing with suppliers and customers
and with governments and government agencies. 
The Code emphasises the importance of employees
protecting the Company’s intellectual property. Any
waivers to the Code require the approval of the Board
and will be published on the Company’s website.
During the year, no waivers have been either sought 
or granted. 
Tomkins’ Human Rights Policy (the “Policy”) has
established a number of principles that are applied
across the Group to all companies, no matter where
they operate. These principles cover anti-discrimination,
employee rights (in the areas of health and safety,
wages and working hours), prohibition of child labour
and social responsibility (covering environmental 
impact and community relations). Employees are
expected to maintain the highest standards in
conformity with the principles.
A copy of the full text of the Code and the Policy 
(in several languages) can be found in the corporate
governance area on T omkins’ website or a printed copy
is available by application to the Company Secretary at
the Company’s registered ofﬁce. From time-to-time, the
Board reviews the Code and the Policy to ensure that
they reﬂect best practice. During the year, a paragraph
was added to the Code and to the Policy which allowed
those Tomkins businesses that have their own existing
code of conduct and ethics and human rights policy or
similar documents to retain them, provided such
documents incorporate the principles of the T omkins’
Code and the Policy and they have received the prior
approval of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of T omkins.
Senior management throughout the Group are
required to conﬁrm annually that they and their
businesses have complied with the principles set out 
in both the Code and the Policy and to report any
breaches. For 2005, no breaches were reported by any
of the operating businesses. Adherence to the Code
and the Policy forms part of the business risk assurance
monitoring process, which has assisted in ensuring the
dissemination of the Code and Policy throughout the
20 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
Group. The Board does not believe that an independent
external process of veriﬁcation is required at this time,
but will keep this under review.
1. HEALTH, SAFETY AND THE
ENVIRONMENT (HSE)
The priority and importance placed by the Board and
management of Tomkins on HSE matters is driven by a
belief and experience that Tomkins’ commercial success
and high HSE performance are mutually reinforcing
objectives. It was because of the importance placed on
HSE matters that the Health, Safety and Environment
Committee was formed by the Board in January 2003.
In recognising its responsibilities to its employees
and the communities in which Tomkins operates, the
Group’s approach to HSE is one of continuous
improvement. Key to the maintenance of the standards
the Group sets for itself is the work of the Health,
Safety and Environment Committee of the Board and 
a supporting team of specialist professionals (the 
“HSE team”) operating throughout the Group. They
have been active in guiding operating businesses 
to achieve the highest internationally recognised
standards including Occupational Health and Safety
Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 and ISO 14001 
or equivalent. The OHSAS standard has been created 
to allow companies to develop systematic controls
relating to their health and safety risks and 
to seek external accreditation of the HSE 
management system.
POLICY, OBJECTIVES AND COMPLIANCE
The intention of Tomkins’ HSE policy is to provide a
safe and healthy workplace for all employees and to
minimise the impact of the Group’s operations on the
environment. Tomkins is committed to the highest
HSE standards consistent with regulatory requirements
and best management practices. The Group’s
businesses are required to operate their facilities
consistent with this commitment. All employees have
a part to play in that commitment and they are
encouraged and expected to do so. Amongst the HSE
Committee’s responsibilities is the determination on
behalf of the Board of the framework or broad policy
and objectives in the areas of HSE and to propose any
amendments to existing policies and objectives for
approval by the Board.
The Group’s policies and objectives are translated 
by management into speciﬁc action plans for each
operational site. All business groups are encouraged 
to set realistic HSE targets and objectives within their
annual business plans in order to pursue a strategy
based on continuous performance improvement. The
HSE activities of individual businesses in the Group are
monitored by the HSE team which carries out regular
performance audits. The audit reports produced are
given to local management who are responsible for
correcting any deﬁciencies that come to light. A
summary is provided to the HSE Committee. At every
quarterly business review with senior management, 
an analysis of incidents of industrial accident and
environmental exposure is considered and discussed.
The Tomkins Annual Bonus Incentive Plan for
management is focused on a sharing of a proportion
of Group after-tax proﬁts after deduction of a charge
for the cost of capital. An intrinsic feature of the
Group’s ability to generate sustained value is the 
need to maintain high standards of HSE controls 
in all operating businesses worldwide. There is much
evidence that actions to improve standards of HSE are
ﬁnancially beneﬁcial to the Group. Furthermore, high
standards of HSE are often paralleled by high standards
of product quality control and customer service. For
these reasons, the Board does not believe it is
necessary to identify separately the performance on
HSE matters as a speciﬁc criterion in determining
bonus payments.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE
The Committee plays a key role in the Group’s HSE
activities and is comprised of two non-executive
Directors and the Chief Executive and normally meets
at least three times a year. In 2005, there were
meetings and inspections at the Gates plant at Legnica,
Poland; the Stackpole plants at Ancaster, Canada; and
the Schrader plants at Belfast and Carrickfergus,
Northern Ireland. Meetings always take place at one 
of the Group’s facilities and normally form part of a
programme during which the Committee will, where
possible, visit more than one site. Site visits enable the
Committee to gain an understanding at ﬁrst hand of
HSE activities of business units and the issues facing
them. This process allows the Committee to maintain a
strong and continuing overview of the way the Group’s
HSE policies and objectives are being implemented.
Site visits by top management also enable facility
personnel to recognise the importance the Committee
and Tomkins Board places upon such matters.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
21
Tomkins plc and its subsidiaries are
committed to conducting their
businesses with care for the health 
and safety of all employees and with
respect for the environment. The HSE
policies are available in several
languages on the Tomkins website. 
The Code of Conduct and Ethics
describes long-standing principles of
conduct that Tomkins follows to
ensure its business is conducted with
integrity and in compliance with the
law in the countries in which it
operates. The Code of Conduct is
available in several languages on the
Tomkins website. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
The Committee has formal terms of reference which
can be found in the Corporate Governance section 
of the Company’s website. The Committee reports
regularly to the Board on its activities, which assists 
the Board in making informed decisions about the
businesses of the Group, particularly relating to any
proposed new investment in manufacturing facilities
and the related HSE implications. The reports received
by the Committee also highlight current areas of HSE
focus and improvement and any event or potential
breach of regulatory requirements. Any potentially
serious breach is communicated immediately to the
Chief Executive of Tomkins and the Committee. This
enables the Committee to monitor fully the
compliance record of each business unit and ensure
corrective action is taken in a timely manner. Of the
environmental deﬁciencies found by regulators or
discovered during audits in 2005, the substantial
majority related to reporting deﬁciencies. On health
and safety, the majority of the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (“OSHA”) citations and informal
inquiries were resolved promptly.
HSE ASSURANCE
The HSE Committee receives detailed quarterly reports
from the HSE team on the current status of all matters
which require attention, including a description of
what action has been taken to address those matters
and the timetable to completion. The adoption of
international or comparable internal standards, tailored
to the individual requirements of a growing number 
of operating businesses, increases the Committee’s
conﬁdence in the effectiveness and accuracy of the
reporting systems and procedures.
Business risk assurance audits are conducted by
Tomkins’ own professionals together with the site
management teams, to ensure that processes and
controls are in place to maintain compliance with
Group policy and the applicable local and national 
HSE legislation.
Tomkins places a great deal of importance on HSE
matters in its acquisition processes. The Tomkins HSE
team forms part of the due diligence team and where
appropriate, external environmental advisers are
employed to review and assess any environmental risks
to which the Group could become exposed if an
acquisition were to proceed. In addition, health 
and safety is also a key area for which a full review is
undertaken including the level of compliance with all
applicable laws and regulations. Environmental due
diligence was performed at all acquired facilities during
the year to ensure that no outstanding remedial
obligations were assumed unless properly deﬁned and
reserved and that any compliance issues were properly
identiﬁed prior to acquisition and addressed promptly.
A review is made of a potential acquisition’s
environmental management system, relationships 
with regulatory ofﬁcials and general level of respect
and care shown for the environment. Where necessary,
an indemnity is sought from the vendor to cover any
potential liabilities, but it is possible that a potential
acquisition would be rejected if the HSE risks were
considered to be too high. Tomkins may require a
vendor to undertake HSE improvements before a
transaction is concluded.
During the year, the Tomkins’ Excellence Award 
was instituted which provides incentives for each
location to meet speciﬁed standards in 12 areas
including: safety indices (incident and severity rates);
waste indices (landﬁll & total wastes); environmental
management systems; regulatory compliance; HSE 
self-assessment; loss prevention report review and
follow-up; citizenship; HSE professional development;
third-party HSE audit response; and corporate HSE
audit response.
HSE COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION
In support of the Group’s HSE activities, a secure
internet-accessible HSE database became fully
operational in 2005. A streamlined data collection,
storage and reporting system to track HSE
performance as well as the ongoing HSE audit process
began operation. Data is currently provided for
approximately 185 of Tomkins’ operating locations.
Veriﬁcation of the completeness and quality of collected
data will be accomplished through annual data reviews
completed by T omkins’ facilities and through periodic
internal and third party HSE assessments conducted by
the T omkins HSE team. Data is derived from information
maintained for each location, including the number of
employees, a description of the operations, site
information including the size and geographic location 
of the site, age and size of buildings on-site, and
information on environmental, safety and quality
management systems employed by the location. An HSE
risk assessment has been completed for each location as
well as HSE information relating to: permits, consents,
and approvals held by the operation; above ground and
22 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
underground tanks on-site; and data indicating the
presence and management of any asbestos or PCB –
containing equipment or materials that may be on-site.
The data collected on a separate intranet-based system
now allows accurate reporting of incident and severity
rates across the Group (see graph on page 25). Following
the gathering of basic data, it will be possible to report
on a number of other areas including waste rates,
emissions and other HSE data which will allow more
detailed reports in future. Data is collected relating to
emissions from the facility and reduction efforts are
monitored against company-established targets for
Gates; in the future, other companies may choose to use
this tool for waste Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).
Work has continued during the year to complete an
integrated approach to the Group’s HSE activities
which has been supported by the development of
Tomkins’ HSE intranet website which is available to 
the Group’s HSE community. It offers a wide range 
of information and assistance in many important 
areas including training.
HSE HIGHLIGHTS
Two major HSE conferences were held during the 
year for Tomkins Group HSE professionals: one in 
Asia (Singapore) and the other in North America
(Columbus, Ohio). In February 2005, the ﬁrst Asian
HSE Conference was held to educate and expand the
culture of compliance and best practice to facilities in
the region. The Conference agenda included a
presentation by each business represented of one 
or more of their best practices. The beneﬁts for
participants included team building, understanding
the HSE organisational structure and practices,
knowledge sharing, improvement in HSE
performance, networking with colleagues and the
development of strong motivation. In November
2005, the North American HSE conference attracted
more than 150 attendees, and an intensive three days
of HSE training was provided, with an emphasis on
integrating HSE into lean practices and included the
introduction of the Tomkins’ HSE Excellence Model.
Tomkins’ commitment to HSE was evidenced by the
presence of Tomkins’ Chief Executive, Jim Nicol, who
provided the opening address, explaining that
excellence in HSE is a requirement and a priority for
all Tomkins businesses.
The emphasis on training continues to remain 
an HSE priority with a whole range of programmes
provided to employees, from basic plant-based
programmes to the more advanced training for 
HSE professionals. 
There were many notable health and safety
achievements throughout the Group during the 
year, and some representative examples are
summarised below:
• Four Stant plants have achieved substantial periods
without a lost-time accident; Connersville (381 days),
Tijuana (750 days), Pontypool (over 1200 days) and
Karvina (300 days). Similar results have been
achieved by other companies including Ideal, Gates
Iola, Gates Salt Lake City, Gates Siloam Springs, Lasco
Fittings, Lasco Bathware (Lancaster) and Dearborn
Mid-West;
• A substantial number of facilities have improved 
the level of lighting with a change to more efﬁcient
lighting installations with longer bulb life which leads
to the creation of a safer working environment, a
reduction in the use of electricity and reduced costs.
These lighting units are environmentally-friendly and
can also be disposed of as general refuse, unlike the
metal halide ﬁxtures which contain mercury and
require a licensed waste hauler for disposal;
• Five of Lasco Bathware’s facilities installed in 2005
control technology which reduces employee exposure 
to styrene by an estimated 85 per cent while controlling
air emissions by more than 90 per cent; and
• Behaviour Based Safety training has been introduced
throughout the Group during the year, and several
plants have begun implementation of the programme.
A large number of awards were received by Tomkins’
operating businesses from local, regional and national
organisations, reﬂecting the attainment and
maintenance of high standards in health and safety
throughout the Group’s facilities.
There were a number of notable environmental
achievements during the year where targets were
either met or exceeded, and, by way of example, 
some are summarised below:
• Recycling and waste reduction efforts have been
made in a large number of Tomkins’ facilities with
notable results achieved under their HSE Excellence
Model by Gates facilities in North America, Europe
and Asia. Recycling activities are extensive and
include metal scrap, vinyl, glass, cardboard, water,
plastic wrap and inkjet cartridges;

TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
• At Gates, Aachen, Germany, zero waste to landﬁll
has been achieved since 1998 (although such
German regulatory requirements came into effect
much later in June 2005). The key elements to
achieving zero landﬁll waste include a thorough
knowledge and careful analysis of all waste streams,
strict policies covering incoming material, packaging
and resulting waste and whole life product and
process design;
• Lasco Bathware is upgrading its transport ﬂeet to
reduce nitrous oxide emissions by requiring improved
pollution control for diesel engines;
• A great deal of success has been achieved in
reducing the use of electricity throughout Tomkins,
not just in lighting, but also production processes
and a range of other areas. Gates Unitta Asia
achieved a substantial reduction in the use of
electricity in the Belt Testing facility in their Technical
Department by developing the regenerative
dynamometer brake (by re-engineering the existing
dynamometer brake). This generates electricity while
giving resistance torque to the belt. The electricity
generated is fed back into the system. Accordingly,
the test rig now consumes only half as much
electricity as the traditional test rig;
• By siting two satellite factories close to their major
customers, Ruskin has reduced freight costs (and
resultant vehicle emissions) and packaging materials;
• Out of adversity sometimes comes opportunity and
Stackpole discovered that Hurricane Katrina had
reduced substantially the supply of hydrogen
available, since it was sourced in the areas badly
affected. A thorough re-assessment of its production
processes was undertaken, which has led to a
reduction in its hydrogen usage of 30 per cent;
• The Philips facility at Stayton, Oregon has reduced
waste by more than 40 per cent, primarily due 
to glass recycling efforts;
• The Ideal plant in St Augustine, Florida, has
eliminated all industrial wastewater discharged 
and reduced its hazardous waste by 51 per cent 
in 2005; and
• Aquatics and Lasco Bathware have engaged in
research and development effort to reduce air
emissions by as much as 22 per cent through 
the use of modiﬁed resins in their products.
There are a number of continuous improvement
projects run by operating businesses that continue 
to yield year-on-year gains in environmental and
ﬁnancial performance, reductions in hazardous waste
being a good example.
There are numerous examples throughout the
Group where changes to processes can yield
environmental, HSE safety and ﬁnancial beneﬁts 
in one operation.
MANUFACTURE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY 
ADVANTAGEOUS PRODUCTS
Many of Tomkins’ businesses have adopted a “Green
Purchasing” routine by which sustainable materials 
are given preference in the purchasing process.
Additionally, Tomkins supplies a number of products
that have a positive impact on the environment. By
way of illustration, two examples are drawn from
Dearborn Mid-West Conveyor Company (DMW) 
and Ruskin.
The US Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Air
Interstate Rule furthers the objectives of the US Clean
Air Act, which requires coal burning power plants to
reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by 70 per cent and
nitrogen oxides by 60 per cent by 2015, compared to
2003 levels, across a region including 28 eastern
states. DMW is furnishing bulk material handling
systems to some of the leading United States energy
companies in this unprecedented effort to improve air
quality. Flue-Gas Desulphurisation requires lime or
limestone in the chemical process to remove sulphur
dioxide from ﬂue gases. A by-product of the process 
is gypsum or sludge. All of these materials are
transported, stored, and retrieved by DMW equipment.
In some cases the gypsum will be conveyed or loaded
out for shipment to nearby plants as the primary
ingredient for the manufacture of plasterboard. DMW 
is assisting other plants who will achieve emission
reductions by converting to lower sulphur coal, or
blending a fuel mix that results in lower emissions.
Different physical and combustion properties require
that the existing material handling systems be modiﬁed
or expanded.
Ruskin, in common with its sister companies in the
Air Handling group, has signed up to the objectives of
the US Green Building Council whose mission is to
promote buildings that are environmentally responsible,
proﬁtable and healthy places to live and work. Just one
of a number of products developed to support this
initiative is the Electronic Air Measurement Station. 
24 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
This innovative product enables the building operator 
to keep leakage of conditioned air to below three cubic
feet per minute per square foot while maintaining a
healthy supply of fresh outside air to the building
occupants. Ruskin’s success in this ﬁeld was recognised
when its President was a featured speaker at the 2005
Engineering Green Buildings Conference.
HSE PERFORMANCE
At the end of 2005, 115 of the Group’s 152 facilities
had adopted an Environmental Management System
(“EMS”), of which 73 facilities were ISO 14001
accredited (2004: 65). A further 24 facilities are
currently ISO compliant but not registered. A further
18 facilities have alternative EMSs in place (these
facilities have implemented fully functional EMSs that
were not based on the ISO 14001 outline but achieve
similar results and are not intended for ISO
certiﬁcation); the remainder of the facilities (except
those facilities opening in 2005 or scheduled to close)
have been tasked to achieve ISO compliance with fully
functional EMSs in 2006.
All of the businesses have established a range of
HSE KPIs within their current business plans to monitor
and assess HSE performance on an ongoing basis. The
HSE Committee monitors the KPIs on a regular basis to
ensure that HSE focus and continuous improvement in
performance are being delivered by all business groups.
Examples of the KPIs used include incident/accident and
severity rates, raw material wastage and energy
consumption per applicable production unit, and
compliance with T omkins’ HSE policy and local
environmental legislation.
Trends on accidents within Tomkins’ manufacturing
plants and distribution facilities are measured using
OSHA standards, since the majority of the Group’s
operations are based in North America. The Tomkins
database provides Group-wide performance data on
the incident rate and the resulting lost days, and the
severity rate, which are tracked in all individual
facilities. A target incident rate of 2.0 (meaning 2
reportable incidents per 100 workers over a period 
of one year) has been set for certain of Tomkins
operations and for the remainder, reductions in the
incident rate and severity rate from year to year, have
been set. The graph opposite shows the trend over 
the past ﬁve years – a reduction of over 40 per cent 
in the incident rate. The very slight increase in the
incident rate in 2005 is entirely due to newly acquired
businesses for which Tomkins’ HSE policies have not
yet been fully implemented. Without those businesses,
the improvement year-on-year would have continued.
The target severity rate (average number of lost
workdays per incident) has been set at zero and for 
the ﬁve-year period a reduction of over 50 per cent was
recorded. The results were affected by the performance
of businesses acquired in recent years, but work
continues to improve performance year-on-year. 
Waste generation has been measured in Gates’
facilities as part of the HSE Excellence Model, although
a number of other companies have also tracked waste.
Expansion of the new intranet database now provides
an opportunity for central measurement of results and
data worldwide. Actual amounts of total waste and
waste to landﬁll may be tracked. Waste is deﬁned as
“any goods being shipped off-site for either disposal 
or for other beneﬁcial use besides the intended original
end-product function”, that is, any non-saleable good
or product. In the Gates facilities, waste volume is then
compared to net production volume (tonnes of good
product manufactured and shipped to warehouse or 
to customers or, for distribution centres, tonnes of
product shipped). Due to the signiﬁcant amount of
waste inherent in some production processes (e.g.
grinding dust of belts, or swarf in hose coupling
production), for the purpose of evaluation, waste
indices are calculated as a percentage of net
production. This enables performance to be
benchmarked. The “Total Waste Index” is rated as
tonnes of total waste per tonne of net production. 
The “Landﬁll Waste Index” is rated as tonnes of waste
to landﬁll per tonne of net production. Indices
calculated from the aggregated data for 2003 and

TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
2004 for Gates show a total waste reduction of 
11.14 per cent with a reduction in landﬁll waste of
9.33 per cent. Since land-ﬁlling is considered by many
countries to be the worst method of waste disposal,
the focus has been on reducing this, while at the same
time not losing sight of total waste reduction. The
target is to show continuous year-on-year reduction 
of waste. Once the Group has “waste” as a KPI
measurement worldwide, speciﬁc percentage
improvement targets may be set. Other companies
may choose to use a different measurement than
waste compared to net production volume; the
intention is to incorporate this new performance
indicator into the continuing effort for manufacturing
excellence by having the facility select a customised 
KPI measurement most appropriate to its operations.
Energy consumption data has also been aggregated
for many Tomkins afﬁliates, however no detailed
analysis is yet available.
2. SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT
The Board regularly takes account of the signiﬁcance
of social, environmental and ethical (‘SEE’) matters 
and how these impact the Group’s businesses and
value. The Board ensures that appropriate and effective
systems are in place to manage signiﬁcant risks. This
manifests itself in a number of ways. At the quarterly
business reviews conducted by senior management,
the signiﬁcant risks facing each business are considered
and strategies to mitigate these risks are discussed and
agreed. Periodically, the Board receives a summary of
the Group Risk Proﬁle that sets out the most important
risks facing the Group and its businesses, which may
have an impact on the short, medium and long-term
value of the Group. These risks cover a whole range of
issues including pricing pressures, growth, investment,
timing of acquisitions and disposals, currency exposures,
products, strategies for developing countries and any
failure adequately to identify and manage signiﬁcant
HSE issues. Each of the risks is assessed for its impact
on proﬁt and cash ﬂow, the likelihood of its occurrence,
and the scope for mitigation or reduction of the risk. The
risks are kept under review until they are either wholly
mitigated or no longer represent a signiﬁcant risk to the
Company and its short, medium and long-term value.
Other important areas where SEE issues are taken
into account include major capital expenditure proposals
considered by the Board, where operating businesses are
required to take account of, and report on, SEE matters
where there is any potential impact. The Business Risk
Assurance group has included in its overall business risk
assurance process, speciﬁc requirements to examine and
assess SEE matters in its list of responsibilities. The results
of the work of the Business Risk Assurance group are
reported quarterly to the Audit Committee, which, 
in turn, reports to the Board.
3. COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
CHARITABLE GIVING
The Board’s policy on charitable giving was reviewed
during the year and whilst no changes were made to
the underlying policies, donations of an exceptional
nature were included in the policy framework. Tomkins
has well-established guidelines that determine the
nature of organisations to which support is given.
Tomkins recognises its responsibilities to the wider
community in which its businesses operate to provide
balanced and targeted charitable assistance. The
charities given assistance cover a wide range of
activities including health and welfare, education, civic
and community projects, culture and the arts. Tomkins
prefers to spread its charitable giving over many
smaller local charities that usually do not have the
organisation, structure or resources to compete with
the marketing skills of the larger, high-proﬁle charitable
bodies. Each year donations are made to hundreds of
charities. Tomkins makes further donations through
advertising, sponsorship, products for prizes and
volunteers or other in-kind support.
In the UK, applications are normally made to
Tomkins’ corporate ofﬁce in London. Requests for
donations are made from a variety of charities and
Tomkins tries to respond positively to as many requests
as possible, provided they come from small local
charities and are registered with the Charity
Commission. The Company and its employees
continued with their support during the year for 
The Aplastic Anaemia Trust through donations and
participation in a London to Paris Triathlon. The Trust 
in turn supports a specialist unit at St George’s
Hospital, near to Tomkins’ corporate headquarters 
in south west London. Aplastic Anaemia is a rare but
devastating disease that causes the bone marrow 
to cease producing red blood cells. 
In the US most requests for support are made locally
and donations can be made in a number of ways. The
T omkins Foundation makes matching gifts, foundation
26 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
gifts and contributions to United Way, an external
charitable organisation that distributes funds to charities.
Tomkins’ US subsidiary companies also make donations
to United Way. In addition to their charitable giving
activities, the businesses also run a range of initiatives for
the beneﬁt of local communities. These include allowing
employees time off to participate in community activities
and other charitable support. Examples of the many
organisations to which help was provided during the
year include the American Heart Association, the
American Cancer Society and “March of Dimes” 
(an organisation that helps prevent birth defects and
infant mortality). Support was given to Drug Awareness
Resistance Education (“DARE”), a programme which
aims to keep children off drugs, and Relay for Life Walk
for cancer. Some US businesses use their industrial and
commercial expertise to support charities, and Habitat
for Humanity receives support from a number of
Tomkins’ companies. In response to Hurricane Katrina 
in August 2005, which had such a devastating effect 
on the southern United States and in particular New
Orleans, the Company made a donation of over
US$290,000 including matched donations made by
employees of US$40,000. The Group’s contribution 
was donated to the American Red Cross who were
closely associated with the relief efforts.
No donations were made to any organisation in
which any of the independent non-executive Directors
serves in an executive capacity. During the year, the
Board approved a donation of £100,000 to Seeability
(formerly known as the Royal School for the Blind), 
a charity whose purpose is to enable individuals who
are blind or partially sighted with additional disabilities
to achieve their full potential, to realise opportunities,
make choices and enhance their quality of life.
Seeability launched its “eye 2 eye” campaign during
the year which aims to raise £2 million to fund ten
community development ofﬁcers nationally to provide
support to individuals with sight loss and a learning
disability. David Newlands is non-executive Chairman
of the Trustees of Seeability and took no part in the
Board’s decision to make the one-off donation. Total
charitable donations during the year are shown in the
Directors’ Report.
COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE
In the US and many other countries in which Tomkins
operates, many employees serve their local community
through work on boards, committees and other bodies
covering a wide range of activities, giving their time
and expertise free to the local community – something
Tomkins encourages and supports. In the UK, the
Company’s employees have an annual vote to select 
a community project and in 2005 the choice was
property maintenance at a local school. There is
widespread Company and employee support in many
countries for giving blood and in the US this was done
in co-operation with local Red Cross organisations.
Many of the Group’s facilities hold “Open Days” 
where members of an employee’s family and the local
community are invited to visit the facility and gain a
greater understanding of what the plant produces 
and how it is produced.
EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE
Many of Tomkins’ businesses operate a range of
voluntary preventative healthcare programmes with 
the purpose of maintaining and supporting employee
health and welfare. The programmes are wide-ranging
and include health screening, weight loss, free
inﬂuenza immunisation, breast screening and other
forms of preventive healthcare. One company which
has facilities some distance from primary medical care
and consequently long emergency response times, has
purchased deﬁbrillators for those facilities.
At Schrader Electronics, Northern Ireland, focus 
is put on the total lifestyle of employees through
comprehensive health and lifestyle assessments
covering the measurement of cholesterol (HDL 
and LDL), glucose, height, weight, body fat, blood
pressure, carbon monoxide, suppleness and strength.
The assessments also cover exercise, smoking, diet,
alcohol, stress levels and other aspects of everyday
life. Lifestyle training was provided to shift workers
and was designed to address shift workers’ issues in
the areas of shift scheduling, sleep hygiene, circadian
physiology, substance abuse, nutrition, stress
management, family counselling and organisational
management. It also provided practical solutions 
for easing day-to-day difﬁculties associated with 
shift work lifestyles.
POLITICAL DONATIONS
It is Tomkins’ practice not to use shareholders’ funds
for the purpose of making political donations either 
in the form of cash donations or other in-kind beneﬁts
and consequently we have not sought shareholder
approval to make such donations.

Financial Review
OVERVIEW OF PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL
POSITION IN THE YEAR
REVENUE AND PROFIT FROM OPERATIONS
Sales increased by 7.0 per cent to £3,182.4 million
(2004: £2,974.1 million) and proﬁt from operations
before restructuring initiatives increased by 1.4 per cent
to £308.5 million (2004: £304.3 million). Proﬁt from
operations was also higher at £296.7 million (2004:
£286.3 million), an increase of 3.6 per cent. 
These results reﬂect good contributions from the
recent acquisitions, organic growth from new
products, increased operational efﬁciency, price
increases made to offset the higher cost of raw
materials and expansion in high growth markets.
Collectively, these positive factors allowed the Group 
to overcome the challenges faced throughout the year
from weak North American automotive production
volumes, particularly at General Motors and Ford, 
the delay in the implementation timetable of the
TREAD Act, and softness in the non-residential
construction market. 
The Group continues to undertake certain
restructuring initiatives aimed at improving the cost
base, and in 2005 the net cost of the restructuring
initiatives was £11.8 million (2004: £18.0 million).
This comprised restructuring costs of £20.3 million
(2004: £20.5 million) and a proﬁt on disposals and 
exit of businesses of £8.5 million (2004: £2.5 million).
The net impact from raw material and energy cost
increases was broadly neutral for the year as a whole.
MARGINS
The Group operating proﬁt margin before restructuring
initiatives was 9.7 per cent, compared to 10.2 per cent
in 2004. We maintained double-digit operating
margins in Industrial & Automotive of 11.1 per cent
(2004: 11.8 per cent) and in Air Systems Components
of 10.3 per cent (2004: 11.3 per cent). The operating
margin in Other Building Products was 7.2 per cent
(2004: 6.2 per cent).
INDUSTRIAL & AUTOMOTIVE
Sales in Industrial & Automotive increased by 5.3 per
cent to £2,298.6 million (2004: £2,182.3 million) and
proﬁt from operations (before restructuring initiatives)
was £255.2 million (2004: £257.6 million). The lower
automotive production volumes in the North American
automotive original equipment (“OE”) market
generally, and particularly at General Motors and 
Ford, had an impact on sales volumes and margins.
The group also had to contend with the delay in 
the TREAD Act that pushed back a signiﬁcant 
number of Remote Tyre Pressure Monitoring System
(“RTPMS”) orders until the second half of 2006, and

“Our results reﬂect good
contributions from the recent
acquisitions, organic growth from
new products and increased
operational efﬁciency”
  TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
in the third quarter of the year the two hurricanes in
the gulf coast region of the United States temporarily
disrupted the supply chain and caused a spike in raw
material prices. 
The Industrial & Automotive group completed two
acquisitions in 2005 (L.E. Technologies and EMB), with
the Mectrol business being acquired at the end 
of 2004. In total, the annualised revenue added by 
the businesses is around $160 million (c. £88 million).
The acquisitions have all been integrated effectively
into their respective businesses and are making
contributions ahead of our initial expectations. 
In 2006, we expect to realise further cost 
synergies and to expand the product offering 
into new markets.
In 2005, automotive OE represented 21.1 per cent
of our global sales (2004: 25.1 per cent) and North
American automotive OE represented 12.0 per cent 
of global sales (2004: 14.4 per cent).
POWER TRANSMISSION
There was good underlying growth in industrial
markets and automotive aftermarket, offsetting the
lower automotive OE volumes. The Mectrol industrial
belt business made a strong contribution during 2005
and is targeting a number of new applications for its
products in markets such as food processing and print
and paper processing.
Automotive original equipment sales were impacted
throughout 2005 by production cuts, especially at
General Motors and Ford. The business is taking action
to address this, and in the year won new business in
Asia of around $30.0 million (£16.5 million) with
Hyundai, Toyota and SAIC, and new business in 
Europe of around $22.0 million (£12.1 million) with
Renault/Nissan, PSA/Peugeot, VW and Fiat. The
business continued to expand in China, with sales
ahead by 17.2 per cent, and secured an award from
Chery Automotive for ‘Excellent T echnical Co-operation’.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
Automotive aftermarket sales were ahead by 
4.3 per cent, with particular strength in Europe where
sales were ahead by 13.2 per cent. The business in
Europe beneﬁtted from the launch of the new Micro-
V® XF belt and, in North America, Power Transmission
won a key contract to supply tensioners to CARQUEST.
The business continues to look at expansion
opportunities in high-growth markets such as Russia
and the Middle East, and during the year won a
“Supplier of the year award” in Russia from AD
International, a large Pan European organisation, 
for the quality of its order fulﬁlment. 
At Stackpole, the proﬁtability of the business
suffered from the lower automotive OE production
volumes. We took action during the year to contain
costs and implement proﬁt protection plans and, in
February 2006, announced the closure of the Pump
Components Division (“PCD”) facility. These actions 
are expected to improve the operational efﬁciency of
the business in 2006. An increase in volumes on new
platforms, as the OEMs move to six-speed transmission,
should also drive an improvement in performance. 
FLUID POWER 
The Fluid Power business performed strongly in 2005,
with sales ahead by 10.6 per cent. In North America, 
the business capitalised on the strength in industrial
production with the result that sales of both hydraulic
OE and industrial aftermarket products were signiﬁcantly
ahead. Sales of automotive aftermarket were also strong
in the fourth quarter of 2005. The balance of the sales
growth was provided by good contributions from
Europe and India, where a new facility was opened at
Faridabad. The EMB business that was acquired in July
2005 has been successfully integrated and made a good
contribution in the second half of the year. The
development of new products continued and the 
Quick-Lok™ family of products was introduced at the
start of the year. This product has been well received 
by customers, with several new contracts awarded for
2006 and 2007. The new Customer Solutions Centre 
in Denver was opened in the second quarter of 2005
and emphasises our focus on developing new product
technology in industrial applications.
WIPER SYSTEMS
2005 was a difﬁcult year for the Wiper Systems
business. Sales volumes were lower, impacted by the
challenging OE environment, the failure of MG Rover
in Europe and a strategic decision to exit some of the
less proﬁtable contracts with the OEMs. Proﬁtability
was impacted by the losses at the Wipers facility in
Pontypool, Wales, and the decision was announced 
in November 2005 to cease production at this facility. 
In contrast, the aftermarket side of the business
performed well, particularly in the second half

of 2005, and now represents 42.0 per cent of the
business (2004: 29.2 per cent). Aftermarket growth
was driven by strong demand for the Innovision™
beam blade that was launched at the end of 2004.
This product won a gold award at the APEX Global
Design Awards and production was more than
doubled during 2005. Extra capacity is being added 
in 2006 to meet demand and there will also be further
new product introductions in the aftermarket. In the
fourth quarter of 2005, production commenced at the
Wipers facility in Suzhou, China. This facility is a key 
part of Trico’s Asian strategy for both the aftermarket
and the OEM business, and has already won a number
of awards to supply this market, including a $1.1 million
(£0.6 million) contract with DaimlerChrysler.
FLUID SYSTEMS
The performance of the Fluid Systems business was in
line with 2004, but was impacted by the delay in the
TREAD Act and lower automotive OE volumes. At the
start of the year, Schrader Electronics had expected a
signiﬁcant ramp-up in volumes of RTPMS due to the
requirements of the TREAD Act. The ramp-up will now
start in the second half of 2006.The management at
Schrader Electronics took swift action during the year to
limit the impact on proﬁt from the reduced volumes and
was also successful in winning several new contracts for
its snap-in sensor technology to supply General Motors,
DaimlerChrysler, PSA/Peugeot, Subaru and Nissan.
The Stant operation showed good year-on-year
performance as sales of new valve products rose and 
a spike in demand for locking fuel caps occurred in 
the ﬁnal quarter of 2005. The balance of the Fluid
Systems business was held back by lower automotive
OE volumes.
Fluid Systems opened two new facilities in 2005.
Stant commenced production at a plant in Karvina,
Czech Republic and Schrader-Bridgeport completed 
the build of a 36,000 square feet valve-manufacturing
facility in Suzhou, China. There were signiﬁcant start-
up costs incurred during the year as production levels
picked up and extra capacity was added to the plants. 
OTHER INDUSTRIAL & AUTOMOTIVE 
Sales and proﬁt from operations in 2005 were
signiﬁcantly ahead. Dexter recovered from lower
volumes in the ﬁrst quarter of the year to deliver a
strong performance assisted by Federal Emergency
Management Agency (“FEMA”) sales in the ﬁnal
quarter of the year. The acquisition of the L.E.
Technologies business in March 2005 added to the
product offering, and this business is already making 
a signiﬁcant contribution ahead of our expectations. 
The Dearborn Mid-West business performed well
and has a strong order backlog for 2006.
Ideal and Plews were both impacted by higher raw
material costs for brass and PVC that have been
difﬁcult to pass on to customers. The Ideal business
opened its Suzhou plant in China in the third quarter
of 2005.
BUILDING PRODUCTS
During 2005, sales in Building Products increased by
11.6 per cent to £883.8 million (2004: £791.8 million)
and proﬁt from operations (before restructuring
initiatives) was ahead by 11.8 per cent at £78.6 million
(2004: £70.3 million). This was achieved through good
contributions from the acquisitions, price increases
made to offset higher material costs, successful new
product introductions, and the continued strength 
in the residential housing market. The operating
margin in the Building Products group remained 
at 8.9 per cent.
AIR SYSTEMS COMPONENTS
Sales were up by 14.8 per cent on 2004. The Hart 
& Cooley business capitalised on the continued
strength in the United States residential housing
market and, in January 2005, acquired Milcor. This
business has now been fully integrated and made 
a strong contribution to sales and proﬁt, and has
presented opportunities for cross-selling of products
with Hart & Cooley and of sourcing low-cost materials
from its China manufacturing operation. 
Despite the slow non-residential market, the order
intake level remained healthy and beneﬁtted from both
new product introductions and new customer wins. 
In the third quarter, Ruskin successfully completed the
acquisition of NRG Industries Inc. and is making good
progress in integrating this business and developing
growth opportunities.
There were a number of plant rationalisations
during the year, with the closure of the Tabor City and
Englewood facilities and the transfer of production 
to other facilities in the business. Ruskin commenced
production at its new facility in Monterrey, Mexico.

TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
Operating margins in 2005 were impacted by costs
associated with the plant rationalisations, although 
the reduced cost base should see improved margin
performance in 2006. 
OTHER BUILDING PRODUCTS
A strong performance in the second half of 2005
resulted in full-year sales ahead by 8.0 per cent
compared to 2004. Lasco Bathware achieved strong
sales growth and double-digit operating margins
before restructuring initiatives, driven by the record
level of housing starts in the United States residential
market and the successful launch of several new
products, such as the ‘Contours
™’ range of luxury
whirlpools and showers.
Lasco Fittings achieved year-on-year improvements
in sales and proﬁt, with higher volumes from new
product introductions and market share gains. New
product sales accounted for over 30 per cent of the
growth in sales in 2005. The business experienced
signiﬁcant pricing pressure in 2005 from the increased
cost of PVC, but was able to implement a series 
of price increases.
The Philips doors and windows business had a
good fourth quarter and full-year sales were ahead
compared to 2004. The operating margin in the
business was impacted by a bad-debt write-off of 
$1.9 million in the ﬁrst quarter of the year.
EVENTS IMPACTING OUR FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE AND POSITION
RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES
Net restructuring initiatives were at £11.8 million
(2004: £18.0 million). Restructuring costs were
£20.3 million (2004: £20.5 million) and primarily
related to the transfer of the manufacturing capability
from the Wiper Systems facility in Pontypool to more
cost competitive locations and the rationalisation 
of production facilities at Air Systems Components.
The disposals and exit of businesses in 2005
resulted in a proﬁt of £8.5 million (2004: £2.5 million).
Of this, £9.0 million related to a proﬁt on the disposal
of the Gutter Helmet business, and the balance arose
from the disposal of businesses and properties as part
of the restructuring initiatives.

prospectively from 2 January 2005. As a result, proﬁt
before tax for the year ended 31 December 2005
shown on the face of the income statement is not
directly comparable to proﬁt before tax year ended 
1 January 2005. In 2005, the preference dividend 
is disclosed within interest payable, while in 2004,
it is shown below proﬁt for the period. In addition, 
fair value gains on derivative instruments are 
included as Other Finance Income in 2005, while
this adjustment was not recognised in 2004.
The table above sets out the effect of the
adjustments in 2005 and shows the movement 
on Proﬁt before tax on a comparable basis.
INTEREST PAYABLE, INVESTMENT INCOME AND 
FINANCE INCOME
Interest payable for 2005 was £83.5 million (2004:
£64.8 million). This includes the interest cost of 
£40.5 million (2004: £43.3 million) related to our
liability for post employment beneﬁts and £16.3 million
(2004: nil) of dividends payable on the convertible
cumulative preference shares, reﬂecting the
reclassiﬁcation of preference dividends to interest
payable. Bank and other interest payable was 
£26.7 million (2004: £21.5 million).
Investment income was £40.3 million (2004: 
£38.8 million), which included the expected return 
on post employment beneﬁts plan assets of £34.6
million (2004: £32.4 million). Bank and other interest
receivable was £5.7 million (2004: £6.4 million).
Fair valuation gains arising on derivative hedging
instruments of £4.2 million have been recognised
under Other Finance Income following the adoption 
of IAS 32 and IAS 39 prospectively from 2 January 2005.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share from total operations were
24.92 pence (2004: 23.93 pence), an increase of 
4.1 per cent. Fully diluted earnings per share from 
total operations were 23.79 pence (2004: 22.81 pence).
DIVIDENDS 
The dividends to our preference shareholders are dollar
denominated and, in 2005, the sterling equivalent was
£16.3 million (2004: £15.6 million). 
The dividends to holders of ordinary shares for
2005 were 13.23 pence (2004: 12.60 pence), an
increase of 5.0 per cent. The dividend earnings cover
was 1.9 times and cash cover was 1.0 times. Cash
cover is based on cash ﬂow after interest, tax and
preference dividends (free cash ﬂow to equity)
compared to ordinary dividends paid. 
The Group continues to emphasise the importance of
cash ﬂow generation in our businesses, which supports
its progressive dividend policy.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Net capital expenditure in 2005 was £119.5 million
(2004: £152.2 million). Gross capital was 
£143.3 million (2004: £157.7 million), representing
1.2 times depreciation (2004: 1.4 times). Proceeds 
from asset disposals amounted to £23.8 million 
(2004: £5.5 million). In 2006, net capital expenditure 
is expected to be around £150 million.
WORKING CAPITAL
Working capital, net of provisions, was £513.8 million
(2004: £429.8 million). The average working capital 
as a percentage of moving annual total sales for the
year was 14.0 per cent compared to 12.9 per cent in
2004. The increase in working capital during the year
was due in part to the change in the US dollar/Sterling
exchange rate at the respective balance sheet dates,
and the impact of the acquisitions and disposals. 
Of the balance of the movement, this was primarily 
due to higher inventory levels in the Fluid Power
business in order to respond to service level
requirements of customers.
CASH FLOW 
In 2005, operating cash ﬂow was ahead of 2004 by
19.4 per cent. The cash effect of increased proﬁt from
operations was offset by the effect of an increase 
of £20.5 million in pension contributions, however,
capital expenditure reduced by £32.7 million. Net
expenditure on acquisitions and disposals in the 
period was £74.0 million. Net debt also increased 
due to the impact of the strengthening of the US
dollar and the fair value adjustment to the Group’s
outstanding bonds. Overall, net debt, excluding the
reclassiﬁcation of preference shares, amounted to
£334.5 million. 
The table overleaf shows the net debt movement 
for the year.
For a reconciliation of the net debt movement to
the consolidated cash ﬂow statement please see the
Supplemental Cash Flow Analysis on page 123.
Cash generation is calculated on net cash inﬂow
from operating activities less net cash outﬂow from
capital expenditure, before gains on disposal and exit
of businesses. Cash conversion is cash generation to
proﬁt from operations, before gains on disposals and
exit of businesses. Cash conversion increased to 75.3
per cent (2004: 64.0 per cent).

FUNDING AND DISTRIBUTION POLICY
Funding for sustaining investment and investment for
organic growth is met initially from internally generated
cash ﬂow (cash ﬂow after interest, tax and preference
dividends). The net cash ﬂow available for equity
holders after organic investment, together with debt
ﬁnance available within the debt capacity of the Group,
will determine the funding available for acquisitions and
distributions. The debt capacity of the Group is
determined by our objective to maintain a stable 
capital structure and the Group’s investment grade 
debt rating.
We aim to grow the dividend steadily and
progressively in line with the overall long-term cash
generation of the Group. When the Group generates
surplus cash and existing investment needs are met,
then the economics of share repurchases or special
dividends to shareholders will be examined.
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
ACCOUNTING METRICS
We assess the accounting return on capital invested 
in our businesses in two ways.
Return on net operating assets is a pre-tax measure 
of the return on the book value of capital employed

ﬁnancial productivity of the cash invested in the
operating assets of the business.
Return on invested capital is an after-tax measure 
of the return on the invested capital employed in the
business, taking into account the goodwill associated
with the acquisition of the business, and represents a
measure of the ﬁnancial return on the total ﬁnancial
investment in the business. 
The charts below set out the return on average
invested capital and the return on average net
operating assets for each business and the Group.
CASH FLOW METRICS
We assess the cash ﬂow performance of each of our
businesses based on the percentage of proﬁt from
operations (before gains/losses on disposal and exit 
of businesses) converted to operating cash ﬂow (cash
conversion). The cash conversion for each of the business
groups and for the Group as a whole is shown below.
ECONOMIC METRICS
To track the economic performance of the Group 
we look at cash added value and economic return.
Cash added value is an absolute measure of value
created based on after-tax EBITDA less sustaining

investment and a charge for cost of capital. The 
charge for cost of capital is based on the weighted
average cost of capital applied to the average book
value of investment in the business including goodwill
associated with acquisitions.
The economic return is based on cash added value
expressed as a percentage of the average book value
of investment.
The trends of cash added value and economic
return are used to assess the allocation of capital 
over the long-term.
WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL
The weighted average cost of capital is the weighted
average by value of the after-tax costs of each of the
elements of the Group’s capital structure.
The cost of equity is calculated using the capital
asset pricing model, with the risk-free rate based on 
a ten-year sterling government bond rate, an equity
beta of one and an equity market risk premium of 
4 per cent. The value of equity is the current market
value of the ordinary shares of Tomkins.
The cost of debt comprises both the cost of the
perpetual preference shares and the cost of the
Group’s net debt after tax at a normalised tax 
rate of 30 per cent. The value of net debt used is 
the actual current sterling value of the Group’s net 
debt. The value of the preference shares is the 
current sterling equivalent nominal value of the
preference shares. 
A graph showing the weighted average cost of
capital during the year is shown below.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Applied research and development is important to the
Group’s manufacturing businesses. The Group maintains
development centres in Japan, Europe and the United
States. Businesses within the Group are encouraged to
review their products regularly and to develop them in
accordance with perceived market trends. The Group’s
measured expenditure on research and development
was £47.1 million in 2005 (2004: £51.3 million) of
which £0.4 million was capitalised (2004: £nil). 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our medium-term aim is to maintain an appropriate
mix of equity and debt to ensure an efﬁcient capital
structure consistent with our desired investment grade
ﬁnancial proﬁle. Our debt capacity is assessed within
this aim. Our long-term debt ﬁnance requirements are
also deﬁned within these parameters and with an
understanding of our future ﬁnancial needs for
investment dividends and acquisitions.
TREASURY MANAGEMENT
TREASURY RESPONSIBILITIES AND PHILOSOPHY
The primary responsibilities of the central treasury
function are to procure the Group’s capital resources,
maintain an efﬁcient capital structure, and
management of the Group’s liquidity, foreign
exchange, interest rate, insurance and pensions 
risks on a Group-wide basis.
The central treasury function operates within 
strict policies and guidelines approved by the Board.
Compliance with these policies and guidelines 
is monitored through the regular reporting of 
treasury activities.
A key element of our treasury philosophy is that
funding, interest rate and currency risk decisions and
the location of cash and debt balances are determined
independently from each other. For example, the
Group’s debt requirements are met by raising funds 
in the most favourable markets, with the desired
currency proﬁle of net debt being achieved by entering
into foreign exchange contracts where necessary.
Similarly, the desired interest rate maturity of net 
debt is achieved by taking account of all debt and 
cash balances together with any foreign exchange
transactions used to manage the currency proﬁle 
of net debt. We operate systems to ensure that all
relevant assets and liabilities are taken into account 
on a Group-wide basis when making these decisions.
This portfolio approach to ﬁnancial risk management
enables our activities in these areas to be carried 
out effectively and efﬁciently and with a high degree 
of visibility. 
DETAILS OF CORPORATE BONDS AND EMTN PROGRAMME
We have a Euro Medium Term Note (“EMTN”)
Programme under which Tomkins may issue bonds up
to a total maximum principal amount of £750 million.
Our initial bond under the programme in December
2001 was for £150 million with a ten-year maturity
and was issued at a coupon of 8 per cent.
In September 2003, we issued a further 
£250 million bond with a twelve-year maturity at a

are detailed in note 14 to the Financial Statements. 
As the majority of the Group’s debt is denominated 
in US dollars, reported net debt also increased by
£28.1 million as a result of the strengthening of 
the US dollar during the period.
We operate in a wide range of markets and
geographic locations and as a result the seasonality 
of our borrowing requirements is low. Underlying
cyclicality before capital expenditure is driven 
principally by the timing of our ordinary and
convertible cumulative preference dividends 
and interest payments.
FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS
AND AUTHORISATIONS
At 31 December 2005, we had surplus cash balances 
in excess of the operational needs of our businesses.
Accordingly, our present policy is to fund new
investments, ﬁrstly from existing cash resources 
and then from borrowings sourced centrally by
Tomkins Finance plc. It is our intention to maintain
surplus un-drawn borrowing facilities sufﬁcient 
to enable our credit ratings to be maintained 
and to enable us to manage the Group’s liquidity
through the operating and investment cycle.
We maintain a regular dialogue with the rating
agencies, and the potential impact on our credit 
rating is taken into consideration when making
capital allocation decisions.
CURRENT VERSUS PROSPECTIVE LIQUIDITY
At 31 December 2005, our committed 2010 
£400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility 
was drawn by £119.9 million. We had a further 
£244.4 million of other, mainly uncommitted,
credit facilities and ﬁnance leases, of which 
£37.2 million was drawn for cash and £75.9 million
was utilised through the issuance of bank guarantees
and standby letters of credit. Total headroom under 
the facilities was £545.1 million in addition to cash
balances of £236.2 million. If all of our uncommitted
credit facilities were to have become unavailable, 
our total committed borrowing headroom would 
have been £311.0 million, in addition to our cash
balances. It is our policy to retain sufﬁcient liquidity
throughout the capital expenditure cycle to maintain
our ﬁnancial ﬂexibility and to preserve our investment
grade credit rating.
coupon of 6.125 per cent. The proceeds of this bond
issue were used to ﬁnance the early redemption of the
convertible cumulative preference shares, which 
took place in August 2003. 
CREDIT RATING
In December 2001, we established long-term credit
ratings with Moody’s and Standard & Poor. Our ratings
have remained unchanged since this date at Baa2 
and BBB respectively. They cover our EMTN Programme
and £250 million bond issued by Tomkins Finance plc,
a directly owned subsidiary of Tomkins plc that carries
out all of the Group’s central treasury activities,
together with our £150 million bond issued by 
Tomkins plc. We also have a short-term rating of 
P-2 with Moody’s. Our aim is to manage the 
Group’s capital structure to preserve these ratings. 
MATURITY PROFILE OF BORROWINGS AND 
BORROWING FACILITIES
The chart below shows the maturity proﬁle of our
borrowing facilities.
Our committed bank borrowing facilities mainly
comprise a multi-currency revolving credit facility 
of £400 million, the maturity of which was extended 
in August 2005, from February 2009 to August 2010.
Borrowing facilities are monitored against forecast
requirements and timely action is taken to put in 
place, renew or replace credit lines. Our policy is 
to reduce ﬁnancing risk by diversifying our funding
sources and by staggering the maturity of 
our borrowings. 
LEVELS OF BORROWINGS AND SEASONALITY
During 2005, our gross and net borrowings 
(excluding the impact of IFRS adjustments and
convertible cumulative preference shares) increased
marginally, with gross debt of £592.9 million and net
debt of £334.5 million on 31 December 2005 (2004:
£434.8 million and £244.5 million respectively). The
higher level of gross debt relative to net debt at the
end of the year arose principally as a result of the
payment of dividends from various subsidiaries to
Group companies located in the United States, 
under the Internal Revenue Code Section 965. 
The peak level of net debt during the year was 
£385.5 million. Expenditure on acquisitions of 
£101.3 million less disposal receipts of £29.3 million
contributed to an overall increase in net debt of

MAXIMISING RETURNS ON CASH BALANCES
Our central treasury function is responsible for
maximising the return on surplus cash balances 
within liquidity and counterparty credit constraints
imposed by our Board-approved liquid funds policy.
This is done, where practical, by controlling directly 
all surplus cash balances and pooling arrangements 
on an ongoing basis and by reviewing the efﬁciency 
of all other cash balances across the Group on a
weekly basis. At 31 December 2005, £164.6 million 
of cash was under the direct control of Group treasury.
Our weighted average cost of debt at 31 December
2005 was 6.5 per cent (2004: 6.5 per cent). 
The net interest charge for the year to 31 December
2005 of £39.0 million was £23.9 million higher than
the charge for the previous year reported under UK
GAAP . This increase was principally due to IFRS
adjustments, including the reclassiﬁcation of dividends
payable on convertible cumulative preference shares 
to interest expense (£16.3 million), post employment
beneﬁts expense (net of the interest cost on beneﬁt
obligations and the expected return on plan assets)
(£5.9 million) and fair value gains relating to derivative
ﬁnancial instruments (£4.2 million). The remaining
increase in the interest charge of £5.9 million
comprises mainly an increase in average interest rates
over the year (£2.6 million) and higher average net
debt balances (£3.3 million).
At 31 December 2005, our total cash and
investments were £236.2 million. Of this amount,
£140.8 million was invested in short-term deposits 
by our treasury department, £7.5 million of cash 
was held in our captive insurance company, Tomkins
Insurance Limited, £33.2 million of cash was held in
our Asian Unitta companies and £54.3 million of cash
was held in centrally controlled pooling arrangements
and with local operating companies. £213.8 million 
of our cash was interest earning. Our policy is to 
apply funds from one part of the Group to meet 
the obligations of another part wherever possible, 
to ensure maximum efﬁciency of the Group’s funds. 
No material restrictions apply that limit the application
of this policy. It is anticipated that surplus cash in
excess of that required for operating purposes held in
operating companies will be repatriated or reinvested
in new investments during 2006. 
CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT
We do not anticipate any material long-term
deterioration in our overall liquidity position in 
the foreseeable future. 
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FINANCIAL
COMMITMENTS
At 31 December 2005, we had £75.9 million of bank
and insurance company issued bonds, guarantees and
standby letters of credit in issue. These were issued
primarily in favour of insurance companies to cover
potential workers’ compensation claims in the United
States in the course of normal business, in addition 
to other contractual counterparties for operational
purposes. Our annual operating lease rentals were
£20.7 million in 2005 (2004: £21.5 million).
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION EXPOSURES
The foreign currency transaction exposures in the
business are protected with forward currency
purchases and sales. These are put in place when
foreign currency trading transactions are committed 
or when there is a high likelihood of such transactions
arising. All foreign exchange contracts are carried out
by our central treasury function, except in cases where
this is prohibited by local regulations. In these cases,
local transactions are reported to central treasury on 
a systematic basis. 
Our principal net currency transaction exposures
arising during the year ended 31 December 2005 
were US dollar to sterling (£31.9 million), US dollar 
to Mexican peso (£30.0 million), and sterling to euro
(£50.9 million). The impact of the movement in
average exchange rates between 2004 and 2005 
on the Group’ s transaction exposures was £0.4 million
negative. Under the Group’s foreign exchange
transaction exposure policy, certain exposures 
are hedged. Compared to the average actual rates 
for the year, the effect of these hedging activities 
was a gain of £2.9 million.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EXPOSURES
The majority of the Group’s activities are transacted in
US dollars but the reporting currency of the Group is
sterling. This gives rise to potential currency translation
exposures in the balance sheet, income statement and
cash ﬂow. The Group’s net borrowings are generally
retained in proportion to the currencies in which the
Group’s assets are denominated, to hedge the foreign
currency translation exposure arising from the Group’s
overseas investments. The proportion of overseas

investments effectively funded by shareholders’ equity
is not hedged. The table below shows the net debt
proﬁle by currency.
We do not hedge foreign currency proﬁt and loss
translation exposures and the reported results may 
be affected by the translation effect of currency
ﬂuctuations. We estimate a movement of 
10 per cent in the US dollar/sterling exchange rate has
an impact on reported proﬁt from operations of
around 7 to 8 per cent. The impact on reported
earnings per share is partly offset to the extent that
interest arises on foreign currency net borrowings.
Interest payments on foreign currency net
borrowings are funded with cash ﬂows generated 
by the corresponding foreign currency investments. 
The main potential impact of movement in the 
US dollar/sterling exchange rate movement is the 
effect on dividends. Much of the Group’s cash ﬂow 
is generated in US dollars from the cash ﬂows
generated by overseas investments, but dividends on
ordinary shares are paid in sterling by converting the
foreign currency cash ﬂows at the time of payment 
of the dividend.
Information on our use of derivatives and 
ﬁnancial instruments is given in note 28 to the
ﬁnancial statements.
INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT
Our central treasury function manages the interest rate
proﬁle within the policy established by the Board. 
This is achieved by considering the portfolio of all 
of our interest bearing assets and liabilities across 
the Group. Our net desired interest rate proﬁle in 
each currency is then managed by entering into
interest rate swaps, options and forward rate
agreements. At 31 December 2005, the interest rate
maturity proﬁle of our Canadian dollar, euro and
sterling net debt was less than three months.
The graph below shows our US dollar interest rate
maturity proﬁle as at 31 December 2005.
BORROWING COVENANTS
We are subject to covenants, representations and
warranties commonly associated with investment
grade borrowings on our committed 2010 
£400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility, 
our £150 million 2011 bond and our £250 million
2015 bond. 
We are subject to two ﬁnancial covenants under
our committed 2010 £400 million multi-currency
revolving credit facility. The ratio of net debt to
consolidated EBITDA must not exceed 2.5 times 
and the ratio of consolidated proﬁt from operations 
to consolidated net interest charge must not be less
than 3.0 times. Throughout 2005, we have been
comfortably within these limits. These ﬁnancial
covenants are calculated by applying UK GAAP frozen
as at 31 December 2002 and are therefore unaffected
by accounting changes associated with the transition
to International Financial Reporting Standards.
PENSIONS 
RISK MANAGEMENT
Management of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension
risks is the responsibility of our Group treasury function.
We are seeking to improve the management of our
deﬁned beneﬁt pension risks, and a number of
changes consistent with this objective have taken 
place during 2005.
A primary objective is to identify and manage the
risk of both the assets and liabilities of the deﬁned
beneﬁt pensions plans. Each of our deﬁned beneﬁt
pensions plans is therefore under review, with a view 
to identifying potential risk and cost reduction
measures. As these reviews are completed they 
will be discussed with the respective trustee boards
and agreement sought to maintain appropriate risk
management and cost control measures.
On 1 December 2005, the Tomkins North American
Retirement Board redenominated existing ﬁxed income
assets in our US deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans
amounting to £88.4 million and entered into £179.3
million of US dollar denominated interest rate swaps
with a combined average duration of 11.5 years. 
This has resulted in a hedge of the interest rate risk
inherent in the Accrued Beneﬁt Obligation (“ABO”) of

the plans, whereby future changes in the ABO value
arising from changes in the interest rate will be
matched by equal and opposite movements in the
value of the assets, thus protecting the deﬁcit from
future interest rate changes. Reporting procedures have
been established to measure the effectiveness of this
hedging arrangement. We are currently evaluating the
merits of hedging the interest rate and other risks of
the UK and Canadian deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans.
As at 31 December 2005, the value of the Group’s
deﬁned beneﬁt pension liabilities was £708.8 million
(2004: £605.4 million). The graph above shows the
attribution of the increase in the liabilities during the
year of £103.4 million.
FUNDING POLICY
The Group remains committed to funding pensions
responsibly. In the UK, this means satisfying the
funding agreements made with the trustees of the
schemes in order to eliminate deﬁcits over a reasonable
period of time. In the United States, funding objectives
generally seek to avoid Pension Beneﬁt Guaranty
Corporation (“PBGC”) variable rate premiums and
accelerated funding charges mandated by the
Employee Retirement Income Act of 1974 (ERISA), 
and remain above the ERISA required minimum
funding levels. Accordingly, most of the United States
plans are funded on the basis of reaching or exceeding
a 90 per cent funded level on a current liability basis.
Tomkins recognises its responsibility to fund deﬁned
beneﬁt pension plans deﬁcits and views these deﬁcits
as being debt-like in nature. Accordingly, where
beneﬁcial, Tomkins plc intends to issue guarantees in
respect of certain of the UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension
plan deﬁcits in order to improve the credit standing 
of these plans. This will also have the effect of
minimising the cost of the Pension Protection Fund’s
risk-based levy.
Cash contributions to the deﬁned beneﬁt pension
plans in 2005 were £44.5 million (2004: £24.0 million)
and £3.9 million was charged to the income statement
(2004: £8.3 million). The market value of the related
assets was £527.1 million (2004: £441.7 million),
resulting in net deﬁned beneﬁt pension liabilities
before the effect of the asset ceiling and before tax 
of £181.7 million (2004: £163.7 million). The graph
below shows the attribution of the increase in the
market value of assets during the year of £85.4 million.
ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS
Actuarial assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis
and updated where appropriate. Since 2004, mortality
assumptions have been reviewed and updated where
recommended by our actuaries. Tomkins believes that
all deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans reﬂect appropriate
mortality assumptions.
Of our total deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan liabilities
of £708.8 million, £305.4 million relates to beneﬁts that
are deferred or currently being drawn, £235.1 million
relates to plans frozen to further service accrual, and 
a further £34.6 million relates to plans with beneﬁts
based on length of service rather than changes in salary
scale. Therefore, £575.1 million of liabilities are not
sensitive to changes in salary scale. All deﬁned beneﬁt
pension plans are closed to new entrants and therefore
the impact of changes in salary scale is limited. 
£133.7 million, or 18.9%, of the total deﬁned beneﬁt
pension plans liabilities are sensitive to salary scale. 
The table on the following page shows the estimated
sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans liabilities

The impact of changes in the discount rate and

INVESTMENT POLICY
Investment of assets within the deﬁned beneﬁt
pensions plans is the responsibility of independent
trustee boards over which Tomkins has varying degrees
of inﬂuence based on national regulations. In order 
to clarify its preferences regarding the investment of
assets by the trustee boards, Tomkins plc has set out 
a statement of its investment preferences. This has
been communicated to the North American Retirement
Board, which oversees our largest deﬁned beneﬁt
pension plans, and will be communicated progressively
to each of the other trustee boards with responsibility
for deﬁned beneﬁt pensions plans as these plans are
reviewed during 2006. The statement of investment
preferences is based on an underlying philosophy that
assets should ﬁrst be used to hedge risks implicit in 
the associated pensions liabilities and to the extent 
that assets are not invested for this purpose, it is the
preference of Tomkins plc that the assets are invested
in investment grade bonds and/or a broad based local
equity index. 
The performance of assets and liabilities in deﬁned
beneﬁt pensions plans is measured and reported to
Tomkins’ Board and used as the basis for dialogue
between Tomkins and trustee boards.
TAXATION 
The overall objective of the Group tax function is 
to plan and manage the tax affairs of the Group
efﬁciently within the various local tax jurisdictions 
of the world, so as to achieve the lowest tax cash cost
consistent with compliance with the local tax regulations.
The total tax charge for the year relating to
continuing activities was £59.0 million (2004: 
£51.1 million). This represents an effective tax rate 
of 22.9 per cent (2004: 19.6 per cent) on proﬁt before
tax of £257.7 million (£260.3 million). In 2005, proﬁt
before tax is stated net of preference dividends of
£16.3 million following the prospective adoption 
of IAS 39 whereas, in 2004, preference dividends are
treated as a distribution. In 2005, the proﬁt before tax
and before preference dividends was £274.0 million 
(2004: £260.3 million). The effective rate of tax in
2005 on proﬁts before tax and before preference
dividends was 21.5 per cent (2004: 19.6 per cent).
During 2005, there was a release of provisions for
uncertain tax positions of £58.7 million. This followed
the successful resolution of outstanding tax issues in
the United States, the expiry of time during which tax
audits could be performed in certain tax jurisdictions,
and the change of views on the likely outcome of
challenges by various tax authorities. In addition during
the year, there were other tax charges amounting 
to £30.1 million included in arriving at the overall 
tax charge for the group. Prior to these adjustments,
the total tax charge for 2005 would have been 
£87.6 million, representing an effective rate of 
32.0 per cent applied to proﬁt before tax and before
preference dividends and 34 per cent applied to 
proﬁt before tax. The tax rate for 2006 is expected 
to be around 30 per cent.
Generally the charge for taxation is affected by 
the varying tax rates in different jurisdictions applied 
to taxable proﬁts and the mix of those proﬁts, by the
rules impacting deductibility of certain costs, such 
as ﬁnance costs, and by the rules relating to double
taxation relief.
We have been successful in minimising the cash tax
cost of the Group, however, as countries around the
world increase their focus on taxation as a means of
raising revenue for their local economies, the tax cash
cost of multinational corporations is likely to increase
over time. We will continue to plan the Group’s tax
affairs efﬁciently to minimise the tax cash cost but 
a gradual increase is likely. 
We manage the Group’s tax affairs and provisions
for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the
Group’s best estimate of the likely outcome of a
challenge by the authorities.
RISK FACTORS
This document contains certain forward-looking
statements, which involve risk and uncertainty as they
relate to future events and circumstances. Our business
is affected by a number of factors, not all of which are
in Tomkins’ control. This section highlights speciﬁc
areas where Tomkins is particularly sensitive to business
risk. Our ﬁnancial condition or results of operations
could be materially adversely affected by any of these
risks. Additional risks not currently known to us, or
risks that we currently regard as immaterial, could 
also have a material adverse effect on our ﬁnancial
condition or the results of operations.
As a part of the Performance Management
Framework of the Group, each business considers
strategic, operational, commercial and ﬁnancial risks
and identiﬁes risk mitigation actions. The Group has
categorised the foregoing risks as those relating to:
• The markets within which the Group operates;
• The competitive position of the Group and its
businesses; and
• The ﬁnancial position of the Group.
Risk can be considered either as downside risk, the
risk that something can go wrong and result in a
ﬁnancial loss or ﬁnancial exposure for the Group, or
volatility risk. Volatility risk is the risk associated with

uncertainty, which means there may be an opportunity
for ﬁnancial gain as well as potential for loss.
RISKS RELATING TO THE MARKETS WITHIN WHICH THE
GROUP OPERATES
There are a number of risks in the markets in which we
operate that could have a material adverse effect on our
business, ﬁnancial condition, or results of operations.
Cyclical nature of the markets – Approximately 
70 per cent of our sales are to markets where the
demand is ultimately affected by consumer spending
and consumer preferences. 
Improvement in vehicle component life – The
greater quality, performance and reliability of the
components we manufacture improves service life 
and could affect demand in the aftermarket 
business segment. 
Regulatory environment – In the industries in 
which we operate we are subject to a variety 
of environmental regulations, particularly relating 
to waste water discharges, air emissions, solid waste
management, and hazardous chemical disposal. 
Operations in foreign and emerging markets –
We operate principally in the automotive, industrial,
and construction-related markets in a number of
geographic regions of the world, including emerging
markets. Operations in emerging markets may present
additional risks. 
Customer demand – Our Industrial & Automotive
business segment is directly impacted by global
automotive production. The automotive industry 
is characterised by overcapacity and ﬁerce competition. 
In North America, it is also affected by signiﬁcant
pension and healthcare liabilities. North American
automotive OEMs have recently announced production
cuts for a number of platforms.
RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF THE
GROUP AND ITS BUSINESSES
There are a number of risks to our competitive position
that could have a material adverse effect on our
business, ﬁnancial condition, or results of operations.
Industry consolidation may result in more
powerful competitors and fewer customers –
Some of our customers and some of our competitors
in a number of our markets especially in the
automotive aftermarket, and to a lesser extent in the
markets of the Air Systems Components business unit,
are consolidating to achieve greater scale or market
share. Such changes could affect our customers and
their relationship with us. As our customers become
larger and more concentrated, they could exert pricing
pressure on all suppliers, including ourselves.
Revenues are generated from ten major customers
in the Industrial & Automotive business –
24.4 per cent of our total revenues come 
from the top ten customers of our Industrial 
& Automotive business. 
Price reductions by automotive customers –
21.1 per cent of our sales are to automotive OEMs. 
It is normal practice for such customers to seek
reductions in their costs from their suppliers over the
duration of any committed supply arrangement. 
To meet any such requests for price reductions 
whilst maintaining our proﬁt margins, 
we have to achieve corresponding cost savings in our
business, by strategic sourcing of raw materials and by
improving production and manufacturing efﬁciencies.
Increased competition from low cost producers –
Manufacturers in the developed economies of the
world are increasingly facing competition from low-
cost sources in the developing economies of the world.
Increasing raw material and energy costs – Steel,
aluminium, oil-based resins and energy are a signiﬁcant
part of our cost structure, and increases in these costs
may impact competitiveness.
Reliance on certain raw materials and suppliers 
of key components – Our productive processes do
require certain raw materials and components, and
arrangements are in place to ensure continuity of
supply. Failure to obtain adequate and timely supplies
may impact our ability to service our customers.
Dependence on our strong relationships with
manufacturers’ representatives, distributors and
wholesalers – Deterioration in the relationships with
manufacturers’ representatives, distributors and
wholesalers or a change in our products’ route to
market could affect sales.
Product liability claims due to the nature of our
products – We face an inherent business risk of
exposure to product liability claims in the event that a
failure of a product results in, or is alleged to result in,
bodily injury, property damage, or consequential loss. 
Technological changes – The markets for our
products and services are characterised by evolving
industry standards and changing technology that may
lead to commoditisation of our products. Continual
development of advanced technologies for new
products and product enhancements is an important
way in which we maintain acceptable pricing levels. 
Dependence on the continued operation of our
manufacturing facilities – Our manufacturing
facilities are located principally in the United States 
and Europe. A major disruption of our critical
manufacturing facilities could result in signiﬁcant
interruption of our business and potential loss of
customers and sales.

hardware, software and telecommunications
infrastructure – We currently secure our networks 
by means of back-up, hardware, virus protection and
other measures, but any systems interruption could
lead to a reduction in performance or loss of services.
A breach of network security could result in reduced
revenues and could have an adverse effect on our
businesses, ﬁnancial condition or results from
operations. Our systems are vulnerable to damage 
or interruption caused by human error, network 
failure, natural disasters, sabotage, computer 
viruses and similar disruptive events. 
Intellectual property rights – Our proprietary
technology is protected by patents and trade 
secrets which could be at risk if:
• Competitors are able to develop similar technology
independently;
• Our patent applications are not approved;
• Steps taken to prevent misappropriation or
infringement of our intellectual property are 
not successful; or
• We do not adequately protect our intellectual
property.
Trade unions or other employment 
organisations – Some of our employees are members
of trade unions, and over many years we have been
able to maintain successful relationships with the
unions and employment organisations. 
FINANCIAL RISKS
There are certain ﬁnancial risks that could have 
a material adverse effect on our business, ﬁnancial
condition, or results of operations.
Cash ﬂow from subsidiaries – Tomkins plc is a
holding company with no independent operations 
or signiﬁcant assets other than investments in, and
advances to, subsidiaries. Accordingly, it depends upon
the receipt of sufﬁcient funds from its subsidiaries 
to meet its obligations, including its ability to repay 
any amounts it borrows under its Euro Medium Term
Note Programme or to pay its dividends. The ability 
of Tomkins plc to access that cash ﬂow may be limited
in some circumstances. 
Pension plans – We operate both deﬁned beneﬁt 
and deﬁned contribution pension plans, the majority 
of which are in the United States and the United
Kingdom. The schemes were in deﬁcit by £183.6
million as at 31 December 2005. Deterioration in asset
prices or changes to long-term interest rates could lead
to an increase in the deﬁcit or give rise to an additional
funding requirement.
Healthcare and workers compensation – Healthcare
and workers compensation are provided by certain
United States subsidiaries to current and former
employees. Healthcare costs in the United States 
are increasing at a faster rate than the general cost
inﬂation and these cost increases have to be absorbed
in the business.
Tax cash outﬂows – Tomkins operates within multiple
tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit in those
jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues,
which may require an extended period of time for
resolution. Although provision has been made for 
such issues the ultimate resolution may result in tax
cash outﬂows. 
Funding growth – We may require capital to expand
our business, implement our strategic initiatives and
remain competitive. At present, our established sources
of funding are through equity, corporate bond markets
(through the Euro Medium Term Note Programme),
bank debt and cash ﬂow from operations. We believe
that the sources of funding currently available will 
be sufﬁcient to fund our operations. If our plans 
or assumptions regarding our funding requirements
change, however, we may need to seek other sources
of ﬁnancing, such as additional lines of credit with
commercial banks, vendors, public ﬁnancing, or 
to renegotiate existing bank facilities. 
Bondholders’ rights – We have a Euro Medium 
Term Note Programme under which Tomkins may issue
bonds. Our bondholders have the right to require us to
redeem our outstanding bonds at par, in the event of a
change of control of Tomkins plc and also in the event
that our credit rating falls below investment grade as a
result of us making either acquisitions or disposals that
comprise more than 25 per cent of the Group’s proﬁt
from operations in a twelve calendar month period. 
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates – We have
manufacturing facilities in, and sell products to many
countries worldwide. The principal currencies in which
we trade are US dollars, Canadian dollars, euros and
sterling. Currency exchange movements can give rise
to the following risks:
• Transaction risk – This arises where sales or
purchases are denominated in foreign currencies 
and exchange rates can change between entering
into a purchase or sale commitment and completing
the transaction;
• Translation risk – This arises where the currency 
in which the results of an entity are reported differs
from the underlying currency in which business 
is transacted; and
• Economic risk – This arises where the manufacturing
cost base of a business is denominated in a currency
different from the currency of the market into which
the products are sold.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Details of the Group’s signiﬁcant accounting policies
are set out in the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial
statements prepared in accordance with IFRS that are
contained in the Financial Statements section. When
applying the Group’s accounting polices, management
must make assumptions and estimates concerning the
future that affect the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities at the balance sheet date, the disclosure of
contingencies that existed at the balance sheet date
and the amounts of revenue and expenses recognised
during the accounting period. Management makes
these assumptions and estimates based on factors such
as historical experience, the observance of trends in 
the industries in which the Group operates and
42 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
information available from the Group’s customers and
other outside sources. Due to the inherent uncertainty
involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual
outcomes could differ from those assumptions and
estimates. An analysis of the key sources of estimation
uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a
signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of the Group’s assets and liabilities
within the next ﬁnancial year is provided below.
POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Group operates deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans in
several countries; in particular, in the United Kingdom
and the United States. The Group also provides other
post-employment beneﬁts, principally health and life
insurance cover, to certain of its employees in North
America by way of unfunded deﬁned beneﬁt plans.
The Group accounts for these deﬁned beneﬁt
plans in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee
Beneﬁts”, whereby the cost of providing the beneﬁts
is determined based on actuarial valuations of the
plans that are carried out annually at the Group’s
balance sheet date by independent qualiﬁed
actuaries. As at 31 December 2005, the deﬁned
beneﬁt liability recognised on the Group’s balance
sheet was £296.3 million. The deﬁned beneﬁt liability
comprises the net total for each plan of the present
value of the beneﬁt obligation, minus any past service
costs not yet recognised, minus the fair value of the
plan assets at the balance sheet date. Where a plan 
is in surplus, the deﬁned beneﬁt asset recognised 
in respect of the plan may be subject to limitation 
by the so-called asset ceiling.
As at 31 December 2005, the present value of the
beneﬁt obligation was £821.5 million. The beneﬁt
obligation is calculated using a number of
assumptions, including future salary increases, 
increases to pension beneﬁts, mortality rates and, 
in the case of post-employment medical beneﬁts, 
the expected rate of increase in medical costs. The
present value of the beneﬁt obligation is calculated by
discounting the beneﬁt obligation using market yields
on high-quality corporate bonds, where available, or
government bonds at the balance sheet date. As at 
31 December 2005, the fair value of the plan assets
was £527.1 million. The plan assets consist largely 
of listed securities and their fair values are subject to
ﬂuctuation in response to changes in market
conditions. As at 31 December 2005, the Group 
was unable to recognise a surplus of £1.9 million 
due to the effect of the asset ceiling.
Effects of changes in the actuarial assumptions
underlying the beneﬁt obligation, effects of changes 
in the discount rate applicable to the beneﬁt
obligation and effects of differences between 
the expected and actual return on the plan assets 
are classiﬁed as actuarial gains and losses and are
recognised directly in equity. During 2005, the Group
recognised a net actuarial loss of £44.1 million.
Further actuarial gains and losses will be recognised
during the next ﬁnancial year. For more information
please refer to the sensitivity analysis on page 40.
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS 
Goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment are tested for impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicate that their carrying
amounts might be impaired. Such events and
circumstances include the effects of restructurings
and new product development initiated by
management. Additionally, goodwill and capitalised
development expenditure relating to a product that
is not yet in full production are subject to an annual
impairment test. Impairment testing of goodwill
requires the calculation of the value in use of the
cash-generating units to which the goodwill 
is allocated. Due to the nature of the Group’s
operations, it is generally not possible to estimate
the recoverable amount for individual items of
property, plant and equipment and impairment
testing of these assets is also usually based on the
value in use of the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs.
Value in use represents the net present value of 
the cash ﬂows expected to arise from the relevant
cash-generating unit and its calculation requires
management to estimate those cash ﬂows and to
apply a suitable discount rate to them. Management
bases the estimated cash ﬂows on assumptions such
as the future growth in sales volumes, future changes
in selling prices, and expected changes in material
prices, salaries and other costs. Discount rates used
are based on current market interest rates adjusted 
to reﬂect the risks speciﬁc to the relevant 
cash-generating unit.
As at 31 December 2005, the aggregate carrying
amount of goodwill, intangible assets and property,
plant and equipment was £1,173.2 million. During
2005, the Group recognised an impairment loss 
of £5.3 million in respect of these assets. Further
impairment losses could arise within the next ﬁnancial
year if changes are necessary to the assumptions
underlying the estimated future cash ﬂows of 
cash-generating units or if there are changes in 
market interest rates that affect the discount rates 
that are applied to those cash ﬂows. 
INVENTORY
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net
realisable value, with due allowance for excess,
obsolete or slow moving items. Net realisable value 
is based on current assessments of future demand,
market conditions and new product development
initiatives. As at 31 December 2005, the carrying 
value of inventories was £444.7 million. During 2005,
the Group recognised an impairment loss on inventory
of £1.2 million. Further impairment losses may be
recognised within the next ﬁnancial year in response 
to changing circumstances.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group adopted IAS 39 “Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement” prospectively from 
2 January 2005. Accordingly, the derivative ﬁnancial
instruments that the Group holds for the purpose 
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
43 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
of hedging its currency and interest rate exposures 
are recognised as assets and liabilities in the Group’s
balance sheet measured at their fair value at the balance
date. As at 31 December 2005, the Group recognised 
a net asset of £16.0 million in respect of derivatives.
The fair value of derivatives continually changes in
response to changes in prevailing market conditions.
Where permissible under IAS 39, the Group uses
hedge accounting to mitigate the impact of changes 
in the fair value of derivatives on the income statement.
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES
Provision is made for the estimated cost of known
environmental remediation obligations in relation 
to the Group’s current and former manufacturing
facilities. Cost estimates include the expenditure
expected to be incurred in the initial remediation effort
and, where appropriate, in the long-term monitoring
of the relevant sites. For each remediation project
management monitors the costs incurred to date
against expected total costs to complete, and operates
procedures to identify possible remediation obligations
that are presently unknown. As at 31 December 2005,
the provision for environmental remediation costs
amounted to £6.2 million. Further provision may 
be necessary within the next ﬁnancial year if actual
remediation costs exceed expected costs, new
remediation obligations are identiﬁed or there are
changes in the circumstances determining the Group’s
legal or constructive remediation obligations.
PRODUCT WARRANTIES
Provision is made for the estimated cost of future
warranty claims on the Group’s products. Management
bases the provision on historical experience of the
nature, frequency and average cost of warranty 
claims and takes into account recent trends that 
might suggest that the historical claims experience 
may differ from future claims. As at 31 December
2005, the Group’s provision for warranty claims
amounted to £6.2 million. Further provision may be
necessary within the next ﬁnancial year if actual claims
experience differs from management’s estimates.
TAXATION
The Group is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions.
Signiﬁcant judgement is required in determining the
worldwide provision for income taxes.
The Group recognises provisions in respect of
uncertain tax positions whereby additional current 
tax may become payable in future periods following
the audit by the tax authorities of previously ﬁled tax
returns. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are based
upon management’s assessment of the likely outcome
of issues associated with assumed permanent
differences, interest that may be applied to temporary
differences, the possible disallowance of tax credits 
and penalties and are classiﬁed as non-current
liabilities. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are
reviewed regularly and are adjusted to reﬂect events
such as the expiry of limitation periods for assessing
tax, administrative guidance given by the tax
authorities and court decisions. As at 31 December
2005, the Group recognised a provision for uncertain
tax positions amounting to £94.9 million. It is possible
that the ﬁnal outcome of these matters may differ
from management’s estimates.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the liability
method, whereby deferred tax liabilities are generally
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that
it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available
against which deductible temporary differences can
be utilised. As at 31 December 2005, the Group
recognised deferred tax assets amounting to 
£101.9 million. It is possible that the deferred 
tax assets actually recoverable may differ from 
the amounts recognised if actual taxable proﬁts 
are lower than management’s estimates.
As at 31 December 2005, the aggregate amount 
of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for
which deferred tax liabilities had not been recognised
was £1,948.9 million. Deferred tax was not recognised
because the Group is in a position to control the
timing of those earnings and it is probable that 
they will not be distributed in the foreseeable 
future. Income tax may be payable on these amounts 
if circumstances change and either their distribution
can no longer be controlled by the Group or they are
actually distributed.
US GAAP
Operating income from continuing operations under
US GAAP in the year was $485.0 million (2004:
$477.1 million). Net income under US GAAP 
was $313.0 million (2004: $377.7 million). 
Shareholders’ equity under US GAAP was $3,034.4
million at 31 December 2005, compared to $2,923.1
million at 1 January 2005.
The differences between IFRS and US GAAP arise
from the treatment of restructuring costs, intangible
assets, inventory, product development costs, post-
employment beneﬁts and share-based incentives. 
Net income under US GAAP is subject to additional
adjustments relating to the treatment of costs
associated with exit or disposal activities, capitalised
interest, derivatives and hedge accounting, deferred
tax and minority interest. A reconciliation of ﬁnancial
information prepared under IFRS and US GAAP is
shown on page 124.

TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
The Directors present their report and the ﬁnancial statements for 
the year ended 31 December 2005.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES 
Tomkins is a world-class global engineering and manufacturing 
group with market and technical leadership across its two business
groups, Industrial & Automotive and Building Products. The principal
subsidiary and associated undertakings and their activities are listed 
in the Investor Information section on page 182.
RESULTS
The audited ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December
2005 are set out on pages 66 to 121. Proﬁt attributable to
shareholders is £192.2 million (year ended 1 January 2005 – 
£184.4 million).
A review of the businesses, activities and future developments 
of the Company and its subsidiaries is given on pages 4 to 45 and
should be read as part of this report. 
ORDINARY DIVIDENDS
The Directors recommend an ordinary ﬁnal dividend of 8.16p per
ordinary share, to be paid on 31 May 2006 to ordinary shareholders 
on the register as at the close of business on 21 April 2006. Together
with the ordinary interim dividend of 5.07p per share paid on 
14 November 2005, this makes a total dividend for the year of
13.23p (year ended 1 January 2005 – 12.60p).
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
See notes 40 and 41 to the ﬁnancial statements on pages 
104 to 106.
RESOLUTIONS AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Resolution 10 renews the Directors’ authority to issue relevant
securities up to an amount not exceeding £12,881,003, representing
257,620,060 ordinary shares of 5p each, being 33
1
/3 per cent of the
issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 
21 February 2006, until the next Annual General Meeting. The
Company held 1,658,803 shares in treasury as at 21 February 2006,
being 0.21 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding
treasury shares) as at that date. There are at present no plans to
exercise this authority, except in relation to share options and other
similar categories of allotment.
Resolution 11 renews the Directors’ authority to allot or, in 
the case of treasury shares, sell, shares for cash without ﬁrst
offering them to existing shareholders on a pro rata basis until 
the next Annual General Meeting. The authority sought is 
limited to the issue or, in the case of treasury shares, sale 
of up to 38,725,940 ordinary shares of 5p each (£1,936,297),
being approximately (but not more than) 5 per cent of the 
issued ordinary share capital as at 21 February 2006. Your 
Board conﬁrms its intention, in line with the guidelines issued 
by representatives of institutional investors, that not more than
7.5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital will be allotted, 
or, in the case of treasury shares, sold, for cash on a non 
pre-emptive basis during any three-year period.
SPECIAL BUSINESS AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Resolution 12 seeks authority for the Company to make market
purchases of its own ordinary shares up to a maximum of 10 per cent
of the issued ordinary share capital. Your Board may make purchases
of the Company’s shares if it considers such purchases will result in 
an increase in earnings per share and are in the best interests of
shareholders generally. The Company may also purchase its own
shares in order that they can, at the relevant time, be allocated to
employees as required under the Company’s Annual Bonus Incentive
Plan. If the Company purchases any of its ordinary shares pursuant to
resolution 12, the Company may cancel these shares or hold them in
treasury. Such decision will be made by your Board at the time of
purchase on the basis outlined above.
At last year’s Annual General Meeting, the Company was given
authority to make market purchases of up to 77,408,588 ordinary
shares of 5p each. 676,800 ordinary shares of 5p have been
purchased by the Company in the market since last year’s AGM. 
Options to subscribe for a total of 27,951,195 ordinary shares 
of 5p each in the Company, being 3.62 per cent of the issued
ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares), were outstanding 
at 21 February 2006. If the Company were to purchase the maximum
number of ordinary shares permitted (under the existing authority 
and resolution 12), the options outstanding at 21 February 2006
would represent 4.52 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital
(excluding treasury shares).
Resolution 13 seeks approval for the introduction of The Tomkins
2006 Performance Share Plan. This is a share-based long-term
incentive arrangement which more closely aligns the interests of
executives with shareholders. Details of the Plan are set out in the
accompanying letter to shareholders.
DIRECTORS
The Directors of the Company at the year end are listed in the table
on page 49. They were all Directors throughout the year, with the
exception of Messrs. R D Gillingwater and D D S Robertson who 
were appointed as Directors on 20 December 2005. Messrs. N N
Broadhurst and K J Minton will retire from the Board at the conclusion
of the Annual General Meeting on 22 May 2006.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Messrs. M F Wallach
and K Lever retire by rotation and, being eligible, offer themselves for
re-appointment. Messrs. R D Gillingwater and D D S Robertson,
having been appointed after the last Annual General Meeting, retire
in accordance with the Articles of Association and, being eligible,
offer themselves for re-appointment.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS 
The interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company 
are shown on the next page. No Director had any beneﬁcial interest in
the shares or loan stock of any other Group undertaking. The
executive Directors, as potential beneﬁciaries, are technically deemed
to have an interest in all ordinary shares held by the Tomkins
Employee Share Trust (the “Trust”) or in which the trustees of the
Trust are interested. The table includes, however, only those Trust
shares which are speciﬁcally allocated to the individual Director.
No changes took place in Directors’ interests during the period
from 1 January 2006 to 21 February 2006.
For details of the Directors’ options to purchase ordinary shares,
please refer to the Remuneration Committee report on pages 
50 to 55.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Applied research and development work continues to be directed
towards the introduction of new and improved products and the
application of technology to reduce unit and operating costs and 
to improve services to customers.
48 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
Each company in the Group is encouraged to implement
comprehensive employment policies designed to identify employees
with its achievements and to determine ways in which their
knowledge and skills can best contribute towards its success.
Schemes are operated to encourage loyalty and performance. 
The Tomkins 2005 Sharesave Scheme provides an opportunity 
to purchase shares in Tomkins and is open to all eligible employees.
Employee involvement and communication programmes continue 
to be developed, designed to provide equal opportunity to all,
irrespective of sex, race, religion or colour. Each company in the
Group endeavours to provide equality of opportunity in recruiting,
training, promoting and developing the careers of disabled persons.
SUPPLIER PAYMENT POLICY
Tomkins requires its operating companies to determine terms and
conditions of payment for the supply of capital and revenue items just as
keenly as they negotiate prices and other commercial matters. Suppliers
are made clearly aware of the agreed terms and how any disputes are 
to be settled and payment is made in accordance with those terms.
The number of days’ credit taken by the Company for trade
purchases at 31 December 2005 was 30 days (year ended 1 January
2005 – 20 days). The number of days’ credit taken by Group
companies for trade purchases at 31 December 2005 ranged from 
10 days to 182 days (year ended 1 January 2005 – 15 days to 151
days). The average number of days taken was 48 days (year ended 
1 January 2005 – 55 days).
PENSIONS
The Group operates retirement plans covering most employees. 
A proportion are deﬁned beneﬁt plans funded by contributions from
both employer and employee, at rates determined by independent
actuaries in the light of regular valuations. Except where legislation
makes pre-funding ﬁnancially inappropriate, the remainder are money
purchase plans funded by contributions from employer and employee.
The funds are held independently of the Group’s ﬁnances and
administered by trustees. In the United Kingdom, Tomkins requests
that trustees prohibit fund managers from investing directly 
in the Company.
CHARITABLE AND POLITICAL DONATIONS
Total charitable donations in the year were £836,348 (year ended
1 January 2005 – £447,881) of which the United Kingdom accounted
for £165,483 (year ended 1 January 2005 – £68,424); in the United
States they totalled £571,253 (year ended 1 January 2005 –
£298,581), of which £394,477 (year ended 1 January 2005 –
£151,093) came from a Tomkins funded charitable trust; and in the
remaining overseas companies they totalled £99,612 (year ended 
1 January 2005 – £80,876).
No political donations were made during the year (year ended 
1 January 2005 – £nil).

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
1. INTRODUCTION
This report to shareholders sets out the membership of the
Remuneration Committee and the names of the advisers who
provided services to the Committee during the year to 31 December
2005. The policies that have been followed by the Remuneration
Committee during the year in determining the elements of executive
remuneration are also set out, together with the policies and
principles to be followed by the Committee over the next two years.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (“DRRR”), which set out
statutory requirements for the disclosure of Directors’ remuneration.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has
applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’
remuneration. DRRR requires the independent auditors to report to
the Company’s members on the auditable parts of the Remuneration
Committee report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts
of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.
The Board keeps under review the terms of reference for the
Remuneration Committee, which are based on current best practice
contained in the model terms of reference set out in the Guidance
Note produced by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and
Administrators. The principal responsibility of the Committee is to
determine the framework or broad policy for the Company’s executive
remuneration and the remuneration of the Chairman of 
the Board, for approval by the Board. The remuneration of non-
executive Directors is a matter for the Board itself. The terms of
reference of the Remuneration Committee can be found in the
corporate governance area on the Company’s website,
www.tomkins.co.uk. In addition, the Company takes full account 
of the guidelines published by the Association of British Insurers 
and the National Association of Pension Funds.
Details of the emoluments, bonuses, beneﬁts-in-kind, incentive
arrangements (including share options and other long-term
incentives), pensions and service contracts applicable to each Director
who served during the year to 31 December 2005 are given in this
report, which will be put to the vote of shareholders at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
2. MEMBERSHIP OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
AND ADVISERS
The Remuneration Committee is made up exclusively of non-executive
Directors whom the Board determined to be independent, as each
was found to be free from any material business or other relationship
with the Company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or
ofﬁcer of an organisation that has a relationship with the Company).
Accordingly, the Board believes that there are no such relationships
that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent
judgement. Messrs. Minton, Broadhurst and Keenan served on the
Committee throughout the year and Richard Gillingwater was
appointed to the Committee on 20 December 2005. The members 
of the Remuneration Committee at 31 December 2005 were:
K J Minton (Chairman)
N N Broadhurst
R D Gillingwater
J M J Keenan
There were no other changes to the membership of the Committee
during the year. 
The Committee consults with the Chairman of the Board and the
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer concerning matters of executive remuneration.
The Committee also received advice from external advisers, PA
Consulting Group, concerning a Company share plan. PA Consulting
Group also provided consulting services during the year in respect of
business process in Tomkins. Mercer Human Resource Consulting
provided pension advice in respect of executive Directors and senior
executives and provided professional services in the area of pension
scheme advice. Other than those consulting services mentioned
above, PA Consulting Group and Mercer Human Resources had 
no connections with the Company.
3. STATEMENT OF THE COMPANY’S POLICY ON DIRECTORS’
REMUNERATION (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
The policies operated by the Company during the year and those 
to be applied over the next two years, are set out below:
A. EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION
The Company’s policy on executive remuneration is that the
Remuneration Committee and the Board should each satisfy itself 
that executives, including executive Directors, are fairly rewarded 
for their individual contributions to the Group’s performance. 
The Remuneration Committee has sought to ensure that executive
Directors receive a level of remuneration that is appropriate to their
scale of responsibility and performance and which will attract,
motivate and retain individuals of the necessary calibre. The only
pensionable element of executive Directors’ remuneration is basic
salary. This policy applies whether or not an executive Director is a
member of the Tomkins Retirement Beneﬁts Plan or has a personal
pension arrangement.
B. ANNUAL REMUNERATION FOR EXECUTIVES
The Board recognises that one of its key objectives is to grow the
value of the business for the beneﬁt of shareholders and that such
growth is strongly related, amongst other things, to the degree of
entrepreneurial spirit in the Group. In order to create the necessary
entrepreneurial impetus within an organisation, compensation
arrangements are required which are similar to those that an owner
of a business would seek. This has led to the adoption of a
remuneration policy under which the levels of total remuneration 
are set in order to attract, retain and motivate executives.
Remuneration is provided through a combination of base salaries 
at median level or below and annual bonuses that have a direct 
and proportionate link to total value created for shareholders. 
This provides the incentive for executives to act like owners of the
business. The Remuneration Committee and the Board believe 
that this more closely aligns the interests of shareholders and
management whereby executives only receive substantial rewards
when they have created high value in the business.
Over time and subject to the achievement of value-creating
performance targets, this policy is likely to lead to a realignment 
of the component parts of total executive remuneration, so that a
greater part of the total package received by executives is made 
up of incentive pay with the remainder coming from base salaries 
at the median level or below. The performance targets for the
Company’s executive share option scheme and the Annual Bonus
Incentive Plan ensure that a substantial proportion of total
remuneration is directly related to actual measurable performance.
Further details of the Annual Bonus Incentive Plan are set out in
section 4B on page 52.
50 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
C. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ FEES AND CHAIRMAN’S REMUNERATION
The executive members of the Board review the fees of non-executive
Directors, who play no part in determining their own remuneration.
The Chairman’s remuneration is determined by the Remuneration
Committee (in the absence of the Chairman) and is approved by the
Board. The review of non-executive Directors’ fees and the Chairman’s
remuneration takes place every two years.
D. SERVICE CONTRACTS
The Company’s policy on Directors’ service contracts is that service
contracts and letters of appointment for executive Directors 
normally provide for notice periods of no longer than twelve months.
On appointment, a longer notice period may apply, but this will
reduce over time to the normal twelve months’ notice period.
Notwithstanding the provisions in an executive Director’s service
contract or letter of appointment concerning termination payments,
the Company will seek to reduce any compensation that may be
payable to reﬂect the departing Director’s obligation to mitigate loss.
E. EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Company’s policy on external appointments is that, with the
approval of the Chairman of the Board, executive Directors are
permitted to hold appointments outside the Company. Any fees
payable in connection with such appointments are normally retained
by Directors unless otherwise agreed. Further details are set out in
section 10 on page 55.
F . LONG-TERM INCENTIVES AND SHARE OPTIONS
The Company has operated a number of share-based long-term
incentive schemes in the past but, following a review of executive
remuneration, the Remuneration Committee and Board expect the
number of plans and schemes to reduce over time as they lapse and
are not renewed or replaced. As reported last year, the Remuneration
Committee and the Board had decided not to continue with an
executive share option scheme beyond 9 May 2005, the date on
which the Company’s Executive Share Option Schemes lapsed.
Following further consideration, the Board has decided to seek
shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
of the introduction of a new share scheme, The Tomkins 2006
Performance Share Plan, a summary of which is set out below.
The Company’s new employee savings related share option
scheme, the Tomkins 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which applies to all 
UK employees, was approved by shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting in May 2005.
G. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company’ s retirement beneﬁt plan was closed to new members in
April 2002 and, since that time, the Company’ s policy has been that new
employees, including executive Directors and senior executives, will receive
a payment from the Company to enable them to make contributions to
retirement beneﬁt schemes of their choice on behalf of themselves and
their dependants. No change to this policy is expected over the next two
years. The normal retirement age of the executive Directors is 60.

car and related costs.)
(4) On 18 July 2005, 2,000 shares were purchased for each of the non-executive Directors at a market price of 272.81 pence per share. The cost of these shares formed part of their remuneration.
(5) 3,045,684 shares were awarded under the Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan on 11 February 2002, being part of the incentive package to attract James Nicol to the Company. 1,469,980
shares vested on 18 February 2005 and the remainder were forfeited. Under the terms of his contract, Mr Nicol elected to receive a cash payment of £4,193,000 (subject to statutory deductions)
in lieu of shares. (See “Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan” below for more details.)
(6) Richard Gillingwater, in accordance with Cabinet Ofﬁce guidelines, has waived his fees.
(7) See section 6 “Retirement beneﬁts” below for more details.
During the year no Director exercised any options and accordingly no gains or losses were made on exercise (year to 1 January 2005 – £nil).
4. ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION (AUDITED INFORMATION)
Executive remuneration is comprised of base salary, a bonus (in three parts: cash, bonus shares and deferred shares) and beneﬁts-in-kind. 
Non-executive Directors are paid a basic fee and fees for their work on Board Committees. The table below sets out the remuneration paid 
to each Director.
A. BASE SALARY, FEES, BONUSES AND BENEFITS-IN-KIND FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2005: GOVERNANCE
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
CHAIRMAN’S REMUNERATION
Having taken into consideration comparative remuneration data, 
the contribution made by the Chairman to the Company’s affairs, 
the time he devotes to the Company’s business, and the extra
responsibilities placed upon him arising from the changes in 
corporate governance requirements in the UK and the US, the
Remuneration Committee recommended to the Board that his
remuneration should be increased from £175,000 to £185,000 plus
2,000 Tomkins plc shares per annum, with effect from 1 January
2006. These recommendations were approved by the Board.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ FEES
The executive members of the Board reviewed the fees paid to non-
executive Directors and noted that the basic fee paid to non-executive
Directors of £40,000 plus 2,000 Tomkins plc shares per annum was
last reviewed in November 2003. Having taken into consideration
comparative remuneration data, the contribution made by individual
non-executive Directors to the Company’s affairs, the time they
devote to the Company’s business, and the extra responsibilities
placed upon them arising from the changes in corporate governance
requirements in the UK and the US, the executive Directors concluded
that the basic annual fee should be increased to £42,000 plus 
2,000 Tomkins plc shares per annum commencing 1 January 2006.
No changes to the level of Committee fees were made. 
B. CURRENT AND PROPOSED SCHEMES 
ANNUAL BONUS INCENTIVE PLAN
The executive Directors and senior executives participate in the
Company’s Annual Bonus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Each participant
in the Plan receives a percentage of “bonusable proﬁt” of the
business for which he or she has responsibility. Bonusable proﬁt is
based on operating proﬁt less a charge for tax, certain exceptional
items, and a charge for invested capital, and is based upon IFRS. The
objective of the Plan is to reward the senior executives for increasing
the overall value created in the business, based on the margin of the
after-tax return on invested capital in excess of the weighted average
cost of capital. Accordingly, bonusable proﬁt may increase at a faster
rate than operating proﬁt where the margin of the return over the
cost of capital increases. This aligns the interests of management and
shareholders. In arriving at bonusable proﬁt, adjustments may be
made for operating exceptional items relating to strategic
manufacturing initiatives to match the costs of the strategic
manufacturing initiatives to the beneﬁts over a period of up to three
years. With the approval of the Remuneration Committee,
adjustments are also made for non-operating exceptional items. 
The charge for taxation reﬂects the ongoing charge for tax excluding
any beneﬁt from exceptional adjustments to tax provisions. The
charge for invested capital is based on applying the estimated
weighted average cost of capital to the average invested capital in 
the Group. The estimated weighted average cost of capital takes 
into account the capital structure of the Group and the costs
associated with each element of capital. The method of calculation
has been agreed by the Remuneration Committee and is subject to
review each year. The invested capital is based on the book value of
assets in the Group excluding goodwill relating to acquisitions made
prior to 30 December 1999. The cost of capital used in the calculation
of bonusable proﬁt for the year under review was 7.7 per cent.
The Remuneration Committee carries out a detailed review of 
the computations involved and ensures that the rules are applied
consistently. Furthermore, the independent auditor is asked to
perform agreed-upon procedures on behalf of the Remuneration
Committee on the calculations which underlie the computation of the
bonusable proﬁt. The incentive bonus of the executive Directors is
based on a percentage of the bonusable proﬁt of the Group which,
for the year ended 31 December 2005, was £123.7 million (1 January
2005 – £111.0 million). James Nicol received the sum of £1,471,000
(1 January 2005 – £1,321,000) and Ken Lever received the sum of
£693,000 (1 January 2005 – £505,000). Ken Lever’s percentage of
bonusable proﬁt increased during the year in accordance with the
levels approved by the Remuneration Committee at the time the 
Plan was introduced. Although there is no limit to the bonusable
proﬁt on which bonuses are calculated, inordinate growth in
bonusable proﬁt in any one year is unlikely to arise due to the 
nature of the Group’s business.
The bonus awards are payable to the senior participants, including
executive Directors, as to four-sevenths in cash, one-seventh in bonus
shares and two-sevenths in deferred shares. The bonus awards
payable to the remaining participants are as to three-quarters in cash,
one-twelfth in bonus shares and one sixth in deferred shares. The
bonus is paid at the end of June, September and December based on
75 per cent of the bonus earned to the end of the previous quarter,
with the balance of the full entitlement to the bonus for the calendar
year paid at the end of March following the calendar year-end. 
Bonus shares are restricted and vest only after a period of three
years after the initial bonus award. Dividends are paid on the bonus
shares. Deferred shares are awarded at the time of the initial bonus
award but the vesting of the shares is conditional on continued
employment with the Group for three years after the award.
Dividends are not paid on the deferred shares until they have vested.
As a condition of continued participation in the Plan, senior
participants, including executive Directors, are required to hold shares
with a purchase cost equivalent to one year’s total after-tax
remuneration including bonus, based on an average of the previous
three years. Remaining participants are required to hold shares with 
a purchase cost equivalent to one half of one year’s total after-tax
remuneration including bonus, based on an average of the previous
three years. Increases in annual base salary of all participants,
including executive Directors, are restricted to the equivalent rate 
of increase in the Retail Prices Index (in the UK) or equivalent index 
in the country in which a participant works. The restrictions on the
increases in salary, together with the growth in bonus, assuming
increases in bonusable proﬁt, will result in the incentive pay element
of remuneration increasing over time. The share awards will increase
the investment each of the participants, including executive Directors,
has in Tomkins plc shares.
THE TOMKINS 2006 SHARE PLAN
Subject to the approval of shareholders at the 2006 Annual General
Meeting, it is proposed to introduce the Tomkins 2006 Performance
Share Plan (the “2006 Plan”), a long-term incentive plan. The purpose
of the 2006 Plan is two-fold. First, to provide a share-based long-term
incentive arrangement for senior executives which more closely aligns
the interests of executives with shareholders. Secondly, the 2006 Plan
is in substitution of the Company’s legal obligation to the Chief
Executive to provide annual grants of options, which had previously
been satisﬁed by the Tomkins Executive Share Option Scheme that
lapsed in May 2005. The Remuneration Committee considered the
alternatives and, with the agreement of the Chief Executive and the
assistance of PA Consulting Group, over the past year devised a plan
that achieves those aims. The 2006 Plan will only provide rewards if
shareholders have seen value created over the preceding three years.
The Remuneration Committee and Board believe that this creates a
52 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
better alignment between executive reward and the creation of
shareholder value than a standard executive share option scheme.
The 2006 Plan has four key features: (i) the performance baseline
is established which is equal to the cost of equity and if the Total
Shareholder Return (comprising dividends and increase in the share
price) over three years does not exceed the cost of equity over the
same three year period, no award of shares will be made; (ii) the
award of shares will be proportional to the degree of performance
over the baseline; (iii) there is a “cap” on the quantum of share
awards; and (iv) subject to performance, awards will be made at 
the end of each three-year performance period.
SHARE OPTIONS
THE TOMKINS 2005 SHARESAVE SCHEME
This is a standard HM Revenue & Customs-approved savings related
share option scheme, which is open to employees who are resident
for tax purposes in the United Kingdom.
C. CLOSED SCHEMES
The following schemes are now closed.
THE TOMKINS EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME NO. 3 (“ESOS 3”) AND
THE TOMKINS EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME NO. 4 (“ESOS 4”)
ESOS 3 and ESOS 4 lapsed for grant purposes on 9 May 2005 and
the Remuneration Committee and the Board decided not to continue
with an executive share option scheme beyond that date.
ESOS 3 was an HM Revenue & Customs-approved scheme. 
ESOS 4 was not approved by HM Revenue & Customs. The options
under both schemes mature after three years. All outstanding 
ESOS 4 options were granted to participants within the limit of four
times their annual earnings. The performance condition for all
outstanding options under ESOS 3 and ESOS 4 requires that the
growth in Tomkins’ earnings per share must exceed the growth 
in the Retail Prices Index by an average of 2 per cent per annum 
over a three-year period before an option can be exercised, which
was in accordance with contemporary practice when the schemes
were introduced in 1995. 
THE TOMKINS SAVINGS RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME NO. 2 (“SAYE 2”)
This was a standard HM Revenue & Customs-approved savings related
share option scheme, which lapsed for grant purposes, on 
9 May 2005.
THE TOMKINS SHARE MATCHING SCHEME (“SMS”)
Awards which had been made under a now expired scheme known
as the Tomkins Restricted Share Plan and which had vested, were
eligible for matching awards for the same number of shares under the
SMS. Such awards could be for up to two conditional share matching
awards vesting a further two years and four years respectively after
the end of the original restricted period. The ﬁnal commitment to
grant an SMS award was made during the year and the SMS is
therefore now closed for grant purposes. With shareholder approval,
this share scheme was introduced in 1996 with no performance
conditions attached and accordingly it does not comply with Schedule
A of the Combined Code.
TOMKINS PREMIUM PRICED OPTION
This was an option speciﬁcally and solely granted to James Nicol as
part of the incentive package on his joining Tomkins. No performance
conditions were attached to this option in order to attract him to the
Company and retain his services and this therefore does not comply
with Schedule A of the Combined Code. It consists of a non-
transferable option to acquire 5,076,142 shares granted on 
11 February 2002. The exercise price is 197 pence per share in 
respect of 2,538,072 shares (A option shares), 276 pence per share
in respect of 1,522,842 shares (B option shares) and 345 pence per
share in respect of 1,015,228 shares (C option shares). The options
have all vested and will lapse on 11 February 2012 or earlier in 
certain circumstances.
ONGOING OPTION
This is an option speciﬁcally and solely granted to James Nicol on
11 February 2002 as part of the incentive package to attract him to
the Company. It consists of a non-transferable option to acquire
1,522,842 shares at 197p per share, which can be exercised on or
after 18 February 2005 provided the rate of increase of earnings per
share over any three-year period is equal to or greater than the rate

of increase of the Retail Prices Index plus 9 per cent. This performance
condition has been met and the option is exercisable. There are
provisions for waiving or amending the performance condition in
certain circumstances and, if there is a change of control of the
Company, the option is exercisable immediately, regardless of whether
the performance condition is satisﬁed. The option will lapse on 
11 February 2012 or earlier in certain circumstances. If there is 
a variation in the share capital of the Company the Remuneration
Committee may adjust the number of shares in either the Tomkins
Premium Priced Option or the Ongoing Option as it reasonably deems
appropriate to take account of the variation.
DEFERRED MATCHING SHARE PURCHASE PLAN
This was speciﬁcally and solely introduced for James Nicol as part of
the incentive package to attract him to the Company. Under this Plan,
3,045,684 shares (“Matching Shares”) were awarded on 11 February
2002 following the purchase by James Nicol of 1,015,228 Tomkins plc
shares. On 18 February 2005, the award vested in respect of
1,015,228 Matching Shares and of the remaining 2,030,456 Matching
Shares, 454,752 vested and the balance lapsed. The number of shares
which vested was calculated on the basis of the highest price of a
Tomkins share sustained over a ﬁve-day period during the six-month
period ended 18 February 2005 (285.25 pence), to the extent that, for
every 1 penny that the share price increased over 197 pence, being the
market price on 18 February 2002, up to a maximum of 591 pence,
James Nicol was entitled to receive 5,153 shares. Under the terms of
his contract, Mr Nicol elected to receive a cash payment of £4,193,000
(subject to statutory deductions) in lieu of shares.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN TOMKINS SHARES AT 31 DECEMBER 2005
The Directors’ current interests in Tomkins shares are set out in 
the Directors’ report on pages 48 and 49 and, in the case of the
executive Directors, where appropriate these include shares held
through their participation in the SMS.
The interests of the Directors in Tomkins ordinary shares held
within the SMS that are yet to vest and yet to be included in
Directors’ remuneration were as follows:
31 December 1 January
Scheme or 2005 Awarded Vested 2005 Vesting
Director Plan Number Number Number Number Period
K Lever SMS 1,809 1,809 1,809 1,809 2007
The value of entitlements held under the SMS for current Directors at
31 December 2005 was £5,000 (1 January 2005 – £5,000). 1,809
shares were awarded to Ken Lever on 29 December 2005 (in relation
to the vesting of the SMS award made on 25 November 2003 in
connection with the vesting of the RSP award made on 15 August
2000) with a market value of £5,000 when the market price per
share was 290.00 pence per share. (No Director received an award in
the year ended 1 January 2005.) No other Director received an award
under the SMS during the year.
During the year 1,809 shares vested under the SMS at 289.02
pence per share, market value £5,000, in respect of Ken Lever. 
(No shares awarded to Directors vested under the SMS during the
year ended 1 January 2005.) No other Director had shares vest 
under the SMS during the year.
At 31 December 2005, 3,618 shares were required to be retained
by Ken Lever in order to allow the SMS award in the above table to
vest in the relevant vesting period (1 January 2005 – 1,809 shares
required to be retained by Ken Lever). No other current Director was
required to retain shares in this respect at 31 December 2005.
5. PERFORMANCE GRAPH (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
The graph set out below plots Total Shareholder Return on a holding
in the Company’s shares for each of the past ﬁve years ended 
31 December, measured against the performance of the FTSE
Engineering and Machinery Index. This index was chosen because its
major constituents are, like Tomkins, moderately diversiﬁed
engineering groups with a signiﬁcant manufacturing presence outside
the home UK market.
The index classiﬁcations changed on 3 January 2006 and with effect
from that date Tomkins is included in General Industrials. 
6. RETIREMENT BENEFITS (AUDITED INFORMATION)
James Nicol and Ken Lever are not entitled to any retirement beneﬁts
deﬁned in terms of ﬁnal or average salary but they receive a payment
at an annual rate of 37.5 per cent of their basic salary to enable them
to make contributions to retirement beneﬁt schemes of their choice
on behalf of themselves and their dependants. For the year ended
31 December 2005, this amounted to £309,709 (year to 1 January
2005 – £300,000) for James Nicol, and £148,899 (year to 1 January
2005 – £144,000) for Ken Lever. At the time he joined the Company,
Ken Lever was given the option to elect at any time to become a
member of the Tomkins Retirement Beneﬁts Plan (the “RBP”) or any
other replacement pension scheme nominated by the Company, but
did not do so during the year ended 31 December 2005. The normal
retirement age of the executive Directors is 60.

This Report has been approved by the Remuneration Committee 
and the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
This report to shareholders has been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of paragraph C.3.3 of the Combined Code and
paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2 of the Guidance on Audit Committees
produced by Sir Robert Smith. The report describes the role of the
Audit Committee in meeting these requirements.
TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Committee’s terms of reference, a copy of which can be found 
in the Corporate Governance area on the Company’s website, are
reviewed from time to time and approved by the Board of Tomkins.
They are based on the model terms of reference set out in the
Guidance Note produced by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries 
and Administrators and take account of the requirements of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Guidance Notes set out in 
Sir Robert Smith’s Report published in January 2003.
The terms of reference cover membership and appointment,
meetings (their frequency, quorum, attendees and minutes), duties
and responsibilities covering external audit, internal audit, ﬁnancial
reporting, internal controls and risk management systems,
whistleblowing, reporting responsibilities, authority (delegated by 
the Board) and a number of other matters.
MEMBERSHIP , APPOINTMENT AND EXPERIENCE
The Audit Committee comprises four independent non-executive
Directors, three of whom have served on the Committee throughout
the year and the fourth who was appointed in December. The
members of the Committee are Norman Broadhurst, who was
appointed to the Committee, as Chairman, in December 2000, Ken
Minton, who was also appointed in December 2000, Jack Keenan,
who was appointed in November 2001 and Richard Gillingwater who
was appointed on 20 December 2005. No limitation on the term of
ofﬁce is speciﬁed for members of any of Tomkins’ Board Committees.
The Board has determined that all four members of the Audit
Committee are independent for the purposes of the Combined Code
and rule 10A.3(b)(1) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange’s Listed Company
Manual. The members have wide-ranging ﬁnancial, commercial and
management experience that they bring to the work of the Audit
Committee and their biographical details are set out on pages 46 and 47.
The Chairman of the Committee, Norman Broadhurst, is a
Chartered Accountant (FCA) and a Fellow of the Institute of Corporate
Treasurers, having previously been group ﬁnance director of Railtrack
PLC (1994 to 2000) and joint deputy chief executive and ﬁnance
director of VSEL Consortium PLC (1990 to 1994). In accordance with
section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Board has
determined that Norman Broadhurst is an “audit committee ﬁnancial
expert” as that term is deﬁned under the rules of the US Securities 
and Exchange Commission, having signiﬁcant, relevant and up-to-date
UK and US ﬁnancial and accounting knowledge and experience. 
Ken Minton has held a number of senior management positions having
been Managing Director and then Chief Executive of Laporte PLC and
Jack Keenan has held a number of senior management positions in
international companies having been Chairman of Kraft International,
Chief Executive of Guinness United Distillers and Vintners and an
executive Director of Diageo plc. Richard Gillingwater is Head of
Shareholder Executive (a body responsible for the Government’s
shareholdings in major publicly-owned businesses) and has wide-
ranging experience in investment banking of more than 20 years. 
All three have extensive ﬁnancial experience.
MEETINGS
The Audit Committee meets at least four times a year and on other
occasions when circumstances require. The quorum for a meeting 
of the Committee is two members. The Finance Director and
representatives from the independent auditor and the internal auditor
attend meetings under a standing invitation. The Chairman of the
Board, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and other Directors are able to attend
meetings of the Committee under the practice that any Director may
attend any meeting of a Board Committee provided that they have no
conﬂict of interest in respect of business to be discussed. It is usual
practice for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer to attend meetings of the
Audit Committee. Other ﬁnance and business risk executives attend
meetings and the Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee Chairman reports regularly to the Board on its
activities. Five meetings were held during the year and attendance 
is set out in the table on page 59.
WORK OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee has established an “agenda framework” which
Tomkins believes is vital for maintaining an appropriate focus on 
the objectives of the Committee. The agenda sets out all of the
operational duties and responsibilities outlined in the Committee’s
terms of reference and is based on four regular meetings, in February,
May, August and November, which coincide with the announcement
of the quarterly results. The areas covered by the “agenda
framework” are as follows:
1. Corporate Governance, including the regular review of the
Committee’s terms of reference and annual evaluation, 
regulatory issues, review of delegated authorities and review 
of auditor independence;
2. Business Risk Assurance (i.e. internal audit), including the review 
of the internal audit charter, update on internal audit reviews and
future plans, and progress against its internal audit business plan;
3. Conﬁdential sessions with the Audit Committee, in the absence 
of Directors and Company executives;
4. Financial Reporting, including current accounting and ﬁnancial
reporting matters and review of quarterly, interim and annual
statements including earnings releases; and
5. Independent Audit including audit plan and scope, review of 
audit fees, cost effectiveness, reports on interim and annual
ﬁnancial statements, status reports, management letters and 
the nature and extent of non-audit services. 
The audit plan and scope sets out details of the areas to be covered
and how the audit is to be conducted. The Chairman of the Audit
Committee meets periodically with the independent auditor to discuss
progress on the audit and the major points to arise, and has the
opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the process. The Committee
is also able to assess the effectiveness of the auditors and the process
through reports made to the Committee by the independent auditor.
In addition to the items considered by the Committee under the
“agenda framework”, during 2005 other important issues considered
included regular reviews of the internal control systems and the
statement to be made in the Directors’ Report and Accounts in
respect of internal controls, Group risk proﬁle, Group tax reports,
updates on compliance with the Combined Code, review of tax
services provided by the independent auditor, Form 20-F and update
of IT systems. Conﬁdential meetings with representatives of the
56 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
independent audit and internal audit functions took place during the
year in the absence of executives. Considerable time and emphasis
continues to be placed by the Committee on compliance with section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and detailed progress reports
were received by the Committee at each of its meetings, including an
update of the Sarbanes-Oxley Project Risk Proﬁle. This has been the
focus of attention of the Business Risk Assurance and internal audit
function during the ﬁrst half of the year. In the second half of the
year, Business Risk Assurance resources were transitioned towards
internal audit reviews, with an appropriate amount of resources
applied to Sarbanes-Oxley and internal audit responsibilities. The Audit
Committee met earlier in the year to consider Tomkins’ transition to
International GAAP reporting (adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)) and following detailed consideration 
by the Committee, consultation with the independent auditor and
approval by the Board, the Company announced on 22 April 2005,
the intended basis of preparation of ﬁnancial statements under IFRS.
The Company has published comparative information for 2004
originally presented in accordance with UK GAAP but restated in
accordance with IFRS. The ﬁrst results to be prepared on an IFRS 
basis were the Group’s results for the quarter ended 2 April 2005. 
Business Risk Assurance’s internal audit function is actively
engaged in the business risk assessment processes in the Group’s
businesses and also provides guidance and assistance in the
development of risk mitigation plans. Each quarter, the Committee
receives a summary of reviews of the business’s risk management
processes; any signiﬁcant related ﬁnancial exposures are also
highlighted. The risk assessment process and risk mitigation plans 
are an important part of the development of the business strategies.
Business risks are considered at the quarterly reviews with the
businesses, where all of the major strategic, operational, compliance
and ﬁnancial risks are discussed.
In determining its policy on the extent of non-audit services
provided by the independent auditor, the Committee has taken
account of the rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission
which regulate and, in certain circumstances, prohibit the provision 
of certain types of non-audit services by the independent auditor.
Non-audit services are ordinarily put out to tender and require the
approval of the Chairman of the Audit Committee. During the year,
speciﬁc projects requiring tax services were the subject of a tender
process and in a number of cases the work was not awarded to the
ﬁrm of the independent auditor. In those cases where the work was
awarded to the independent auditor it was concluded that the ﬁrm of
the independent auditor was best placed to supply in a cost effective
manner such tax services, due to the experience and qualiﬁcations of
the individuals providing such services, the independent auditor’s
knowledge of the Company and its tax affairs and that the best
interests of the Company were served by engaging the ﬁrm of the
independent auditor. By way of example, during 2005, the American
Jobs Creation Act in the US enabled Tomkins to take advantage of a
number of tax beneﬁts. After a detailed review and, in some cases, 
a tender process, it was decided that Deloitte and Touche were the
preferred ﬁrm to engage on a number of projects to ensure that
Tomkins maximised the beneﬁts available. This was largely due to 
the efﬁciencies arising from the knowledge Deloitte and Touche has
of the Tomkins Group. The adoption of certain other rules by the
Committee, including those relating to audit partner rotation, 
relevant ethical guidance issued by the professional bodies in the
Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (in particular that 
the external auditor should not audit its own ﬁrm’s work, make
management decisions for the Company, create a mutuality of
interest nor be put in the position of advocate for the Company),
when taken together provide adequate protection of auditor
independence. All fees proposed by the external auditor must be
reported to the Audit Committee and approved by the Chairman of
the Audit Committee. Details of audit fees for the year can be found
on page 82 of the ﬁnancial statements.
The Company’s practice, in accordance with the Companies Act
1985 and the Combined Code, in relation to the appointment and
termination of the independent auditor, involves a recommendation
from the Audit Committee to the Board, which will then make a
recommendation to shareholders in general meeting. This differs 
from the procedure in the US, where the independent auditor is
accountable to the Audit Committee, which has the authority to
appoint or dismiss the independent auditor without reference 
to shareholders.
With the approval of the Board, the Committee has established
guidelines for the recruitment of employees or former employees of
the independent auditor. Tomkins will not engage, on a part-time or
full-time basis, any person who is or was an employee of the
Company’s independent auditor, where that person has worked on the
Group’s audit either as a principal or partner at any time during a
period of not less than three years prior to the proposed date of
joining the Tomkins Group. In addition, though Tomkins may employ
an employee of the Company’ s independent auditor where such
person has never worked on the Group’ s audit either as a principal or
partner, a period of not less than one year must elapse prior to the
proposed date of that person joining the Company. Any former
employee of the independent auditor who joined the Company before
the independent auditor was appointed will remain unaffected.
A “whistleblowing” procedure has been established for the
conﬁdential and anonymous submission by employees of concerns
regarding accounting, internal controls or auditing matters, in
accordance with the requirements of section 301 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002. Should a call be received on the dedicated
telephone line, the Vice-President, Business Risk Assurance would
immediately report to the Chairman of the Audit Committee all
concerns raised. A course of action is agreed and a report is prepared
for review at the next meeting of the Audit Committee, including
details of actions taken to deal with the matters raised. The Chairman
of the Committee will report all cases of “whistleblowing” to the
Committee and the Board. The Company’s Code of Conduct and
Ethics includes the “whistleblowing” procedure. No reports were
received by the Committee during the year.
Shareholders are given the opportunity at the Annual General
Meeting to ask the Chairman of the Committee questions on this
report and any other related matter.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
The Board promotes the highest standards of corporate governance
within the Company through its support and application of the
Principles of Good Governance set out in Section 1 of the Combined
Code. A summary of the Company’s system of applying the principles
and the manner in which the provisions in Section 1 have been
complied with are set out in this report to shareholders. Section 1 of
the Combined Code sets out the main and supporting Principles of
Good Governance for companies, which are split into the following
areas: directors, remuneration, accountability and audit, and relations
with shareholders.
A. DIRECTORS
1. THE BOARD
The Company is controlled through its Board of Directors. The Board’s
main roles are to create value for shareholders, to provide leadership
of the Company, to approve the Company’s strategic objectives, to
ensure that the necessary ﬁnancial and other resources are made
available to the management to enable them to meet those 
objectives and to operate within a framework of effective controls
which enables the assessment and management of principal 
business risks. The Board, which has reserved certain speciﬁc matters
to itself for decision, is responsible for approving overall Group
strategy and ﬁnancial policy, acquisition and divestment policy and
major capital expenditure projects. It also appoints and removes
members of the Board and Board Committees, and reviews
recommendations of the Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee
and Nomination Committee and the appointment of the independent
auditor and the ﬁnancial performance and operation of each of the
Company’s businesses. 
The Board has delegated to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Group subject 
to certain ﬁnancial limits above which Board approval is required. 
The delegated authority includes such matters as operations,
acquisitions and divestitures, investments, capital expenditure,
borrowing facilities and foreign currency transactions.
The Board of Directors comprises a non-executive Chairman, eight
additional non-executive Directors and two executive Directors who
together, with their different ages, ﬁnancial, commercial, technical
and operational expertise and cultures, bring with them 
a wide range of experience to the Company. 
The Board has determined that David Newlands, Norman
Broadhurst, Richard Gillingwater, Jack Keenan, Ken Minton, Sir Brian
Pitman, David Richardson and Struan Robertson are independent, as
they are independent of the Company’s executive management and
free from any material business or other relationship with the
Company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or ofﬁcer of an
organisation that has a relationship with the Company). In December
2000, at the request of the Board, the non-executive Chairman, David
Newlands, temporarily assumed certain executive responsibilities until
the recruitment of James Nicol as Chief Executive in February 2002. 
It is the Board’s view that this short-term arrangement did not affect
Mr Newlands’ independence. Accordingly, the Board believes that
there are no such relationships that could materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement. Marshall Wallach is the only
non-executive Director deemed not to be independent as a result of
his advisory capacity to the Gates family who are substantial
preference shareholders in the Company.
Non-executive directors are normally appointed for a minimum
period of two years, which is renewable by agreement with the
Board. The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce
during normal business hours on weekdays and will also be available
for inspection at the place of the Annual General Meeting from 15
minutes before the meeting until it ends. The Combined Code
recommends the appointment of a senior independent non-executive
Director and Sir Brian Pitman has served in this capacity during the year
under review. The roles of non-executive Directors are to scrutinise the
performance of management in meeting agreed objectives, help
develop proposals on strategy and monitor the reporting of
performance, including satisfying themselves as to the integrity of
ﬁnancial information and that ﬁnancial controls and systems of risk
management put in place by the Company are robust and effective.
They meet together from time to time in the absence of management
and the Chairman normally presides over such meetings.
Directors receive a range of information about the Company upon
appointment and, where appropriate, any training that is necessary 
for them to carry out their duties effectively. An induction programme 
is available which aims to provide an understanding of the Company 
as a whole, including its strategy, structure, geographical spread of
operations, ﬁnancial position, markets, products, technologies and
people, as well as their legal responsibilities as a Director. The Directors
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary whose
removal may be effected only with the approval of the Board. There is
an approved procedure by which all Directors can obtain independent
professional advice at the Company’ s expense in furtherance of their
duties, if required; this procedure is reviewed periodically.
The Board ordinarily meets not less than ﬁve times a year, and will
hold additional meetings when circumstances require. During the year
to 31 December 2005, the Board met on ﬁve occasions, including a
meeting held solely to consider and approve Group strategy. Between
meetings, the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer update the non-
executive Directors on current matters and there is frequent contact to
progress the affairs of the Company. With the encouragement of the
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the non-executive Directors have regular
contact with senior management through their presentations at Board
meetings, at strategic reviews and on other occasions.
Attendance by each individual Director at Board and Committee
meetings held during 2005 is set out in the table on the next page.
The Board sets the standards and values of the Company and
much of this has been embodied in the Company’s Code of Conduct
and Ethics and Human Rights Policy which can be found on the
Company’s website, www.tomkins.co.uk. The Code of Conduct 
and Ethics applies to all Directors, ofﬁcers and employees, including
the principal executive, ﬁnancial and accounting ofﬁcers, as required
by section 406 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the related
rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the rules 
of the New York Stock Exchange. The Code contains provisions 
(in paragraph XVI) under which employees can report violations of
company policy or any applicable law, rule or regulation, including
those of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. US employees
have the added protection of section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, which prohibits the discrimination by a company or others
against an employee where such violations are reported. The current
procedure, which is set out in Tomkins’ Code of Conduct and Ethics,
provides for information to be given anonymously or by named
employees under conditions of conﬁdentiality. Those employees who
come forward and give their name are assured that they will receive
the full protection of section 806 and no retaliation will take place.
This is of particular importance since 57 per cent of the Company’s
employees are based in the US. Furthermore, the Company ensures
that the principles are applied in other jurisdictions, subject to
compliance with local employment and other laws.
58 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
RE-APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company and in
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, Ken Minton
and Ken Lever as the longest serving Directors, will retire from the
Board and Ken Lever will seek re-appointment. Norman Broadhurst
will retire from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual General
Meeting and together with Ken Minton will not be seeking 
re-appointment. There are no circumstances relating to their
retirement from the Board that they wish to draw to the attention of
shareholders. Marshall Wallach will stand down from the Board with
effect from 1 May 2006. Richard Gillingwater and Struan Robertson
who were appointed by the Board on 20 December 2005 and David
Richardson who was appointed by the Board on 1 March 2006 are
required, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
to seek re-appointment at the ﬁrst Annual General Meeting following
their appointment. Details of their terms of appointment can be
found in the Remuneration Committee Report. Richard Gillingwater
has many years’ broad business experience, including investment
banking, and Struan Robertson has held a number of senior
management positions in both the UK and overseas. David Richardson
has substantial ﬁnancial management and strategic planning
experience over many years. The Board strongly supports the 
re-appointment of all Directors standing for re-appointment and
recommends that shareholders vote in favour of their re-appointment. 
2. CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
There is a clear division of responsibility between the Chairman and
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, with neither having unfettered powers 
of decision with respect to substantial matters. The Chairman is
responsible for running the Board and ensures that all Directors
receive sufﬁcient relevant information on ﬁnancial, business and
corporate matters to enable them to participate effectively in Board
decisions. In advance of each meeting, the Board is provided with
comprehensive brieﬁng papers on items under consideration.
The Chairman, David Newlands, is also Chairman of Kesa Electrical
plc and PayPoint plc. Whilst these are important appointments, the
Board of Tomkins believes that the Chairman continues to be able 
to carry out his duties and responsibilities effectively for the Company.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’ s primary role is the running of the
Company’s businesses and the development and implementation of
strategy. The non-executive Directors have the opportunity to meet with
the Chairman and with the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer periodically, either
together or separately, to consider and discuss a wide range of matters
affecting the Company, its business, strategy and other matters.
3. BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established a number of Committees and receives
reports of their proceedings. Each Committee has its own delegated
authority as deﬁned in its terms of reference, which are reviewed
periodically by the Board. The Board is satisﬁed that its Committees
have written terms of reference which conform to best corporate
governance practice. The terms of reference for all Board Committees
can be found on the Company’s website, www.tomkins.co.uk, or 
a copy can be obtained by application to the Company Secretary 
at the Company’s registered ofﬁce.
The Board appoints the chairmen and members of all 
Board Committees upon the recommendation of the
Nomination Committee. The Company Secretary is Secretary
to all Board Committees. 
The principal Committees, their membership, a brief description 
of their terms of reference and their duties are as follows:
AUDIT COMMITTEE

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
K J Minton (Chairman), N N Broadhurst, R D Gillingwater, J M J Keenan.
The Remuneration Committee, which meets at least twice a year
and on other occasions when circumstances require, comprises
independent non-executive Directors and has responsibility for
determining Company policy on executive remuneration for approval
by the Board. It also determines speciﬁc remuneration packages and
compensation packages on employment or early termination of ofﬁce
for each of the executive Directors of the Company. The Committee
takes independent advice from consultants as and when required. All
decisions of the Remuneration Committee in respect of remuneration
packages of executive Directors are referred to the Board. No
executive Director takes part in any discussion or decision concerning
his own remuneration. The Remuneration Committee also monitors
the compensation packages of other senior executives in the Group
below Board level.
The report of the Remuneration Committee can be found on
pages 50 to 55.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
D B Newlands (Chairman), N N Broadhurst, R D Gillingwater, 
J M J Keenan, K J Minton, Sir Brian Pitman, D D S Robertson, 
M F Wallach.
The Nomination Committee makes recommendations to the Board
on all proposed appointments of Directors through a formal and
transparent procedure. The Committee meets as and when required. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, Directors
are subject to re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting
immediately following the date of their appointment, and thereafter
they have to seek re-appointment no more than three years from the
date they were last re-appointed. The Committee recommends to the
Board the names of the Directors who are to seek re-appointment at
the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the Company’s
Articles of Association.
During the year, two new Board appointments were made. The
Nomination Committee was at the heart of the recruitment process,
including the appointment of professional advisers and conducting
interviews with potential candidates, and the Committee and Board
are aware of, and support, the principles set out in section A.4 of the
Combined Code relating to appointments to the Board.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE
K J Minton (Chairman), J Nicol, D D S Robertson, M F Wallach.
The Health, Safety and Environment Committee meets at least
three times a year. The Committee is chaired by an independent non-
executive Director and its membership also includes the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer. Its principal role is to determine, on behalf of the
Board, the framework or broad policy and objectives in the areas of
health, safety and the environment (“HSE”) and propose any
amendments to existing policies for approval by the Board. It also
reviews management’s performance in the achievement of HSE
objectives and reviews HSE reports produced by business units for
compliance with all local health, safety and environmental codes of
practice, legislation and relevant industry practice. 
More details of the work of the Health, Safety and Environment
Committee can be found in the Corporate Social Responsibility report
to shareholders on pages 20 to 27.
GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE
J Nicol (Chairman), K Lever, E H Lewzey, J E Middleton, N C Porter,
K A Sullivan, M T Swain, N P Wilkinson.
The General Purposes Committee meets as and when required. It
comprises executive Directors and senior executives and the quorum
requires the presence of at least one executive Director. The
Committee deals principally with day-to-day matters of a routine
nature and matters delegated to it by the Board.
DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE
D B Newlands (Chairman), J Nicol, K Lever.
During the year, the Board formed a Disclosure Committee for the
purpose of, inter alia, reviewing and approving for release all price-
sensitive information relating to the Company and compliance with
the Disclosure Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
4. BOARD, COMMITTEE AND CHAIRMAN EVALUATIONS
Under the direction of the Senior Independent Director, Sir Brian
Pitman, evaluations of the effectiveness of the Board, its Committees
and Chairman were conducted during the year. The evaluation
processes built on the experiences of the previous evaluations of the
Board and its Committees and concentrated on six key elements: 
(i) the optimum mix of skills and knowledge amongst the Directors; 
(ii) clarity of goals and processes; (iii) tailoring the evaluation to the
speciﬁc circumstances of Tomkins; (iv) the culture of candour that
encourages constructive evaluation; (v) regular reviews of assessment
criteria; and (vi) full disclosure of procedures and criteria to the Board.
BOARD AND COMMITTEE EVALUATION
The third Board performance evaluation took place during the year,
building on the experiences of the ﬁrst two years. The overall view of
Directors was that the Board functions well, supported by high quality
papers, presentations and reporting. Improvements in the
communication processes between Board meetings were suggested
to maintain the ongoing and high quality of debate within the Board.
On Board structure, Directors were conscious that care was needed
when replacing non-executive Directors, in order to maintain the
balance of skills and experience of the Board and this has been taken
into account in the recruitment of non-executive Directors during 
the year.
The second Board Committee performance evaluation reinforced
the positive messages that were highlighted in the ﬁrst evaluation.
The Committees were led by strong and experienced members who
were well informed. There were a small number of suggestions on
improving particular aspects of the work of a Committee, including
reporting by the Committee. Overall, there was satisfaction that the
Committees function well.
CHAIRMAN
For the evaluation of the Chairman this year, a more formal approach
was adopted which included completion of a questionnaire that
sought views across a broad range of the Chairman’s responsibilities.
The Directors were very positive about the role performed by the
Chairman and his leadership of the Board. A small number of
suggestions were made and these were discussed with the Chairman
by the Senior Independent Director, Sir Brian Pitman.
B. REMUNERATION
The Remuneration Committee report to shareholders can be found on
pages 50 to 55 and sets out the Company’s remuneration policy,
procedures and the remuneration of individual Directors and related
information.
60 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
C. ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
1. FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Board, through the Business, Operating and Financial reviews,
seeks to provide a detailed understanding of each business of the
Group. In conjunction with the Chairman’s statement, the Chief
Executive’s statement, the Operating and Financial Review and the 
Directors’ report, the Board seeks to present a balanced and
understandable assessment of the Company’s position and prospects.
2. INTERNAL CONTROL
Further information on the internal control environment within which
Tomkins operates may be found in the Directors’ statement on
internal control on pages 62 and 63.
3. GOING CONCERN
The Directors are conﬁdent, on the basis of current ﬁnancial
projections and facilities available, that the Company and the Group
have adequate ﬁnancial resources to continue in operation for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
4. “WHISTLEBLOWER” REPORTING PROCEDURES
Under section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all public
companies, including non-US public companies such as Tomkins,
acting through the Audit Committee of the Board, must provide a
procedure for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints
received by the Company regarding accounting, internal controls or
auditing matters. The Audit Committee and the Board have agreed a
procedure for the conﬁdential and anonymous submission by
employees of concerns regarding these matters.
D. RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company places a high degree of importance on maintaining
good relationships and communications with both institutional and
private investors and ensures that shareholders are kept informed of
signiﬁcant Company developments.
In order to assist members of the Board to gain an understanding
of the views of institutional shareholders, at each of its meetings the
Board receives an Investor Relations Report, which covers a wide
range of matters including a commentary on the perception of the
Company and views expressed by the investment community.
Analysts’ reports are also made available to all Directors. The
announcement of quarterly, half-year and full-year results provides
opportunities for the Company to answer questions from institutional
shareholders covering a wide range of topics. The Chairman, Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer, Finance Director and Senior Vice-President – Investor
Relations hold a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders to
ensure the mutual understanding of objectives. Regular reports are
made to non-executive Directors by the Chairman, Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer and Finance Director of the key points to emerge from
meetings they have had with substantial shareholders. The Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer participates in industry conferences organised by
investment banks, which are attended by existing and potential
shareholders, and he holds regular meetings with analysts and
institutional shareholders. The Company exercises care to ensure that
all price-sensitive information is released to all shareholders at the
same time, as required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority and Regulation FD in the US.
The Company’s website provides shareholders and potential
investors with information about the Company, including annual and
interim reports, recent announcements, investor presentations, share
price information, Group policies and the terms of reference of its
Board Committees. Shareholders are also able to put questions to the
Company via its website.
The Company aims to deal expeditiously with all enquiries from
shareholders on a wide range of matters. Shareholders also have the
opportunity to attend the Annual General Meeting to put questions
to the Chairman and to the chairmen of Board Committees. The
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer gives a presentation to shareholders covering a
wide range of matters affecting the Company and its business and
shareholders have the opportunity to ask him questions. The
Company indicates the level of proxy votes lodged in respect of each
resolution proposed at its Annual General Meeting following each
vote on a show of hands. In the event of a poll being called, the
result will be published as soon as possible after the conclusion of the
Annual General Meeting. Directors also meet informally with
shareholders before and after the meeting. The Company keeps
under review ways in which it can communicate more effectively with
its shareholders throughout the year, as well as at the Annual General
Meeting. 
It has been the Company’s practice to send the Notice of the
Annual General Meeting and related papers to shareholders at least
20 working days before the meeting and to propose separate
resolutions on each substantially separate issue.
INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDERS
The Board notes that Section 2 of the Combined Code seeks to
encourage more active participation by institutional shareholders
including entering into a dialogue with companies and making
considered use of their votes – principles which the Company
supports.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority require the Board
to report on compliance with the provisions contained in Section 1 of
the Combined Code. Tomkins considers that throughout the year to
31 December 2005 the Company has been in compliance with the
Code provisions set out in Section 1 of the July 2003 FRC Combined
Code on Corporate Governance, except for those matters indicated in
the Remuneration Committee Report.
The certiﬁcations of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Finance
Director required under section 302 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, and the related rules of the US Securities and Exchange
Commission, will be ﬁled as exhibits to the Company’s Form 20-F .
Pursuant to Section 303A, the Foreign Private Issuer Annual Written
Afﬁrmation was sent to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in
August 2005, afﬁrming without qualiﬁcation that Tomkins has
complied with the requirements laid down by the NYSE in respect of
Foreign Private Issuers. 
The Company has placed on its website a general summary of the
signiﬁcant ways in which the Company’s corporate governance differs
from that followed by domestic US companies under the NYSE’s
listing standards, as required by section 303A.11.
GOVERNANCE
61 GOVERNANCE
INTERNAL CONTROL
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
The Directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. To fulﬁl this
responsibility the Directors have established a Performance
Management framework within which each of the Group’s businesses
operates. Within this framework, the management of each of the
businesses considers strategic, operational, commercial and ﬁnancial
risks and identiﬁes risk mitigation actions. Whilst acknowledging the
overall responsibility for the system of internal control, the Directors
are aware that the system is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
During the period under review, the Directors were not aware
of any control breakdowns which resulted in a material loss to 
the Group. 
The Performance Management framework, which includes an
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the
signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group, has been in place throughout 
the ﬁnancial year and up to the approval date of the Directors’ Report
and Accounts. Each business unit’s management identiﬁes and
assesses the key business risks affecting the achievement of its
objectives. Business unit management also identiﬁes the risk
management processes used to mitigate the key risks to an
acceptable level and, where appropriate, additional actions required to
further manage and mitigate them. The risk summaries developed out
of this process are updated at least annually. In addition, Corporate
Centre management considers those risks to the Group’s strategic
objectives that may not be identiﬁed and managed at the business
unit level.
In connection with quarterly business reviews, relevant 
executives discuss risk management activities with Corporate Centre
management. The key risks and mitigation strategies are also
discussed at least annually with the Audit Committee as well as the
full Board.
The risk management processes described above are applied to
major decision-making processes such as acquisitions as well as
operational risks within the business including environmental, health
and safety.
The other key elements of the Performance Management
framework, which constitutes the control environment, are:
Business strategy reviews – each business is required to prepare 
a strategic position assessment taking into account the current and
likely future market environment and competitive position of the
business with speciﬁc consideration given to strategic risk. The
Corporate Centre management reviews the strategy with each
business and the Board is presented with a summary of the plans.
Business reviews – on a quarterly basis, Corporate Centre
management performs extensive reviews with each business. 
These reviews consider current and projected ﬁnancial and operating
results, and address the progress of key strategic and operating
initiatives, the risks affecting their achievement and the actions being
taken by business unit management to manage the risks and achieve
their objectives.
Financial plans – each business prepares ﬁnancial plans in
accordance with a deﬁned format, which includes consideration 
of risks. Management at the Corporate Centre reviews the ﬁnancial
plans with the business units and a summary is presented to the
Board for approval.
Balance sheet reviews – business unit and Corporate Centre
ﬁnancial management conduct periodic, on-site reviews of underlying
rationale and support for the signiﬁcant line item components
comprising the balance sheets for each business in the Group.
Investment project authorisation – all signiﬁcant investment
project expenditures are subject to a formal investment project
authorisation process, which takes into account, inter alia,
operational, ﬁnancial and technical risks. For signiﬁcant investment
projects, a post-investment analysis is completed to facilitate
continuous improvement in the investment planning process,
including risk identiﬁcation and mitigation.
Reporting, analysis and forecasts – all businesses are required 
to report monthly to the Corporate Centre on ﬁnancial performance.
Comparisons are made with plan, forecast and prior year and
signiﬁcant variances and changes in the business environment are
explained. Each business reassesses its forecast for the ﬁnancial year
on a monthly basis. Quarterly, each business prepares a forecast 
for the following eighteen months and reviews projections for the
current and following year.
Financial strategy – the ﬁnancial strategy includes assessment 
of the major ﬁnancial risks related to interest rate exposure, foreign
currency exposure, debt maturity and liquidity. There is a
comprehensive global insurance programme using the external
insurance market and some limited use of an internal captive
insurance company. Group Treasury manages hedging activities,
relating to ﬁnancial risks, with external cover for net currency
transaction exposures. The Group Tax function manages tax
compliance and tax risks associated with the Group’s activities. 
The Audit Committee, through the Finance Committee, oversees 
the ﬁnancial strategy as well as the tax strategy and considers the
associated risks and risk management techniques being used by 
the Group.
Reporting certiﬁcations – in connection with the preparation of 
the annual and quarterly ﬁnancial statements, senior business general
management and ﬁnancial management sign a certiﬁcate which
includes a declaration regarding the existence of internal controls, 
the proper recording of transactions and the identiﬁcation and
evaluation of signiﬁcant business risks. These certiﬁcations were
expanded to encompass Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
of 2002 (the “Act”) in support of statements required to be made 
by Tomkins’ Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Finance Director. See further
discussion of Sarbanes-Oxley below.
Sarbanes-Oxley – as a foreign private issuer (FPI) listed on the 
NYSE in the US, the Group is subject to the provisions of the Act. 
In particular, Section 404 of the Act requires certiﬁcations by
management regarding the effectiveness of internal controls over
ﬁnancial reporting and requires the independent auditors to express
an opinion on the Board’s assertions regarding such internal controls.
Accordingly, the Group has undertaken a project to ensure Tomkins 
is in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Act by
31 December 2006 (the effective date for the Group as a FPI). While
the certiﬁcation and external audit opinion on internal controls over
ﬁnancial reporting will be reported in Tomkins’ US SEC ﬁlings, the
results of Tomkins’ compliance with the Act will serve to further
strengthen the internal control framework for the Group. 
The Group has an established internal audit function; the Vice
President – Business Risk Assurance directs the activities of the internal
auditors on a day-to-day basis and reports directly to the Audit
Committee of the Board at least four times a year. Due to the
importance and signiﬁcance of the effort required to achieve
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, during the ﬁrst half of 2005, the Board
directed substantially all internal audit resources towards supporting
62 TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
the Sarbanes-Oxley project described above. Internal audit’s support
primarily assisted management in completing controls documentation,
assessing design effectiveness and developing test plans. Internal
audit’s support is expected to continue in 2006 but will shift to testing
the operating effectiveness of controls in higher risk areas 
and providing the Board with assurance over management’s testing
process in other risk areas. However, with the Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance extension for FPIs to 31 December 2006, the majority 
of internal audit resources were re-deployed to perform internal 
audit reviews in areas other than ﬁnancial reporting controls for the
last half of 2005.
The Directors conﬁrm that the effectiveness of the system of
internal control for the year ended 31 December 2005 has been
reviewed in line with the criteria set out in the guidance for directors
in the Combined Code.

The Directors are required by law to prepare consolidated financial 
statements of Tomkins plc and its subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985, International Financial Reporting 
Standards and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The Directors are required to ensure that the Group’s financial statements 
present fairly for each financial year the Group’s financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows which requires the faithful representation of the 
effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definition and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for 
the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements”.  
In preparing the Group’s financial statements, the Directors are required 
properly to select and apply accounting policies, present information, 
including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information, and provide additional 
disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
Group’s financial position and financial performance. 
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Company keeps proper 
accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and which enable them to ensure that the 
Group’s financial statements comply with applicable law.  
The Directors are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
hence for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a Directors’ 
report and Directors’ remuneration report which comply with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 1985. 
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
financial information contained on the corporate website, www.tomkins.co.uk. 
The work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these 
matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes 
that may have occurred to the Group’s financial statements since they were 
initially presented on the website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT  
 
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 
65
GROUP – IFRS 
TO THE MEMBERS OF TOMKINS PLC 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Tomkins plc and its 
subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2005 
(“the Group’s financial statements”) which comprise the consolidated 
income statement, consolidated cash flow statement, consolidated balance 
sheet, consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, the 
reconciliation of changes in consolidated shareholders’ equity, the related 
notes 1 to 45 and the information on pages 108 to 121. These financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies 
set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Remuneration 
Committee’s report that is described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the individual financial statements of 
Tomkins plc for the year ended 31 December 2005. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and  
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and  
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Committee report and the Group financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted in the European Union are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group’s financial statements and the part  
of the Remuneration Committee report described as having been audited in 
accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group’s financial statements 
give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting 
framework and whether the Group financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Committee report described as having been audited have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We report to you if, in our opinion, the 
Directors’ report is not consistent with the Group’s financial statements.  
We also report to you if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law 
regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions with the  
Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed. 
We report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not complied with any 
of the four directors’ remuneration disclosure requirements specified for our 
review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. These comprise 
the amount of each element of the remuneration package and information 
on share options, details of long-term incentive schemes, and money 
purchase and defined benefit pension schemes. We give a statement,  
to the extent possible, of details of any non-compliance. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined 
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider 
whether the Board’s statement on internal control covers all risks and 
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read the Directors’ report and the other information contained in  
the Annual Report for the above year as described in the contents section 
including the unaudited part of the Remuneration Committee report and  
we consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent mis-statements or material inconsistencies with the Group’s  
financial statements.  
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the Group’s financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Committee report described as having been audited. It also 
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made  
by the Directors in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements,  
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information  
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group’s financial 
statements and the part of the Remuneration Committee report described as 
having been audited are free from material mis-statement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
Group financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Committee 
report described as having been audited. 
OPINION 
In our opinion, the Group financial statements give a true and fair view,  
in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union, of the 
state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of its profit for the 
year then ended, and the Group financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Committee report described as having been audited have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
A. BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The consolidated financial statements on pages 66 to 107 and the related 
information on pages 108 to 123 have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted for use in the 
European Union and, except as described under the heading “Financial 
instruments”, under the historical cost convention. 
B. FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IFRS 
The Group adopted IFRS with a transition date of 4 January 2004. 
Accordingly, the Group’s consolidated balance sheet as at 1 January 2005 
and its consolidated income statement and consolidated cash flow statement 
for the year then ended that were previously reported in accordance with 
United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles (“UK GAAP”) have 
been restated in accordance with IFRS on the basis of the accounting polices 
described below.  
An explanation of the transition to IFRS and an analysis of the significant 
differences between UK GAAP and IFRS that were relevant to the Group  
and of their effect on the Group’s reported financial position as at  
3 January 2004 and 1 January 2005 and its results and cash flows for the 
year ended 1 January 2005 is presented on pages 108 to 123.  
C. ADOPTION OF IAS 32 & IAS 39 
The Group adopted IAS 32 ”Financial Instruments: Disclosure and 
Presentation” and IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement” prospectively from 2 January 2005. Accordingly, comparative 
information as at 1 January 2005 and for the year then ended has not been 
restated to reflect the adoption of these accounting standards. 
On adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the Group recognised an increase in net 
debt of £271.7 million and an increase in shareholders’ equity of  
£63.1 million that may be analysed as follows: 
 £ million 
Convertible cumulative preference shares 273.6 
Fair valuation of derivative financial instruments (6.0)
Hedging accounting adjustment to borrowings 5.7 
Net interest accrual reclassified from payables  
and receivables (1.6)
Increase in net debt 271.7 
 
Convertible cumulative preference shares 63.6 
Fair valuation of available-for-sale investments  0.4 
Fair valuation of derivative financial instruments  7.5 
Hedge accounting adjustment to borrowings (5.7)
Tax on the above (2.6)
 63.2 
Minority interest in the above (0.1)
Increase in shareholders’ equity 63.1 
An explanation of the effect of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 is presented 
below under the heading “Financial instruments”.  
D. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash flows and 
assets and liabilities of Tomkins plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(together, “the Group”), and the Group’s share of the results and net assets 
of its associates.  
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the 
Company, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of the entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities. The results  
of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the Group’s  
results from the effective date of acquisition. The results of a subsidiary sold 
during the period are included in the Group’s results up to the effective date 
of disposal.  
Where accumulated losses applicable to a minority interest in a subsidiary 
exceed the minority’s interest in the equity of the subsidiary, the excess is 
allocated to the Group’s interest in the subsidiary, except to the extent that 
the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional 
investment to cover its share of the accumulated losses. 
Intra-Group transactions and balances, and any unrealised gains and losses 
arising from intra-Group transactions, are eliminated on consolidation.  
E. ASSOCIATES 
An associate is an entity over which the Company, either directly or 
indirectly, is in a position to exercise significant influence by participating in, 
but not controlling or jointly controlling, the financial and operating policies 
of the entity. Associates are accounted for using the equity method. Losses 
of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in the associate are not 
recognised, except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations on 
behalf of the associate. Profits and losses recognised by the Company or its 
subsidiaries on transactions with an associate are eliminated to the extent of 
the Group’s interest in the associate concerned.  
F. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are  
translated into the entity’s functional currency at the exchange rate ruling  
on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated  
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the 
balance sheet date. Currency translation differences are recognised in the 
income statement. 
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into Sterling 
at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are 
translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet 
date. Currency translation differences are recognised directly in equity in the 
currency translation reserve.  
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal 
recognised in the income statement is determined after taking into account 
the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the 
operation. On adoption of IFRS, the Group elected to deem cumulative 
currency translation differences to be £nil as at 4 January 2004. Accordingly, 
the gain or loss recognised on disposal of a foreign operation does not 
include currency translation differences that arose before 4 January 2004.  
In the cash flow statement, the cash flows of foreign operations are 
translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate for the period. 
G. REVENUE  
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the invoiced amount net of 
returns, early settlement discounts, rebates and sales taxes and is recognised 
only where there is persuasive evidence of a sales agreement, the delivery of 
goods has occurred, the sale price is fixed or determinable and the 
collectability of revenue is reasonably assured.  
Revenue from long-term contracts is recognised by the percentage-of-
completion method determined by comparing contract costs incurred  
for work performed to date to estimated total contract costs. Losses on 
contracts, if any, are recognised in the period when such losses become 
probable and can be reasonably estimated. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis using the effective interest method. 
H. GOODWILL 
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. 
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates and 
represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition. Goodwill in 
respect of an acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset. 
Goodwill in respect of an acquired associate is included within investments  
in associates. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested at least annually for 
impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.  
Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entity’s assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is 
recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

GROUP – IFRS 
1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
On adoption of IFRS, the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 ”Business 
Combinations” to business combinations that were recognised before  
4 January 2004. As a result, the carrying amount of goodwill recognised as 
an asset under UK GAAP was brought forward unadjusted as the cost of 
goodwill recognised under IFRS as at 4 January 2004 and goodwill that was 
written-off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not taken into account in 
determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after  
4 January 2004.  
I. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation  
and any recognised impairment losses. All intangible assets recognised  
by the Group are considered to have finite useful lives. 
(I) ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as 
an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from 
contractual or legal rights. An acquired intangible asset is amortised on a 
straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which represents its fair value at 
the date of acquisition, to the income statement over its expected useful life. 
(II) PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS  
All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period  
in which it is incurred.  
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period 
in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new or 
significantly improved product and it is incurred after the technical feasibility 
of the product has been proven and customer orders have been received that 
are expected to provide income sufficient to cover the further development 
expenditure that will be incurred prior to the product going into full 
production. Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight-
line basis such that it is charged to the income statement over the expected 
life of the resulting product. 
Development expenditure incurred before 4 January 2004 was not 
capitalised retrospectively because the conditions specified within IAS 38 
“Intangible Assets” were not met. 
(III) COMPUTER SOFTWARE 
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and 
equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset. Amortisation is 
provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost of the software to 
the income statement over its expected useful life, which is in the range 
three to five years. 
J. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any recognised impairment losses. Freehold land and assets under 
construction are not depreciated. Depreciation of property, plant and 
equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is 
generally provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the depreciable 
amount to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset 
concerned, which is in the following ranges: 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings 10 to 50 years 
Short leasehold land and buildings Length of lease 
Plant, equipment and vehicles 2 to 20 years 
Borrowing costs attributable to assets under construction are charged to the 
income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
K. LEASES 
Leases that confer rights and obligations similar to those that attach to 
owned assets are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified  
as operating leases.  
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and 
equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value 
of the minimum lease payments, and a corresponding liability is recognised 
within obligations under finance leases. Subsequently, the assets are 
depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or over the term of 
the lease, if shorter. At inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned 
between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a constant 
periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability. Thereafter, the interest 
element is recognised as an expense in the income statement while the capital 
element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability.  
Operating lease rentals, and any incentives receivable, are recognised in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
L. IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS  
Non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired. Additionally, goodwill 
and capitalised development expenditure relating to a product that is not yet in 
full production are subject to an annual impairment test. 
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an asset’s carrying  
value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the 
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. An asset’s value in use 
represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived 
from the asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount 
of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash-
generating unit to which it belongs. Similarly, the recoverable amount of 
goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash flows of 
the cash-generating units to which it is allocated. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment  
losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are 
reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the carrying amount 
of the asset does not exceed its carrying amount had no impairment loss 
been recognised in previous periods. Impairment losses recognised in respect 
of goodwill are not reversed.  
M. INVENTORIES 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value,  
with due allowance for any excess, obsolete or slow moving items. Cost 
represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing 
location and condition, which may include the cost of raw materials, direct 
labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads. Cost is 
generally determined on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. 
From time to time, the Group enters into forward purchase contracts to fix 
the price of commodities purchased for use in its manufacturing operations. 
As used by the Group, such derivative contracts do not fall within the scope 
of IAS39 and they are therefore not recognised as assets or liabilities on the 
balance sheet. 
N. GRANTS 
Grants received relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as 
deferred income and recognised as income in equal instalments over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned. Other grants received are 
recognised as income on a systematic basis so as to match them with the 
costs they are intended to compensate or, if those costs have already been 
recognised, the grants are recognised as income in the period in which they 
are received. 
O. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on 
demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on 
acquisition of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are 
presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset 
with cash balances. 
P. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
(I) INVESTMENTS 
Prior to 2 January 2005, listed investments were stated at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. From 2 January 2005 onwards, these investments 
are classified as available-for-sale and are measured at fair value. Changes in 
their fair values are recognised in a separate component of equity except to 
the extent that they represent an other than temporary impairment in which 
case the impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. Realised 
gains and losses are transferred from equity to the income statement in the 
event of the disposal of the investments.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
(II) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency 
swaps, forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps, to reduce 
its exposure to exchange rate and interest rate movements. The Group does 
not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Prior to 
2 January 2005, such derivative contracts were not generally recognised  
as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and gains and losses arising  
on them were not recognised until the hedged item was itself recognised  
in the financial statements.  
From 2 January 2005 onwards, derivative financial instruments are 
recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance 
sheet date. Changes in their fair values are recognised in the income 
statement and this is likely to cause volatility in situations where the carrying 
value of the hedged item is either not adjusted to reflect fair value changes 
arising from the hedged risk or is so adjusted but that adjustment is not 
recognised in the income statement. Provided the conditions specified by 
IAS 39 are met, hedge accounting may be used to mitigate this volatility.  
The Group does not generally apply hedge accounting to transactional 
foreign currency hedging relationships, such as hedges of forecast or 
committed transactions. It does, however, apply hedge accounting to 
translational foreign currency hedging relationships and to hedges of its 
interest rate exposures where it is permissible to do so under IAS 39. When 
hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified  
as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or, in the case of a hedge of the 
Group’s net investment in a foreign operation, a net investment hedge. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the 
carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted by the increase  
or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting 
gain or loss is recognised in the income statement where, to the extent  
that the hedge is effective, it offsets the change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net 
investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair 
value of the hedging instrument are recognised directly in equity rather than 
in the income statement. When the hedged item in a cash flow hedge is 
recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses 
recognised in equity are either recycled to the income statement or, if the 
hedged item results in a non-financial asset, are recognised as adjustments to 
its initial carrying amount. Accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity 
in relation to a net investment hedge are recycled to the income statement 
on disposal of the foreign operation.  
Derivative financial instruments are classified as current assets or liabilities 
unless they qualify for hedge accounting under IAS39 and the hedged item  
is classified as a non-current asset or liability. 
(III) EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES 
Prior to 2 January 2005, embedded derivatives were not recognised in the 
financial statements. From 2 January 2005 onwards, derivatives embedded in 
non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial 
instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to 
those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value 
with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement. 
(IV) PREFERENCE SHARES 
In July 1996, the Company issued US dollar denominated 5.56%  
Convertible cumulative preference shares (“the Preference shares”). Prior  
to 2 January 2005, the Preference shares were classified as non-equity 
shareholders’ funds and were translated into Sterling at the exchange rate 
ruling at their date of issue. Dividends payable on the Preference shares were 
dealt with as an appropriation of profit.  
From 2 January 2005 onwards, the Preference shares are classified as non-
current liabilities and are retranslated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling 
at the balance sheet date. Dividends payable on the Preference shares are 
included within interest payable. 
(V) OWN SHARES 
Own shares represent the Company’s ordinary shares that are held by  
the Company, its subsidiaries and sponsored ESOP trusts in relation to the 
Group’s employee share schemes. Own shares are deducted at cost in 
arriving at shareholders’ equity and gains and losses on their sale or transfer 
are recognised directly in equity. 
Q. POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to employees 
throughout the world and other benefits, mainly healthcare, provided to 
certain employees in North America. 
For defined contribution plans, the cost of providing the benefits represents 
the Group’s contributions to the plans and is recognised in the income 
statement in the period in which the contributions fall due. 
For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing the benefits is determined 
based on actuarial valuations of each of the plans that are carried out 
annually at the Group’s balance sheet date by independent qualified 
actuaries. Plan assets (if any) are measured at their fair values at the  
balance sheet date. Benefit obligations are measured using the projected  
unit credit method. 
The cost of defined benefit plans recognised in the income statement 
comprises the net total of the current service cost, the past service cost,  
the expected return on plan assets, the interest cost and the effect of 
curtailments and settlements. The current service cost represents the increase 
in the present value of the plan liabilities expected to arise from employee 
service in the current period. Past service costs resulting from enhanced 
benefits are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, or immediately if the benefits have vested. The expected 
return on plan assets is based on market expectations, at the beginning of 
the period, for returns over the life of the benefit obligation. The interest cost 
represents the increase in the benefit obligation due to the passage of time. 
The discount rate used is determined by reference to market yields on high 
quality corporate bonds, where available, or government bonds at the 
balance sheet date. Gains and losses on curtailments or settlements are 
recognised in the income statement in the period in which the curtailment  
or settlement occurs.  
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected 
and actual returns on the plan assets and the effect of changes in actuarial 
assumptions, are recognised in the statement of recognised income and 
expense in the period in which they occur.  
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet 
comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date, minus any past service costs not yet 
recognised, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance 
sheet date. Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the 
amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any 
amounts that the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction 
in future contributions. 
R. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVES 
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s share 
option, bonus and other share award schemes. The Group recognises a 
compensation expense in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair 
value of the awards, where appropriate measured using an option-pricing 
model. For equity-settled awards, the fair value is determined at the date of 
grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which 
the award was granted are modified. For cash-settled awards, the fair value 
is determined at the date of grant and is re-measured at each balance sheet 
date until the liability is settled. Generally, the compensation expense is 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are 
made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due 
to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.  
In accordance with IFRS 1“First-time Adoption of IFRS”, the Group has not 
applied this policy to equity-settled awards that were granted on or before  
7 November 2002.

GROUP – IFRS 
1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
S. PROVISIONS 
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount and is recognised 
when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that payment will be made to settle the obligation and the payment 
can be estimated reliably. 
Provisions for warranty claims are recognised when the relevant products are 
sold, based on historical experience of the nature, frequency and average 
cost of warranty claims.  
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when a detailed formal  
plan for the restructuring has been determined and the plan has been 
communicated to the affected parties. Gains from the expected disposal  
of assets are not taken into account in measuring these provisions and 
provision is not made for future operating losses. 
Provision is made for workers’ compensation that represents the best 
estimate of the liability outstanding on claims for compensation for injuries 
sustained by employees while at work. It includes estimates of (a) the 
remaining payout due on claims already made and (b) the liability for 
incidents that have occurred, but as yet have not yet been reported to the 
Group. The Group’s liability for claims already made, but not fully settled,  
is calculated on an actuarial basis by a third party administrator. Historical 
data trends are used to estimate the liability for unreported claims. 
T. TAXATION 
Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the 
taxable profit or loss for the period. Taxable profit differs from accounting 
profit because it excludes items of income or expense recognised for 
accounting purposes that are either not taxable or deductible for tax 
purposes or are taxable or deductible in other periods. Current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted  
at the balance sheet date. 
The Group recognises provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions 
whereby additional current tax may become payable in future periods 
following the audit by the tax authorities of previously filed tax returns. 
Provisions for uncertain tax positions are based upon management’s 
assessment of the likely outcome of issues associated with assumed 
permanent differences, interest that may be applied to temporary 
differences, the possible disallowance of tax credits and penalties, and  
are classified as non-current liabilities. Provisions for uncertain tax positions 
are reviewed regularly and are adjusted to reflect events such as the expiry  
of limitation periods for assessing tax, administrative guidance given by the 
tax authorities and court decisions.  
Deferred tax is tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amount of an asset or a liability and its tax base used  
in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax is accounted for using the 
liability method, whereby deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the  
initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction other  
than a business combination that affects neither accounting profit nor 
taxable profit.  
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in 
foreign subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control 
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates that are expected to apply  
in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a  
net basis. 
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement unless it 
relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised 
directly in equity. 
U. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  
The Group applied IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations” to assets and related liabilities that met the criteria 
to be classified as held for sale, and operations that met the criteria to be 
classified as discontinued on or after 4 January 2004. 
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered 
by sale rather than by continuing use in the business. For this to be the case, 
the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, 
management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the 
asset which, when initiated, was expected to result in a completed sale 
within twelve months. An extension of the period required to complete  
the sale does not preclude the asset from being classified as held for sale, 
provided the delay was for reasons beyond the Group’s control and 
management remains committed to its plan to sell the asset. Assets that are 
classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell. 
A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has either been 
disposed of, or satisfies the criteria to be classified as held for sale, and 
represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of 
operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate 
major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary 
acquired exclusively with a view to disposal. 
V. DIVIDENDS ON ORDINARY SHARES 
Dividends payable on ordinary shares are recognised in the financial 
statements when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer 
at the Company’s discretion. Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised 
when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are 
declared following approval by shareholders at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting. Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as an 
appropriation of shareholders’ equity. 
W. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
When applying the Group’s accounting polices, management must make 
assumptions and estimates concerning the future that affect the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, the disclosure  
of contingencies that existed at the balance sheet date and the amounts  
of revenue and expenses recognised during the accounting period. Such 
assumptions and estimates are based on factors such as historical experience, 
the observance of trends in the industries in which the Group operates and 
information available from the Group’s customers and other outside sources.  
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, 
actual outcomes could differ from those assumptions and estimates. An 
analysis of the key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet  
date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of the Group’s assets and liabilities within the next financial year is 
provided in the Operating and Financial Review. 
X. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED 
In August 2005, the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) 
issued IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” that consolidates and 
augments the disclosure requirements concerning financial instruments that 
are at present contained in several international accounting standards. At the 
same time, the IASB issued “Amendment to IAS 1 – Capital Disclosures” that 
introduces a requirement for entities to provide disclosures concerning what 
they regard as their capital.  
Until recently, neither pronouncement had been endorsed for use within  
the EU and neither is mandatory until accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2007. The Group will consider the early adoption of these 
pronouncements during 2006. As they deal only with disclosures, the 
adoption of these pronouncements will have no effect on the Group’s results 
or financial position.

2.  SEGMENT INFORMATION  
A. BACKGROUND 
The Group determines its reportable segments based on the structure of the internal financial reports that are used by senior management for decision-making 
purposes and its primary segment reporting format is by business segment. 
With effect from 2 January 2005, the Group was reorganised for management reporting purposes into two business groups: Industrial & Automotive and 
Building Products.  
Industrial & Automotive manufactures a wide range of systems and components for car, truck and industrial equipment manufacturing markets, and industrial 
and automotive aftermarkets throughout the world through five business segments: Power Transmission, Fluid Power, Wiper Systems, Fluid Systems and Other 
Industrial & Automotive.  
Building Products comprises two business segments: Air Systems Components and Other Building Products. Air Systems Components supplies the industrial 
and residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning market mainly in North America. Other Building Products manufactures a variety of products for the 
building and construction industries mainly in North America. 
Segment information about the Group’s continuing operations is presented below. Segment information about the Group’s discontinued operations is 
presented in note 8.  
Segment information about the Group’s associates is presented in note 18.

Restructuring costs recognised during 2005 primarily related to the closure of Stackpole’s PCD facility, the transfer of the manufacturing of the Wiper Systems 
facility in Pontypool to more cost competitive locations and the rationalisation of production facilities at Air Systems Components. Restructuring costs 
recognised during 2004 primarily related to the rationalisation of manufacturing capacity within North America and the relocation of wiper blade production.

During 2005, there was a release of provisions for uncertain tax positions of £58.7 million following the successful resolution of an outstanding tax issue in  
the United States, the expiry of time during which tax audits could be performed in certain tax jurisdictions and the change of views on the likely outcome  
of challenges by various tax authorities. During 2004, there was a similar release of £15.0 million. 
Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”) in the United States, the Group had the opportunity to benefit from a one-time repatriation of  
cash to the United States at a reduced tax rate. During 2005, the Group repatriated £41.8 million to the United States under the AJCA on which it incurred  
a tax charge of £2.1 million.

11. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of the 
Company’s ordinary shares in issue during the period. The weighted average number of the Company’s ordinary shares in issue during the period excludes 
2,888,908 shares (2004 – 2,949,225 shares), being the weighted average number of own shares held during the period.  
Diluted earnings per share takes into account the dilutive effect of options and awards outstanding under the Group’s employee share schemes and the 
dilutive effect of the potential conversion of the Company’s convertible cumulative preference shares into the Company’s ordinary shares. The weighted 
average number of the Company’s ordinary shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of options and awards over 
2,549,390 shares (2004 – 2,538,070 shares) that were anti-dilutive for the periods presented but could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future.

Total fees 5.3 4.2 
During 2005, the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 in the United States enabled the Group to take advantage of a number of tax benefits. After a detailed 
review and, in some cases, a tender process, it was decided that Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) was the preferred firm to engage on a number of projects 
to ensure that the Group maximised the benefits available, largely because of the efficiencies that were expected to arise from the detailed knowledge Deloitte 
has of the Group. 
Audit related regulatory services include the review of the interim financial statements and the audit of the US GAAP financial statements included in the  
Form 20-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US. Further assurance services include advice on accounting matters and non-regulatory 
reporting and include £0.3 million (2004 – £0.1 million) in relation to the transition to IFRS. 
Fees relating to further assurance services or to tax advisory services must be reported to the Audit Committee and approved by the Chairman of the  
Audit Committee.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are determined from value in use calculations in which the 
principal assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs. Management uses discount 
rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the relevant cash generating units. Growth rates are based on 
industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market in which the 
cash generating units operate.  
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash 
flows for the following seven years based on estimated growth rates that do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. 
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows resulting from these projections was 8.5% (2004 – 9.0%).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

GROUP – IFRS 
TO THE MEMBERS OF TOMKINS PLC 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Tomkins plc and its 
subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2005 
(“the Group’s financial statements”) which comprise the consolidated 
income statement, consolidated cash flow statement, consolidated balance 
sheet, consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, the 
reconciliation of changes in consolidated shareholders’ equity, the related 
notes 1 to 45 and the information on pages 108 to 121. These financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies 
set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Remuneration 
Committee’s report that is described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the individual financial statements of 
Tomkins plc for the year ended 31 December 2005. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and  
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and  
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Committee report and the Group financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted in the European Union are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group’s financial statements and the part  
of the Remuneration Committee report described as having been audited in 
accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group’s financial statements 
give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting 
framework and whether the Group financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Committee report described as having been audited have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We report to you if, in our opinion, the 
Directors’ report is not consistent with the Group’s financial statements.  
We also report to you if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law 
regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions with the  
Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed. 
We report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not complied with any 
of the four directors’ remuneration disclosure requirements specified for our 
review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. These comprise 
the amount of each element of the remuneration package and information 
on share options, details of long-term incentive schemes, and money 
purchase and defined benefit pension schemes. We give a statement,  
to the extent possible, of details of any non-compliance. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined 
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider 
whether the Board’s statement on internal control covers all risks and 
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read the Directors’ report and the other information contained in  
the Annual Report for the above year as described in the contents section 
including the unaudited part of the Remuneration Committee report and  
we consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent mis-statements or material inconsistencies with the Group’s  
financial statements.  
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the Group’s financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Committee report described as having been audited. It also 
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made  
by the Directors in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements,  
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information  
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group’s financial 
statements and the part of the Remuneration Committee report described as 
having been audited are free from material mis-statement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
Group financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Committee 
report described as having been audited. 
OPINION 
In our opinion, the Group financial statements give a true and fair view,  
in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union, of the 
state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of its profit for the 
year then ended, and the Group financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Committee report described as having been audited have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

The Group has a significant concentration of customers in the United States of America, who accounted for 68.9 % (2004 – 67.5%) of the Group’s sales 
during the period, and in the industrial and automotive industry, which accounted for 72.2% (2004 – 73.4%) of the Group’s sales during the period. However, 
no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Group’s sales and there were no significant amounts due from any one customer. Trade receivables 
are stated net of an allowance of £7.9 million (1 January 2005 – £6.1 million) for doubtful accounts, estimated based on factors surrounding the credit risk of 
specific customers, historical trends, the influence of the current economic environment, and other information.  
Trade and other receivables are not generally interest bearing although interest may be charged to customers on overdue accounts. 
The Group is the beneficiary of a number of corporate-owned life assurance policies against which it borrows from the relevant life assurance company.  
As at 31 December 2005, the surrender value of the policies was £218.9 million (1 January 2005 – £175.7 million) and the amount outstanding on the  
related loans was £217.7 million (1 January 2005 – £174.8 million). For accounting purposes, these amounts are offset and the net receivable of £1.2 million  
(1 January 2005 – £0.9 million) is included in other receivables. 
Trade receivables with a carrying value of £2.6 million (1 January 2005 – £1.0 million) have been pledged as security for amounts outstanding under  
secured bank loans. 
 
21. LONG-TERM CONTRACTS 
Long-term contracts are entered into by a subsidiary that is engaged in the construction of automotive assembly lines and materials handling equipment.

UNSECURED LOAN NOTES 
The unsecured loan notes must be repaid, at par, on 30 June 2012. Until that time, in certain circumstances the noteholders have the right to require full or 
part repayment, at par, half yearly on 30 June and 31 December and for this reason they are classified as current liabilities. The unsecured loan notes bear 
interest at a fixed rate of 2.6%.

BORROWING FACILITIES 
As at 31 December 2005, the Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £280.1 million (1 January 2005 – £400 million) available under the multi-
currency revolving credit facility that expires on 8 August 2010. 
BORROWING COVENANTS 
The Group is subject to covenants, representations and warranties commonly associated with investment grade borrowings in respect of its committed 
borrowing facilities and borrowings under the Euro Medium Term Note Programme.  
The Group is subject to two financial covenants in respect of its committed borrowing facilities. The ratio of net debt to consolidated earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation must not exceed 2.5 times, and the ratio of consolidated operating profit to the consolidated net interest charge must not 
be less than 3.0 times. The financial covenants are calculated by applying “frozen” UK GAAP as at 31 December 2002 and are therefore unaffected by 
accounting changes associated with the transition to IFRS.

28. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
A. RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
The Group’s policy in relation to financial risk management is set out in detail in the Operating and Financial Review. 
The Group’s central treasury function is responsible for the procurement of the Group’s capital resources and for the maintenance of an efficient capital 
structure, together with the management of the Group’s liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rate exposures. All treasury operations are conducted within 
strict policies and guidelines that are approved by the Board. Compliance with those polices and guidelines is monitored by the regular reporting of treasury 
activities to the Board. A key element of the Group’s treasury philosophy is that funding, interest rate and currency decisions and the location of cash and debt 
balances are determined independently of each other. The Group’s borrowing requirements are met by raising funds in the most favourable markets, and the 
desired currency profile of net debt is achieved by entering into currency derivative contracts (typically forward currency contracts and currency swaps). The 
desired interest rate profile of net debt is achieved by entering into interest rate derivative contracts after taking into account any foreign currency derivatives 
that have been entered into to manage the currency profile of net debt. From time to time, the Group also enters into currency derivative contracts to manage 
currency transaction exposures.  
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.  
The Group ensures that its portfolio of derivative financial instruments is managed such that there is no significant concentration of credit risk in any one bank 
or other financial institution.

The Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 prospectively from 2 January 2005. Accordingly, comparative information as at 1 January 2005 has not been restated.  
B. CURRENCY DERIVATIVES 
As at 31 December 2005, the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts that are used to manage the currency profile of the 
Group’s net assets was £411.2 million (1 January 2005 – £368.9 million). During 2005, the Group designated all such contracts as net investment hedges  
and a net fair value loss of £35.6 million in relation to these contracts was recognised directly in reserves. 
Also during 2005, the Group designated the US dollar denominated convertible cumulative preference shares and US dollar denominated borrowings under 
the multi-currency revolving credit facility as net investment hedges and a net currency translation loss of £37.0 million arising on these instruments was 
recognised directly in reserves.  
During 2005, a net gain of £0.9 million was recognised within other finance income in respect of currency translation hedges that did not qualify for hedge 
accounting under IAS 39. Also during 2005, a net fair value gain of £0.4 million was recognised within profit from operations in respect of currency derivatives 
that were held to provide an economic hedge of transactional currency exposures but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. 
C. INTEREST RATE SWAPS 
Interest rate swaps are used to swap borrowings under the Group’s Euro Medium Term Note Programme from fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.  
As at 31 December 2005, the nominal value of the contracts outstanding was £400 million (1 January 2005 – £400 million). These contracts have been 
designated and are effective as fair value hedges in relation to the borrowings. As at 31 December 2005, an adjustment of £14.3 million was made to the 
carrying amount of the hedged borrowings to reflect the extent to which the swaps provided an effective hedge against fair value interest rate risk. 
Interest rate swaps are also used to restrict the amount of floating rate US dollar debt. As at 31 December 2005, the nominal value of these contracts held was 
US$420 million (1 January 2005 – US$ 210 million), including contracts with a nominal value of US$210 million that commence on the maturity of equivalent 
contracts that are currently in force in June 2006 and June 2008.  
During 2005, a net gain of £3.3 million was recognised within other finance income that represented changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that did 
not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.  
The profile of interest rate swaps held by the Group was as follows:

Available-for-sale investments held by the Group are listed investments and their fair value represents their quoted market value. 
Cash and cash equivalents and collateralised cash largely attract floating interest rates. Accordingly, their carrying amounts are considered to approximate to 
fair value.  
Borrowings classified as current liabilities mainly comprise overdrafts and loans that attract floating interest rates. Accordingly their carrying amount is 
considered to approximate to fair value. 
Borrowings classified as non-current liabilities principally comprise borrowings under the Group’s multi-currency revolving credit facility that attract floating 
interest rates, whose carrying amount is considered to approximate to fair value, and the listed bonds issued under the Group’s Euro Medium Term Note 
Programme, whose fair values represent their quoted market prices.  
Finance lease obligations attract fixed interest rates that are implicit in the lease rentals and their fair value has been assessed by reference to prevailing market 
interest rates. 
Interest rate derivatives are valued by discounting the applicable cash flows at prevailing market interest rates. 
Foreign currency derivatives are valued on a mark to market basis by reference to prevailing currency exchange rates. 
The Convertible cumulative preference shares are not traded in an organised market and their fair value has been assessed using a valuation model that takes 
into account prevailing market interest rates and the existence of the holders’ conversion option.

31. POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS 
A. BACKGROUND 
The Group operates pension plans throughout the world, covering the majority of its employees. The plans are structured to accord with local conditions and 
practices in each country and include defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.  
The Group provides defined contribution pension benefits in most of the countries in which it operates; in particular, the majority of Group’s employees  
in the United States of America are entitled to such benefits. The expense recognised in the income statement in respect of these plans represents the 
contributions payable by the Group for the period at rates that are specified in the rules of the plans. As at 31 December 2005, the Group had not paid over  
to the plans contributions due amounting to £7.4 million (1 January 2005 – £ 5.6 million). All amounts due for the period were paid over subsequent to the 
balance sheet date.  
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans in several countries; in particular, in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Generally, the 
pension benefits provided under these plans are based upon pensionable salary and the period of service of the individual employees. The assets of the plans 
are held separately from those of the Group in funds that are under the control of trustees. The defined benefit pension plans operated by the Group are 
closed to new entrants. In addition to the funded defined benefit pension plans, the Group has unfunded defined benefit obligations to certain employees.  
The Group also provides other post-employment benefits, principally health and life insurance cover, to certain of its employees in North America. These plans, 
which are unfunded, are defined benefit plans.  
B. SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL EFFECT 
An analysis of the effect of post-employment benefits on the Group’s results and financial position is set out below. The Group has adopted the amendments 
to IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” published in December 2004.

Plan assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.  
The return and risk expectations for each asset class incorporate assumptions about historical return relationships, current financial market conditions and the 
degree of global capital market integration. The assumptions used have been derived from rigorous historical performance analysis combined with forward 
looking views of the financial markets as revealed through (a) the yield on long-term bonds and (b) the price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices. 
The actuaries review analyses of historical risk and the correlation of the return on asset classes and apply subjective judgment based on their knowledge of the 
Groups plans. The result of this analysis is incorporated into a risk matrix from which expected long-term risk premiums for each asset class are developed. The 
nominal return expectations are determined by combining the asset class risk premiums with expected inflation and real risk-free rate assumptions. As a final 
consideration, the nominal return assumptions are blended with current market conditions to develop long-term equilibrium expectations. 
The actual return on plan assets was as follows:

32. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVES 
A. BACKGROUND 
The Company operates a number of share-based compensation arrangements to provide incentives to the Group’s senior management and other eligible 
employees. Details of the schemes in respect of which options and awards are outstanding are set out in the Remuneration Committee report on  
pages 50 to 55. 
B. SHARE OPTIONS 
Following a review by the Board in 2004, it was decided that the Company’s executive share option schemes would not be renewed when they lapsed for  
the purposes of new grants in May 2005. Accordingly, no new options were granted under these schemes during 2005. Options will continue to be granted 
from time to time under the Company’s savings-related share option scheme, which is restricted to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the  
United Kingdom.  
Options granted under the Company’s share option schemes are classified as equity-settled awards. The compensation expense recognised during the period  
in respect of share options was £3.9 million (2004 – £1.9 million).  
Changes in the total number of share options outstanding during the period were as follows:

Exercisable at the end of the period 5,079,142 250.35    4,374,594 265.15 
On the dates on which options were exercised during 2005, the weighted average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares was 276.04p per share 
(2004 – 268.69p per share).  
The compensation expense recognised in respect of share options is based on their fair value at the grant date calculated using the Black-Scholes option  
pricing model.  
Assumptions made in calculating the fair values of options granted during the period were as follows: 
 
 
Year ended 
31 December 
2005 
Year ended
1 January
2005 
Options granted  419,297  6,853,762  
Weighted average fair value 87.24p 70.18p 
 
Weighted average assumptions: 
– Share price  273.00p 250.33p 
– Exercise price 218.40p 239.05p 
– Expected volatility 30.46% 31.50% 
– Expected life 5.25 years 5.83 years 
– Risk free interest rate 3.84% 4.51% 
– Expected dividends 12.60p 12.00p 
Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares over the period since May 2001 
when, following a period of significant de-merger activity, the Group was re-focused on its remaining core businesses. Adjustments have been made to the 
expected life used in the model to reflect the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
The weighted average contractual life of share options outstanding at the end of the period was as follows:

32. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVES CONTINUED 
C. OTHER EQUITY-SETTLED AWARDS 
The Group’s principal share-based compensation arrangement is the Annual Bonus Incentive Plan (“ABIP”) which is restricted to the Group’s senior 
management and provides an award of bonus shares and deferred shares based on the profit of the business for which the participants have responsibility.  
During the period, awards were made over 1,415,047 ordinary shares (2004 – 1,310,424 ordinary shares) under the ABIP. Also during the period, matching 
awards were made over 11,320 ordinary shares (2004 – 11,369 ordinary shares) under the Share Matching Scheme (“SMS”) which is a legacy scheme that  
is closed to new entrants.  
The fair value of awards made under these schemes is measured based on the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of the award.  
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid 
during the expected life of the awards. The weighted average fair value of awards made during the period was 257.08p (2004 – 252.14p).  
Awards made under these schemes are classified as equity-settled awards. The compensation expense recognised during the period was £3.5 million  
(2004 – £2.5 million).  
D. CASH-SETTLED AWARDS 
The Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan was introduced for James Nicol as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company. Under this plan 
3,045,684 ordinary shares (“Matching Shares”) were awarded on 11 February 2002 following the purchase by Mr Nicol of 1,015,228 ordinary shares. After 
three years from 18 February 2002 (or earlier in certain circumstances), the award was to vest in respect of 1,015,228 Matching Shares and the remaining 
2,030,456 Matching Shares were to vest to the extent that, for every 1 penny the highest market price of the Company’s ordinary shares sustained over a  
five-day period during the six-month period ended 18 February 2005 exceeded 197 pence, being the market price on 18 February 2002, Mr Nicol was entitled 
to receive 5,153 shares. In the event, the market price achieved under the terms of the plan was 285.25 pence and of the 2,030,456 Matching Shares, 
454,752 vested and the balance lapsed. 
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Nicol was entitled to elect to receive a cash payment in lieu of shares and for this reason this plan was classified as a cash-
settled transaction. In the event, Mr Nicol elected to receive cash and was paid £4,193,000 (subject to statutory deductions) in settlement on 28 February 2005.  
As at 1 January 2005, the Group recognised a liability of £3.6 million. During the period, the Group recognised a compensation expense of £0.6 million  
(2004 – £1.3 million).

£44.0 million have expiry dates between 2006 and 2019. As at 31 December 2005, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of £15.3 million in respect of 
these losses. 
As at 31 December 2005, the Group had capital tax losses amounting to £286.3 million of which £285.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely and  
£0.6 million expire in 2009. As at 31 December 2005, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of £1.0 million in respect of these losses. 
As at 31 December 2005, the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to £1,948.9 million (1 January 2005 – £1,483.8 million). No income 
taxes have been provided on the Company's share of these undistributed earnings due to management's ability and intent to reinvest such amounts 
indefinitely. A determination of the amount of the unrecognised deferred tax liability has not been made because it is not practical to do so.

The Convertible cumulative preference shares (“the Preference shares”) were issued on terms that they could be converted at any time, at the shareholder’s 
option, into fully paid ordinary shares of 5p each in the Company on the basis of 9.77 ordinary shares for every one preference share so converted. At the date 
of issue, the conversion terms of the Preference shares were equivalent to a price of 334p per ordinary share.  
The Company has the option, at any time when the total amount of the Preference shares issued and outstanding is less than 10% of the amount originally 
issued and in any event on or after 29 July 2006, to redeem, in the first case, all but not some only and, in the second case, all or any of the Preference shares 
which remain issued and outstanding at that time.  
Until such time as the Preference shares are converted or redeemed, the holders of the Preference shares have a right to receive dividends at an annual rate of 
5.560 per cent in preference to the holders of the Company’s ordinary shares. As at 31 December 2005, the carrying value of the Preference shares included 
an accrued dividend payable of £2.1 million (1 January 2005 – £nil). 
The holders of the Preference shares are entitled to vote at a general meeting of the Company where, on a show of hands, each holder will have one vote and, 
on a poll, each holder will have one vote in respect of every seven fully paid ordinary shares to which the holder would be entitled on the full exercise of his 
conversion rights, except if two or more consecutive quarterly dividends are in arrears whereupon, on a poll, each holder shall have one vote in respect of every 
fully paid ordinary share to which the holder would be entitled on the full exercise of his conversion rights and such voting rights would continue until such 
time as any arrears of dividends have been paid in full. 
On a return of assets on liquidation or otherwise, other than on redemption or repurchase of the Preference shares, the assets of the Company available to 
shareholders will be applied first in repaying the capital paid up or credited as paid up in respect of the Preference shares together with all arrears and accruals 
of dividends to the holders of the Preference shares and any other classes of shares ranking pari passu as to capital with the Preference shares. 
 
 
40. ACQUISITIONS 
INDUSTRIAL & AUTOMOTIVE 
On 18 March 2005, the Group acquired L.E. Technologies, a recreational vehicle frame manufacturer, for cash consideration, including costs, of $80.0 million 
(£41.8 million). Goodwill of £26.4 million arising on the acquisition was capitalised which reflects that the acquisition provides the Group with an extended 
product range, enables Dexter Axle Company Inc. to pre-integrate its axles to vehicle frames and gives the opportunity for a number of synergies.  
In addition to goodwill, an intangible asset of £2.4 million has been recognised for customer relationships. 
On 1 July 2005, the Group acquired Eifeler Maschinenbau GmbH (“EMB”), a manufacturer of high-performance hydraulic tube fittings, adapters and 
accessories, for cash consideration, including costs, of €36.5 million (£24.6 million). Provisional Goodwill of £11.1 million arising on the acquisition was 
capitalised which is attributable to the value of EMB’s assembled workforce and its well established distribution network within Europe and Asia. In addition, 
there is opportunity for significant synergies from the sale of the Group’s existing products through EMB’s distribution network and from the ability to offer  
a broader range of product to the Group’s existing customer base.  
During 2005, additional goodwill of £0.8 million was recognised on the acquisition of certain businesses of Mectrol Corporation in December 2004. 
BUILDING PRODUCTS 
On 27 January 2005, the Group acquired Milcor Inc, a multi-brand manufacturer of building products, for cash consideration, including costs, of $42.9 million 
(£22.8 million). Goodwill of £14.1 million arising on the acquisition was capitalised which reflects the value of the enhancement of the Group’s position in the 
residential grilles, registers and diffusers market as a result of the acquisition, the strengthening of the Group’s ability to secure sales representation in several 
key markets and the provision of growth opportunities in the commercial products portion of the market. In addition, the acquisition provides immediate 
access to a Chinese manufacturing source and an opportunity for significant synergies.

40. ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED 
On 23 September 2005, the Group acquired NRG Industries Inc, a multi brand manufacturer of commercial building accessories, for cash consideration, 
including costs, of $25.1 million (£14.1 million). Provisional goodwill of £7.1 million arising on the acquisition was capitalised which reflects that the acquisition 
gave the Group access to fully developed products that could be marketed more broadly through Ruskin Company and Air Systems Components channels.  
In addition, the acquisition increased our presence in significant markets as well as providing opportunity for a number of manufacturing synergies. 
The businesses acquired during the period contributed £90.0 million to the Group’s revenue and £10.4 million to the Group’s profit for the period during  
the period between their respective dates of acquisition and the balance sheet date.  
In the event that these companies had been acquired on 2 January 2005, it is estimated that they would have contributed £129.3 million to the Group’s 
revenue for the period, but it is not practicable to estimate what their contribution to the Group’s profit for the period would have been on this assumption 
because balance sheets of these companies as at 2 January 2005 prepared in accordance with IFRS are not available. 
The net assets acquired in acquisitions recognised during the period, and the goodwill arising, were as follows:

flying hour, plus US$1,300 per day crew, plus US$1,800 per month to cover insurance costs. During the period, the Group recognised an expense of 
US$147,870 (2004 – US$145,705) in respect of these services. As at 31 December 2005, an amount of US$ 2,100 (1 January 2005 – US$1,700) due to IGC, 
LLC was included in trade payables. 
There are no further transactions or proposed transactions with related parties that are material to the Group or to a related party. 
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005  FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IFRS 
EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS  
 
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 
108 
A. ADOPTION OF IFRS 
The Group adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)  
with a transition date of 4 January 2004.  
Accordingly, the Group’s consolidated balance sheets as at 3 January 2004 
and 1 January 2005 and its consolidated income statement and consolidated 
cash flow statement for the year ended 1 January 2005 that were previously 
reported in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting 
principles (“UK GAAP”) have been restated in accordance with IFRS on the 
basis of Group’s accounting policies determined in accordance with IFRS that 
are described on pages 70 to 73.  
As a general rule, the Group applied those accounting policies fully 
retrospectively to determine its restated financial position as at  
3 January 2004 and 1 January 2005 and its results and cash flows for the 
year ended 1 January 2005. However, as described below, the Group used 
certain exemptions from the principle of full retrospective application 
permitted by IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of IFRS”. 
B. EXEMPTIONS FROM RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF IFRS 
(I)  GOODWILL 
The Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” to business 
combinations that were recognised on or before 3 January 2004. As a result, 
the carrying amount of goodwill recognised as an asset under UK GAAP was 
brought forward unadjusted as the cost of goodwill recognised under IFRS  
as at 3 January 2004 and goodwill that was written-off directly to reserves 
under UK GAAP is not taken into account in determining the gain or loss  
on the disposal of acquired businesses on or after 4 January 2004. 
(II) SHARE-BASED INCENTIVES 
The Group applied IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” retrospectively to all 
awards that were outstanding but had not vested as at 1 January 2005, 
except those equity-settled awards that were granted on or before  
7 November 2002.  
(III) CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION DIFFERENCES 
The Group elected to deem the cumulative currency translation differences 
on its net investment in foreign operations to be £nil as at 3 January 2004. 
Accordingly, the gain or loss recognised on the disposal of a foreign 
operation does not include currency translation differences that arose before 
4 January 2004. 
(IV) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Group elected to apply IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and 
Presentation” and IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement” prospectively from 2 January 2005. Accordingly, previously 
reported amounts as at 3 January 2004 and 1 January 2005 and for the year 
ended 1 January 2005 have not been restated to reflect the adoption of 
these accounting standards. 
C. SUMMARY OF ADJUSTMENTS BETWEEN UK GAAP AND IFRS 
A detailed analysis of the adjustments that were made to the comparative 
financial information is presented on pages 110 to 121 which shows the 
effect of differences between the Group’s accounting policies determined 
under UK GAAP and those determined under IFRS separately from the effect 
of presentational differences between UK GAAP and IFRS.  
In summary, the effect of adopting IFRS on the Group’s reported results and 
financial position was as follows:

consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS has been 
re-presented in the format specified by IAS 7 “Cash Flow Statements”. 
D. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES 
(I) GOODWILL 
Under UK GAAP, capitalised goodwill was amortised over its useful economic 
life. Under IFRS, this goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested at least 
annually for impairment. The impairment tests carried out by the Group in 
accordance with IFRS as at 3 January 2004 and as at 1 January 2005 
identified no impairment loss. 
Goodwill amortisation charged under UK GAAP during 2004 was 
£12.5 million and this amount is credited back to the income statement 
under IFRS. 
Under UK GAAP, the Group recognised goodwill of £18.6 million on  
the acquisition of certain businesses of the Mectrol Corporation in 2004. 
Under IFRS, the Group recognised goodwill of £18.5 million and allocated  
£0.1 million to identifiable intangible assets.  
In summary, the adjustments to the carrying amount of goodwill as at  
1 January 2005 were as follows: 
 £ million 
Carrying amount under UK GAAP  214.2 
Adjustments: 
– Reversal of amortisation 12.5 
– Allocation to acquired intangible assets (0.1)
– Currency translation differences (0.3)
Carrying amount under IFRS  226.3 
Under UK GAAP, goodwill written-off directly to reserves was recycled to  
the income statement on the disposal or impairment of a previously acquired 
business. Under IFRS, this goodwill is not recycled. Accordingly, goodwill  
of £13.1 million recycled to the income statement under UK GAAP on the 
disposal of Mayfran Corporation during 2004 has been reversed under IFRS.  
(II) COMPUTER SOFTWARE 
Under UK GAAP, all capitalised computer software was included within 
tangible fixed assets. Under IFRS, capitalised computer software must be 
presented as an intangible asset if it is not integral to an item of property, 
plant and equipment. As at 1 January 2005, non-integral computer software 
with a carrying amount of £4.5 million (3 January 2004 – £6.5 million) was 
transferred from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets. 
(III) SHARE-BASED INCENTIVES 
Under UK GAAP, the cost of awards made under the Group’s employee 
share schemes was based on the intrinsic value of the awards, with the 
exception of SAYE schemes for which no cost was recognised. Under  
IFRS, the cost of all employee share schemes is based on the fair value  
of the awards.  
As a result, the cost of employee share schemes recognised during 2004 
increased by £0.8 million under IFRS. As at 1 January 2005, an additional  FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IFRS

GROUP – IFRS 
liability of £1.5 million (3 January 2004 – £1.2 million) was recognised  
in respect of cash-settled awards.  
(IV) POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
Under UK GAAP, the cost of providing defined benefit pensions and  
post-retirement healthcare benefits was recognised on a systematic basis  
and surpluses and deficits arising were spread over the expected average 
remaining service lives of participating employees.  
Under IFRS, the cost of benefits accruing under defined benefit plans  
is recognised over the expected average remaining service lives of the 
participating employees, but the total cost recognised in each period is 
dependent on the change during the period in the recognised defined 
benefit liability or asset.  
Under UK GAAP, the cost of defined benefit plans was charged in arriving  
at operating profit. Under IFRS, the service cost, the past service cost and the 
effect of settlements and curtailments are included in profit from operations, 
the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost on the defined 
benefit obligation are included within net finance costs and actuarial gains 
and losses and the effect of the asset ceiling are recognised in the statement 
of recognised income and expense.  
As shown below, the total cost of defined benefit plans recognised under 
IFRS during 2004 was £28.0 million lower than that recognised under  
UK GAAP:

– Effect of the asset ceiling –  (0.1) (0.1)
Total cost of defined benefit plans 28.2  (28.0) 0.2 
During 2004, the charge to profit from operations under IFRS included a net 
credit of £4.8 million arising from settlements and curtailments and 
adjustments to past service costs.  
Shareholders’ equity as at 1 January 2005 was reduced by £101.5 million  
(3 January 2004 – £137.0 million) due to the recognition of the net defined 
benefit liability under IFRS.  
Accounting for defined contribution plans is unchanged under IFRS. 
(V) FUTURE OPERATING LOSSES 
Under UK GAAP, the Group provided for the expected future operating 
losses of operations that are to be sold or terminated. Under IFRS it is not 
permissible to provide for future operating losses. Accordingly, the provision 
for operating losses recognised under UK GAAP as at 3 January 2004 was 
reversed under IFRS and operating losses of £1.0 million incurred during 
2004, that were set against the provision established under UK GAAP, were 
charged to the income statement under IFRS. 
(VI) CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION DIFFERENCES 
Under UK GAAP, currency translation differences arising on the Group’s net 
investment in foreign operations were recognised in reserves and were not 
recycled to the income statement in the event of the disposal of a foreign 
operation. Under IFRS, cumulative currency translation differences arising on 
or after 4 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity 
and are taken into account in calculating the gain or loss on the disposal  
of a foreign operation. During 2004, cumulative currency translation losses 
of £0.9 million were taken into account in calculating the net gain on 
disposal of businesses recognised under IFRS. 
(VII) PROPOSED DIVIDENDS 
Under UK GAAP, proposed dividends on ordinary shares were recognised as 
a liability in the period to which they related. Under IFRS, interim dividends 
are not recognised until they are paid and final dividends are not recognised 
until they are declared following approval by shareholders at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting. Shareholders’ equity as at 1 January 2005 was 
increased by £60.0 million (3 January 2004 – £57.2 million) due to the 
reversal under IFRS of the liability for the proposed final dividend for the 
relevant period that was recognised under UK GAAP. 
(VIII) DEFERRED TAX 
Under UK GAAP, deferred tax was provided on timing differences  
between the accounting and taxable profit (an income statement approach). 
Under IFRS, deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between  
the book carrying value and tax base of assets and liabilities (a balance  
sheet approach).  
While the difference in the approach to determining taxable differences  
did not give rise to a significant adjustment, an adjustment was necessary in 
relation to the differing bases for recognising deferred tax assets. Under UK 
GAAP, a deferred tax asset was recognised where it was more likely than not 
that there were suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing difference could be deducted, and for this purpose the 
Group considered only the future periods for which forecasts are prepared. 
Under IFRS, the look forward period is not limited to the period for which 
forecasts are prepared. As a result, additional deferred tax assets amounting 
to £11.5 million were recognised as at 1 January 2005 (3 January 2004 – 
£13.6 million). 
As at 1 January 2005, additional deferred tax assets of £63.3 million  
(3 January 2004 – £54.0 million) and deferred tax liabilities of £26.4 million  
(3 January 2004 – £0.4 million) were recognised on the adjustments between 
UK GAAP and IFRS. 
E. PRESENTATIONAL CHANGES 
The restated financial information on pages 110 to 121 is presented in 
accordance with IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” and IFRS 5 
“Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”.  
A number of presentational changes have been made compared with  
UK GAAP, including the following that affect the Group’s reported profit 
from operations: 
• the results of discontinued operations are shown as a single line item 
below profit after tax; 
• items that were treated as non-operating exceptional items under UK 
GAAP and relate to continuing operations are included in arriving at profit 
from operations; and 
• the results (after interest and tax) of associates are shown as a single line 
item in arriving at profit from operations. 
The Group applied IFRS 5 to assets and related liabilities that met the criteria 
to be classified as held for sale, and operations that met the criteria to be 
classified as discontinued on or after 4 January 2004. 
Discontinued operations identified under IFRS as at 1 January 2005 
corresponded with those identified under UK GAAP and comprised the 
Group’s former Valves, Taps & Mixers businesses. 
F. USE OF ESTIMATES 
On transition to IFRS, estimates that had been made under UK GAAP  
as at 3 January 2004 and 1 January 2005 and were also required under  
IFRS were not revised. Where estimates were required under IFRS that  
were not required under UK GAAP, they were based on information  
known at the relevant balance sheet date and did not take into account 
subsequent events.

  RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO US GAAP 
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IFRS AND US GAAP  
 
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 
124 
A. BACKGROUND 
For the benefit of its US shareholders, in addition to its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”), the Group also presents its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting 
principles (“US GAAP”).  
IFRS differs from US GAAP in certain respects. An explanation of the significant differences that affect the Group’s reported results, cash flows and financial 
position is presented below, together with reconciliation statements that quantify the effect of those differences on the Group’s consolidated net income  
for the years ended 31 December 2005 (“2005”) and 1 January 2005 (“2004”) and its consolidated shareholders’ equity as at 31 December 2005 and  
1 January 2005.  
An explanation of the Group’s transition to IFRS is presented on pages 108 and 109. Under IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of IFRS” the Group was  
not required to restate its consolidated income statement for the year ended 3 January 2004 (“2003”) previously reported in accordance with United Kingdom 
generally accepted accounting principles (“UK GAAP”) in accordance with IFRS. Consequently, the reconciliation statements presented below do not include  
a reconciliation of the Group’s net income for 2003. 
B. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES 
(I) GOODWILL 
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, goodwill is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment. However, a significant difference exists between  
the carrying amounts of goodwill due largely to historical differences in the initial measurement and subsequent accounting for goodwill arising on  
past acquisitions.  
Under IFRS, the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” to business combinations that were recognised on or before 3 January 2004.  
As a result, the Group recognised goodwill amounting to £216.7 million as at 3 January 2004, which represented the carrying amount of goodwill that was 
recognised as an asset under UK GAAP on acquisitions completed on or after 3 May 1998. Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed before 3 May 1998 
amounting to £1,054.8 million was written off to reserves under UK GAAP and was not reinstated on adoption of IFRS.  
Under US GAAP, the carrying amount of goodwill as at 3 January 2004 was £953.4 million.  
As at 31 December 2005 and 1 January 2005, the difference between the carrying value of goodwill under IFRS and that under US GAAP represents the 
difference between the carrying values as at 3 January 2004 adjusted for the effect of subsequent currency exchange rate movements. 
(II) ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, an intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the 
acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights. However, a significant difference exists between the carrying amounts of acquired intangible assets 
due largely to the differing treatment of intangible resources acquired in past acquisitions.  
As a consequence of the decision not to apply IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” to business combinations that were recognised on or before 3 January 2004, 
intangible resources acquired in those business combinations are not recognised as intangible assets under IFRS.  
Under US GAAP, the carrying amount of acquired intangible assets as at 3 January 2004 was £22.8 million.  
As at 31 December 2005 and 1 January 2005, the difference between the carrying value of acquired intangible assets under IFRS and that under  
US GAAP represents the difference between the carrying values as at 3 January 2004 adjusted for the effect of subsequent amortisation and currency 
exchange rate movements. 
(III) PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS 
Under IFRS, certain product development costs are capitalised when the conditions specified by IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” are met. Capitalised development 
costs are amortised to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product. 
Under US GAAP, all product development costs are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
(IV) RESTRUCTURING COSTS 
Under IFRS, a restructuring plan is viewed as a whole and the related expenses are recognised when there exists an obligation to carry out the restructuring, 
which is generally when a detailed formal restructuring plan is announced. 
Under US GAAP, each component of a restructuring plan must be examined separately to determine when the related expenses may be recognised. 
Involuntary employee termination costs may be recognised when management has committed to a detailed termination plan and has communicated the plan 
to employees. Other restructuring expenses are generally recognised when they are incurred.  
(V) DISPOSAL OF OPERATIONS 
Differences between the gain or loss recognised on the disposal of an operation recognised under IFRS and that recognised under US GAAP arise principally 
because of differences in the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the operation. In addition, differences in the gain or loss may arise if the operation 
was previously acquired, due to differences in the carrying amount of goodwill recognised in respect of that operation (see “Goodwill” above) and/or, if the 
operation is a foreign operation, due to differences in the cumulative currency translation differences that are recycled to the income statement on disposal of 
the operation (see “Cumulative currency translation differences” below).  
(VI) CAPITALISATION OF INTEREST 
Under IFRS, the Group does not capitalise any element of its interest expense. Under US GAAP, interest expense attributable to the construction of major items 
of property, plant and equipment is capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the asset concerned.  
(VII) INVENTORY 
Under IFRS, inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is generally determined on a first in, first out (“FIFO”) basis. Use of the last 
in, first out (“LIFO”) basis is prohibited under IFRS. 
Under US GAAP, inventories are stated at the lower of cost and market value. Cost is generally determined on a FIFO basis, but a last in, first out (“LIFO”) basis 
is used to determine the cost of inventory held by certain US subsidiaries.  RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO US GAAP 
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IFRS AND US GAAP CONTINUED 
125
GROUP – IFRS 
(VIII) POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the cost of defined benefit plans is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the average 
expected remaining service lives of participating employees, but differences exist, principally concerning the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, surpluses 
and the minimum pension liability. 
Under IFRS, the plan assets (if any) and the plan liabilities must be measured at the Group’s balance sheet date. Under US GAAP, measurement may take place 
up to three months prior to the Group’s balance sheet date and is carried out as at 1 October each year. 
Under IFRS, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur. Under US GAAP, 
the Group uses the so-called “corridor approach” whereby actuarial gains and losses are amortised to the income statement over the remaining service lives of 
participating employees to the extent that, measured at the beginning of each year, they exceed 10 per cent of the greater of the market related value of the 
plan assets or the projected benefit obligation. 
Under IFRS, where a plan is in surplus the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount 
which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions. Under US GAAP, there is no restriction on the asset recognised in 
respect of a plan in surplus. 
Under US GAAP, a minimum pension liability must be recognised that represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation (ignoring projected 
future salary increases) exceeds the fair value of the plan assets. A corresponding amount is recognised as an intangible asset, to the extent of any 
unrecognised prior service cost and unrecognised transition obligation, and the balance is recognised in comprehensive income. Under IFRS, there is no 
equivalent requirement to recognise a minimum pension liability because the net liability is fully recognised on the balance sheet.  
(IX) SHARE-BASED INCENTIVES 
Under IFRS, the Group recognises a compensation expense in respect of share-based incentives that is based on the fair value of the awards in accordance with 
IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”. The Group applied IFRS 2 retrospectively to all awards that were outstanding but had not vested as at 1 January 2005, except 
those equity-settled awards that were granted on or before 7 November 2002.  
Under US GAAP, prior to 2 January 2005, the compensation expense was based on the intrinsic value of the awards in accordance with APB 25 “Accounting 
for Stock Issued to Employees”. Effective 2 January 2005, the Group adopted SFAS 123R “Share-Based Payment” which requires that the compensation 
expense is based on the fair value of the awards. The Group applied SFAS 123R prospectively to the unvested portion of all awards that were outstanding  
as at 1 January 2005. 
While differences between the compensation expense recognised under IFRS and US GAAP will exist for the foreseeable future, it is expected that they will be 
eliminated in future years when the outstanding unvested equity-settled awards granted on or before 7 November 2002 either vest or are forfeited due to 
failure to meet the service or non-market performance conditions that apply to them.  
(X) DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
Under IFRS, prior to 2 January 2005, derivative financial instruments were not generally recognised as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and gains or 
losses arising on them were not recognised until the hedged item was itself recognised in the financial statements. From 2 January 2005 onwards, derivative 
financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date and, in the absence of hedge accounting, 
changes in their fair values are reflected immediately in the Group’s profit for the period. The Group does not generally apply hedge accounting to 
transactional foreign currency hedging relationships. It does, however, apply hedge accounting to translational foreign currency hedging relationships and to 
hedges of its interest rate exposures where it is permissible to do so under IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”.  
Under US GAAP, derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date and, in the 
absence of hedge accounting, changes in their fair values are reflected immediately in the Group’s net income. Prior to 2005, the Group chose not to apply 
hedge accounting but, thereafter, it has applied hedge accounting to translational hedging relationships where it is permissible to do so under SFAS 133 
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”. While the Group achieves hedge accounting under US GAAP for those hedges of its interest 
rate exposures that qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS, it is not possible for it to achieve hedge accounting under US GAAP for certain translational 
foreign currency hedging relationships that qualify for hedge accounting as net investment hedges under IFRS.  
(XI) PREFERENCE SHARES 
Under IFRS, prior to 2 January 2005, the US dollar denominated 5.56% Convertible cumulative preference shares (“the Preference shares”) were classified as 
non-equity shareholders’ funds and were translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at their date of issue. Dividends payable on the Preference shares 
were treated as an appropriation of profit. 
From 2 January 2005 onwards, the Preference shares are classified as non-current liabilities and are retranslated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the 
balance sheet date. The Preference shares have been designated as a net investment hedge and, to the extent the hedge is effective, currency translation 
differences are recognised directly in equity. Dividends payable on the Preference shares are included within interest payable. 
Under US GAAP, the Preference shares are classified as shareholders’ equity and are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of issue. 
Dividends payable on the Preference shares are treated as an appropriation of shareholders’ equity. 
(XII) CUMULATIVE CURRENCY TRANSLATION DIFFERENCES 
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, currency translation differences arising on the translation into Sterling of the results, assets and liabilities of foreign operations 
are recognised as a separate component of equity. On transition to IFRS, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences on its net 
investment in foreign operations to be £nil as at 3 January 2004. Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation recognised under IFRS does 
not include currency translation differences that arose before 4 January 2004.

C. PRESENTATIONAL DIFFERENCES 
(I) DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  
Under IFRS, an operation is classified as discontinued if it has been sold or is classified as held for sale at the balance sheet date, and itself represents, or its sale 
is part of a single plan to dispose of, a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. Under US GAAP, discontinued operations include all 
components of the Group’s businesses that have identifiable operations and cash flows and have been sold or are classified as held for sale at the balance 
sheet date.  
(II) STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
Under IFRS, cash flow represents increases or decreases in cash and cash equivalents, which comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand  
and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Under US GAAP, cash flow  
is as defined under IFRS, except it excludes increases or decreases in bank overdrafts. 
Under IFRS, dividends received from associates have been classified as cash flows from investing activities whereas under US GAAP they are classified  
as cash flows from operating activities. 
Under IFRS, interest paid and interest received has been classified as cash flows from financing activities whereas under US GAAP they are classified within  
cash flows from operating activities.

TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 
128 
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TOMKINS PLC 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of  
Tomkins plc and subsidiaries (“the Company”) as of December 31, 2005, 
and January 1, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, 
cash flows and changes in shareholders’ equity for the fiscal years ended 
December 31, 2005, January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based  
on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,  
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. An audit includes 
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for 
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,  
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness  
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,  
we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the  
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide  
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of Tomkins plc as of December 31, 
2005 and January 1, 2005 and the results of its operations and its cash flows 
for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, January 1, 2005 and January 
3, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America.  
As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, in fiscal 2005 the 
Company (1) changed the presentation of its consolidated statements of 
cash flows to include the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing 
activities of discontinued operations within the respective categories  
of operating, investing, and financing activities of the Company, and  
(2) separately restated the presentation within its statement of changes in 
shareholders’ equity. Fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 have been retroactively 
restated to reflect these changes. 
As discussed in Note 18 to the financial statements, the Company early 
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
No.123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” as of January 2, 2005.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES 
A. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tomkins plc 
and its subsidiaries.  
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the 
Company, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of the entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities. The income 
and expenses of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the 
Company’s income and expenses from the date of acquisition. The income 
and expenses of a subsidiary sold during the period are included in the 
Company’s income and expenses up to the date of disposal.  
Transactions between Tomkins plc and its subsidiaries or between fellow 
subsidiaries, and any balances and unrealized gains and losses arising from 
such transactions, are eliminated on consolidation.  
As at December 31, 2005, the carrying amount of minority interests in 
subsidiaries that were not wholly owned by the Company was $83.3 million 
(January 1, 2005: $80.8 million), which comprised the following outside 
ownership interests: 
As at December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005:  
Gates Korea Company Limited 49%
Gates Unitta India Private Company Limited 49%
Gates Unitta Korea Company Limited 49%
Gates Unitta Power Transmission (Suzhou) Limited 49%
Gates Unitta Power Transmission (Shanghai) Limited 49%
Gates Unitta Asia Company Limited 49%
Gates Unitta Asia Trading Company Pte Limited 49%
Gates Unitta (Thailand) Company Limited 49%
Schrader – Lu Hai Rubber Metal (Kunshan) Company Limited 40%
Where accumulated losses applicable to a minority interest in a subsidiary 
exceed the minority’s interest in the equity of the subsidiary, the excess is 
allocated to the Company’s interest in the subsidiary, except to the extent 
that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional 
investment to cover its share of the accumulated losses. 
During fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, there were no  
variable interest entities in which the Company was deemed to be the 
primary beneficiary. 
B. ASSOCIATES 
An associate is an entity over which Tomkins plc, either directly or indirectly, 
is in a position to exercise significant influence by participating in, but not 
controlling or jointly controlling, the financial and operating policies of the 
entity. Associates are accounted for using the equity method whereby the 
Company’s share of the earnings or losses of associates are included in 
consolidated net income and the Company’s share of the net assets of  
its associates is included within other long-term assets. 
Gains and losses recognized by Tomkins plc or its subsidiaries on transactions 
with an associate are eliminated to the extent of the Company’s interest in 
the associate concerned.  
As at December 31, 2005, the carrying amount of the Company’s interests in 
associates was $7.6 million (January 1, 2005: $7.1 million), which comprised 
the following ownership interests: 
As at December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005:  
Dongfeng-Fuji-Thomson Thermostat Co. Limited 32%
Ideal International SA 40%
Pyung Hwa CMB Co. Limited 21%
Schrader Duncan Ltd 50%
Losses of an associate in excess of the Company’s interest in the associate 
are not recognized, except to the extent that the Company has incurred 
obligations on behalf of the associate. 
C. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
At entity level, transactions denominated in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency are translated into the entity’s functional currency at the 
exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange 
rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences are 
recognized in the statement of income for the period. 
On consolidation, the results of operations of entities whose functional 
currency is other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at the 
average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are 
translated into US dollars at the exchange rate ruling on the balance  
sheet date. Currency translation differences are recognized within other 
comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. In 
the event that such an operation is sold, the cumulative currency translation 
differences that are attributable to the operation are reclassified to income. 
In the statement of cash flows, the cash flows of operations whose functional 
currency is other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at the 
average exchange rate for the period. 
D. REVENUE RECOGNITION 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized only when there is persuasive 
evidence of a sales agreement, the delivery of goods has occurred, the sales 
price is fixed or determinable and the collectibility of revenue is reasonably 
assured. Revenue is measured at the invoiced amount net of returns, early 
settlement discounts, rebates and sales taxes. The Company accrues for 
rebates pursuant to specific arrangements with certain of its customers, 
primarily in the aftermarket. Rebates generally provide for price reductions 
based upon the achievement of specified purchase volumes and are recorded 
as a reduction in revenue when recognized. 
Revenue on long-term contracts is recognized by the percentage-of-
completion method determined by comparing contract costs incurred  
for work performed to date to estimated total contract costs. Losses on 
contracts, if any, are recognized in the period when such losses become 
probable and can be reasonably estimated.  
Revenue recognized on long-term contracts in fiscal 2005 was  
$235.3 million (fiscal 2004: $149.5 million; fiscal 2003: $164.8 million),  
of which $31.5 million in fiscal 2004 and $68.8 million in fiscal 2003 related 
to discontinued operations. As at December 31, 2005, amounts billed but 
not yet received in respect of long-term contracts amounted to $37.1 million 
(January 1, 2005: $27.8 million), including customer retentions of  
$5.7 million (January 1, 2005: $1.2 million).  
Interest income is accrued on a time basis using the effective interest method. 
E. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS 
Research and development expenditure is charged to income in the period in 
which it is incurred. Research and development expenses were $84.8 million 
in fiscal 2005, $93.7 million in fiscal 2004 and $95.6 million in fiscal 2003. 
F. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on 
demand and other short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities  
on acquisition of 90 days or less.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
G. RESTRICTED CASH 
Restricted cash comprises cash balances pledged or advanced as collateral  
in the ordinary course of business.  
H. INVENTORY 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with due allowance for 
any excess, obsolete or slow moving items based on management’s review  
of on-hand inventories compared to historical and estimated future sales and 
usage profiles.  
Cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their 
existing location and condition, which may include the cost of raw materials, 
direct labor costs, other direct costs and related production overheads. Cost 
is generally determined on a first in, first out (“FIFO”) basis, but the cost of 
certain inventories is determined on a last in, first out (“LIFO”) basis. As at 
December 31, 2005, inventories whose cost was determined on a LIFO basis 
represented 35 per cent (January 1, 2005: 37 percent) of the total carrying 
amount of inventories. As at December 31, 2005, the replacement cost of 
inventories whose cost was determined on a LIFO basis exceeded their 
carrying values by $8.5 million (January 1, 2005: $1.6 million).  
I. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated  
depreciation and any recognized impairment losses. Major improvements  
are capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to 
expense as incurred. 
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and 
assets under construction, is generally provided on a straight-line basis so as 
to charge the depreciable amount to expense over the estimated useful life 
of the asset concerned. The estimated useful lives of items of property, plant 
and equipment are in the following ranges: 
Freehold buildings and long  
leasehold land and buildings 10 to 50 years 
Short leasehold land and buildings Length of lease 
Plant, equipment and vehicles 2 to 20 years 
Interest costs attributable to funding the construction of major items of 
property, plant and equipment are capitalized and amortized over the 
estimated useful life of the asset concerned. Interest capitalized is 
determined by reference to the average interest rate on outstanding 
borrowings. In fiscal 2005 interest costs of $13.8 million were capitalized 
(fiscal 2004: $11.7million; fiscal 2003: $7.2 million). 
J. GOODWILL 
Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 141 
“Business Combinations”. 
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates and 
represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Company’s 
interest in the fair value of the entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not 
amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost 
less any recognized impairment losses.  
K. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and any 
recognized impairment losses. All intangible assets recognized by the 
Company are considered to have finite useful lives. 
(I) ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognized as 
an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from 
contractual or other legal rights. An acquired intangible asset is amortized on 
a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which represents its fair value at 
the date of acquisition, to expense over its expected useful life. Acquired 
intangible assets mainly comprise patents and technology, customer 
relationships and intellectual property. The expected useful lives of these 
assets are in the range 8 to 15 years and the weighted average expected 
useful life is 11 years. 
(II) COMPUTER SOFTWARE 
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and 
equipment is recognized separately as an intangible asset. Non-integral 
computer software is amortized on a straight-line basis so as to charge its 
cost to expense over its expected useful life. The expected useful lives of  
non-integral computer software are in the range 3 to 5 years. 
L. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  
(I) LONG-LIVED ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL 
Long-lived assets to be held and used, including intangible assets, are 
reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that  
the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable.  
The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered to be 
impaired when the undiscounted expected future cash flows from the asset 
or asset group are less than its carrying amount. In that event, an impairment 
loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset 
group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined based on quoted market 
prices, where available, or is estimated as the present value of the expected 
future cash flows from the asset or asset group discounted at a rate 
commensurate with the risk involved.  
(II) GOODWILL 
At the time of the business combination to which it relates, goodwill is 
allocated to one or more reporting units. Goodwill is tested at least annually 
for impairment. Firstly, to identify potential impairment of the goodwill, the 
fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is allocated is compared 
with its carrying amount. Fair value is determined based on quoted market 
prices, where available, or is estimated as the present value of the expected 
future cash flows from the reporting unit discounted at a rate commensurate 
with the risk involved. Secondly, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit, 
including the goodwill, exceeds its fair value, the goodwill is tested for 
impairment based on its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill 
represents the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value 
of its identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the 
impairment test. An impairment loss is recognized if and to the extent that 
the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.  
M. INVESTMENTS 
Listed investments are classified as available-for-sale and are measured at  
fair value. Changes in their fair values are recognized in other comprehensive 
income except to the extent that they represent another than temporary 
impairment in which case the impairment loss is recognized in income . 
Accumulated gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to income in the event that they are realized on the disposal of 
the investments. Available-for-sale investments are included within other 
non-current assets. As at December 31, 2005, their carrying amount was 
$3.8 million (January 1 2005: $3.1 million). During fiscal 2005, a gain  
of $1.3 million was reclassified to income on the disposal of available-for- 
sale investments. 
N. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally foreign 
currency swaps, forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps, 
to reduce its exposure to exchange rate and interest rate movements.  
The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or  
trading purposes.  
Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets and liabilities 
measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. Changes in their  
fair values are recognized in income and this is likely to cause volatility in 
situations where the carrying amount of the hedged item is either not 
adjusted to reflect fair value changes arising from the hedged risk or is  
so adjusted but that adjustment is not recognized in income. Provided the 
conditions specified by SFAS133 ”Accounting for Derivative Instruments  
and Hedging Activities” are met, hedge accounting may be used to mitigate 
this volatility.  
  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 
136 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Prior to fiscal 2005, the Company chose not to adopt the hedge accounting 
provisions of SFAS 133. During fiscal 2005, management reviewed its policy 
towards hedge accounting and decided to use hedge accounting in certain 
circumstances. With effect from fiscal 2005, the Company does not generally 
apply hedge accounting to transactional foreign currency hedging 
relationships, such as hedges of forecast or committed transactions. It does, 
however, apply hedge accounting to translational foreign currency hedging 
relationships and to hedges of its interest rate exposures where it is 
permissible to do so under SFAS133. When hedge accounting is used, the 
relevant hedging relationships are classified as a fair value hedge, a cash flow 
hedge or, in the case of a hedge of the Company’s net investment in a 
foreign operation, a net investment hedge. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the 
carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted by the increase  
or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting 
gain or loss is recognised in income where, to the extent that the hedge is 
effective, it offsets the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net 
investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair 
value of the hedging instrument are recognized in other comprehensive 
income rather than in income. Accumulated gains and losses recognized in 
other comprehensive income in relation to a cash flow hedge are reclassified 
to income in the same period or periods during which the hedged 
transaction affects income. Accumulated gains and losses recognized in 
other comprehensive income in relation to a net investment hedge are 
reclassified to income in the event of the disposal of the foreign operation.  
Derivative financial instruments are classified as current assets or liabilities 
unless they qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS133 and the hedged 
item is classified as a non-current asset or liability. 
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognized 
separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the 
host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value 
recognized in the income statement. 
O. LEASES 
Leases that confer rights and obligations similar to those that attach to 
owned assets and meet the conditions specified by SFAS 13 “Accounting  
for Leases” are classified as capital leases. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases. 
Assets held under capital leases are included within property, plant and 
equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value 
of the minimum lease payments, and a corresponding liability is recognized 
within capital lease obligations. Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on 
a basis consistent with similar owned assets or over the term of the lease, if 
shorter. On commencement of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned 
between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a 
constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability. Thereafter,  
the interest element is recognized in expense while the capital element is 
applied to reduce the outstanding liability. As at December 31, 2005, the 
cost of assets held under capital leases was $57.5 million (January 1, 2005: 
$64.9 million) and accumulated depreciation recognized in respect of those 
assets was $37.8 million (January 1, 2005: $40.5 million).  
Operating lease rentals, and any incentives receivable, are recognized in 
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
P. POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
Post-retirement benefits comprise pension benefits provided to employees 
throughout the world and other benefits, mainly healthcare, provided to 
certain employees in North America. The plans are structured to accord  
with local conditions and practices in each country and include defined 
contribution and defined benefit plans. 
The Company accounts for its post-retirement benefit plans in accordance 
with SFAS 87, “Employers' Accounting for Pensions” and SFAS 106, 
“Employers’ Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits other than Pensions”. 
The principle underlying these accounting standards is that the cost of 
providing these benefits is recognized in income on a smoothed basis over 
the service lives of the participating employees. 
For defined contribution plans, the cost of providing the benefits represents 
the Company’s contributions to the plans and is recognized in income in the 
period in which the contributions fall due. 
For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing the benefits is determined 
based on actuarial valuations of each of the plans that are carried out 
annually by independent qualified actuaries at a date not more than three 
months before Company’s fiscal year end. Plan assets (if any) are measured 
at a market-related value that smoothes the effect of short-term market 
fluctuations in asset values. Benefit obligations are measured using the 
projected unit credit method. 
The net periodic cost comprises the service cost, the interest cost, the 
expected return on plan assets (if any), and the amortization of the prior 
service cost, the actuarial gain or loss and any unrecognized obligation  
or asset that existed on initial application by the Company of SFAS 87  
and SFAS 106. The service cost represents the present value of benefits 
attributed to services rendered by employees during the period. The interest 
cost represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation (which is  
the present value of accrued benefits including assumed future salary 
increases) due to the passage of time. The discount rate used reflects the 
rates available on high-quality fixed-income debt instruments at the date  
of the plan valuation. Prior service costs resulting from plan amendments  
are recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining service lives of 
participating employees.  
Actuarial gains and losses represent differences between the expected  
and actual returns on the plan assets, gains and losses on the plan liabilities 
and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions. The Company uses  
the so-called “corridor approach” whereby to the extent that they exceed  
10 per cent of the greater of the market related value of the plan assets  
and the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the fiscal year,  
they are amortized to income over the average remaining service lives of 
participating employees. 
Gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are generally recognized  
in income in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs in 
accordance with SFAS 88 “Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments  
of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits”. 
An additional liability is recognized to the extent that the accumulated 
benefit obligation (the present value of accrued benefits without allowance 
for future salary increases) exceeds the fair value of the plan assets.  
Where an additional minimum liability is recognized, an intangible asset  
is recognized up to the amount of any unrecognized prior service cost and 
any unrecognized transition obligation. Any amount not recognized as an 
intangible asset is reported in other comprehensive income. 
Q. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
Share-based compensation is provided to employees under the Company’s 
share option, bonus and other share award schemes.  
The Company adopted SFAS 123R ”Share-Based Payment” using the 
modified prospective method with an effective date of January 2, 2005, 
whereby the standard was applied prospectively to the unvested portion of 
awards that were outstanding as at January 1, 2005 and all awards granted, 
modified or settled on or after January 2, 2005. 
Accordingly, the compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2005 was  
based on the fair value of the unvested awards, where appropriate measured 
using an option-pricing model. For equity-settled awards, the fair value is 
determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless 
the conditions on which the award was granted are modified. For cash-
settled awards, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is re-
measured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled. Generally, 
the compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual 
forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service 
conditions or non-market performance conditions.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Prior to adopting SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock based 
compensation in accordance with APB 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to 
Employees”, whereby the compensation expense was based on the intrinsic 
value of the unvested awards determined at the measurement date. The 
measurement date was the first date on which both the number of shares 
that were subject to the award and the option or purchase price, if any, was 
known. Adjustments for forfeitures were made to the compensation expense 
in the period in which they occurred. 
The Company’s financial statements for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 have  
not been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS123R. If the Company had 
accounted for the plans using the fair value method prescribed in SFAS 123, 
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, the Company’s net income 
and net income per common share in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 would have 
been as follows:

Basic $0.45  $0.52 
Diluted $0.43  $0.45 
R. PRODUCT WARRANTIES 
Provision is made for warranty claims on various products depending on 
specific market expectations and the type of product. These estimates are 
established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average 
cost of warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty reserve is 
appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original 
estimates requiring adjustments to the reserve. 
FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for 
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” 
requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must disclose  
and recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under 
that guarantee.  
The requirements of FIN 45 are applicable to the Company’s product 
warranty liability and certain guarantees. The Company’s guarantees issued 
subject to the recognition and disclosure requirements of FIN 45 as at 
December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005 were not material. As at December 
31, 2005 the Company’s product warranty liability recorded in other accrued 
liabilities was $10.7 million (January 1, 2005: $10.8 million). The following 
table summarizes the activity related to the product warranty liability during 
fiscal 2005 and 2004.

Provision is made for the cost of product recalls if management consider it 
probable that it will be necessary to recall a specific product and the amount 
can be reasonably estimated. 
S. INCOME TAXES 
Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the 
taxable profit or loss for the period. Taxable profit differs from accounting 
profit because it excludes items of income or expense recognized for 
accounting purposes that are either not taxable or deductible for tax 
purposes or are taxable or deductible in other periods. Current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date. 
The Company recognizes provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions 
whereby additional current tax may become payable in future periods 
following the audit by the tax authorities of previously filed tax returns. 
Provisions for uncertain tax positions are based upon management’s 
assessment of the likely outcome of issues associated with assumed 
permanent differences, interest that may be applied to temporary 
differences, the possible disallowance of tax credits and penalties and  
are classified as current liabilities. Provisions for uncertain tax positions  
are reviewed regularly and are adjusted to reflect events such as the expiry  
of limitation periods for assessing tax, administrative guidance given by the 
tax authorities and court decisions.  
Deferred tax is tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amount of an asset or a liability and its tax base used 
in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax is accounted for using  
the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are generally 
recognised for all temporary differences based on enacted tax rates. Deferred 
tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at 
such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the 
deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments  
in foreign subsidiaries, except where the Company intends, and is able,  
to reinvest such amounts indefinitely.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on  
a net basis. 
T. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered 
by sale rather than by continuing use in the business. For this to be the case, 
the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, 
management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the 
asset which, when initiated, was expected to result in a completed sale 
within twelve months. An extension of the period required to complete  
the sale does not preclude the asset from being classified as held for sale, 
provided the delay was for reasons beyond the Company’s control and 
management remains committed to its plan to sell the asset. 
 Assets that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Fair value is determined 
using quoted market prices, where available, or estimated based on the 
expected future cash flows from the asset or asset group concerned 
discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Long-lived  
assets classified as held for sale are no longer subject to depreciation. 
Assets that are to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and 
used until the disposal occurs.  
Discontinued operations comprise those operations and cash flows that can 
be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes 
from the rest of the Company’s activities and have either been disposed  
of or satisfy the criteria to be classified as held for sale.  
U. RECLASSIFICATION OF AMOUNTS REPORTED IN PRIOR YEARS 
Certain amounts reported in prior years have been reclassified to conform  
to the presentation used in fiscal 2005.  
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and 
equipment has been reclassified from property, plant and equipment to 
other intangible assets. As at January 1, 2005, the carrying amount of  
such software was $8.6 million.  
Derivative financial instruments held to hedge the Company’s translational 
foreign currency exposures that were previously included in the carrying 
amount of bank overdrafts were reclassified to accounts payable. As at 
January 1, 2005, the carrying amount of such derivative financial instruments 
was $13.0 million.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
V. USE OF ESTIMATES 
When applying the Company’s accounting policies, management must make 
assumptions and estimates concerning the future that affect the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, the disclosure  
of contingencies that existed at the balance sheet date and the amounts  
of revenue and expenses recognized during the accounting period. Estimates 
and assumptions are particularly important in accounting for post-retirement 
benefits, impairment of long-lived assets, product warranties and income 
taxes. Estimates and assumptions used are based on factors such as historical 
experience, the observance of trends in the industries in which the Company 
operates and information available from the Company’s customers and other 
outside sources. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making 
assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes could differ from those 
assumptions and estimates. 
W. NON-STATUTORY ACCOUNTS 
The accompanying financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts 
within the meaning of section 240 of the Companies Act 1985. The 
Company’s statutory accounts for fiscal 2005, that have been prepared in 
accordance International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted for 
use in the European Union and on which the Company’s auditors, Deloitte & 
Touche LLP, have given an unqualified report that did not contain a

Company’s Annual General Meeting on May 22, 2006. 
 
3. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING 
PRONOUNCEMENTS 
A. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ADOPTED DURING THE YEAR 
SFAS 123R “SHARE-BASED PAYMENT” 
Share based compensation is provided to employees under the Company’s 
share option, bonus and other share award plans, whereby the participating 
employees receive rights over shares in Tomkins plc. In previous periods, the 
Company accounted for these plans in accordance with APB 25 “Accounting 
for Stock Issued to Employees”, which required that the compensation  
cost was measured on the basis of the intrinsic value of the awards at the 
grant date.  
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R “Share-Based Payment” 
which requires companies to measure the cost of share based compensation 
plans on the basis of the fair value of the awards. SFAS 123R supersedes  
APB 25. 
Under SFAS 123R, the fair value of equity-settled awards is determined at the 
date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on 
which the award was granted are modified. For cash-settled awards, the fair 
value is determined at the date of grant and is re-measured at each balance 
sheet date until the liability is settled. Generally, the compensation cost is 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are 
made to reflect actual and expected forfeitures during the vesting period due 
to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.  
The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method 
with an effective date of January 2, 2005, whereby SFAS 123R has been 
applied prospectively to the unvested portion of awards that were 
outstanding as of January 1, 2005 and all awards granted, modified or 
settled on or after January 2, 2005. The financial impact of adopting  
SFAS 123R is discussed in Note 18. 
B. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED 
SFAS 154 “ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND ERROR CORRECTIONS” 
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154 “Accounting Changes and Error 
Corrections” which requires retrospective application to the financial 
statements of prior periods to reflect changes in accounting principle  
and redefines the term “restatement” as the revising of previously issued 
financial statements to reflect the correction of an error. Under retrospective 
application, the new accounting principle is applied as at the beginning of 
the first period presented as if that principle had always been used. The 
cumulative effect of the change is reflected in the carrying value of assets 
and liabilities as at the beginning of the first period presented and the 
offsetting adjustments are recorded to opening retained earnings. SFAS 154 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal 
years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the 
adoption of SFAS 154 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP

4. RESTATEMENT OF INFORMATION PRESENTED IN PRIOR YEARS  
A. STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS 
Subsequent to the issuance of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004, the United States Securities & Exchange Commission issued 
guidance to the effect that the cash flows associated with discontinued operations should not be presented as a single line item within the consolidated 
statements of cash flows. Accordingly, during fiscal 2005 the Company changed the presentation of its statements of cash flows to include the cash flows 
from discontinued operations within the categories of operating, investing, and financing activities. A summary of the effects of the change in presentation  
on the consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is as follows:

2005 
$ million

Net cash used in investing activities 
Previously reported (285.0) (355.4)
Net cash flows from discontinued operations (5.0) (9.7)
Restated (290.0) (365.1)
 
Reported net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was unaffected by the restatement. 
B. STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY 
Subsequent to the issuance of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004, management determined that certain shareholders’ equity 
accounts were translated from the Company’s functional currency to the reporting currency using current exchange rates rather than historical exchange rates. 
As a result, the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and the consolidated balance sheets as at January 1, 
2005 and January 3, 2004 have been restated from the amounts previously reported. The restatement did not have any impact on the Company’s previously 
reported net income, total shareholders’ equity or cash flows and may be analyzed as follows:

A. BACKGROUND 
Prior to fiscal 2005, the Company prepared its home country consolidated financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted 
accounting principles (“UK GAAP”). During fiscal 2005, the Company adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted for use in the 
European Union with a transition date of January 4, 2004. Accordingly, the Company’s home country consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004 that 
were previously reported in accordance with UK GAAP were restated in accordance with IFRS.  
SFAS131 “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” requires segment information provided in financial statements to reflect the 
information that was provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources within the Company and

operating net assets. During fiscal 2005, the information provided to the chief operating decision maker was prepared in accordance with IFRS, and during 
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 it was prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. Accordingly, the segment information presented below for fiscal 2005 is prepared in 
accordance with IFRS and that for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. To assist comparison of segment information for fiscal 
2005 with that for fiscal 2004, management has additionally presented segment information for fiscal 2004 prepared in accordance with IFRS.  
The Company’s reportable segments are based upon the nature of their products and services. Effective January 2, 2005, the Company changed the structure 
of its internal organization reflect the changing focus of its operations. Segment information for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 has been represented to reflect the 
resulting change in the Company’s reportable segments.

An explanation of the significant differences between US GAAP, IFRS and UK GAAP that affect the Company’s reported sales, operating income and operating 
net assets is presented below. 
(I) CLASSIFICATION DIFFERENCES 
(a) Discontinued operations 
Under US GAAP and IFRS, net income from discontinued operations is shown as a separate line item below net income from continuing operations. Although 
there is commonality of presentation, differences in the amounts included within sales and operating income from continuing operations arise from the 
definition of a discontinued operation.  
Under US GAAP, a discontinued operation is any component of an entity that has identifiable operations and cash flows and has been sold or is classified as 
held for sale at the balance sheet date. Under IFRS, a discontinued operation is an operation that has been sold or is classified as held for sale at the balance 
sheet date, and itself represents, or its sale is part of a single plan to dispose of, a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. 
Accordingly, more operations are likely to be classified as discontinued under US GAAP than under IFRS. 
Under UK GAAP, the income and expenses of discontinued operations were included in the line item to which they related but their contribution to certain line 
items was disclosed either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements. Sales and operating income information provided to 
the chief decision maker included the contribution of discontinued operations.  
(b) Gain on disposal of continuing operations 
Under UK GAAP, gains on disposal of continuing operations were described as non-operating exceptional items and were shown separately within the income 
statement after operating income.  
Under US GAAP and IFRS, there is no concept of a non-operating exceptional item and items that would have been classified as such under UK GAAP are 
included in operating income.  
(c) Associates 
Under US GAAP, operating income does not include any amounts in respect of the Company’s associates. 
Under IFRS, operating income includes the Company’s share of the net income of its associates.  
Under UK GAAP, operating income included the Company’s share of the income before taxes and non-operating exceptional items of its associates. 
Under US GAAP, the Company’s investments in associates accounted for using the equity method are included in operating assets but they are (were) not 
included under IFRS and UK GAAP.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005

7. SEGMENT INFORMATION CONTINUED 
(I) CLASSIFICATION DIFFERENCES CONTINUED 
(d) Investments 
Under US GAAP, available-for-sale investments are included in operating assets but they are (were) not included under IFRS and UK GAAP. 
(e) Dividends on preferred shares 
Under US GAAP, accrued dividends on preferred shares are included in operating net assets. 
Under IFRS, from January 2, 2005 onwards, accrued dividends on preferred shares are included in net debt and are therefore excluded from operating  
net assets. 
Under UK GAAP, accrued dividends on preferred shares were not included in operating net assets. 
(II) GOODWILL 
Under both US GAAP and IFRS, goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. However, a significant difference exists in the carrying 
value of goodwill due largely to historical differences in the initial measurement and subsequent accounting for goodwill arising on past acquisitions.  
Under IFRS, the Company elected not to apply IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” to business combinations that occurred before January 4, 2004. As a result,  
the Company recognized goodwill amounting to $387.9 million as at January 3, 2004, which represented the carrying value of goodwill recognized under UK 
GAAP on acquisitions completed on or after May 3, 1998. Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed before May 3, 1998 amounting to $1,888.2 million was 
written off to reserves under UK GAAP and was not reinstated on adoption of IFRS. Under US GAAP, the carrying value of goodwill as at January 3, 2004 was 
$1,706.7 million. 
Under UK GAAP, capitalized goodwill was amortized over its estimated useful economic life, not exceeding 20 years, and was tested for impairment whenever 
circumstances indicated that it may have suffered an impairment loss.  
(III) ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, intangible resources acquired in business combinations that occurred on or after January 4, 2004 are recognized as intangible 
assets if they are separable from the acquired business or arise from contractual or legal rights. However, a significant difference exists in the carrying value of 
acquired intangible assets due largely to the differing treatment of intangible resources acquired in past acquisitions.  
As a consequence of the decision not to apply IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” to business combinations that occurred before January 4, 2004, intangible 
resources acquired in those business combinations are not recognized as intangible assets under IFRS. Under US GAAP, the carrying value of acquired 
intangible assets as at January 3, 2004 was $40.9 million.  
Acquired intangible assets are amortized under both US GAAP and IFRS, but the amortization charge under IFRS is likely to be lower than under US GAAP  
due to the lower carrying amount of these assets under IFRS. 
Under UK GAAP, intangible resources acquired in business combinations were recognized separately from goodwill only if they were separable from  
the acquired business and arose from contractual or legal rights. The Company had not recognized any acquired intangible assets under UK GAAP. 
(IV) PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS  
Under US GAAP, product development costs are charged to income in the period in which they are incurred. 
Under IFRS, certain product development costs are capitalized when the conditions specified by IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” are met. Capitalized development 
costs are amortized to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product. 
Under UK GAAP, product development costs were charged to income in the period in which they are incurred. 
(V) RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES 
Under US GAAP, each component of a restructuring plan must be examined separately to determine when the related expenses may be recognized. 
Involuntary employee termination costs may be recognized when management has committed to a detailed termination plan and has communicated the plan  
to employees. Other restructuring expenses are generally recognized when they are incurred.  
Under IFRS and UK GAAP, a restructuring plan is (or was) viewed as a whole and the related expenses are (or were) recognized when there exists an obligation 
to carry out the restructuring, which is generally when a detailed formal restructuring plan is announced. 
(VI) CAPITALIZED INTEREST  
Under US GAAP, interest costs attributable to funding the construction of major items of property, plant and equipment are capitalized and amortized over the 
estimated useful life of the asset concerned. 
Under IFRS and UK GAAP, the Company does (or did) not capitalize any element of its interest costs.  
(VII) INVENTORY 
Under US GAAP, inventories are stated at the lower of cost and market value. Cost is generally determined on a FIFO basis, but a last in, first out (“LIFO”)  
basis is used to determine the cost of inventory held by certain US subsidiaries. 
Under IFRS and UK GAAP, use of the LIFO basis is (or was) prohibited. 
(VIII) POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
Under US GAAP, IFRS and UK GAAP, the cost of defined benefit plans is (or was) calculated using the projected unit credit method and is (or was) recognized 
over the average expected remaining service lives of participating employees but there are (or were) significant differences with regard to the methods and 
assumptions that must be used for valuing plan assets and benefit obligations and for recognizing gains and losses.  
Under US GAAP, the net periodic pension cost is charged wholly to operating income.  
Under IFRS, the service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included within operating income, but the interest cost 
is included in interest expense, the expected return on plan assets is included in interest income and actuarial gains and losses are recognized directly in equity. 
Under both US GAAP and IFRS, the net benefit obligation is recognized as a liability but the amounts recognized differ, due largely to different methods of 
recognizing surpluses and deficits.   CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005

GROUP – US GAAP 
7. SEGMENT INFORMATION CONTINUED 
Under US GAAP, actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the remaining service lives of participating employees to the extent that, measured at  
the beginning of each fiscal year, they exceed 10 per cent of the greater of the market related value of the plan assets or the projected benefit obligation. 
Under IFRS, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in equity in the period in which they occur. 
Under IFRS, where a plan is in surplus the asset recognized is limited to the amount of any unrecognized past service costs and the present value of any 
amount which the Company expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions. Under US GAAP, there is no restriction on the asset 
recognized in respect of a plan in surplus. 
Under US GAAP, a minimum pension liability must be recognized that represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation (ignoring projected  
future salary increases) exceeds the fair value of the plan assets. A corresponding amount is recognized as an intangible asset, to the extent of any 
unrecognized prior service cost and any recognized transition obligation, and the balance is recognized in comprehensive income. Under IFRS, there is no 
equivalent requirement to recognize a minimum pension liability because the net liability is fully recognized on the balance sheet. 
Under UK GAAP, the net periodic pension cost was charged wholly to operating income and consisted of the regular cost and variations from the regular cost 
arising from actuarial gains and losses and retroactive changes in benefits that were aggregated and amortized over the expected remaining service lives of the 
active participants in the plan. Gains and losses on settlements and curtailments were generally recognized in the period in which they occurred and if they 
related to the disposal or exit of businesses were included in non-operating exceptional items. 
Under UK GAAP, the net benefit obligation was not recognized as a liability. 
(IX) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
Under US GAAP, the Company accounts for share-based compensation plans using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123R “Share-Based Payment”. 
SFAS 123R was applied prospectively to the unvested portion of awards that were outstanding as at January 1, 2005 and all awards granted, modified or 
settled on or after January 2, 2005. Prior to January 2, 2005, the Company accounted for its stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method 
prescribed by APB 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. 
Under IFRS, the Company accounts for share-based compensation plans using the fair value method prescribed by IFRS 2 “ Share-based Payment”. IFRS 2 was 
applied retrospectively to all awards that were outstanding but had not vested as at January 1, 2005, except those equity-settled awards that were granted on 
or before November 7, 2002. 
While differences between the compensation expense recognized under IFRS and US GAAP will exist in the medium-term, it is expected that they will be 
eliminated in future years when the outstanding unvested equity-settled awards granted on or before November 7, 2002 either vest or are forfeited due to 
failure to meet the service or non-market performance conditions that apply to them.  
Under UK GAAP, the Company accounted for share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method specified by UITF 17”Employee share schemes” 
which differed in certain respects from that specified by APB25. In particular, awards made under the Company’s savings-related share option plan were 
regarded as non-compensatory under UITF17 whereas they were regarded as compensatory under APB25, and the compensation expense relating to deferred 
shares awarded under the Company’s annual bonus plan was recognized at the grant date under UITF17 whereas it was recognized over the applicable vesting 
period under APB25.  
(X) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Under US GAAP, derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date and, in the 
absence of hedge accounting, changes in their fair values are reflected immediately in income. 
Under IFRS prior to January 2, 2005 and under UK GAAP, derivative financial instruments were not generally recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance 
sheet and gains or losses arising on them were not recognized until the hedged item was itself recognised in the financial statements.  
Under IFRS from January 2, 2005 onwards, derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance 
sheet date and, in the absence of hedge accounting, changes in their fair values are reflected immediately in income.  
Under US GAAP and IFRS, the Company applies hedge accounting in certain circumstances where it is permissible to do so under the applicable accounting 
standards. Fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments held to hedge translational exposures that are reflected in income because they do  
not qualify for hedge accounting are included in other income and do not affect operating income.

E. INFORMATION ABOUT MAJOR CUSTOMERS 
The Company has a significant concentration of customers in the United States of America, who accounted for 68.9% (2004: 67.5%; 2003: 67.2%) of the 
Company’s sales during the period, and in the industrial and automotive industry, which accounted for 72.2% (2004: 73.4%; 2003: 70.3%) of the Company’s 
sales during the period. No single customer accounted for more than 10 per cent of the Company's sales, and there were no significant accounts receivables 
from a single customer. The Company reviews a customer's credit history before extending credit. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful 
accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information.

FISCAL 2005 
Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”) in the United States, the Company had the opportunity to benefit from a one-time repatriation of 
cash to the United States at a reduced tax rate. During fiscal 2005, the Company repatriated $75.9 million to the United States under the AJCA on which it 
incurred a tax charge of $3.8 million. 
In fiscal 2005, there was a release of provisions for uncertain tax positions of $106.6 million following the successful resolution of a tax issue in the United 
States, the expiry of time during which tax audits could be performed in certain tax jurisdictions and the change of views on the likely outcome of challenges 
by various tax authorities.  
FISCAL 2004 
In fiscal 2004, the Company reached agreement with the US Internal Revenue Service with respect to the examination of the tax returns of one of its 
subsidiaries for fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001. As a result, tax provisions of $27.4 million were no longer considered necessary and were released to  
the income statement in fiscal 2004. 
FISCAL 2003 
During fiscal 2003, following an extensive tax risk management study, the Company implemented a new methodology to estimate its provision for uncertain 
tax positions. The principal change from the methodology used in prior periods was that the provision recognized was not assessed against a “portfolio” of tax 
exposures but, instead, provisions for uncertain tax positions were made on an item-by-item basis. As a result, there was a reduction of $147.9 million in the 
Company’s provision for uncertain tax positions which was released to the income statement in fiscal 2003.

As at December 31, 2005, the Company had operating tax losses amounting to $2,063.8 million of which $1,988.2 million can be carried forward indefinitely 
and $75.6 million have expiry dates between 2006 and 2019. As at December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a deferred tax asset of $26.3 million in 
respect of these losses, net of a valuation allowance of $589.4 million. 
As at December 31, 2005, the Company had capital tax losses amounting to $491.6 million of which $490.5 million can be carried forward indefinitely  
and $1.1 million expire in 2009. As at December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a deferred tax asset of $1.6 million in respect of these losses, net  
of a valuation allowance of $145.5 million. 
As at December 31, 2005, the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to $3,345.8 million (January 1, 2005 – $2,848.8 million). No  
income taxes have been provided on the Company's share of these undistributed earnings due to management's ability and intent to reinvest such  
amounts indefinitely. A determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability has not been made because it is not practical to do so.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP

9. INCOME PER COMMON SHARE 
Basic income per common share represents net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal year.  
Diluted income per common share considers the effect of potential common shares, unless the inclusion of the potential common shares would have  
an anti-dilutive effect.

the fiscal year, were excluded in computing diluted earnings per share since the impact would be anti-dilutive. For the purposes of diluted earnings per share  
the income is increased for the dividend on the preferred shares of $29.1 million (fiscal 2004: $28.5 million; fiscal 2003: $47.1 million).

BANK LOANS 
Bank loans are principally amounts drawn down under the Company’s £400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility. As at December 31, 2005,  
$205.8 million (January 1, 2005 - $ nil) had been drawn down, including tranches denominated in US dollars totaling $175.0 million. Borrowings under the 
facility attract interest at floating rates determined by reference to LIBOR and the weighted average rate payable was 4.8% as at December 31, 2005. 
OTHER LOANS 
The Company has a Euro Medium Term Note Program under which it may borrow up to a total maximum principal amount of £750 million. So far, two bonds 
have been issued under this program: £150 million repayable at par on December 20, 2011 that bears interest at a fixed rate of 8%; and £250 million repayable 
at par on September 16, 2015 that bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.125%.

The Company is subject to covenants, representations and warranties commonly associated with investment grade borrowings in respect of its committed 
borrowing facilities and borrowings under the Euro Medium Term Note Program.  
The Company is subject to two financial covenants in respect of its committed borrowing facilities. The ratio of net debt to consolidated earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization must not exceed 2.5 times, and the ratio of consolidated operating profit to the consolidated net interest charge 
must not be less that 3.0 times. The financial covenants are calculated by applying “frozen” UK GAAP as at December 31, 2002.

The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.  
The Company ensures that its portfolio of derivative financial instruments is managed such that there is no significant concentration of credit risk in any one 
bank or other financial institution.  
B. CURRENCY DERIVATIVES 
As at December 31, 2005, the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts that are used to manage the currency profile of the 
Company’s net assets was $705.9 million (January 1, 2005: $708.3 million). These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS133 “Accounting 
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities“ and in fiscal 2005 the net fair value loss on these contracts of $62.7 million was recognized in other 
(expense)/income (fiscal 2004: net fair value gain of $22.2 million; fiscal 2003 net fair value gain of $57.0 million). 
During fiscal 2005, the Company drew-down US-dollar denominated borrowings under its multi-currency revolving credit facility which had the effect of 
providing an economic hedge of the translational currency exposures arising on its net investment in certain of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is the 
US dollar. As at December 31, 2005, the amount of US-dollar denominated borrowings outstanding under the facility was $175.0 million. These borrowings 
do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS133 and in fiscal 2005, the attributable foreign currency translation loss of $9.5 million was recognized in 
other expense. Also in fiscal 2005, a net gain of $1.0 million was recognized within other income in respect of other currency translation hedges that did  
not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS133 (fiscal 2004: $nil; fiscal 2003: $nil). 
In fiscal 2005, a net fair value gain of $0.6 million was recognized within operating income in respect of currency derivatives that were held to provide  
an economic hedge of transactional currency exposures but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes (fiscal 2004: net fair value gain of  
$2.6 million; fiscal 2003 net fair value gain of $2.6 million). 
C. INTEREST RATE SWAPS 
Interest rate swaps are used to swap borrowings under the Company’s Euro Medium Term Note Program from fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. As 
at December 31, 2005, the nominal value of the contracts outstanding was $686.7 million (January 1, 2005: $768.0 million). The Company had not previously 
elected to designate these contracts as fair value hedges in accordance with SFAS133, but during fiscal 2005 they were so designated and were subsequently 
considered to be effective hedges for accounting purposes. As at December 31, 2005, an adjustment of $14.8 million was made to the carrying amount of the 
hedged borrowings to reflect the extent to which the swaps provided an effective hedge against fair value interest rate risk.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP

15. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 
Interest rate swaps are also used to restrict the amount of floating rate US dollar debt. As at December 31, 2005, the nominal value of these contracts held 
was $420 million (January 1, 2005: $ 210 million), including contracts with a nominal value of $210 million that commence on the maturity of equivalent 
contracts that are currently in force in June 2006 and June 2008.  
During fiscal 2005, a net gain of $6.0 million was recognized within other income that represented the net change in the fair value of interest rate swaps  
that did not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS133 (fiscal 2004: net fair value gain of $12.0 million; fiscal 2003 net fair value loss of $11.6 million).

Convertible cumulative preference shares (526.7) (538.2)  (647.4) (481.1)
Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash largely attract floating interest rates. Accordingly, their carrying amounts are considered to approximate to  
fair value.  
Borrowings classified as current liabilities mainly comprise overdrafts and loans that attract floating interest rates. Accordingly their carrying amount is 
considered to approximate to fair value. 
Borrowings classified as non-current liabilities principally comprise borrowings under the Group’s multi-currency revolving credit facility that attract floating 
interest rates, whose carrying amount is considered to approximate to fair value, and the listed bonds issued under the Group’s Euro Medium Term Note 
Program, whose fair values represent their quoted market prices.  
Capital lease obligations attract fixed interest rates that are implicit in the lease rentals and their fair value has been assessed by reference to prevailing market 
interest rates. 
Interest rate derivatives are valued by discounting the applicable cash flows at prevailing market interest rates. 
Foreign currency derivatives are valued on a mark to market basis by reference to prevailing currency exchange rates. 
The Convertible cumulative preference shares are not traded in an organized market and their fair value has been assessed using a valuation model that takes 
into account prevailing market interest rates and the existence of the holders’ conversion option.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1,133.9 million at December 31, 2005 and $1,058.6 million at January 1, 2005. 
The accumulated benefit obligation has been calculated in accordance with Approach 1 described in EITF 88-1 “Determination of Vested Benefit Obligation  
for a Defined Benefit Pension Plan”. 
During fiscal 2004, certain assets and liabilities of one of the Group’s Japanese pension arrangements were transferred to the Japanese government.  
The value of liabilities transferred exceeded the amount of assets transferred by $8.7 million. The impact of this government subsidy is reflected in the  
above figures.

PENSION PLAN ASSETS 
Pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, bonds and other fixed income securities, money market instruments, and insurance contracts.  
The Company’s weighted-average worldwide actual asset allocations at December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005 by asset category are as follows: 
 Plan assets

– Fixed income securities 35%  35% 27-33% 
– Other assets 5%   4% 0-10% 
Total 100%  100% 100% 
The Company’s investment strategy for pension plan assets includes diversification to minimize interest and market risks. On December 1, 2005 the Tomkins 
North American Retirement Board redenominated existing fixed income assets in the US defined benefit pension plans amounting to $152.0 million and 
entered into $308.0 million of US dollar denominated interest rate swaps with a combined average duration of 11.5 years. This has resulted in a hedge of the 
interest rate risk inherent in the accrued benefit obligation of the plans, whereby future changes in the accrued benefit obligation arising from changes in the 
interest rate will be matched by equal and opposite movements in the value of the assets, protecting the deficit from future interest rate changes. In general, 
the investment strategy for non-US plans does not involve the use of derivative financial instruments. Plan assets are re-balanced periodically to maintain target 
asset allocations. Maturities of investments are not necessarily related to the timing of expected future benefit payments, but adequate liquidity to make 
immediate and medium term benefit payments is ensured. 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
The Company’s funding policy for its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future 
benefits in accordance with federal law and other regulations. Post retirement health and life insurance benefits are funded as incurred. The Company expects 
to contribute approximately $69 million to its pension plans during fiscal 2006.

HEALTH CARE COST TRENDS AND THE IMPACT OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION ACT OF 2003 
The weighted average annual rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rate) is assumed to be 8.68% for fiscal 
2006, reducing gradually to 4.18% by fiscal 2011 and remaining at that level thereafter. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend 
rate would have the following effects as of December 31, 2005: 
 
1 % point increase

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act introduced a plan 
sponsor subsidy based on a percentage of a beneficiary’s annual prescription drug benefits, within defined limits, and the opportunity for a retiree to obtain 
prescription drug benefits under Medicare. 
In January 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement 
and Modernization Act of 2003” (the “Act”, or “FSP FAS 106-1”). FSP FAS 106-1 allows for current recognition or a one-time deferral of the effects of the 
Act. The deferral suspends the application of the measurement requirements of SFAS106 “Employer’s Accounting for Post retirement Benefits Other Than 
Pensions,” and it revised the disclosure requirements of SFAS 132 “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits” for pensions  
and other post retirement plans for the effects of the Act. In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements 
related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (the Act, or “FSP FAS 106-2”), which supercedes FSP FAS 106-1 and 
provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Act and requires employers that sponsor post retirement healthcare plans that provide prescription 
drug benefits to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy included in the Act. FSP FAS 106-2 was effective for the first interim or 
annual period beginning after June 15, 2004 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

18. SHARE- BASED COMPENSATION 
A. BACKGROUND 
The Company operates a number of share-based compensation plans to provide incentives to its senior management and other eligible employees. Details of 
the plans in respect of which options and awards were outstanding as at December 31, 2005 are set out below. 
The Company adopted SFAS123R “Share-Based Payment” using the modified prospective method with an effective date of January 2, 2005. Prior to adopting 
SFAS123R, the Company accounted for share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in APB25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to 
Employees”. The Company’s financial statements for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 have not been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS123R. Pro-forma 
information on the effect on the Company’s net income and net income per common share for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 had the Company previously 
accounted for share-based compensation using the fair value method prescribed in SFAS123”Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” is presented in  
Note 2.  
Under SFAS 123, the Company recognized the effect of forfeitures due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions when  
they occurred. Under SFAS 123R, the Company adjusts the compensation expense recognized in each period to reflect actual and expected forfeitures.  
The cumulative effect of this change of accounting policy as at January 1, 2005 was not material. 
The compensation expense recognized in income and the related income tax benefit in respect of share-based compensation plans was as follows:

B.  SHARE OPTIONS 
Following a review by management in fiscal 2004, it was decided that the Company’s executive share option plans would not be renewed when they lapsed 
for the purposes of new grants in May 2005. Accordingly, no new options were granted under these plans during fiscal 2005. Options will continue to be 
granted from time to time under the Tomkins 2005 Sharesave Scheme, a savings related share option plan which is open to employees who are resident for 
tax purposes in the United Kingdom. Options granted under the Tomkins 2005 Sharesave Scheme generally vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date and 
expire if they are not exercised within six months of the vesting date. 
Details of the share option plans that are closed for the purposes of new grants but under which options were outstanding as at December 31, 2005 are  
as follows:  
TOMKINS EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME NO.3 (“ESOS 3”) AND THE TOMKINS EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME NO. 4 (“ESOS 4”) 
Options granted under ESOS3 and ESOS4 cannot generally be exercised until the third anniversary of the date of grant and until the performance condition  
has been satisfied. The performance condition will be achieved if the rate of increase of the Company’s earnings per share exceeds the growth in the United 
Kingdom Retail Prices Index by an average of 2 per cent per annum over any three-year period after the option is granted based on a simple arithmetic 
calculation that is made annually when the Company’s results are known. In any event, options granted under these plans generally expire if they are not 
exercised by the tenth anniversary of the grant date. 
TOMKINS PREMIUM PRICED OPTION 
The Tomkins Premium Priced Option was an option specifically and solely granted to James Nicol as part of the incentive package to attract him to the 
Company. It consists of a non-transferable option to acquire 5,076,142 shares granted on February 11, 2002. The price per share payable on the exercise of 
the option will be 338 cents in respect of 2,538,072 shares (“A option shares”), 474 cents in respect of 1,522,842 shares (“B option shares”) and 592 cents  
in respect of 1,015,228 shares (“C option shares”). No performance conditions are attached to these options. The options vested as to one-third of A, B and C 
option shares on February 18, 2003, one-third of A, B and C option shares on February 18, 2004 and as to one-third of A, B and C option shares on February 
18, 2005. The option will expire on February 11, 2012 or earlier in certain circumstances. 
ONGOING OPTION 
The Ongoing Option was also an option specifically and solely granted to James Nicol on February 11, 2002, as part of the incentive package to attract him to the 
Company. It consisted of a non-transferable option to acquire 1,522,842 shares at 338 cents, which could not be exercised before February 18, 2005 and unless 
and until the performance condition has been satisfied or waived. The performance condition will be achieved if, on or after the third anniversary of the date of 
grant, the rate of increase of the Company’s earnings per share over any three-year period is equal to or greater than the rate of increase of the United Kingdom 
Retail Prices Index plus 9 per cent. The performance condition may be waived or amended by the Remuneration Committee. If there is a change of control of the 
Company then the option is exercisable immediately regardless of whether the performance condition is satisfied. The option will expire on February 11, 2012 or 
earlier in certain circumstances. As at December 31, 2005, the option had not vested because the performance condition had not been met. 
TOMKINS SAVINGS RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME NO. 2 
The Tomkins Savings Related Share Option Scheme No.2 was open to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom. Options granted 
under this plan generally vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date and expire if they are not exercised within six months of the vesting date. During fiscal 
2005, this plan expired for the purposes of new grants and was replaced with The Tomkins 2005 Sharesave Scheme.

Exercisable as at December 31, 2005 5,079,142 454.53 
Options that were exercisable as at December 31, 2005 had a total intrinsic value of $4.3 million and a weighted average remaining contractual term  
of 6.1 years.  
The Company expects to recognize an aggregate compensation expense of $8.2 million in respect of options that were not exercisable as at December 31, 
2005 over their weighted average remaining period to vesting of 1.1 years. 
During fiscal 2005, the Company received $0.7million (fiscal 2004: $2.2 million; fiscal 2003: $1.1 million) in cash from the exercise of share options whose 
total intrinsic value was $0.1 million (fiscal 2004: $0.9 million; fiscal 2003: $0.1 million). The tax benefit realized by the Company on the exercise of these 
options was $nil (fiscal 2004: $0.3 million; fiscal 2003: $nil). 
The compensation expense recognized in respect of share options is based on their fair value at the grant date calculated using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model.  
Assumptions made in calculating the fair values of options granted were as follows:

– Risk free interest rate 3.84%  4.51% 4.43% 
– Expected dividends 22.88c  21.91c 19.57c 
Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares over the period since May 2001 
when, following a period of significant de-merger activity, the Company was re-focused on its remaining core businesses. Adjustments have been made to  
the expected term used in the model to reflect the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioral considerations, where available based  
on historical experience of similar awards. 
C. OTHER EQUITY-SETTLED AWARDS 
Details of the other equity-settled plans operated by the Company under which awards were outstanding as at December 31, 2005 are as follows:  
ANNUAL BONUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
The Company’s executive Directors and other senior executives participate in the Annual Bonus Incentive Plan (“ABIP”). Each participant in the plan receives a 
percentage of “bonusable profit” of the business for which he or she has responsibility. Bonusable profit is based on operating profit less a charge for tax and 
a charge for invested capital. Bonusable profit may also be adjusted for restructuring costs and, with the approval of the Remuneration Committee, certain 
other items such as gains or losses on the disposal and exit of businesses.  
Senior participants receive their bonus as to four-sevenths in cash, one-seventh in bonus shares and two-sevenths in deferred shares. Other participants receive 
their bonus as to three-quarters in cash, one-twelfth in bonus shares and one sixth in deferred shares. Bonuses are paid at the end of June, September and 
December based on 75 per cent of the bonus earned to the end of the previous quarter, with the balance of the full entitlement to the bonus for the fiscal 
year paid at the end of March following the fiscal year-end.  
Bonus shares are restricted and vest only after a period of three years after the initial bonus award. Dividends are paid on the bonus shares. Deferred shares are 
awarded at the time of the initial bonus award but the vesting of the shares is conditional on continued employment with the Company for three years after 
the award. Dividends are not paid on the deferred shares until they have vested. 
As a condition of continued participation in the Plan, senior participants are required to hold shares with a purchase cost equivalent to one year’s total after-tax 
remuneration including bonus, based on an average of the previous three years. Other participants are required to hold shares with a purchase cost equivalent 
to one half of one year’s total after-tax remuneration including bonus, based on an average of the previous three years.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP

18. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CONTINUED 
SHARE MATCHING SCHEME 
The Tomkins Share Matching Scheme (“SMS”) was related to The Tomkins Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) which closed for the purposes of new grants in fiscal 
2000/01. The RSP required participants either to take an element of their annual bonus in the form of restricted shares, or to acquire further shares in the 
Company using cash bonuses already paid to them. Awards made under the RSP were subject to forfeiture if the participant left the Company before the third 
anniversary of the grant date. In the event that restricted shares vested under the RSP, the SMS provided for up to two conditional matching awards. Each 
matching award was for the number of shares that had vested under the RSP with proportionate reductions in the event that the participant disposed of any 
shares that had vested under the RSP. The first matching award under the SMS was subject to forfeiture if the participant left the Company before the second 
anniversary of the grant date. The second matching award was made when the first matching award vested and was subject to forfeiture if the participant left 
the Company before the second anniversary of the grant date. The final grant under the SMS was made during fiscal 2005 and the plan is now closed for the 
purposes of new grants.  
Changes in the total number of awards outstanding under these plans during fiscal 2005 were as follows: 
 
Awards 
Number 
Weighted 
average 
grant date 
 fair value
Cents 
Outstanding as at January 1, 2005 1,889,075 469.83 
Granted during the period 1,426,367 296.72 
Forfeited during the period (18,701) 487.25 
Vested during the period (73,744) 463.16 
Outstanding as at December 31, 2005 3,222,997 468.10 
During fiscal 2005, awards were made over 1,415,047 ordinary shares under ABIP and matching awards were made over 11,320 ordinary shares under  
the SMS.  
The Company expects to recognize an aggregate compensation expense of $4.6 million in respect of awards that had not vested as at December 31, 2005 
over their weighted average remaining period to vesting of 1.6 years. 
The total intrinsic value of awards that vested under these plans during fiscal 2005 was $nil (fiscal 2004: $2.9 million; fiscal 2003: $0.9 million).  
The tax benefit realized by the Company on the vesting of these awards was $nil (fiscal 2004: $1.0 million; fiscal 2003: $0.3 million). 
The fair value of awards made under these plans is measured based on the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of the award. Where 
the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during  
the expected life of the awards.  
D. CASH-SETTLED AWARDS 
DEFERRED MATCHING SHARE PURCHASE PLAN 
The Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan was introduced for James Nicol as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company. Under this plan 
3,045,684 ordinary shares (“Matching Shares”) were awarded on February 11, 2002 following the purchase by Mr Nicol of 1,015,228 ordinary shares. After 
three years from February 18, 2002 (or earlier in certain circumstances), the award was to vest in respect of 1,015,228 Matching Shares and the remaining 
2,030,456 Matching Shares were to vest to the extent that, for every 1 penny the highest market price of the Company’s ordinary shares sustained over a five-
day period during the six-month period ended February 18, 2005 exceeded 197 pence, being the market price on February 18, 2002, Mr Nicol was entitled to 
receive 5,153 shares. In the event, the market price achieved under the terms of the plan was 285.25 pence and of the 2,030,456 Matching Shares, 454,752 
vested and the balance lapsed. 
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Nicol was entitled to elect to receive a cash payment in lieu of shares and for this reason this plan was classified as a cash-
settled transaction. As at January 1, 2005, the Company recognized a liability of $6.9 million in respect of the plan. During fiscal 2005, the Company 
recognized a compensation expense of $1.1 million in respect of the plan (fiscal 2004: $2.3 million; fiscal 2003: $2.3 million).  
In the event, Mr Nicol elected to receive cash and was paid $8.0 million (subject to statutory deductions) in settlement on February 28, 2005.  
The tax benefit realized by the Company on the vesting of this award was $0.9 million.

The Company is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Directors do not anticipate  
that the outcome of any of the above proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Group’s  
financial position. 
 
22. RESTRUCTURING 
The Company defines restructuring expenses to include charges incurred with respect to exit or disposal activities accounted for in accordance with SFAS 146 
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”, employee severance costs incurred as a result of an exit or disposal activity accounted for  
in accordance with SFAS 88 “Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits” and  
SFAS 112 “Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits”, and pension and other post employment benefit costs incurred as a result of an exit or 
disposal activity accounted for in accordance with SFAS 87 “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and SFAS 106 “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement 
Benefits Other Than Pensions”.  
The Company has undertaken various restructuring activities to streamline its operations, consolidate and take advantage of available capacity and resources, 
and ultimately achieve net cost reductions. Restructuring activities include efforts to integrate and rationalize the Company’s businesses and to relocate 
manufacturing operations to lower cost markets.  
During fiscal 2005 there were $40.8 million of restructuring costs charged to the consolidated income statement compared with $34.1 million in fiscal 2004.

22. RESTRUCTURING CONTINUED 
INDUSTRIAL & AUTOMOTIVE 
The loss of a local major customer and uncompetitive labor costs resulted in the decision to announce the closure of the Company’s curved hose production 
plant in Nowra, Australia. The plant will close in July 2006 allowing time to honor current customer commitments. Due to continued losses, Wipers announced 
its intention to transfer the remaining manufacturing capability from the Wiper Systems plant in Pontypool, Wales to more cost competitive locations.  
The transfer will complete in the first half of fiscal 2006. Taken together, these projects will result in the termination of 362 employees in fiscal 2006. 
AIR SYSTEMS COMPONENTS 
In Air Systems Components, a number of plant rationalizations occurred with the closure of the Tabor City and Englewood facilities and the transfer to 
production to lower cost facilities.

23.  CAPITAL STRUCTURE 
The Company’s issued share capital comprises ordinary shares of 5p each (“common shares”) and convertible cumulative preference shares of $50 each 
(“preferred shares”). 
PREFERRED SHARES 
The preferred shares were issued on terms that they could be converted at any time, at the shareholder’s option, into fully paid common shares of the 
Company on the basis of 9.77 common shares for every preferred share so converted. At the date of issue, the conversion terms of the preferred shares  
were equivalent to a price of 334p per common share.  
The Company has the option, at any time when the total amount of the preferred shares issued and outstanding is less than 10% of the amount originally 
issued and in any event on or after July 29, 2006 to redeem, in the first case, all but not some only and, in the second case, all or any of the preferred shares 
which remain issued and outstanding at that time. As at December 31, 2005, the Company was unable to redeem the preferred shares. 
Until such time as the preferred shares are converted or redeemed, the holders of the preferred shares have a right to receive dividends at an annual rate of 
5.560 per cent in preference to the holders of the Company’s common shares.   CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
TOMKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005 
166 
23. CAPITAL STRUCTURE CONTINUED 
The holders of the preferred shares are entitled to vote at a general meeting of the Company where, on a show of hands, each holder will have one vote and, 
on a poll, each holder will have one vote in respect of every seven fully paid common shares to which the holder would be entitled on the full exercise of his 
conversion rights, except if two or more consecutive quarterly dividends are in arrears whereupon, on a poll, each holder shall have one vote in respect of every 
fully paid common share to which the holder would be entitled on the full exercise of his conversion rights and such voting rights would continue until such 
time as any arrears of dividends have been paid in full. 
On a return of assets on liquidation or otherwise, other than on redemption or repurchase of the preferred shares, the assets of the Company available to 
shareholders will be applied first in repaying the capital paid up or credited as paid up in respect of the preferred shares together with all arrears and accruals 
of dividends to the holders of the preferred shares and any other classes of shares ranking pari passu as to capital with the preferred shares. 
RESTRICTED RESERVES 
Under United Kingdom law, there is a concept of a capital redemption reserve. In the event that the Company purchases its own shares, in certain 
circumstances it is required to transfer an amount equivalent to the nominal value of the shares purchased to the capital redemption reserve in order to 
maintain the capital of the Company. The capital redemption reserve is a restricted reserve, as it cannot be distributed to shareholders. On August 26, 2003, 
the Company redeemed all of its outstanding Redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares of $50 each and transferred $621.9 million to the capital 
redemption reserve. In fiscal 2003, the Company recognized a gain of $17.4 million on redemption of the Redeemable convertible cumulative preference 
shares in comprehensive income. 
 
24.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
During the period, the Group purchased aviation services under an agreement with IGC, LLC and GForce Aviation, LLC. IGC, LLC was wholly-owned by  
Mr C C Gates until his death on August 28, 2005, when ownership passed to the Gates family. Mr Gates had and Gates family members have an interest in 
the Company’s preferred shares. The agreement was entered into on an arm’s length basis and the services provided are used strictly for corporate travel to 
the Company’s diverse locations within North America and only if there is no lower cost alternative available to the Company’s employees. The agreement 
permits the Company to purchase an unlimited number of aircraft flying hours at the rate of $1,950 per flying hour, plus $1,300 per day crew, plus $1,800  
per month to cover insurance costs. During fiscal 2005, the Company recognized an expense of $ 147,870 (fiscal 2004: $145,705) in respect of these services. 
As at December 31, 2005, an amount of $2,100 (January 1, 2005: $1,700) due to IGC, LLC was included in trade payables. 
There are no further transactions or proposed transactions with related parties that are material to the Company or to a related party.

26. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
On March 1, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued stock of Selkirk Americas, L.P. (“Selkirk”) for a provisional consideration of 
$124.4 million. Selkirk is a manufacturer of chimney, venting and air distribution products for commercial and residential applications and it will be integrated 
into the Company’s Air Systems Components business segment. Selkirk is headquartered in the United States of America and has manufacturing facilities in 
the United States of America, Canada and Mexico.  
On March 2, 2006, the Company announced that it had received conversion notices in respect of an aggregate of 7,800,000 Convertible cumulative 
preference shares of US$50 each (“preferred shares”) held by B-C Management LLC as nominee for Bear Creek Inc., a corporate trustee administering certain 
Gates family trusts, and The Gates Family Foundation who together controlled approximately 99.15% of the preferred shares in issue. The preferred shares 
were converted into 76,205,998 fully paid ordinary shares of 5p each (“common shares”) on March 9, 2006. Based on the Company’s issued share capital  
as at March 2, 2006, the number of issued common shares increased from 777,431,246 to 853,637,244 following the conversion and 2,656,912 preferred 
shares remained in issue.

include the Company’s profit and loss account in the financial statements.  
In preparing the Company’s financial statements, the Directors are

whether applicable accounting standards have been followed subject  
to any material departures that must be disclosed and explained in the

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance

B. CHANGES OF ACCOUNTING POLICY 
(I) CHANGES APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY 
During the period, the Company adopted the following accounting 
standards: 
–  FRS 17 “Retirement benefits” 
– FRS 20 (IFRS 2) “Share-based Payment” 
– FRS 21 (IAS 10) “Events after the Balance Sheet Date” 
– FRS 28 “Corresponding amounts” 
Restated to reflect the retrospective application of these accounting 
standards, the Company’s loss for the year ended 1 January 2005 of  
£50.4 million is £5.4 million higher than previously reported and its 
shareholders’ funds as at 1 January 2005 of £1,294.7 million are £55.3 
million higher than previously reported. An analysis of the adjustments that 
have been made to comparative information as at 1 January 2005 and for 
the year then ended is presented in note 16.  
The Directors estimate that the Company’s profit for the year ended  
31 December 2005 was reduced by £1.2 million because of its adoption of 
FRS 20. It is not practicable to estimate the effect of adopting FRS 17 on the 
Company’s results for the year ended 31 December 2005 because the 
Directors no longer obtain actuarial advice in accordance with the previously 
applicable accounting standard, SSAP 24 “Accounting for pension costs”. 
The adoption of FRS 21 and FRS 28 had no effect on the Company’s profit 
for the year ended 31 December 2005. 
(II) ADOPTION OF FRS25 & FRS26 
The Company adopted FRS 25 (IAS 32) ”Financial Instruments: Disclosure 
and Presentation” and FRS 26 (IAS 39) “Financial Instruments: 
Measurement” prospectively from 2 January 2005. Accordingly, comparative 
information as at 1 January 2005 and for the year then ended has not been 
restated to reflect the adoption of these accounting standards. 
On adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26, the Company recognised an increase in 
shareholders’ funds of £63.6 million that may be analysed as follows: 
 £ million 
Convertible cumulative preference shares 63.6  
Fair valuation of derivative financial instruments  4.1  
Hedge accounting adjustment to borrowings (4.1)
Increase in shareholders’ funds 63.6  
An explanation of the effect of adopting FRS 25 and FRS 26 is presented 
below under the heading “Financial instruments”.  
(III) ADOPTION OF FRS 23 
The Company adopted FRS 23 (IAS 21) “The Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates” prospectively from 2 January 2005. On adoption of FRS 23, 
there was no change in the Company’s shareholders’ funds. 
C. INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the 
Company, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of the entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities. Investments  
in subsidiaries represent interests in the Company’s subsidiaries that are 
directly owned by the Company and are stated at cost less any provision  
for impairment. 
D. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at 
the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange 
rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences are 
recognised in the profit and loss account. 
E. TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS 
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  
and any provision for impairment. Freehold land and assets under 
construction are not depreciated. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets,  
other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a 
straight-line basis so as to charge the depreciable amount to the profit and 
loss account over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, which  
is in the following ranges:  
Freehold buildings  50 years 
Plant, equipment and vehicles 2 to 20 years 
F. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
(I) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to 
exchange rate and interest rate movements. The Company does not hold or 
issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Prior to 2 January 2005, 
such derivative contracts were not recognised as assets and liabilities on the 
balance sheet and gains or losses arising on them were not recognised until 
the hedged item was itself recognised in the financial statements.  
From 2 January 2005 onwards, derivative financial instruments are 
recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance 
sheet date. Changes in their fair values are recognised in the profit and loss 
account and this is likely to cause volatility in situations where the carrying 
value of the hedged item is either not adjusted to reflect fair value changes 
arising from the hedged risk or is so adjusted but that adjustment is not 
recognised in the profit and loss account. Provided the conditions specified 
by FRS 26 are met, hedge accounting may be used to mitigate such volatility.  
The Company does not generally apply hedge accounting to transactional 
foreign currency hedging relationships, such as hedges of forecast or 
committed transactions. It does, however, apply hedge accounting to hedges 
of its interest rate exposures where it is permissible to do so under FRS26. 
When hedge accounting is used, the hedging relationship is classified either 
as a fair value hedge or as a cash flow hedge. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the 
carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted by the increase or 
decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting 
gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account where, to the extent 
that the hedge is effective, it offsets the change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge, to the 
extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging 
instrument are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and 
losses rather than in the profit and loss account. When the hedged item is 
recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses on 
the hedging instrument are either recycled to the profit and loss account or, 
if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, are recognised as 
adjustments to its initial carrying amount. 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as current assets or liabilities 
unless they qualify for hedge accounting under FRS 26 and the hedged item 
is classified as a non-current asset or liability. 
(II) EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES 
Prior to 2 January 2005, embedded derivatives were not recognised in the 
financial statements. From 2 January 2005 onwards, derivatives embedded in 
non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial 
instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to 
those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value 
with changes in its fair value recognised in the profit and loss account.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UK GAAP

1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
F. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 
(III)  PREFERENCE SHARES 
In July 1996, the Company issued US dollar denominated 5.56% Convertible 
cumulative preference shares (“the Preference shares”). Prior to 2 January 
2005, the Preference shares were classed as non-equity shareholders’ funds 
and were translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at their date of 
issue. Dividends payable on the shares were dealt with as an appropriation  
of profit.  
From 2 January 2005 onwards, the Preference shares are classified as non-
current liabilities and are retranslated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling 
at the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences are recognised in 
the profit and loss account. Dividends payable on the Preference shares are 
included within interest payable. 
(IV) OWN SHARES  
Own shares represent the Company’s ordinary shares that are held by the 
Company and sponsored ESOP trusts in relation to the Group’s employee 
share schemes. Own shares are deducted at cost in arriving at shareholders’ 
funds and gains and losses on their sale or transfer are recognised directly  
in reserves. 
G. RETIREMENT BENEFITS  
Retirement benefits comprise pension benefits provided to employees in the 
United Kingdom. 
For defined contribution plans, the pension cost represents the Company’s 
contributions to the plans and is recognised in the profit and loss account in 
the period in which the contributions fall due. 
For defined benefit plans, the pension cost is determined using the projected 
unit credit method based on actuarial valuations of each of the plans that are 
carried out annually at the Company’s balance sheet date by independent 
qualified actuaries. The current service cost represents the increase in the 
present value of the plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service  
in the current period. Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are 
recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, or immediately if the benefits have vested. Gains or losses on 
curtailments or settlements are recognised in the profit and loss account in 
the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs. Actuarial gains and 
losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns 
on the plan assets and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are 
recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in the period 
in which they occur. The net pension liability or asset recognised in the 
balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of 
the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, minus any past service costs 
not yet recognised, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the 
balance sheet date and is stated net of deferred tax. Where a plan is in 
surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any amounts 
that the Company expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in 
future contributions. 
H. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVES 
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Company’s 
share option, bonus and other share award schemes. The Company 
recognises a compensation expense in respect of these schemes that is  
based on the fair value of the awards, where appropriate measured using an 
option-pricing model. For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined 
at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the 
conditions on which the award was granted are modified. For cash-settled 
schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is re-measured 
at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled. Generally, the 
compensation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures 
during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-
market performance conditions.  
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20 (IFRS 2) “Share-based 
Payment”, the Company has not applied this policy to equity-settled awards 
that were granted on or before 7 November 2002. 
I. TAXATION 
Deferred tax is recognised on a full provision basis on timing differences 
between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and 
their recognition for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to 
the extent that it is considered more likely than not that that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax 
is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply in the periods in 
which the timing differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not discounted.  
J. DIVIDENDS ON ORDINARY SHARES 
Dividends payable on ordinary shares are recognised in the financial 
statements when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer 
at the Company’s discretion. Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised 
when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are 
declared following approval by shareholders at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting. Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as an 
appropriation of shareholders’ funds.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UK GAAP

Interest rate swaps  6.3 –   – – 
The Company adopted FRS 25 and FRS 26 prospectively from 2 January 2005. Accordingly, comparative information as at 1 January 2005 has not been restated. 
Interest rate swaps are used to swap borrowings by the Company under the Group’s Euro Medium Term Note Program from fixed interest rates to floating 
interest rates. As at 31 December 2005, the nominal value the contracts outstanding was £150 million (1 January 2005 – £150 million). These contracts have 
been designated and are effective as fair value hedges in relation to the borrowings. As at 31 December 2005, an adjustment of £6.0 million was made to the 
carrying value of the hedged borrowings to reflect the extent to which the swaps provided an effective hedge against fair value interest rate risk. 
During 2005, a net gain of £0.3 million was recognised in the profit and loss account that represented changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that did 
not qualify for hedge accounting under FRS 26.

11. PENSIONS 
The Company operates a number of funded defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom that provide benefits based upon final pensionable salary 
and the period of service of the individual employees. The plan assets are held separately from the Company’s assets in funds that are under the control of 
trustees. Day to day management of the plan assets is carried out by independent investment managers who, at the request of the Company, are prohibited by 
the trustees from investing directly in the Company.  
Certain employees and former employees whose pension benefits exceed the maximum that may be provided from the Company’s defined benefit pension 
plans are entitled to an additional unfunded pension payable directly by the Company after their retirement.  
The defined benefit pension plans operated by the Company are closed to new entrants. 
Full actuarial valuations of the plans are carried out at least every three years. The last full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2004. The principal 
assumptions used in the actuarial valuations carried out at the balance sheet date were as follows:

12. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVES 
A. BACKGROUND 
The Company operates a number of share-based compensation arrangements to provide incentives to the Company’s senior management and other eligible 
employees. Details of the schemes in respect of which options and awards are outstanding are set out in the Remuneration Committee report on  
pages 50 to 55.  
The information provided below relates only to such options and awards that were granted to persons who are employees of the Company.  
B. SHARE OPTIONS 
Following a review by the Board in 2004, it was decided that the Company’s executive share option schemes would not be renewed when they lapsed for  
the purposes of new grants in May 2005. Accordingly, no new options were granted under these schemes during 2005. Options will continue to be granted 
from time to time under the Company’s savings-related share option scheme, which is restricted to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the  
United Kingdom.  
Options granted under the Company’s share option schemes are classified as equity-settled awards. The compensation expense recognised during the period  
in respect of share options was £1.4 million (2004 – £0.7 million).

On the dates on which options were exercised during 2005, the weighted average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares was 275.85p per share 
(2004 – 262.22p per share).  
The compensation expense recognised in respect of share options is based on their fair value at the grant date calculated using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model.  
Assumptions made in calculating the fair values of options granted to the Company’s employees during the period were as follows: 
 
Year ended 
31 December 
2005 
Year ended 
1 January  
2005 
Options granted  32,983  1,907,994  
Weighted average fair value 87.24 p 64.77 p 
 
Weighted average assumptions: 
Share price  273.00 p 250.33 p 
Exercise price 218.40 p 239.05 p 
Expected volatility 30.46% 31.50% 
Expected life 5.25 years 5.83 years 
Risk free interest rate 3.84% 4.51% 
Expected dividends 12.60 p 12.00 p 
Expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares over the period since May 2001 
when, following a period of significant de-merger activity, the Group was re-focused on its remaining core businesses. Adjustments have been made to the 
expected life used in the model to reflect the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
The weighted average contractual life of share options outstanding to the Company’s employees at the end of the period was as follows:

C. OTHER EQUITY-SETTLED AWARDS 
The Company’s principal share-based compensation arrangement is the Annual Bonus Incentive Plan (“ABIP”) which is restricted to senior management  
and provides an award of bonus shares and deferred shares based on the profit of the business for which the participants have responsibility.  
During the period, awards were made over 349,598 ordinary shares (2004 – 350,814 ordinary shares) under the ABIP. Also during the period, matching 
awards were made over 9,068 ordinary shares (2004 – 9,380 ordinary shares) under the Share Matching Scheme (“SMS”) which is a legacy scheme that  
is closed to new entrants.  
The fair value of awards made under these schemes is measured based on the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of the award. Where 
the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the 
expected life of the awards. The weighted average fair value of awards made during the period was 257.86p (2004 – 253.14p).  
Awards made under these schemes are classified as equity-settled awards. The compensation expense recognised during the period was £0.8 million  
(2004 – £ 0.5 million).

D.  CASH-SETTLED AWARDS 
The Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan was introduced for James Nicol as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company. Under this plan 
3,045,684 ordinary shares (“Matching Shares”) were awarded on 11 February 2002 following the purchase by Mr Nicol of 1,015,228 ordinary shares. After 
three years from 18 February 2002 (or earlier in certain circumstances), the award was to vest in respect of 1,015,228 Matching Shares and the remaining 
2,030,456 Matching Shares were to vest to the extent that, for every 1 penny the highest market price of the Company’s ordinary shares sustained over a five-
day period during the six-month period ended 18 February 2005 exceeded 197 pence, being the market price on 18 February 2002, Mr Nicol was entitled to 
receive 5,153 shares. In the event, the market price achieved under the terms of the plan was 285.25 pence and of the 2,030,456 Matching Shares, 454,752 
vested and the balance lapsed. 
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Nicol was entitled to elect to receive a cash payment in lieu of shares and for this reason this plan was classified as  
a cash-settled transaction. In the event, Mr Nicol elected to receive cash and was paid £4,193,000 (subject to statutory deductions) in settlement on  
28 February 2005.  
As at 1 January 2005, the Company recognised a liability of £3.6 million. During the period, the Company recognised a compensation expense of £0.6 million 
(2004 – £1.3 million).

As at 31 December 2005 10,462,774 304.7  2.1 306.8  
The convertible cumulative preference shares (“the Preference shares”) were issued on terms that they could be converted at any time, at the shareholder’s 
option, into fully paid ordinary shares of 5p each in the Company on the basis of 9.77 ordinary shares for every one preference share so converted. At the date 
of issue, the conversion terms of the Preference shares were equivalent to a price of 334p per ordinary share.  
The Company has the option, at any time when the total amount of the Preference shares issued and outstanding is less than 10% of the amount originally 
issued and in any event on or after 29 July 2006, to redeem, in the first case, all but not some only and, in the second case, all or any of the Preference shares 
which remain issued and outstanding at that time.  
Until such time as the Preference shares are converted or redeemed, the holders have a right to receive dividends at an annual rate of 5.560 per cent in 
preference to the holders of the Company’s ordinary shares. As at 31 December 2005, the carrying value of the Preference shares included an accrued 
dividend payable of £2.1 million (1 January 2005 – £nil). 
The holders of the Preference shares are entitled to vote at a general meeting of the Company where, on a show of hands, each holder will have one vote and, 
on a poll, each holder will have one vote in respect of every seven fully paid ordinary shares to which the holder would be entitled on the full exercise of his 
conversion rights, except if two or more consecutive quarterly dividends are in arrears whereupon, on a poll, each holder shall have one vote in respect of every 
fully paid ordinary share to which the holder would be entitled on the full exercise of his conversion rights and such voting rights would continue until such 
time as any arrears of dividends have been paid in full. 
On a return of assets on liquidation or otherwise, other than on redemption or repurchase of the Preference shares, the assets of the Company available to 
shareholders will be applied first in repaying the capital paid up or credited as paid up in respect of the Preference shares together with all arrears and accruals 
of dividends to the holders of the Preference shares and any other classes of shares ranking pari passu as to capital with the Preference shares. 
 
18. CONTINGENCIES

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
Shareholders are invited to attend the Annual General Meeting to be held  
at 11.00 am on Monday, 22 May 2006. The venue is The Queen Elizabeth II 
Conference Centre, Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, London SW1P 3EE.  
The nearest Underground stations are St. James’s Park and Westminster. 
DIVIDENDS 
The final dividend of 8.16 pence per ordinary share will be paid on 31 May 
2006 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 21 April 
2006. For holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), the dividend, 
declared in pence, is converted to US dollars on the dividend payment date 
using the exchange rate prevailing on that day. 
PAYMENT OF DIVIDEND 
Shareholders who have mandated their dividends to be credited to a 
nominated bank or building society account should note that dividends  
are paid automatically to their account through the Bankers’ Automated 
Clearing Services (BACS) with the associated tax voucher being sent direct  
to shareholders at their registered address unless requested otherwise. If the 
nominated account is with a bank or building society which is not a member 
of BACS, both the payment and tax voucher are sent to the account holding 
branch. Shareholders who do not currently mandate their dividends and who 
wish to have their dividend paid direct to a bank or building society account 
should complete a dividend mandate instruction form obtainable from Lloyds 
TSB Registrars, The Causeway, Worthing, West Sussex BN99 6DA, or by

the maximum whole number of ordinary shares possible on, or as soon as

costs have been arranged. For further details or an application form please

NOTES: 
1.  Any shareholder entitled to attend and vote at this Meeting may appoint a proxy to 
attend and vote on his/her behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.  
A white form of proxy for use by ordinary shareholders and/or a green form of proxy 
for use by convertible cumulative preference shareholders is/are enclosed. To be valid, 
proxy forms must reach the Company’s registrar by 11.00 am on 20 May 2006. 
2. Only those shareholders registered in the register of members of the Company  
as at 11.00 am on 20 May 2006 shall be entitled to attend and/or vote at this 
Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. 
Changes to entries on the relevant register of securities after 11.00 am on 20 May 
2006 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and/or 
vote at this Meeting. 
3. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic 
proxy appointment service may do so for this Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof 
by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members  
or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed 
a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. 
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be 
valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications and must contain the 
information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual.  
The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an 
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order  
to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID 7RA01) by 
11.00 am on 20 May 2006. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be 
the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by 
enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change  
of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to  
the appointee through other means. 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service 
providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available special procedures  
in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will 
therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member  
is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service 
provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) 
such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means  
of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, 
where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in 
particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations  
of the CREST system and timings. 
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances  
set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.  
4. Copies of the service contracts of executive Directors, the letters of appointment  
of non-executive Directors and the register of Directors’ interests and the interests  
of their connected persons in the share capital of the Company will be available for 
inspection during usual business hours on any weekday (public holidays excepted) at 
East Putney House, 84 Upper Richmond Road, London SW15 2ST from the date of 
this Notice until the time of the Meeting and at The Queen Elizabeth II Conference 
Centre from 15 minutes before the Meeting until it ends.

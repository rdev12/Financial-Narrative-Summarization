 Investor proposition ITV at a Glance
ITV, as an integrated producer broadcaster, creates,  
owns and distributes high-quality content on  
multiple platforms. 
Broadcast  
& Online
We operate the largest commercial family of channels in the UK 
and deliver our content through traditional television broadcasting 
as well as on demand via the ITV Hub.
ITV broadcasts a wide variety of content on its family of free-to-air channels. We invest 
over £1 billion annually in programming for our channels which is primarily funded by 
television advertising revenue. ITV has the largest share of the UK television advertising 
market, and we estimate this share to be 46.1% in 2015 (2014: 45.9%).
The family of channels attracted a total share of viewing (SOV) of 21.2% in 2015 
(2014: 22.0%), the largest audience of any UK commercial broadcaster.
Our main channel is the largest commercial channel in the UK, delivering 98% of all 
commercial audiences over five million. 
Our free-to-air digital channels provide more targeted demographics for advertisers 
such as 16-34’s, ABC1 Men and Housewives with Children, and consist of ITV2 and 
ITV3, the two largest digital channels in the UK, and ITV4, CITV and ITVBe. 
We also have high definition versions of our digital channels available on pay 
platforms along with ITV Encore, our pay only channel available exclusively on Sky. 
In addition to linear broadcast, ITV delivers its content across multiple platforms. 
This is either through the newly launched ITV Hub, now available on over 27 platforms 
including ITV’s website (itv.com) and pay providers such as Virgin and Sky, or through 
direct content deals with services such as Amazon, Apple iTunes and Netflix.

Strategic Report  Overview We have built significant scale in key creative markets around the 
world, creating and producing programmes and formats that return 
and travel, namely drama, entertainment and factual entertainment.
ITV Studios creates and produces content in the UK and internationally, while 
our distribution business, Global Entertainment, sells finished programmes 
and formats worldwide.
ITV Studios UK
ITV Studios UK is the largest commercial producer in the UK. We produce 
programming across a diverse range of genres such as drama, entertainment and 
factual for ITV’s own channels, as well as for other UK broadcasters such as the BBC, 
Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky. 
ITV America
ITV America is the largest unscripted independent producer of content in the US. 
We have acquired a number of unscripted and reality producers and have grown 
our presence in scripted content, using our strong cash flows to produce high profile 
dramas with the potential to travel and build international appeal.
ITV Studios Rest of World
ITV Studios also operates in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Australia and the 
Nordics, producing content for local broadcasters in these regions. This content 
is either created locally or are formats that have been created elsewhere by ITV, 
primarily the UK. 
Global Entertainment
Global Entertainment, ITV’s distribution business, owns the rights of ITV programmes 
and formats and acquires third-party content and distributes this to other 
broadcasters and platforms internationally. Within this business we also finance 
productions both on and off-ITV to acquire global distribution rights.

 ITV at a Glance Market Review
Global demand for content continues to 
grow, with more channels, more platforms 
and new entrants increasing spend on 
high-quality programming. We estimate 
that the global content market is growing 
at around 5% per annum, with some genres 
such as drama growing faster than others. 
This growth can be attributed to a number 
of factors, including: a larger international 
pay television market; convergence in the 
television market, where telecom and 
new media companies are increasingly 
competing with traditional media 
companies for content and viewers; online 
players such as Netflix and Amazon have 
continued to invest heavily in archive and 
new content; and online advertising driven 
platforms like YouTube and Facebook are 
creating a new market for short form and 
digital content. 
The US is by far the largest content market 
in the world, dominating the global 
production sector, with the UK the second 
largest market. This represents a significant 
opportunity for ITV Studios, which has a 
strong presence in both regions. 
Demand for drama, particularly US drama, 
has increased significantly in the last few 
years. Original scripted content becomes 
brand defining for broadcasters and OTT 
players in an increasingly competitive 
global environment. US studios continue 
to dominate the market for drama in 
the US and internationally, however the 
emergence of Netflix and Amazon in 
creating high-quality original scripted 
content has increased competition in the 
market. ITV America has developed a 
number of scripted programmes including 
Over recent years the number of ways to 
watch TV has greatly increased with viewers 
able to choose a variety of platforms, 
both free and pay. Linear viewing remains 
dominant although viewing habits vary 
by demographic with younger viewers 
watching more non-linear content than 
older demographics. Non-linear viewing, 
while currently only a small proportion 
of total viewing, is growing fast and we 
continue to invest in ITV’s online offering, 
for example the ITV Hub, to compete 
successfully in this market.

ITV competes for viewers with the BBC 
and commercial broadcasters including 
Channel 4, Sky and Channel 5. Since the 
digital switchover, the number of available 
channels has grown which has impacted 
the SOV of the traditional broadcasters. 
However, despite an increase in the number 
of channels, ITV and BBC1 continue to be 
the only channels consistently able to 
deliver mass audiences as well as targeted 
demographics, and in 2015 ITV delivered 
98% of all commercial audiences over five 
million viewers. In 2015 the ITV family of 
channels delivered a 21.2% SOV, second 
only to the BBC’s family of channels.
Global Content Broadcast & Online
Aquarius, The Good Witch and Texas Rising. 
Leveraging our network relationships and 
international distribution network, we 
are looking to expand our global scripted 
business and develop a strong portfolio 
of international and returning drama. 
In the UK, there is stronger demand and 
higher viewing figures for UK content over 
imported series. We are a major producer 
of scripted content and have further 
reinforced this position through acquiring 
Mammoth Screen and Twofour Group. 
Our 2015 scripted deliveries included 
Poldark, Unforgotten and Home Fires.
While not growing as quickly as scripted 
content, demand for non-scripted content 
remains strong as networks continue to 
require lower cost, high volume popular 
series. The UK remains the dominant 
producer of unique non-scripted formats, 
producing almost twice as many as the US. 
ITV has significantly strengthened its 
capability in this area with the acquisition 
of Talpa Media. Along with the established 
entertainment and factual entertainment 
genres, scripted reality programming, 
where we have focused our US acquisitions, 
has grown quickly with formats such 
as Pawn Stars, Real Housewives and 
Duck Dynasty.
ITV is now a genuine global player in 
non-scripted content, being the largest 
unscripted independent producer in the 
US, as well as the largest commercial 
production company in the UK. The large 
independent production companies, such 
as Endemol Shine Group and Fremantle 
Media, continue to be ITV Studios’ main 
competitors in non-scripted content. 
The market environment in which we operate 
is dynamic and constantly changing. 
Consolidation of media and telecoms companies and the increasing influence of technology brings both 
challenges and opportunities that we believe we are able to respond to with pace and confidence. 
Key market trends
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 8
Strategic Report  Overview Although broadcast television has seen 
significant change over the last few years 
overall television viewing levels around the 
world have remained high.
Average television viewing in the UK in 2015 
was down 2% compared to 2014. However, 
over a longer-term basis viewing has been 
resilient despite year-on-year fluctuations 
and remains the most popular form of media 
entertainment. UK average television viewing 
in 2015 was 216 minutes per day which is a 
similar level to ten years ago. (source: BARB). 
Pay television
The platform mix in the UK 
is roughly 50% free-to-air 
and 50% pay. 
Free-to-air television is delivered through 
the services Freeview, YouView and Freesat, 
while pay television is delivered through the 
satellite operator Sky and cable operators 
Virgin and BT. Pay television revenue 
continues to grow in aggregate but the 
market dynamics are changing rapidly as 
established pay television providers such 
as Sky and Virgin come under pressure from 
relatively new entrants to the market such 
as BT, Netflix and Amazon. 
Increasingly homes are supplementing 
their free television with other forms of paid 
content including subscription VOD such as 
Netflix, or by purchasing additional channels 
from providers such as BT or Now TV.
ITV participates in the pay television market, 
earning revenue from various third parties, 
including Sky and Virgin, through the licensing 
of channels and content. ITV also has its pay 
only television channel, ITV Encore, on the 
Sky platform along with our other pay 
channels, ITV2 HD, ITV3 HD and ITV4 HD.

Source: Internal estimates
Non-linear viewing of long-form content is 
mostly recorded, or timeshifted viewing and 
catch-up of live television (linear television). It 
also encompasses VOD or Over The Top (OTT) 
delivery of other long-form content such as 
box sets and movies.
While non-linear viewing has grown fast it 
still accounts for a small proportion of total 
viewing time. In the UK we estimate 81% of 
all viewing of legal long-form content is live 
(including simulcast), with a further 12% 
timeshifted via a Personal Video Recorder 
(PVR) and watched within 28 days of the 
original broadcast date. Of the estimated 7% 
of content viewed on demand, 3% is catch-up 
viewing of broadcaster content via the 
television set or to other devices such as 
tablets and mobiles. The remaining 4% of 
content is other VOD viewing, where viewing 
of box sets via services such as Netflix is 
replacing viewing of DVDs. This is growing 
quickly driven by increased availability of 
devices such as smartphones, tablets and 
connected televisions.

Source: Advertising Association January 2016
ITV generates revenues from advertising 
through traditional broadcast and 
online, and competes with commercial 
broadcasters and other advertising media, 
for its advertising revenues. In the UK, 
television has broadly held its share of the 
overall advertising market over the last five 
years, with a share of 27 .5% in 2015 (2010: 
29.2%). Internet advertising has grown its 
share from 29.3% in 2010 to 47 .1% in 2015, 
making the UK one of the most developed 
markets for online advertising. This growth 
is at the expense of print advertising, which 
declined to 15.2% in 2015, down from 30.8% 
in 2010.
The UK television advertising market is 
getting increasingly hard to measure as all 
broadcasters have different definitions, but 
we estimate ITV’s share of broadcast was 
46.1% in 2015, up from 44.7% in 2009. This 
is because of ITV’s unique ability to deliver 
mass audiences across key demographics.
Within online advertising, display accounts 
for 16.9% of the total online advertising 
spend, with the remaining 30.2% spent on 
search and classified. ITV competes within 
the display section of this market, providing 
an advertising platform around our online 
video content.
Pictured left to right: Home Fires was a new 
drama for ITV averaging 6.2 million viewers 
across six episodes. It has been commissioned 
for a second series; Joanna Lumley presented

 Our Strategy and Business Model The last year has seen another period of strong 
progress at ITV with record financial performance 
and further evolution in the shape of the business. 
Chairman’s Statement
This represents the sixth successive 
year of growth and the turnaround 
days of 2010 are now long behind us. 
As a result ITV is a very different 
business today, from that which this 
team inherited. 
The success of ITV depends on driving 
ahead creatively, commercially and 
financially, while at the same time 
combining these strands successfully in 
the context of very strong management 
leadership. Creative potential sits at 
the core of our business, and measured 
in terms of talented people and new 
programme generation, ITV is stronger 
than it has ever been. Commercially 
the year has seen further progress 
in rebalancing the business towards 
content and multi-platform 
broadcasting. Financially we have a 
business generating strong cash flows 
and high return on capital. 
When we started on the original 
transformation programme it was 
commonplace to hear television referred 
to as a no-growth business. In fact, 
many saw our model as in decline. 
Instead we have grown strongly every 
year and emphatically believe our 
combination of multi-platform 
broadcasting and content provides 
a platform for continued growth.
That is not to say that the changing 
broadcast landscape is entirely benign. 
We can all see that changing viewing 
habits, especially amongst young people 
will affect conventional linear television. 
The arrival of new global video on 
demand broadcasters is affecting 
viewing habits and provides new 
competition for top-end drama. 
And new online advertising models 
provide our commercial customers 
with different routes to market.
These challenges are also opportunities 
for ITV. Great content is in demand 
globally. As new viewing opportunities 
emerge so the thirst for really good 
programmes increases. Under its 
international umbrella ITV has an 
extraordinarily diverse but high talent 
set of content businesses. In the UK our 
integrated producer broadcaster model 
is stronger than ever with increasing 
in-house output.
Our audience strength in the UK and 
close working relationships with 
advertisers provides a uniquely powerful 
marketing platform. Far from replacing 
television, the online advertising market 
has reinforced our unique ability to 
provide advertisers with rapid access 
to very large audiences with persuasive 
and emotional branding messages. The 
strength of ITV’s offering has enabled 
it to grow its share of broadcast 
advertising revenues over the last 
five years.
ITV is a remarkable 
place to work and 
employs remarkable 
people. It is thanks to 
their hard work that 
we have produced 
these results.”
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 12
Strategic Report  Strategy and Operations One of the hallmarks of our approach 
has been disciplined control of costs and 
spending. As a result, over 90% of our 
operating profit is converted into cash 
and we have been able to both invest 
in acquisitions and grow progressively 
our dividend. Our approach is to invest 
carefully in selected new growth 
opportunities while at the same 
time making returns to shareholders. 
Within this context we continue to 
look at potential acquisitions that could 
further enhance our ability to execute 
our strategy.
Against this context we maintain a 
conservative balance sheet. That is 
not just a consequence of strong 
performance but a Board policy – to 
maintain low financial risk and to take 
where appropriate bold creative and 
operating decisions.
Our Board structure and workings 
reflect our commitment to a creative, 
commercial and financial management 
philosophy. The ‘team sheet’ includes 
strands of experience and knowledge 
in all three areas. We have a relatively 
small Board, closely engaged with the 
business, supporting but also challenging 
the executive. We believe that the 
strength of a Board comes from its 
understanding of what really goes on in 
the business and a spirit of openness and 
transparency around the Board table.
Dividend

We are very selective about Board 
appointments. Each addition needs to 
add to our skill base and diversity, but 
also relate to the business. Against this 
context I am delighted to welcome 
Anna Manz to our Board. She will bring 
new insight from the consumer world 
and valuable experience.
I believe that the well spring of our 
success is our people and the culture 
that binds them together. ITV is a 
remarkable place to work and employs 
remarkable people. It is thanks to their 
hard work that we have produced 
these results.
Lastly, after the AGM I pass the baton 
on to a talented and accomplished new 
Chairman. After nearly six and a half 
years in what has been a carefully 
planned succession I want to thank 
all our shareholders and colleagues 
for their commitment. 
Being part of ITV during this exciting 
period has been a great privilege.

 Chairman’s Statement Chief Executive’s Review
In 2015 ITV delivered another 
strong performance as we continue 
to strengthen and grow the business. 
We achieved good revenue growth 
across all parts of the business, with 
external revenue up 15%, and for the 
sixth consecutive year we delivered 
double-digit growth in our key 
profit measures. 
ITV’s performance in 2015 builds 
on our consistent record of strong 
results since we launched our strategy 
six years ago. Since 2009 we have 
increased Group external revenues by 
58%, adjusted EBITA by 328%, adjusted 
earnings per share (EPS) by over 800% 
and basic EPS by over 400%. We have 
improved our cash position by turning 
this profit into cash, which has allowed 
us to significantly invest in the business 
while at the same time returning over 
£1.1 billion to shareholders to date, 
with more proposed for 2016. We will 
also maintain financial flexibility to 
continue to invest in the business. 
ITV today is a demonstrably better 
business creatively, commercially and 
financially. We’ve made significant 
progress in reducing our dependence 
on UK spot advertising and in growing 
new revenue streams. In 2015, 49% of 
ITV’s total revenues came from sources 
other than traditional spot advertising.
Our global production business, ITV 
Studios, continues to grow in the UK 
and internationally, both organically 
and through acquisitions in key creative 
markets, and is now a global player 
of scale with over half of its revenues 
coming from outside the UK. Our 
Broadcast business is robust and 
growing as we continue to deliver 
unrivalled audience reach for advertisers, 
and further strong growth in Online, 
Pay & Interactive, which is a material 
and profitable part of the business. 
We are committed to our original vision 
of ITV as an owner and producer of 
world-class content. We are confident 
that our strategy to maximise our value 
as an integrated producer broadcaster, 
making our content famous on multiple 
platforms before distributing it around 
the world, is the right long-term path 
for ITV.
We will continue to strengthen the 
business and grow new revenue 
streams both organically and through 
acquisitions, as we see investment 
opportunities across the business. 
There will be an increasing emphasis 
on building a global pay and distribution 
business as we seek to deliver and 
monetise our content on multiple 
platforms, free and pay. 
We remain focused on delivering 
against our three strategic priorities 
in the areas where we can achieve 
most growth:
 maximising
maximise audience and 
revenue share from 
free-to-air broadcast 
and VOD business

ITV delivers another strong 
performance
In 2015 we grew external revenue by 15% 
to £2,972 million (2014: £2,590 million), 
reflecting 6% growth in NAR to 
£1,719 million (2014: £1,629 million) and 
over £300 million growth in non-NAR to 
£1,664 million (2014: £1,327 million), up 
25%. Together with our continued focus 
on cash and costs we delivered another 
year of double-digit profit growth 
with total adjusted EBITA up 18% 
to £865 million (2014: £730 million), 
corresponding to an improved adjusted 
EBITA margin of 29% (2014: 28%). 
Adjusted EPS in the year increased 20% 
to 16.5p (2014: 13.8p) and statutory EPS 
increased 7% to 12.4p (2014: 11.6p).

Maximise audience and revenue 
share from free-to-air broadcast 
and VOD business
Against the backdrop of a rapidly changing 
media environment, our Broadcast 
business has performed consistently well 
over the last few years and has generated 
significant profit and cash, supported by 
our strong programme schedule, tight 
cost control and a sustained recovery 
in the UK advertising market.
In 2015 Broadcast & Online revenues 
were up 6% to £2,146 million (2014: 
£2,023 million), with adjusted EBITA up 
16% to £659 million (2014: £568 million), 
which reflects 6% growth in highly geared 
NAR and 23% growth in high margin 
Online, Pay & Interactive revenue.
Continued strong advertising growth
In 2015 ITV again outperformed its 
estimate of the television advertising 
market. ITV invests over £1 billion annually 
in programming and has unique scale 
and reach which is much in demand from 
advertisers, delivering mass audiences 
on the ITV main channel as well as more 
targeted demographics on the family of 
channels and on the ITV Hub. This scale 
and strength of our brand underpins 
the success of our free-to-air and on 
demand platforms. 
ITV is also driving more value from its 
brands and for advertisers through 
partnerships and sponsorship deals, 
increased consumer interactivity, and 
by developing new and more targeted 
advertising initiatives to extend 
advertising campaigns beyond the 
television spot, such as AdSync+ and 
ITV AdVentures.

The business remains highly cash

was 91%, even after increased 
investment in our scripted business. 
We ended the year with net debt of 
£319 million (2014: net cash £41 million) 
after acquisitions of £406 million (net 
of cash acquired), dividend payments 
of £459 million and pension deficit 
contributions of £90 million. 
With a strong balance sheet we are 
able to continue to invest in the assets 
underpinning our strategy, developing 
our content, our people and our brand. 
As a people and talent business we 
also continue to drive high employee 
engagement and attract a diverse 
workforce to support the success of ITV. 
Reflecting ITV’s strong performance in 
2015 and in line with its policy, the Board 
has proposed a final dividend of 4.1p. 
This equates to a full year dividend of 
6.0p, up 28%, which is well ahead of 
earnings growth and is a significant step 
forward in taking ITV’s dividend cover 
closer to its policy range.
The Board is also proposing a 
£400 million (10.0p per share) special 
dividend, which comes after a year 
of significant investment at ITV and 
reflects ITV’s strong cash generation and 
the Board’s confidence in the business. 
Following this distribution ITV’s leverage 
remains well below the 1.5x net debt 
to EBITDA ceiling and gives ITV the 
flexibility to continue to invest across 
the business for further growth.
Focus on strengthening viewing 
performance
In 2015 ITV Family Share of Viewing (SOV) 
declined by 3%. While there were many 
successful programmes in the first half, 
our viewing performance was impacted 
by the launch of a number of new 
free-to-air digital channels, some of 
our shows, particularly in the factual 
genre, not performing as well as we 
had expected and relatively strong 
competition from BBC. ITV Family 
Share of Commercial Impacts (SOCI ) 
was down 4%.
We have new creative leadership in place 
and we remain focused on strengthening 
our viewing performance to ensure we 
continue to deliver standout content 
that drives mass audiences for our 
advertisers. We believe that around 
£1 billion is the right level of investment 
for our programme budget and we have a 
strong slate of programmes for 2016 with 
many new and returning programmes 
across all key genres. 
Responsive to a dynamic environment
The market environment in which we 
operate is constantly changing which 
provides both opportunities and 
challenges. Viewers, and particularly the 
younger generation, are changing the 
way they consume content and the digital 
revolution has dramatically increased 
the number of devices and platforms on 
which content is viewed. As a result online 
is one of the fastest growing businesses 
within ITV and we will continue to invest 
in the quality and accessibility of the 
ITV Hub, the new digital home for all our 
channels and services, as well as seeking 
new ways to monetise and distribute 
our content. 
However, while online viewing is growing 
rapidly in the UK, it remains a small 
proportion of total viewing at 7%, with 
the majority of television watched live.
Broadcast markets differ internationally 
and therefore there cannot necessarily 
be a direct read across. However, what 
is common to all markets is that at the 
heart of a successful Broadcast business

 Chief Executive’s Review is owning and exploiting the rights to 
high-quality, ‘must have’ content. That 
is why growing an international content 
business remains central to our strategy 
as an integrated producer broadcaster.
Grow international content business
In 2015, reflecting the strength of our 
global production labels, ITV Studios 
delivered good revenue growth both 
organically and from our acquisitions, 
with growth across the business. Total 
revenue was up 33% to £1,237 million 
(2014: £933 million), of which organic 
revenue was up 8%, while adjusted 
EBITA increased 27% to £206 million 
(2014: £162 million). 
Our vision is to be a scaled international 
business, owning and exploiting rights 
in key genres that travel. In line with 
this, we continue to strengthen our 
position as the UK’s largest commercial 
production company, as well as creating 
an increasingly international business 
with production bases in America, 
the Netherlands, France, Germany, the 
Nordics and Australia. Over half of ITV 
Studios total revenue is generated 
outside the UK and we have become 
a top independent producer across 
Europe and the US.
It is clear that there remains strong 
global demand for high-quality content 
from both broadcasters and platform 
owners. We estimate that the global 
content market is growing at about 5% 
per annum. Capitalising on this demand, 
ITV’s strategy continues to be to 
develop, own and manage content 
with international appeal in the key 
creative markets.
Over the last few years we have built 
scale in production markets with solid 
creative track records both organically 
and through acquisitions. This year we 
have strengthened our business, with 
the acquisitions of T alpa Media in the 
Netherlands and Twofour Group and 
Mammoth Screen in the UK. 
We continue to build scale internationally 
and develop a larger portfolio of 
successful series and formats across 
genres and across their content lifecycle. 
We will focus on programmes that 
return and travel internationally, namely 
drama, entertainment and factual 
entertainment. We have a good slate 
of new and returning programmes 
with 166 new commissions and 176 
recommissions delivered in 2015 and 
many more in the creative pipeline for 
2016 and beyond.
Building a global pay  
and distribution business
As we grow our investment in content 
and own more hit shows that can be 
exported around the world, we are 
creating new windows to extend the 
reach of that content and monetise it 
across more platforms and markets.
Capitalising on growing demand 
for video on demand
Growth in Online, Pay & Interactive 
remains strong with revenue up 23% 
to £188 million (2015: £153 million) as 
viewers are changing the way they 
consume content. We continue to 
see good growth in long-form video 
requests, up 14% while total video 
consumption, which is the measure of 
how long viewers are spending online, 
was up 42%. 
In Autumn 2015 we successfully 
launched our new online service the ITV 
Hub, through which audiences can access 
ITV broadcast content both live and on 
demand. This is a major step forward in 
the quality, innovation and ease of use of 
our online service. Live content is central 
to the Hub and live simulcast viewing 
is becoming increasingly popular 
particularly around sporting events and 
large entertainment shows, as viewers 
are using connected devices as a 
television set. The new service has been 
very well received with consumption 
growing strongly since launch. To 
continue to drive growth in our online 
audiences and advertising revenues, we 
will continuously invest in improving the 
user experience, technology and the 
reach of the ITV Hub, which is now 
available on 27 platforms. 
Further developing pay opportunities
We have built a fast-growing and 
profitable pay business in the UK from 
licensing our channels, including our 
pay channel ITV Encore, and content to 
platforms such as Sky and Virgin. Outside 
the UK we have established a number of 
smaller pay propositions including Cirkus 
and ITV Choice.
Going forward we are looking to explore 
new models for content creation and 
distribution, through a mix of pay 
channels and online. We have invested 
in a number of digital media companies 
and will continue to develop a greater 
expertise and scale in monetising our 
content through a mixed economy 
of organic growth, partnerships 
and acquisitions.
Expanding our global distribution 
network
Global Entertainment’s revenues grew 
9% in 2015 to £157 million (2014: £144 
million) as we have driven value from the 
investments we have made in creating 
and owning content with international 
appeal. In 2015 we invested £163 million 
in scripted content, up £60 million and 
we continue to strengthen our portfolio 
including acquiring third-party content. 
As ITV grows in scale, we will further 
enhance our distribution network, 
benefiting from our increased rights 
ownership and from the stronger 
network relationships we build.

Strategic Report  Strategy and Operations Our acquisitions have also strengthened 
Global Entertainment’s position as a 
leading international distributor of 
content and our focus is now on 
leveraging our creative talent and 
distribution network to build on these 
successes and develop new ways 
to package and sell our content 
internationally. 
Confident of delivering further 
good growth in 2016 and beyond
We expect to deliver another good 
performance in 2016 with continued 
revenue growth across both businesses.
Over the full year we expect to 
outperform our estimate of the 
television advertising market but 
the phasing of NAR over the year is 
expected to be different in 2016, driven 
by the timing of major sporting events. 
We expect ITV NAR to be flat in Q1, 
marginally behind the market, against 
12% growth in Q1 last year. Q2, which 
will benefit from the Euros, should 
be positive. 
We remain focused on strengthening 
our viewing performance and we have 
started 2016 well, with ITV SOV up 5% 
and ITV Family SOV up 2%. Online, Pay 
& Interactive will deliver double digit 
revenue growth, driven particularly by 
Online and Pay as we continue to invest 
in the ITV Hub and further develop our 
international pay model. ITV Studios is 
on track to report double-digit revenue 
and profit growth, primarily driven by our 
recent acquisitions. 
Overall, we see clear opportunities for 
investment in all parts of the business. 
And because of our strong financial 
position and cash conversion, we are 
confident in delivering both continued 
growth and shareholder returns. ITV 
remains well positioned to drive value 
from its talented and creative people, 
our commercial scale, and our global 
network in the creation and distribution 
of content. 
Our people and our responsibility
Building a responsible business that benefits all stakeholders
The success of our strategy depends 
not just on our operational efficiency, 
but also on the way we interact with our 
stakeholders, the wider community and 
the environment. ITV’s social purpose is 
to use the power of the nation’s most 
loved and most watched programmes 
to create change for good. Our 
responsibility strategy is at the heart 
of everything we do with the aim of 
building a responsible and sustainable 
business. As well as complying with our 
legislative and regulatory requirements 
we recognise that our actions can have 
an impact and our reach can positively 
influence society. We therefore work to 
identify issues that are material to ITV 
and matter to our stakeholders, helping 
us to manage reputational risk as well 
as leverage our audience reach to 
benefit our communities.
Our responsibility priorities
Our responsibility strategy is focused 
around three priorities: people, planet 
and partnerships. 
People
T o continue our success as an integrated 
producer broadcaster, we want to 
attract the largest possible audiences 
to our channels and content and attract 
the best people to work for us. To do 
this we need to portray the diverse 
makeup of modern society on-screen 
and ensure our workplace is inclusive.

Our programmes and services also 
need to be accessible to all and we 
exceed the Ofcom targets for subtitling, 
audio description and signing. 
Planet
We rely on energy and often depend 
on the resources of local communities 
to help in the production and 
broadcast of programmes. In 2015, 
we used 100% renewable energy in all 
the buildings we own and Coronation 
Street leads the industry in producing 
a television drama of the highest 
quality with the lowest possible 
environmental impact. See page 88 
for our greenhouse gas disclosures.
Partnerships
We strive to tackle social topics in an 
authentic way and leverage our reach 
to mass audiences to raise awareness 
and money for charity. In 2015, over 
30 hours of airtime were dedicated 
to social action. ITV contributed more 
than £24 million in cash and in-kind 
to support charitable causes, which 
equates to 2.8% of adjusted profit 
before tax. More locally, our people 
volunteered over 1,000 hours of their 
time for a cause they care about.

Strategic Report  Strategy and Operations
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 While the media environment in which we operate 
is constantly changing our Broadcast business 
remains robust and adaptable. ITV is the biggest 
marketing platform in the UK and because of the 
scale of our commercial channels, we reach around 
80% of the television owning population every week. 
We invest over £1 billion in our programme budget, 
significantly more than our commercial competitors, 
and have an unrivalled ability to deliver mass 
audiences across all demographics. 
 See page 30 for more
As a result, there continues to be a strong demand for advertising on 
our family of channels, which generates significant profit and cash to 
reinvest across ITV. Additionally, as an integrated producer broadcaster, 
our broadcast channels also provide an important platform to 
showcase ITV Studios content and give it a proven track record, 
before exploiting it internationally.
Continued strong advertising growth driven by our 
unique offering
Since 2009 ITV has maintained its leading position as the only 
commercial broadcaster consistently able to deliver mass audiences 
to our advertisers. In 2015 ITV delivered 98% of all audiences over 
five million and 93% of all audiences over three million.

ITV’s unique ability to deliver these mass audiences, as well as more 
targeted demographics across the family of channels and the ITV Hub, 
has enabled us to once again grow ITV Family NAR ahead of our 
estimate of the television advertising market, even though our SOV 
declined in the year. SOV provides an overall measure of viewing 
performance, however because advertisers are buying scale and

and The X Factor. Our drama schedule, 
which included Code of a Killer, Safe

Unforgotten and the second series 
of Broadchurch, continued to deliver 
large-scale audiences. 
To drive viewing and engagement in 
our content, we are further developing 
programme apps which continue 
to grow in popularity. Our digital 
engagement has grown significantly 
in the year, delivering 100 million votes 
across our big entertainment shows 
and 40 million paid competition entries. 
Looking ahead we have new creative 
leadership in place and we remain very 
focused on strengthening our viewing 
performance in 2016. We believe that 
around £1 billion is the appropriate 
programme budget for ITV’s family 
of channels to ensure we continue 
to deliver standout content that drives 
the scale and breadth of audiences that 
advertisers demand. We have a strong 
slate of new and returning programmes 
across the key genres. We have 50 hours 
more drama, major football and rugby 
tournaments and will continue to invest 
in daytime and soaps. Our 2016 schedule 
includes new programmes such as

Television remains the most efficient 
and effective advertising medium 
for advertisers to achieve mass 
simultaneous reach. Although television 
has seen some price inflation over the 
last few years, the cost of advertising is 
similar to 2004 levels and compared to 
many other advertising media it remains 
good value, especially given the reach 
and scale that it delivers. As the viewing 
and advertising landscape continues to 
fragment, the scale of audience that 
television, and particularly ITV delivers, 
becomes increasingly valuable.

Maximising the value of our airtime
ITV is also focused on maximising the 
value of its airtime and driving new 
revenue streams through sponsorship, 
interactivity and branded content. 
ITV can utilise its core assets of its 
strong brand and reputation, unique 
commercial relationships and quality 
production capability to deliver a wide 
variety of marketing solutions. To date 
we have implemented many innovative 
sponsorship deals including Aunt Bessie’s 
for I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! 
and Land Rover and SSE for the Rugby 
World Cup. We have also produced a 
number of branded content solutions 
with our new service ITV AdVentures 
for Suzuki and National Lottery and we 
have launched AdSync+, a partnership 
with RadiumOne to amplify the reach 
of our television advertising. In 2016 
we will also be introducing more 
targeted advertising.
Ongoing focus on strengthening 
viewing performance
Although we had many on-screen 
successes in 2015, ITV Family’s SOV 
declined by 3% with ITV main channel 
SOV down 4% and the digital channels 
SOV down 3%. This performance was a 
result of the launch of some new free 
digital channels, a number of our shows 
not performing as well as we had 
expected, particularly in the factual 
genre, and relatively strong competition 
from the BBC.
However, we enjoyed many real 
successes in the year – we broadcast the 
most watched entertainment show in 
Britain’s Got T alent, the most watched 
soap in Coronation Street, the most 
watched drama in Downton Abbey and 
the most watched sporting event with 
England vs. Wales during the Rugby 
World Cup. Our daytime schedule 
improved, including Good Morning 
Britain, and we also launched a number 
of new entertainment shows including 
Mission Survive, Ninja Warrior UK and

Remaining responsive to a changing 
media environment
The market in which we operate is 
constantly changing but traditional 
linear television viewing remains 
resilient despite significant changes in 
the availability and delivery of content. 
Broadcaster and other VOD is growing 
rapidly, but it is a gradual process and still 
only accounts for 7% of total viewing. 
On average viewers watch 216 minutes 
of television a day, which is a similar level 
to 2004 of 222 minutes. The majority of 
television viewing is live, which we 
estimate to be 81%, as television 
continues to have the power to bring 
audiences together. Live event television 
in particular has demonstrated resilience 
and a growing relevance as viewers 
increasingly connect through social 
media and they continue to deliver very 
significant audiences. Therefore large 
sporting events, which also deliver 
valuable demographics, continue to be 
an important part of our schedule and as 
well as the Rugby Six Nations we have 
also recently secured British horseracing 
from 2017 .
Many consumers, particularly younger 
viewers, are engaging in an increasing 
amount of content and entertainment 
via other platforms such as social media 
and video games, but television viewing 
continues to dominate the way people 
like to be entertained.
Broadcast markets differ internationally. 
The key European markets are 
structurally different to the US, driven 
by the strength of free-to-air television, 
the level of pay penetration and the cost 
of pay. Therefore while lessons can be 
learnt from other countries, there can 
be no direct read-across. 
The market in which we 
operate is constantly 
changing but traditional 
linear television viewing 
remains resilient despite 
significant changes in 
the availability and 
delivery of content.”
Pictured left to right: This Morning is one of 
the longest running daytime programmes in 
the UK and has been broadcast on ITV since 
1989; Black Work was ITV’s most watched 
new drama in 2015 with an average of 7.6m 
viewers across the three-part series.
Three attributes lie at the heart of ITV’s 
successful Broadcast proposition: it’s 
first-class distribution and reach across 
all platforms; owning the rights to 
high-quality, must have content, for all 
key audiences; and providing advertisers 
with creative access to the biggest and 
most effective marketing platform in 
the UK. 
2016 and beyond
On 29th February 2016 ITV completed 
its acquisition of 100% of UTV Ltd, 
the television assets of UTV plc. This 
further strengthens ITV’s free-to-air 
business and enables it to run a more 
efficient network.
As we continue to invest in our 
integrated producer broadcast model, 
our priority is to strengthen our 
on-screen performance and we have 
started 2016 well, with ITV SOV up 
5% and ITV Family SOV up 2%. We are 
also focused on maintaining the scale 
of our audiences because as the viewing 
and advertising landscape continues 
to fragment, this becomes increasingly 
valuable to advertisers.
Over the full year we again expect 
to outperform our estimate of the 
television advertising market, although 
the phasing of NAR is expected to be 
different in 2016, driven by the timing 
of major sporting events. We expect 
ITV NAR to be flat in Q1, marginally 
behind the market, against 12% growth 
in Q1 last year. Q2, which will benefit 
from the Euros, should be positive.

Growing a scaled international content business is central to our 
strategy as an integrated producer broadcaster. As ITV creates and 
owns more content, our channels provide a platform to showcase 
our programmes before distributing them across multiple platforms 
in the UK and internationally.
 See page 30 for more
Growing global demand for content
The strong global demand for content from 
broadcasters and platform owners provides 
a significant opportunity for ITV Studios. 
We estimate that the global content market 
is growing at about 5% per annum, with some 
genres such as drama growing more quickly 
than others. To capitalise on this, our strategy 
remains to develop, own and manage content 
rights in genres that return and travel 
internationally, namely drama, entertainment 
and factual entertainment. 
In 2015 we again delivered strong growth 
with revenues up 33% to £1,237 million 
(2014: £933 million) and EBITA up 27% to 
£206m (2014: £162 million). This builds on 
the significant growth we have achieved 
over the last few years, more than doubling 
revenues from £600m in 2009 to over 
£1.2 billion in 2015. This growth has been 
achieved organically as well as through a mix 
of acquisitions, partnerships, investments 
and talent deals. 
Building scale in creative markets
ITV Studios has three production divisions – ITV Studios UK, ITV America and ITV Studios 
Rest of World. The US and UK are the dominant creative markets, with the US the largest 
exporter of scripted content and the UK the world leader for exported formats. 
Over the last few years we have built scale in these key markets, developing a portfolio 
of successful series and formats. We have made 16 acquisitions since 2012 mainly in the 
UK and US and also more recently T alpa Media in the Netherlands. Our original business 
(excluding all acquisitions we have made) continues to perform well, delivering a 5% 
compound annual growth rate since 2009, although production businesses do not deliver 
straight-line revenue growth.

In total in 2015 we produced over 
7 ,000 hours of content by our 58 labels, 
supplying over 90 channels. We have 
delivered good revenue growth across 
our three production divisions and 
we have cemented our position as the 
number one commercial producer 
in the UK and have become a leading 
independent producer in Europe and the 
US. Over half of our revenues now come 
from outside the UK as we are becoming 
an increasingly international business. 
Investing in content with 
international appeal
To become increasingly international we 
must continue to expand our portfolio 
of successful series and formats that 
return and that can be distributed 
globally. We have a strong mix of 
programmes across genres and also 
across their content life cycle which 
balances our risk and financial exposure. 
We continue to invest in our pipeline of 
ideas to ensure that we are adding to our 
catalogue of programmes every year. 
ITV Studios UK performed strongly in 
2015 with overall revenues up 19%, with 
good growth in sales to ITV and to other 
UK broadcasters. With the acquisition of 
Mammoth Screen and Twofour Group 
we have strengthened our production 
capability across the genres of drama, 
entertainment, factual entertainment 
and comedy, as well as helping to 
drive further growth in our off-ITV 
commissions. We have delivered series 
such as The Graham Norton Show 
(BBC1), 24 Hours in A&E (Channel 4), 
10,000 BC (Channel 5), and following 
these recent acquisitions our portfolio 
includes Poldark (BBC), The Voice (BBC), 
Educating Cardiff (Channel 4) and Posh 
Pawn (Channel 4).
ITV Studios UK is also focused on 
growing its share of original content 
commissioned on the ITV main channel. 
In 2015 ITV Studios delivered 60% of the 
total spend on original commissions on 
the ITV main channel. This is a similar 
proportion to 2014 but in terms of 
revenue, total sales to Broadcast 
increased by 12%. New commissions 
delivered to ITV include Thunderbirds 
Are Go!, Ninja Warrior UK, Home Fires, 
Unforgotten and Jekyll & Hyde. 
ITV America also had a strong year with 
revenues up 36% as it benefited from 
the delivery of major new dramas and 
a high volume of programmes from 
our stable portfolio of unscripted series, 
including Duck Dynasty, Pawn Stars 
and two series of Hell’s Kitchen USA.
We saw good growth across ITV Studios 
Rest of World (RoW) with revenues 
up 124%, where our production bases 
in Australia, Germany, France, the 
Netherlands and the Nordics produce 
original content as well as local versions 
of ITV Studios formats. This division 
benefited from the significant 
acquisition of T alpa Media in the year 
and also delivered a number of new 
and returning commissions including

as standout, original content becomes

and OTT players in an increasingly 
competitive global environment. We 
are looking to leverage our network 
relationships and international 
distribution network, to expand our 
global scripted business and develop 
a strong portfolio of international and 
returning drama. 
Reflecting the Group’s strong financial 
position and cash generation, we are 
now able to finance larger-scale scripted 
projects through working capital. 
The production cost is partly funded 
by the initial sale of the series to the 
broadcaster, while the deficit is recovered 
through distribution revenue from 
selling the finished product globally to 
other broadcasters and platforms. We 
balance our financial exposure through 
our portfolio approach, with successful 
international dramas offsetting the risk 
that we will not recover the full deficit 
on every show. 
During 2015 we have delivered three 
major drama series in the US, The Good 
Witch, Aquarius and Texas Rising, of 
which The Good Witch and Aquarius 
have been recommissioned. In the 
UK we have also delivered or have in 
production Mr Selfridge s4, Endeavour 
s3, Poldark s2 and Vera s6 which all 
have international appeal. 
We continue to perform well 
internationally in the entertainment 
and factual entertainment genres. 
In response to continued demand 
from networks, we have grown a solid 
portfolio of high volume, high margin 
formats including Duck Dynasty, 
Pawn Stars, Come Dine with Me, 
I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!, 
Hell’s Kitchen USA and The Chase. 
Over the last few years we have 
strengthened our exposure to this genre 
with a number of partnerships, including 
in 2015, Possessed Television and Cats 
on the Roof and most significantly T alpa 
Media, which we acquired in April 2015 
which is focused on developing new 
entertainment formats that attract 
large audiences and have significant 
commercial potential. Benefiting from 
the creative input of John De Mol and his 
management team, who will continue 
to work with ITV, T alpa has created 
75 shows and has aired programmes in 
more than 180 countries over the last six 
years, including The Voice, The Voice Kids, 
I Love My Country, Dating in the Dark and

As digital media and consumer behaviour continue to evolve, 
our ability to create and distribute high-value content in 
new and efficient ways is of increasing significance. ITV is 
continually exploring and experimenting with new ways to 
distribute our content to broadcasters and platform owners, 
both free and pay, while also seeking new opportunities to 
extend the reach of our content for the consumer.
 See page 30 for more
Capitalising on growing demand for VOD through the ITV Hub
Changes in technology and the growing base of connected devices are driving 
rapid growth in audiences’ appetite for VOD and in turn fuelling demand from 
advertisers for VOD inventory. ITV as a creator and owner of content, particularly 
sought after drama and entertainment content, is well placed to exploit this 
growing customer base.
Our Online business has grown rapidly over the last few years and is contributing 
meaningful revenue to the Group. In November we successfully launched the 
ITV Hub to replace ITV Player and ITV.com across mobile, PC and connected TV, 
through which audiences can access ITV content on different devices, live 
or on demand. This is a major step forward in the quality, innovation and ease 
of use of ITV’s online services. The biggest change is that live content is now 
central to the ITV Hub and live simulcast viewing is becoming increasingly popular 
particularly around sporting events and large entertainment shows, as viewers 
are using their connected devices as a television set. Simulcast viewing now 
represents about 30% of viewing on the platforms on which it is available. 
To drive growth in our online audiences and online advertising revenues we 
have also been working to increase the distribution of the ITV Hub which is now 
available on 27 platforms, most recently launching on Amazon Fire, YouView Sony 
and Freeview Play. Long-form video requests continue to grow strongly up 14% 
in 2015, driven by mobile and connected televisions. Online consumption, which is 
the measure of how long viewers are spending online, has also increased by 42% 
reflecting the quality of ITV’s content and the improved viewing experience of the 
ITV Hub. 
To date there have been 21 million downloads of our app and to further increase 
usage we will continually extend and enhance the ITV Hub with improvements in 
technology and new content, such as premieres, box sets and short-form content. 
Overall the new service has been very well received by both audiences and 
advertisers, with consumption growing strongly since launch, particularly for live 
viewing where our audiences enjoy the new ‘live swipe’ feature on smartphones 
and tablets and the ITV Hub’s improved streaming quality. 
Additionally, we are working to 
maximise the value of our digital 
data. We have introduced new 
digital advertising features like 
AdSync+ as well as dynamically-
served advertising on ITV’s live 
simulcast channels on PC and 
Apple platforms. With 13 million 
registered users of the ITV Hub, we 
are not only able to understand and 
engage with our audiences better 
but we are also developing more 
targeted advertising online in 2016.

we have already increased our exposure 
to new types of content including 
short-form and younger focused 
long-form programming and new types 
of distribution. We are widening our 
digital reach by expanding our presence 
on YouTube to bring new audiences to 
our programmes. In 2015 we launched 
22 new ITV branded channels across a 
range of our biggest programme brands. 
We saw usage increase over 400% 
across the year on the ITV branded 
channels to deliver over 160million 
views, the equivalent of over 8 million 
hours of viewing. 
T alpa has a very strong digital presence 
internationally across its range of 
formats. Since 2014 it has developed 
10 successful connected live formats 
including The Voice, The Voice Kids and 
Dance Dance Dance, in 40 countries, with 
90 apps/sites and 100 YouTube channels, 
in total delivering over 12 billion views. 
We have made investments in the 
digital arena as we look to develop our 
expertise in monetising online audiences. 
These include: Believe Entertainment 
Group, a producer of digital-branded 
short-form entertainment; Zealot, a 
digital content multi-platform network; 
Indigenous Media, a producer of scripted 
digital content; and Channel Mum, 
the first ever online video network 
dedicated to young mothers.
Looking ahead we will further develop 
our pay offering both in the UK and 
internationally exploring opportunities 
for both pay and online as we seek to 
monetise our content further. We will 
look to do this through a mixed economy 
of organic growth, partnerships and 
acquisitions. We will also increasingly 
look for opportunities to ‘window’ our 
content across our free channels, pay 
channels and the ITV Hub to derive 
maximum value for audiences, 
platforms and advertisers.
Further developing our pay offering 
in the UK and internationally
ITV earns revenue from pay television 
through licensing our channels and 
content. 2015 pay revenue grew by 
38% as we continued to develop our 
services across multiple platforms.
Our pay business in the UK includes deals 
with Sky and Virgin for our HD channels 
and catch-up VOD, an advertising free 
subscription version of the ITV Hub on 
iOS and a deal with Sky to make ITV’s 
content available through its connected 
platforms including Sky Go and Now TV. 
In 2014 we launched our first pay 
channel, ITV Encore, which we are 
strengthening with more exclusive 
content including original commissions 
such as The Frankenstein Chronicles and 
Houdini & Doyle and critically acclaimed 
acquired series such as The Americans 
and Jordskott.
Outside the UK we have established 
a number of smaller pay propositions 
including Cirkus, a subscription VOD 
service that offers the ‘Best of British’ 
content to international pay platforms 
which is available in the Nordics and 
more recently in Iceland. We also 
distribute ITV Essentials, an online 
service for expats, and ITV Choice, a 
general entertainment channel for 
emerging markets which was recently 
launched in South Africa.

Key Performance Indicators
We have defined our KPIs to align our performance  
and accountability to our strategy.
These KPIs are the key measures of 
success and cover all three strategic 
priorities. Our KPIs have not changed 
over the year.
Our strategic priorities
  Maximise audience and  
revenue share from free-to-air 
broadcast and VOD business
  G row i n t e r n a t i o n a l  
content business
  Build a global pay and  
distribution business
Financial
Adjusted EBITA
Definition
This is the key profitability measure 
used across the whole business. 
Earnings before interest, tax and 
amortisation (EBITA) is before 
exceptional items and has been 
adjusted to include the benefit of 
production tax credits. It reflects our 
performance in a consistent manner 
and in line with how the business 
is managed and measured on a 
day-to-day basis.
Performance
In 2015 adjusted EBITA increased by 
£135 million or 18%. This increase was 
a result of the 15% increase in Group 
external revenue which was driven 
by a 6% increase in Net Advertising 
Revenue, a 23% increase in Online, 
Pay & Interactive revenue and a 124% 
increase in ITV Studios Rest of World 
revenue driven by the acquisition 
of Talpa. 
Group EBITA margin once again 
increased, up to 29% from 28% 
in 2014.
Adjusted EPS
Definition
Adjusted EPS represents the adjusted 
profit for the year attributable to 
equity shareholders. Adjusted profit 
is defined as profit for the year 
attributable to equity shareholders 
before exceptional items, impairment 
of intangible assets, amortisation 
of intangible assets acquired 
through business combinations, net 
financing cost adjustments and tax 
adjustments relating to these items.
It reflects the business performance 
of the Group in a consistent manner 
and in line with how the business 
is managed and measured on a 
day-to-day basis.
Performance
Adjusted EPS increased by 20% or 
13.8p to 16.5p. This reflects the 
increase in adjusted EBITA of 18%.

Profit to cash 
conversion
Definition
Profit to cash conversion represents 
the proportion of adjusted EBITA 
converted into a measure of 
adjusted cash flow (defined as cash 
generated from operations before 
exceptional items less cash related 
to the acquisition of operating 
property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets).
This primarily reflects our working 
capital management and capital 
expenditure control. Our aim is to 
keep profit to cash conversion as 
high as possible.
Performance
Profit to cash has been maintained at 
a strong level in excess of 90%. This is 
despite our continued investment in 
scripted content and demonstrates 
our continued focus on working 
capital management.
Non-NAR revenue
Definition
Growing non-NAR is key to the 
strategy as we aim to rebalance 
the business away from our reliance 
on television advertising revenue. 
Non-NAR includes all ITV revenue, 
both internal and external, except 
NAR (spot advertising revenues).
Key drivers of non-NAR are the 
growth in Online, Pay & Interactive 
and ITV Studios, particularly 
international.
Performance
Non-NAR revenue increased by 25% 
in 2015 as we continue to rebalance 
the business away from a reliance 
on NAR. Growth was driven by ITV 
Studios revenues which saw both 
organic and acquisition revenues 
increase, and from Online and Pay 
revenue. Non-NAR revenues were 
49% of total revenues which has 
increased significantly since 2009 
when it was 40%. 
Employee 
engagement
Definition
Continuing to develop a creative, 
commercial and global organisation 
requires high-quality employees who 
are engaged in the work that they do, 
and are committed to the strategy.
Employee engagement measures 
pride in the work we do, pride in 
working for ITV and also what we say 
about our programmes and services.
Performance
Employee engagement was once 
again high at 89% which is above 
the benchmark rate of 83%. The 
participation rate was 74%.

Strategic
ITV Family SOCI
Definition
Strategic Priority 1 aims to maximise 
audience share from our existing 
free-to-air Broadcast business, and 
ITV Family SOCI is another indicator 
of this. SOCI is the trading currency 
in the television advertising market, 
and since it only covers commercial 
television it does not include the BBC. 
This is the share of total UK television 
commercial impacts which is 
delivered by ITV’s family of channels. 
An impact is one viewer watching 
one 30 second commercial. We aim 
to maximise our SOCI.
SOCI provides an overall measure 
of viewing performance, however 
because advertisers are buying scale 
and breadth of audience, SOCI is 
not necessarily a direct indicator 
of advertising performance. 
Performance
ITV Family SOCI declined by 4%, with 
the main channel down 4%. The 
digital channels SOCI was down 3%.
ITV Family SOV
Definition
Strategic Priority 1 aims to maximise 
audience share from our existing 
free-to-air Broadcast business, 
and ITV Family SOV is the clearest 
indicator of this. ITV Family SOV 
is ITV’s share of the total viewing 
audience over the year achieved 
by ITV’s family of channels as a 
proportion of total television viewing, 
including the BBC Family. ITV aims at 
least to maintain the ITV Family SOV.
Performance
ITV Family SOV declined by 3% in 2015 
to 21.2%. Within this, the ITV main 
channel saw a decline of 4% impacted 
by the launch of new free digital 
channels, some of our shows not 
performing as well as we had 
expected, particularly in the first 
half of the year and by the relatively 
strong performance of the BBC. 
The digital channels were down 3%.
ITV Family SOV improved in the 
second half of 2015 with strong 
performances in Daytime, the Soaps, 
Sport and Entertainment.
ITV Family share  
of broadcast
Definition
ITV’s share of UK television spot 
advertising revenue is known as its 
share of broadcast. To maximise 
revenue from our free-to-air business, 
which is a key component of Strategic 
Priority 1, we aim to continue to 
maximise our share of broadcast 
and to outperform the UK television 
advertising market.
It is increasingly difficult to measure 
the total television advertising 
market as all broadcasters have 
different definitions and include 
other sources of revenue, such 
as sponsorship and VOD in their 
estimates of television advertising. 
Our share of broadcast is based on 
our estimate of the pure spot 
advertising market.
Performance
In 2015 we gained market share again, 
increasing our share of broadcast to 
46.1%. This is as a result of our unique 
ability to deliver mass audiences 
across the key demographics to 
our advertisers.

Total long-form 
video requests
 
Definition
A key part of our strategy is to 
maximise audience share from 
our free-to-air broadcast and 
VOD business. 
Long-form video requests is a 
measure of the total number of our 
videos viewed across all platforms 
on which the ITV Hub is available and 
therefore provides a key measure 
of how much of our content is being 
viewed online. A long-form video is a 
programme that has been broadcast 
on television and is available to watch 
online and on demand in its entirety. 
Performance
Long-form video requests were up 
14% in 2015 to 828 million views. 
To support growth in our online 
audiences we launched the ITV Hub 
in November 2015 and have improved 
our mobile apps and simulcast 
offering. Online consumption, which 
is the measure of how long viewers 
are spending online, is becoming 
increasingly important as an indicator 
of online performance and this has 
increased by over 40% in 2015.
Number of new 
commissions for  
ITV Studios
Definition
A key indicator of the creative 
renewal pipeline is the number of new 
commissions won. This figure includes 
programmes shown both on ITV and 
on other broadcasters, and both in 
the UK and internationally.
Performance
There was strong growth in the 
number of new commissions for 
ITV Studios in 2015, up 11% to 166. 
Fifty-eight of these new commissions 
have come from the UK business, 
with the remaining 108 coming 
from our international businesses. 
We continue to invest in our 
creative pipeline both organically 
and through acquisitions.
Percentage of  
ITV* output from 
ITV Studios
Definition
This represents the proportion of the 
total spend on original commissions 
on ITV transmitted in the year, 
delivered by ITV Studios. A key part 
of building a strong international 
content business is to increase ITV 
Studios’ supply of programmes to ITV, 
where we aim to make them famous 
and then sell them around the world, 
benefiting from our integrated 
producer broadcaster status.
Performance
The percentage of ITV output from 
ITV Studios has remained flat in 2015, 
although the value has increased 
as ITV’s total original commissions 
has increased. Several ITV Studios 
programmes created in 2015 have 
now been distributed around the 
world including Thunderbirds Are Go!, 
Mr Selfridge, The Chase and I’m A 
Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!
* ITV Main Channel only.

ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 36
Strategic Report  Performance and Financials Growth in NAR and high margin Online, Pay & Interactive 
revenue combined with the growth in ITV Studios and our 
continued focus on costs, delivered an 18% increase in adjusted 
EBITA to £865 million (2014: £730 million), resulting in a 1% 
improvement in the adjusted EBITA margin to 29%. Adjusted 
EPS grew 20% to 16.5p (2014: 13.8p) while reported EPS grew 
7% to 12.4p (2014: 11.6p). Reported EPS grew at a slower rate 
than adjusted EPS primarily because of the treatment of 
employment linked consideration for our acquisitions which 
is included within reported earnings. This is explained over 
the following pages.
We remain focused on balance sheet efficiency and working 
capital management. Despite increased investment in scripted 
content, our profit to cash ratio remained strong at 91%. After 
acquisitions of £406 million (net of cash acquired), dividend 
payments of £459 million and our deficit pension contributions 
of £90 million, we ended 2015 with net debt of £319 million 
(31 December 2014: net cash of £41 million). This gives us the 
financial flexibility to continue to invest in the business.

The Financial and Performance Review focuses on the adjusted 
results, which, in management’s view, reflect the underlying 
performance of the business, providing a more meaningful 
comparison of how the business is managed and measured 
on a day-to-day basis. 
The key adjustments are to reflect production tax credits in 
EBITA before exceptional items (‘adjusted EBITA’) and remove 
the effect of certain items from adjusted profit before tax 
and EPS. These include all operating and non-operating 
exceptional items primarily acquisition-related costs such as: 
employment linked consideration and professional fees for 
due diligence; impairment of intangible assets; amortisation 
of intangible assets acquired through business combinations 
including formats and customer contracts; net financing cost 
adjustments; and tax adjustments relating to these items. 
A full reconciliation between our adjusted and statutory 
results is provided on page 43.

The television advertising market again showed strong 
growth with NAR up 6% to £1,719 million (2014: 1,629 million) 
and continued good growth across all the major advertising 
categories. The Finance advertising category was driven by 
traditional banking brands and the Retail and Food sectors 
remained strong with supermarkets and furniture stores 
increasing spend. We saw strong growth from technology 
companies such as Google and Facebook as well as new digital 
brands, such as Just Eat and Purple Bricks, all using TV to build 
brand awareness. Entertainment & Leisure did see a decline 
which was as a result of significant spend by bookmakers in 
2014 around the Football World Cup.

As expected, the phasing of NAR was different in 2015 
reflecting the timing of major sporting events. The first 
quarter saw strong growth of 12% benefiting from an earlier 
Easter, while the second quarter was flat against a strong Q2 
2014 which benefited from the Football World Cup. The 
third quarter was up 8% with increased spend around the 
Rugby World Cup with the fourth quarter up 4%. Overall 
ITV’s underlying advertising performance was consistently 
strong in both the first and second halves of the year. 
Over the full year we increased our estimated share 
of broadcast to 46.1% (2014: 45.9%) as we once again 
outperformed our estimate of the UK television advertising 
market. It is becoming increasingly difficult to measure the 
pure spot advertising market as all broadcasters use 
different definitions, which may include additional sources 
of revenue such as sponsorship and VOD in their estimates 
of television advertising. 
ITV Family SOV declined 3% in 2015. This reflects a 4% decline 
in the ITV main channel SOV which was impacted by more 
competition from the launch of new digital channels in the 
year including Spike and Your TV, some of our shows not 
performing as well as we had expected and the relatively 
strong performance of the BBC. ITV2 also contributed to the 
decline, partly as a result of our repositioning of the channel 
to provide more targeted audiences for our advertisers. We 
remain focused on strengthening our viewing performance 
and continuing to deliver mass audiences.
Online, Pay & Interactive revenue continued to show strong 
growth, up 23% to £188 million (2014: £153 million) reflecting 
further growth in both our online advertising and pay 
businesses. In November we successfully launched the ITV Hub, 
the new digital home for our online services, which has had a 
very encouraging start. Audience demand for VOD continues 
to grow strongly which helped drive a 14% increase in long-
form video requests and 42% increase in consumption. There 
remains strong demand for online advertising which helped 
drive significant growth in online revenue. We continue to 
develop our pay services with Pay revenue benefiting from 
a full twelve months of revenue from ITV Encore and strong 
demand for ITV video on demand services. Interactive revenue 
was up in the year with daytime competitions performing well. 
Voting on our programme apps increased exponentially as we 
introduced a free voting strategy. X Factor delivered 24 million 
votes and I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! delivered total 
votes of over 56 million.
SDN external revenue, which is generated from licence sales 
for DTT Multiplex A, decreased 10% to £64 million (2014: 
£71 million). This was as a result of lower renewal fees for 
existing long-term contracts which expired during the year.
Other commercial income was up 3% to £175 million (2014: 
£171 million), reflecting growth in sponsorship for the Rugby 
World Cup and brand extensions through a number of 
innovative solutions including Land Rover and SSE for the 
Rugby World Cup and Aunt Bessie’s for I’m A Celebrity…Get Me 
Out Of Here! Other commercial income also includes revenue 
from media sales, which relates to commission earned by ITV 
on sales of airtime for the non-consolidated licensees, as well 
as minority revenue from these licensees for ITV content. 
As expected, performance across both revenue streams 
was largely unchanged.
Schedule costs were up 3% to £1,045 million (2014: £1,018 
million) predominantly due to the full year costs of ITVBe 
and ITV Encore. Sports rights savings on the FA Cup and 
Champions League were partly offset by the costs of the 
Rugby World Cup. Going forward we believe that this is around 
the right level of programme spend although the genre mix 
will change each year. 
Other Broadcast costs increased marginally, up 1% to 
£442 million (2014: £437 million). We maintain a tight control 
on costs and will continue to deliver savings to mitigate 
inflationary pressure.
Overall Broadcast & Online adjusted EBITA was up 16% to 
£659 million (2014: £568 million). The continued growth in 
our highly geared advertising revenue, together with high 
margin revenue growth in Online, Pay & Interactive, resulted in 
the adjusted EBITA margin increasing 3% to 31% (2014: 28%). 
On 29th February 2016, ITV completed its acquisition of 100% 
of UTV Ltd, which owns the televisions assets of UTV Plc, for 
£100 million. This will further strengthen ITV’s free-to-air 
business and enable it to run a more efficient network. As part 
of the transaction ITV has taken on responsibility for the UTV 
defined benefit pension scheme.

ITV Studios total revenue grew strongly, exceeding £1 billion 
for the first time as we continue to build scale in creative 
content markets and strengthen our international portfolio 
of programmes that return and travel. ITV Studios is becoming 
increasingly international, and reflecting our growth and 
increasing scale in key production markets in Europe and the 
US, 53% of ITV Studios total revenue in the year was generated 
outside the UK (2014: 47%).
Total organic revenue, which excludes our current and prior 
year acquisitions as well as foreign exchange movements, 
was up 8%. There was growth across the business, with a 
particularly strong performance from ITV America and Global 
Entertainment. Our acquisitions continue to come through, 
with twelve months of Leftfield Entertainment as well as 
T alpa Media from 30 April 2015 and our UK acquisitions 
including Twofour Group from 24 June 2015. The foreign 
exchange impact was immaterial as the stronger US dollar was 
offset by our greater exposure to a weakening Euro following 
the T alpa acquisition.

Studios UK revenue was up 19% to £547 million (2014: 
£459 million) reflecting 13% growth in internal revenue and 
39% growth in external revenue. Organic revenue was up 5%. 
There were increased programming sales to Broadcast 
across both drama and entertainment, with new deliveries 
including The Trials of Jimmy Rose, Unforgotten, Home Fires, 
Thunderbirds Are Go! and Ninja Warrior UK. Successful 
recommissions On-ITV included Saturday Night T akeaway, 
The Chase and Judge Rinder. Off-ITV revenue grew strongly 
with successful deliveries including Poldark and The Graham 
Norton Show for the BBC and Come Dine With Me and 24 
Hours in A&E for Channel 4.
ITV America grew strongly in 2015, with revenue up 36% to 
£320 million (2014: £235 million) as we benefited from good 
organic growth, up 15% driven by the delivery of our three 
US dramas, Best Time Ever, a US remake of Saturday Night 
T akeaway, and two series of Hells Kitchen. ITV America also 
benefited from the first full year of Leftfield Entertainment, 
acquired in May 2014. Following this acquisition, we became 
the largest unscripted independent producer in the US and we 
now have a strong portfolio of returning series and formats 
including Hell’s Kitchen, Pawn Stars, Duck Dynasty, Marriage 
Bootcamp, The Real Housewives of New Jersey and The Rich 
Kids Of Beverly Hills. 
Studios RoW also showed strong growth, up 124% to 
£213 million (2014: £95 million), with organic revenue up 4%. 
We have benefited from T alpa Media which we acquired on 
30 April 2015, significantly strengthening our position as a 
leading international producer. We also saw good growth in 
Australia and Denmark from exporting UK formats. 2015 
deliveries included I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! in 
Australia and Denmark, The Chase in Germany and Norway, 
and Hell’s Kitchen in France. 
Global Entertainment revenue increased 9% in the year 
to £157 million (2014: £144 million). Revenue growth was 
supported by our strong programme slate including new titles 
Poldark and Schitt’s Creek, as well as US drama Aquarius and 
the launch of Thunderbirds Are Go!, which has now been sold 
to 90 countries with key territories such as the US and France 
launching in 2016. We expect to benefit from merchandising 
around the series as we continue to extend the franchise 
beyond the television set. 
Reflecting the strong revenue growth across ITV Studios, 
adjusted EBITA increased 27% to £206 million (2014: 
£162 million). The adjusted EBITA margin remains unchanged 
at 17% even after significant investment in scripted content. 
In 2015 we invested £163 million in scripted content, up 
£60 million. We are financing our larger-scale scripted projects 
through our strong underlying cashflows. The production cost 
is partly funded by the initial sale of the series to a broadcaster, 
Strategic Report
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 39
 Financial and Performance Review while the deficit is recovered through distribution revenue 
from selling the finished product globally to other 
broadcasters and platforms. We balance our financial 
exposure through our portfolio approach, with successful 
international dramas offsetting the risk that we will not 
recover the full deficit on every show. 
Overall, we delivered many creative successes in the year, 
including two of our US dramas – Aquarius and The Good Witch 
being recommissioned. Given the nature of our business not 
all our programmes will return for another series in 2016, 
for example Jekyll & Hyde and Best Time Ever, but we have 
a strong portfolio of programmes and formats and we will 
continue to invest in our creative pipeline to build upon this. 
We are on track to deliver good revenue and profit growth 
in 2016, primarily driven by our acquisitions.
Acquisitions
We have built scale in our international content business, 
focusing our growth in key creative markets that have a track 
record for creating and owning intellectual property. Since 
2012 we have acquired a number of content businesses in 
the UK, US and creative locations across Europe, developing a 
strong portfolio of programmes that return and travel. As we 
have grown in size and expanded our network relationships 
and distribution capability, this has helped to strengthen our 
creative talent pool and build our reputation as a leading 
European producer and the largest unscripted independent 
production company in the US.
We have strict criteria for evaluating potential acquisitions. 
Financially, we assess ownership of intellectual property, 
earnings growth and valuation based on return on capital 
employed and discounted cash flow. Strategically, we ensure 
an acquisition target has a strong creative track record and 
pipeline in content genres that return and travel, namely 
drama, entertainment and factual entertainment, as well 
as succession planning for key individuals in the business.
We generally structure our deals with earnouts or with put and 
call options in place for the remainder of the equity, capping 
the maximum consideration payable. By basing a significant 
part of the consideration on future performance in this 
way, not only can we lock in creative talent and ensure our 
incentives are aligned, but we also reduce our risk by only 
paying for the actual, not expected, performance delivered 
over time. The majority of earnouts or put and call options are 
dependent on the seller remaining within the business. Where 
consideration paid or contingent consideration payable in the 
future is employment linked, it is treated as an expense in our 
statutory results rather than as capital. All consideration of this 
type is excluded from adjusted profit after tax and adjusted 
EPS as, in our view, these items are part of capital consideration. 
In April 2015 we completed the acquisition of 100% of 
T alpa Media in the Netherlands, the creator of worldwide 
entertainment formats, including The Voice, The Voice Kids, 
I Love My Country, Dating In The Dark and Dance Dance Dance. 
We paid an initial cash consideration of €500 million 
(£362 million) for 100% of T alpa’s fully diluted share capital 
with further payments dependent on T alpa’s future 
performance. The total maximum consideration, including 
the initial payment, is up to €1.1 billion which is contingent on 
T alpa continuing to deliver significant profit growth to 2022 as 
well as John de Mol’s continued commitment to the business 
during this time. Under the deal structure, because all future 
payments and €150 million of the initial consideration are 
directly related to John de Mol remaining with the business, 
these payments are treated as employment costs and 
therefore on a statutory basis are part of our reported 
results. However, we exclude them from adjusted profits as 
an exceptional item, which is consistent with our treatment 
of all costs of this type.
We also acquired a minority stake in Monumental Television in 
April, the UK scripted independent producer founded by Oscar 
nominated film producers Alison Owen and Debra Hayward. As 
part of the agreement, Global Entertainment acquired exclusive 
distribution rights to all of its future television productions.
In May we acquired the remaining 75% of Mammoth Screen, 
one of the UK’s leading scripted production companies, 
having held a 25% investment in the producer since 2007 . 
Its successful slate of high-end drama includes Poldark, 
Endeavour and the forthcoming Victoria. 
In June we completed the acquisition of Boom Supervisory 
Limited, the holding company of UK based Twofour Group 
which produces factual entertainment and drama 
programmes. We paid an initial cash consideration of 
£55 million for 75% of the Group. There is a put and call option 
for the remaining 25% that can be exercised at the end of 2017 
and between the end of 2019 and 2021. Additionally, Twofour 
has a put and call option to acquire the remaining 49% of its 
subsidiary Mainstreet Pictures that can be exercised between 
2018 and 2023. The total maximum consideration for 100% 
of the business is £280 million with contingent payments 
dependent on delivering exceptional profit growth to 
£60 million in aggregate over the final two-year payment 
period and key individuals remaining with the Group.
Also in June we acquired a new label, Cats on the Roof Media 
which owns a number of creative labels focused on developing 
entertainment and scripted comedy programmes.

Financial and Performance Review continued
Strategic Report  Performance and Financials In December Brent Montgomery, the CEO of Leftfield, became 
CEO of ITV America. In order to facilitate the integration of 
Leftfield within the US business, we acquired the outstanding 
20% of Leftfield which we did not own. The original terms 
under which ITV acquired its initial 80% interest included 
potential future payments linked to Leftfield’s profit growth 
and put and call options under which ITV would acquire the 
remaining 20%. In consideration for the acquisition of the 
outstanding 20%, these arrangements have been cancelled 
and ITV has assumed certain obligations of Brent Montgomery 
in relation to Leftfield, most notably settlement of the 
earnouts for its subsidiaries. There was no cash consideration 
payable at the time by ITV. The maximum consideration 
payable by ITV for the remaining obligations under the 
Leftfield acquisition is $100m and is dependent on future 
performance and is linked to ongoing employment.
The 2015 acquisitions we have made have resulted in a 
£297 million increase in intangible assets, mainly relating 
to T alpa formats and £102 million of goodwill.
The table above sets out the initial consideration payable 
on our acquisitions, our expected future payments based 
on our current view of performance and the total maximum 
consideration payable which is only payable if exceptional 
compound earnings growth is delivered. 
We closely monitor the forecast performance of each 
acquisition and where there has been a change in expectations, 
we adjust our view of potential future commitments through 
the income statement. 
Total expected consideration for all acquisitions since 2012 has 
increased by £656 million since 2014. This relates to the total 
expected amount payable for our 2015 acquisitions. This is 
made up of the initial consideration of £432 million (£406 
million plus the cash acquired) and expected future payments 
which are only payable if significant compound earnings 
growth is delivered.

Adjusted financing costs increased to £13 million (2014:

of T alpa and costs associated with raising the funding which 
included the initial €500 million acquisition bridge loan that 
was repaid in September following the issue of the seven year 
€600 million Eurobond. 
Net financing costs are adjusted to reflect the underlying 
funding costs of the business providing a more meaningful 
comparison of how the business is managed and funded on 
a day-to-day basis. These adjustments include mark-to-market 
on swaps and foreign exchange, imputed pension interest, 
losses on debt buybacks and other financial loss/income.
Net financing costs were £20 million lower in 2015 at 
£31 million (2014: £51 million), as the prior year included losses 
incurred on the repurchase of the remaining £62 million 2019 
bilateral loan. This was partially offset by the reduction in 
other net financial income, which in 2014 related to a reduction 
in expected future payments for acquisitions as a result of 
ITV’s assessment of their future performance. The imputed 
pension charge also decreased as a result of the reduction in 
pension liabilities.

 Financial and Performance Review Profit before tax
Adjusted profit before tax, after financing costs, was up 
18% at £843 million (2014: £712 million). Profit before tax is 
adjusted to reflect the impact of production tax credits, net 
exceptional items, amortisation and impairment of intangible 
assets and the adjustments to net financing costs, to reflect 
the underlying performance of the business. Statutory profit 
before tax increased by 6%, which is less than the increase in 
adjusted profit before tax, as a result of the exceptional items 
described below.

Production tax credits are recognised in adjusted PBT as in 
our view they relate directly to the production of programmes 
and reflect the way the business is managed and measured 
on a day-to-day basis. The ability to access these tax credits 
is fundamental when assessing the viability of investment 
decisions in high-end drama. ITV considers these to be part of 
the overall cost of production rather than a corporate tax item. 
In 2015 significant tax credits were available to us because of 
our investment in high-end drama in the UK.
Exceptional items are set out in the table below. Operating 
exceptional items largely relate to acquisition related expenses 
which are predominantly performance based employment 
linked consideration, in particular regarding T alpa as discussed 
earlier. Other operating exceptional items relate to 
restructuring costs in particular in relation to the US business. 
Non-operating income relates to the gain on the sale of the 
freehold property in Manchester.

Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired

development is included as management considers these 
assets to be core to supporting the operations of the business.
Tax
The total adjusted tax charge for 2015 was £177 million 
(2014: £151 million), corresponding to an effective tax rate on 
adjusted PBT of 21% (2014: 21%) which is broadly in line with 
the standard UK corporation tax rate of 20.25% (2014: 21.5%). 
The adjustments made to reconcile the tax charge with the 
adjusted tax charge are the tax effects of the adjustments 
made above to reconcile PBT and adjusted PBT.

Cash tax paid in the year was £117 million (2014: £85 million), 
the majority of which is paid in the UK. The 2015 cash figure is 
net of production tax credits received in the year. The cash tax 
paid is lower than the total tax charge for 2015 largely due to 
the tax treatment of allowable pension contributions.
ITV is a responsible business, and we take a responsible 
attitude to tax, recognising that it affects all of our 
stakeholders. We seek at all times to comply with the law in 
each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and to build open 
and transparent relationships with those jurisdictions’ tax 
authorities. Our tax strategy is in line with that of the business 
and its commercial activities, and within our overall governance 
structure, the governance of tax and tax risk is given a high 
priority by the Board and Audit Committee, including through 
the operation of the T ax & Treasury Committee.
EPS
Overall, adjusted profit after tax was up 19% at £666 million 
(2014: £561 million). After non-controlling interests of £7 million 
(2014: £7 million), adjusted basic earnings per share was 16.5p 
(2014: 13.8p), up 20%. The weighted average number of shares

2.0 and 2.5x adjusted earnings per share. Reflecting ITV’s 
strong performance in 2015 and in line with its policy, the 
Board has proposed a final dividend of 4.1p. This equates to 
a full year dividend of 6.0p, up 28%, which is well ahead of 
earnings growth and is a significant step forward in taking 
ITV’s dividend cover closer to its policy range. 
The Board is also proposing a 10.0p special dividend, worth 
just over £400 million, which comes after a year of significant 
investment at ITV and reflects ITV’s strong cash generation 
and the Board’s confidence in the business. Adjusted for this 
special distribution ITV’s pro forma leverage would be 0.8x 
reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA, which provides flexibility 
to continue to invest in the business for further growth.

ITV remains highly cash generative reflecting our continued 
focus on cash and costs. In 2015 there was another working 
capital outflow as we continued to invest in our creative pipeline. 
 In the year we generated £788 million of operational cash 
(2014: £665 million) from £865 million of adjusted EBITA 
(2014: £730 million), which equates to a strong profit to cash 
ratio of 91%. The ratio has remained the same despite our 
increased investment in scripted content and demonstrates 
our disciplined approach to cash and costs.

 Financial and Performance Review Cash spent on the acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets increased year-on-year 
as we invest in infrastructure to support the business. 
The difference between the reported and adjusted cash flow

Overall, after dividends, acquisitions and debt repayments 
we ended the year with net debt of £319 million, compared to 
net debt of £540 million at 30 June 2015 and £41 million net 
cash at 31 December 2014. Our cash generation was weighted

Funding and liquidity
Debt structure and liquidity
We have a £525 million Revolving Credit Facility in place 
until 2019 provided by a number of core relationship banks. 
We also have a £175 million bilateral financing facility and a 
£75 million invoice discounting facility, both of which are free 
of financial covenants. At 31 December 2015 these facilities 
were all undrawn.
In 2015, to fund the acquisition of T alpa Media, we entered 
into a 12 month €500 million bridge loan facility provided by 
five of our relationship banks. This was repaid and cancelled 
in September 2015 when we issued a 7 year €600 million 
Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.125%. The bond will mature 
on 21 September 2022. The proceeds from the bond were 
also used to fund the maturing £78 million Eurobond in 
October 2015. 
As we enter the next phase of our strategy, our balance sheet 
strength together with our continued strong free cash flow 
will enable us to invest in opportunities to grow the business 
and enhance shareholder value. To preserve our financial 
flexibility, our policy is to maintain at least £250 million of 
available liquidity at any point. 
Leverage
Our objective is to run an efficient balance sheet. Our priority is 
to invest to drive organic growth and make acquisitions in line 
with our strategic priorities. We will balance this investment 
for further growth with attractive returns to shareholders. 
Over time we will continue to look to increase our balance 
sheet leverage and we believe maintaining leverage below 1.5x 
reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA will optimise our cost of 
capital, allow us to sustain a progressive dividend policy and 
enable us to retain flexibility to continue to invest for further 
growth. As at 31 December 2015, reported net debt to 
adjusted EBITDA was 0.4x.
We also look at an adjusted measure of net debt, taking 
into consideration all of our financial commitments which 
reflects how credit rating agencies look at our balance sheet. 
At 31 December 2015, adjusted net debt was £1,144 million 
(31 December 2014: £765 million) reflecting an increase in 
expected contingent payments on acquisitions as a result 
of the acquisitions we have made in the year, partly offset 
by a reduction in the pension deficit under IAS 19 and lower 
undiscounted finance lease commitments which mainly 
relate to broadcast transmission contracts and property. 
As at 31 December 2015 adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA 
was 1.3x.

Other debt 5 Various

Ratings
We are rated investment grade by two ratings agencies: 
BBB- by Standard and Poor’s and Baa3 by Moody’s Investor 
Services. The factors that are taken into account in assessing 
our credit rating include our degree of operational gearing, 
exposure to the economic cycle, as well as business and 
geographical diversity. 
Foreign exchange
As ITV continues to grow internationally, we are increasingly 
exposed to foreign exchange on our overseas operations. It is 
our policy not to hedge our exposure to revenues and profits 
generated overseas, as this is seen as an inherent risk. We do 
hedge our overseas net assets, where material, and so we have 
hedged a significant portion of the euro net assets arising 
from the T alpa acquisition.
ITV is also exposed to foreign exchange risk on transactions 
we undertake in a foreign currency. Our policy is to hedge a 
portion of any transaction that is either a firm commitment 
or highly probable for up to two years forward. The amount 
hedged depends on the level of certainty we have on the final 
size of the transaction.
Finally, ITV is exposed to foreign exchange risk on the re-
translation of foreign currency loans and deposits. Our policy 
is to hedge such exposures where there is an expectation that 
any changes in the value of these items will result in a realised 
cash movement over the short to medium term.
Pensions
IAS 19
The aggregate IAS 19 deficit of the defined benefit scheme 
at 31 December 2015 was £176 million (31 December 2014: 
£346 million). The reduction reflects lower pension liabilities 
as a result of rising bond yields over the year, deficit funding 
contributions of £90 million and the difference between 
the actual inflation experienced in the period compared to 
the expected rate. Pensions continue to be paid from the 
Scheme based on actual requirements.

Actuarial valuation
The last actuarial valuation was undertaken in 2014. On the 
bases adopted by the Trustee, the combined deficits as at 
1 January 2014 amounted to £540 million.
Deficit funding contributions
The Group’s deficit funding contributions in 2015 were 
£90 million (2014: £91 million).
Following completion of the actuarial valuations, the Group 
has agreed to make deficit funding contributions in order to 
eliminate the deficits in each section. From 1 January 2016 
the contributions are paid on the following basis:
Section A – £5.0 million per month until 31 May 2021
Section B – £0.15 million per month until 28 February 2023
Section C – £0.3 million per month until 31 July 2021 
In addition to these contributions, payments are made into 
Section A as a result of the SDN and LTC Pension Funding 
Partnership structures and during 2015 these payments 
amounted to £13 million. 
The new funding structure above results in a £10 million reduction 
in deficit funding contributions payable in 2016 compared to 
2015, which will be paid more evenly throughout the year.

 Financial and Performance Review High Impact, Low 
Likelihood (HILL) risks 
Strategic risks 
Process level risks 
The Board is responsible for establishing 
risk appetite, a robust and appropriate 
risk management framework and for 
monitoring the risk management 
and internal control systems. During 
the course of the year the Board, 
Management Board and Divisional 
Boards, routinely review ITV’s principal 
risks and discuss the mitigations and 
actions being taken with regards to 
these risks. The Audit Committee 
supports the Board to keep the overall 
effectiveness of these processes under 
regular review. 
In 2015 the Board has continued 
to enhance and develop ITV’s risk 
management framework, in particular 
reviewing the level of risk appetite in the 
business. Further, the Board has carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing ITV, including those that 
would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
Discussion of the principal risks affecting 
ITV and mitigating factors can be found 
on pages 48 to 51.
The Management Board has 
responsibility for the development 
and operation of the risk management 
framework and for the operation 
of ITV’s systems of internal control. 
This includes: 
• Risk identification and assessment: 
identifying the risks facing the 
business and for establishing controls 
and procedures to monitor and 
mitigate risks. 
• Control environment: financial 
controls, policies and procedures are 
considered as a part of the Group’s 
ongoing risk assessment process. 
These controls are reviewed to ensure 
risks are identified and the processes 
and procedures are in accordance 
with and aligned to the strategy. The 
Internal Audit team provides objective 
assurance as to the effectiveness of 
the Group’s systems of internal control 
and risk management, reporting to 
both the Management Board and 
the Audit Committee. 
Risks and Uncertainties
ITV has a formal risk management process which 
is embedded within the business to support the 
identification and effective management of risks 
across the business. 
It is regularly reviewed and adapted as the Company, industry and macro environment evolves.
Risk management framework
 
Our approach, which is consistent with 
previous years, covers risks at all levels 
of the organisation and considers risks 
in three core groups:
High Impact, Low Likelihood (HILL) risks –  
of low inherent likelihood but where there 
would be major consequences were the risk 
to materialise
Strategic risks – would impact the 
successful execution of the strategy
Process level risks – embedded into 
everyday activity within the organisation.
Principal Risks
Potential Operational Risks
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 46
Strategic Report  Performance and Financials • Reviewing and monitoring the 
effectiveness of internal controls: 
controls are monitored by senior 
management, Internal Audit and the 
Audit Committee. Remedial plans 
are put in place where controls are 
weak or there are opportunities 
for improvement. Serious control 
weakness (if any) are reported to the 
Board and action taken as appropriate.
Risk management process
Risks are primarily controlled through 
the risk management process. In 
addition to the risk specific mitigating 
actions outlined on pages 48 to 51 risks 
are considered through day-to-day 
operations and are regularly discussed 
by the Board and Management Board, 
by the Audit Committee and as part 
of the Board’s strategy day. 
During 2015 all the HILL and Strategic 
risks were reassessed, challenged and 
further refined to improve our risk 
management. Mitigating actions have 
been identified for all the HILL and 
Strategic risks. Each Strategic risk has 
been mapped to at least one of the 
three key strategic priorities and, where 
possible, assigned key risk indicators. 
Where appropriate, the key risk indicators 
are aligned to our key performance 
indicators (KPIs) on pages 32 to 35 or 
a subset of these KPIs. All HILL and 
Strategic risks are owned by at least one 
member of the Management Board.
We have in place an Operational Risk 
Steering Group to manage and consider 
existing and emerging operational 
risks and ensure they are addressed 
appropriately.
Internal audit plan
The internal audit plan is driven from 
ITV’s risk management framework. 
Internal Audit reviews the auditable 
elements of the HILL, Strategic and 
Process level risks and this informs 
the areas and topics that Internal Audit 
focus on. 
Risk culture
Throughout the year we have continued 
to focus on and strengthen our risk 
culture. Our Code of Conduct remains 
unchanged and the Operational Risk 
Steering Group considers ethical 
behaviours, governance and compliance 
with our Code. ITV also offers all 
employees annual online training 
on ethics and compliance.
Viability Statement
In its assessment of viability the Board is of the view that a three year horizon to 31 December 2018 is appropriate, 
given the visibility ITV has over its Broadcast advertising business and the normal commissioning cycle which drives the 
Studios division. 
When considering the longer-term viability of ITV, the Board has reviewed each of ITV’s principal risks and uncertainties 
and, taking into account current operational and financial performance, has in particular analysed the impact of: 
• The Broadcast division experiencing a significant and sharp downturn, similar to the 2008/09 financial crisis, with 
regards to advertising revenues, but in this case with no immediate recovery
• A number of key programme brands within the Studios division not being recommissioned
• A significant change in ITV’s pension funding obligations, following the triennial valuation in 2017 and subsequent 
funding arrangements
The review involved flexing the underlying strategic forecast for the above impacts, both individually and concurrently, 
and no specific mitigations were assumed. The underlying strategic forecast assumed: business as usual capital 
spending; the ongoing availability of the financing facilities (as ITV remains within the covenants); and that ITV 
maintains its stated dividend policy. 
Based on the results of this review, the Board has a reasonable expectation that ITV will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 December 2018. The assessment has been 
made with reference to ITV’s strategy and current position and prospects.

Strategic Report
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 51
 Risks and Uncertainties Dear shareholder,
The Board believes that a high standard 
of corporate governance is essential not 
just to protecting shareholders interests, 
but to building and sustaining the long- 
term success of the Company.
Our belief is that a good board is an 
engaged board, working closely with 
the executive team. The success of the 
Board process depends on a strong 
chemistry around the board table where 
robust discussions can be conducted in 
a spirit of openness and transparency. 
The Board’s role is both to support and 
challenge the executive team and to 
promote the success of the business.
When we started on the transformation 
programme six years ago we downsized 
the Board initially to six members to 
create a more cohesive and engaged 
team. Since that time, we have added 
carefully to its membership to reflect 
our belief that ITV works best with a 
balanced combination of creative, 
commercial and financial talent and 
experience. But we continue to believe 
that a relatively small, but talented 
board, close to the business is the right 
model for ITV.
With that we have reshaped the 
governance process. Strong governance 
is the platform that allows the Board 
to engage in effective strategic and 
commercial debate. Today, we have a 
robust framework of risk management 
and financial controls which we review 
regularly and a very rigorous Audit 
Committee process under its Chairman, 
John Ormerod. 
We recognise that the best governance 
system in the world is of limited value 
unless built on an organisation that 
encourages integrity and transparency.

ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 52
Governance ITV is a talent business and ensuring 
that we employ great people and allow 
them creative freedom in the context 
of tight financial discipline is crucial to 
our success. So the foundation of our 
governance is ensuring we have the 
right people and attitudes. For this 
reason we have rigorous pulse surveys 
of employee morale and attitudes 
and the Board regularly engages in 
discussion about people, organisation 
and succession. 
The Board meets regularly for scheduled 
Board and Committee meetings and 
has a number of informal meetings to 
consider specific issues. We interact 
frequently with senior executives and 
subject matter experts. This ensures 
that the Board has a full understanding 
of the business. During the year some of 
our Non-executive Directors undertook 
visits to our UK and international sites. 
We remain committed to maintaining 
regular open dialogue and effective 
communication with our shareholders. 
We believe that continued engagement 
is highly beneficial to all parties as it 
helps to build a greater understanding 
of our investors’ views, opinions 
and concerns. 
During the year an important focus has 
been on evolving our strategy for the 
next stage of our development. Each 
year we hold a two day off-site strategy 
meeting where we consider recent 
and upcoming changes in our business 
environment, the risks and impacts of 
such changes on our business and how 
we might meet these challenges. A brief 
summary of the business undertaken by 
the Board and our focus for 2016 is set 
out on page 59.
We are delighted that Anna Manz 
agreed to join the Board in February 
2016. Anna is currently Group Strategy 
Director at Diageo plc where she has 
an impressive track record. She will 
bring consumer, financial and strategic 
experience to the Board .
It is our policy to appoint Non-executive 
Directors for a three year period 
from appointment and then consider 
reappointment on an annual basis 
following a robust performance 
evaluation. 
In addition we carefully review other 
commitments to ensure that Directors 
have sufficient time to commit to the 
business. Details of appointment dates 
and length of tenure for each director 
can be found in the table on page 59. 
All Directors are required by the 
Company’s Articles of Association to 
be elected by shareholders at the first 
AGM following their appointment by 
the Board. Subsequently, all Directors 
are subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders as recommended by 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code). 
We are in the process of conducting 
an externally facilitated board 
effectiveness review and further 
details of this can be found on page 60.
As a listed company, ITV is required 
to report on how it has complied with 
the principles of governance set out 
in the Code. The Board considers that 
the Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Code, except in 
respect of provision C.3.1. Following the 
departure of Lucy Neville-Rolfe in July 
2014, the Audit Committee had only two 
members. However, we were delighted 
that Mary Harris agreed to join the Audit 
Committee and she was appointed as 
an additional member on 16 June 2015. 
From that date we were fully compliant.
Further information on corporate 
governance and a schedule setting out 
how we comply with the Code can be 
found on our website.

A copy of the Code is available on the 
FRC website.

Evaluation
Internal
The work of the Board Committees is 
reviewed annually with the support of 
Group Secretariat. The evaluation takes 
the form of face-to-face meetings with 
Board and Committee members eliciting 
feedback on a wide range of topics. 
In addition input is sought from the 
Executive Directors, other relevant 
senior executives and external advisers.
Output is reported to the relevant 
Chairman and a report of actions is 
submitted to the Committees and 
actioned as appropriate.
External
In 2012/13 the Board undertook a 
board effectiveness review facilitated 
by YSC. The review was developmentally 
focused, both with respect to the 
functioning of the Board and for 
individual board members. This resulted 
in suggestions for the Board to develop 
its effectiveness which were discussed 
with the Board as a whole and feedback 
was provided to individual board 
members together with additional 
development sessions.
At the end of 2015 the Board 
commenced a further effectiveness 
review, again using YSC, and recognising 
During the year the appointments of 
John Ormerod and Andy Haste were 
extended for a further 12 months. 
Both have been Non-executive Directors 
for over six years. The Board continues 
to believe that they bring a wealth of 
knowledge and experience to their 
deliberations and both provide a 
valuable contribution as Chairmen 
of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees respectively. 
Anna Manz was appointed as a Non-
executive Director with effect from 
1 February 2016. Anna was selected 
from a number of candidates following 
a rigorous search process. 
During 2015 the Nomination Committee 
commenced the succession process for 
the Chairman. Following a robust review 
they concluded that Sir Peter Bazalgette 
was the best and most appropriate 
candidate for the position. With his 
wealth of experience and unrivalled 
reputation in the media sector, he is well 
placed to take the Company forward to 
its next stage of development. Sir Peter 
has been on the Board since June 2013 
and has a detailed understanding of 
the business and its issues together 
with valuable insight on the strategic 
challenges facing ITV and the 
industry generally.
Executive search firm Zygos were 
engaged to assist with both search 
processes. Zygos have no other 
connection with ITV.

The Board is of the view that the 
Non-executive Directors are independent 
in both character and judgement. 
They constructively challenge and 
help develop proposals on strategy, 
scrutinise the performance of 
that the Board has a number of new 
members. Board members were 
asked for:
• Views on board effectiveness
• Feedback on individual board 
members
• Suggestions for improvement
• Personal aspirations around 
contribution to the Board
As part of the process YSC have 
attended several board meetings 
to observe and will produce a report 
of findings and suggestions for 
development of the Board as a whole 
and on an individual basis. The process 
is expected to take approximately 
six months.

Succession planning and diversity
Succession planning
The Board has agreed a succession 
planning framework which it regularly 
reviews to ensure that:
• Board tenure is appropriate and 
encourages fresh thinking and 
new ideas
• The Board is sufficiently diverse but 
most importantly has the appropriate 
mix of generalist and specialist skills
• Non-executive Directors have the 
appropriate level of independence, 
from the executive and each other
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 60
Governance Both John Ormerod and Andy Haste are 
approaching nine years tenure. The 
Board is mindful of this and succession 
planning is under consideration.
Diversity
It is our policy to retain a strong but 
relatively small board bringing a balance 
of in-depth commercial and creative 
experience. It continues to be the Board’s 
intention to increase the diverse 
make-up and representation of its 
members as opportunities arise, but 
given the size of the Board specific 
formulaic targets are not appropriate. 
Induction, training and development
The Company has a policy and 
programme for induction and continuing 
professional development of Directors. 
On appointment, each Director takes 
part in a comprehensive induction 
programme.
During their period in office, the 
Directors are continually updated on the 
Group’s businesses and the competitive 
and regulatory environments in which 
they operate. This is done through:
• Updates and papers which cover 
changes affecting the Group and 
the market in which it operates
• Meetings with senior executives 
across the Group and key advisers
• Regular updates on changes to the 
legal and governance requirements 
of the Group and in relation to their 
own position as Directors
• Presentations given at board and 
committee meetings on business 
matters and technical update 
sessions from external advisers 
where appropriate
This is supplemented by visits to UK and 
international locations. During 2015 
Peter Bazalgette and Roger Faxon 
visited the ITV Studios office in Los 
Angeles, Mary Harris visited T alpa in 
The Netherlands and The Garden 
with John Ormerod. A number of the 
Directors visited the new Coronation 
Street site in Salford, Manchester.
As part of their professional 
development Executive Directors 
may accept external appointments 
as Non-executive Directors of other 
companies and retain any related fees 
paid to them. Details of positions held 
and fees received by Executive Directors 
in 2015 can be found on page 79. 
Relations with shareholders
The Board attaches a high priority to 
effective communication with 
shareholders and has regular and open 
dialogue with investors. The Board 
believes that continued engagement 
with shareholders is beneficial to both 
ITV and its stakeholders as it helps to 
build a greater understanding of 
investors’ views, opinions and concerns. 
Adam Crozier, Ian Griffiths and the 
Director of Investor Relations meet with 
many institutional investors throughout 
the year to keep them updated on the 
Company’s performance against our 
strategy. These range from one-to-one 
meetings to group presentations 
including the Full Year and Interim 
results and the AGM. Specifically, 
following the Full Year and Interim 
results one-to-one meetings are held 
with our largest institutional investors.
The Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director also respond to shareholder 
queries and hold meetings where 
appropriate.
The Company maintains a programme 
of engagement with the investment 
community, including results 
presentations, briefings to brokers 
and other sales forces and attendance 
at a number of investor conferences. 
Presentations given to the investment 
community are available to download 
from our website.
  w w w . it v pl c . c o m / i n v e st o r s
We regularly seek feedback on the 
perception of the Company amongst 
shareholders and the investor 
community more broadly via our 
corporate brokers. Investor comments 
are fed back to the Board and its 
committees regularly.
Private shareholders represent more 
than 92% of our shareholders, holding 
2.97% of our shares. We encourage 
shareholders to register their email 
addresses to receive information from 
us in a timely manner.
The AGM will be held on Thursday, 
12 May 2016 (further details can be 
found on page 171). 
In 2015 the meeting was attended by 
129 shareholders. Shareholders are 
invited to meet the Directors prior to 
and after the formal proceedings. At 
the meeting the Chairman and Chief 
Executive will review the Group’s current 
trading which is followed by a question 
and answer session. Separate resolutions 
are proposed on each substantially 
separate issue and all resolutions are 
taken on a poll. Voting can be done 
online or using a form of proxy which 
is sent to all shareholders. The level of 
votes lodged on each resolution is made 
available on a Regulatory Information 
Service and on the Company’s website 
as soon as possible after the meeting. 
Details of voting at the 2015 meeting

Code) in relation to risk management 
and internal controls. The Committee 
reviewed the process of risk 
management and considered how to 
embed more operational risk appetite 
measures into board discussions. For 
example in 2015, an Operational Risk 
Steering Group was established to 
manage and consider a number of 
existing and emerging operational 
risks and ensure the business addresses 
them appropriately. I am invited to 
attend meetings of the Operational 
Risk Steering Group and of the T ax 
and Treasury Committee.
Audit Tendering: during the year the 
Committee has continued to monitor 
changes in regulation for auditor 
appointments. Recently the Department 
for Business, Innovation and Skills has 
issued further guidance that has clarified 
ITV’s position with regards to its next 
tender and mandatory auditor rotation.
Viability Statement: following changes 
to the Code the Committee reviewed 
the process by which the Company 
assesses viability over the longer term. 
This was considered by the Board and 
the statement is set out on page 47 . 
We continue to focus on financial 
reporting judgements and disclosures 
and challenging management to 
develop controls to anticipate future 
opportunities and risk. Management is 
committed to continuous improvement. 
Dear shareholder,
On the following pages we set out the 
Audit Committee’s Report for 2015. 
Our particular areas of focus during the 
year include:
Acquisitions: we continued to invest 
in our production business in particular 
the acquisition of formats that travel 
internationally. The Committee engages 
at an early stage with significant 
potential acquisitions. We review with 
management the approach to due 
diligence and review the results of that 
work prior to its submission to the Board. 
We consider carefully the appropriate 
accounting for arrangements which are 
designed both to incentivise creative 
talent and manage financial risk. 
Of particular focus this year was 
the acquisition accounting for T alpa, 
specifically the treatment of the 
earnout arrangements linked to 
retaining key talent in the business.
Technology: technology is key to our 
competitive success in areas such as 
online but also to improving our 
operational efficiency. The Committee 
has continued to review the plans and 
controls over technology change and 
for maintaining control in areas where 
legacy systems continue to operate. 
Cyber security has remained a focus 
for the Committee, especially as media 
companies have continued to face 
increased frequency and sophistication 
of cyber attacks.
ITV is a different business from that 
of three or five years ago. We aim 
to ensure that our controls 
anticipate the changing 
risks in our business and 
that our reporting reflects 
fairly our new activities.”

What we focused on in 2015
In planning its own agenda, and 
reviewing the audit plans of the internal 
and external auditor, the Committee 
takes account of significant issues and 
risks, both operational and financial, 
likely to impact on the Company’s 
financial statements. The Committee 
also addresses specific queries referred 
to it by the Board or Remuneration 
Committee.
During 2015 there were no topics where 
there was significant disagreement 
between management, our external 
auditor and the Committee, or 
unresolved issues that needed to be 
referred to the Board.
During 2015 we complied with the 
provisions of the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
Below is a summary of some of the 
more significant risks and financial 
reporting issues discussed in the year 
by the Committee.
Who is on the Committee
The Committee is composed entirely of Non-executive Directors. The current 
members are:
• John Ormerod (Chairman)
• Mary Harris (appointed 16 June 2015)
• Andy Haste
The Committee members have between them a wide range of business and 
financial experience. The Committee considers that John Ormerod has recent 
and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the Code. 
Full details of attendance at Committee meetings can be found on the table 
on page 59.
Our role
The main role of the Committee is to:
• monitor the integrity of the published financial information of the Company 
and review and report to the Board on the significant financial reporting issues 
and judgements made in connection with the preparation of the published 
financial information of the Company;
• provide advice to the Board on whether the Annual Report and Accounts are 
fair, balanced and understandable;
• review the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management 
processes and give input to the Board’s consideration of risk and risk appetite;
• monitor and review the effectiveness and independence of the internal 
audit function; 
• provide advice to the Remuneration Committee on financial reporting matters 
and related judgements and risk management as they affect performance 
objectives related to executive remuneration; and
• review the quality and effectiveness of the external audit and the procedures 
and controls designed to ensure auditor independence.
Following each meeting the Committee communicates its main discussion points 
and findings to the Board.
Annual Review
An annual review of the performance of the Committee was conducted for 
the year. In addition to feedback from members of the Committee, input was 
sought from the Group Finance Director, external auditors, Internal Audit and 
the Chairman of the Board. Overall, the review concluded that the Committee is 
responding appropriately to its terms of reference and will continue to develop 
its role. Priorities for this year will include strengthening further the Committee 
membership as part of our succession planning and deepening our engagement 
with the key risks facing the Company.

Financial reporting
As part of the Committee’s review of the Interim and Full Year financial statements, the following were discussed:
Complex discrete transactions in the year
The Group completed certain transactions during the period that were outside the normal course of business. The Committee 
carefully reviewed these one-off transactions to ensure that the judgements applied by management were reasonable and 
any complex accounting guidance followed correctly. The key topics discussed in the year covered acquisitions.
Acquisition accounting for T alpa (see note 3.4 for detail on the acquisition)
T alpa was the largest acquisition made by the Group in 2015. The Committee ensured consistency in application of principles to 
previous deals and reviewed the treatment and presentation of performance-related commitments between ITV and the seller:
Consistent 
application of 
acquisition 
accounting
As part of the review of the acquisition of T alpa, the Committee reviewed the areas of judgement applied 
by management around the valuation of intangibles. The Committee concluded that the assumptions 
and judgements taken by management were on a basis consistent with previous acquisitions, market 
practice and IFRSs.
Performance- 
related  
consideration
The T alpa acquisition structure allows for further amounts payable after two, five and eight years 
based on the achievement of stretching performance targets for the business in the years following 
acquisition. For these amounts to be paid the deal requires the seller to remain with the business 
during these periods. Further, if the seller leaves within two years a significant portion of the initial 
consideration would be refunded to ITV. Structuring the deal this way helped manage risks in terms 
of initial capital outlay and created a joint incentive between ITV and the seller to grow the business. 
Management considered it appropriate for performance reporting to include these payments as the 
cost of acquiring the business even though IFRS requires any payment that links a seller to remaining in 
the business as an employment cost. The Committee discussed management’s analysis for excluding 
these payments from adjusted earnings, and concluded that management’s analysis was fair and 
consistent with previous acquisitions where key talent is retained.
Buy out of minority interest of Leftfield
The Committee also reviewed the acceleration of the buy out of the Leftfield minority interest. The Committee discussed 
management’s judgements around the fair value of the consideration paid for the remaining minority interest and concluded 
management’s analysis was fair and reasonable.
Recurring transactions in the year
There are a number of areas where the Group transacts as part of its business as usual. However, these areas may require the 
application of judgement by management or have underlying complexity that should be considered on an ongoing basis by 
the Committee.
Consequently, the following key topics are reviewed by the Committee:
Revenue Every year the Committee considers management’s assessment of the Group’s internal controls 
framework, which includes control over revenue. At the end of 2014 the Committee requested an internal 
audit exercise specifically to review the risks and controls surrounding each of the Group’s main revenue 
streams. This review was finalised in early 2015. The Committee ensured the processes and controls 
around existing revenue streams remained consistent and effective during the year. The Committee is 
involved in the preliminary discussions regarding implementation of the new revenue recognition 
standard IFRS15 applicable from 2018.
Deal debt This is where management reviews the over and under delivery of advertising value to agencies. The 
Committee reviews management’s approach and method of determining the provision required for 
under delivery. The Committee is satisfied that the provision has been calculated on an appropriate basis. 
Royalty accruals The Group is required to make royalty payments for content broadcast and distributed where we do not own 
all the rights. Such payments are in accordance with individual contracts, and the large variety of terms 
results in a complex and manual process. After an annual review of processes and controls, the Committee 
was satisfied with the improvements management continue to make in the controls over royalty 
payments and as with previous years, the Committee considered the estimated accrual to be reasonable.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 64
Governance Pension  
accounting
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is a significant net liability on the Group’s balance sheet 
(see note 3.7) and the value of the scheme’s net liabilities will fluctuate due to changes in underlying 
assumptions (and the assets are held at market value). The main assumptions which drive the fluctuations 
in liabilities include the value of its bond yield rate and the forecast inflation rate. The Committee 
considered both the process management undertook to finalise the assumptions and how these 
assumptions benchmark against the market. The Committee concluded that the process was robust 
and the resulting calculation appropriately balanced.
Other topics reviewed during the year included: 
Deficit financing As part of management’s strategy to expand its content portfolio, significant investment in high end 
drama was made during the year. The Committee has reviewed and considered the accounting 
implications, including revenue recognition and recoverability of the amounts invested. The Committee 
concluded that the accounting treatment was appropriate.
Tax The Committee received regular updates from management and the T ax and Treasury Committee 
with regard to key areas of tax risk, tax compliance, tax matters in respect of corporate transactions, 
and significant changes in tax legislation. The Committee considered the key risks which give rise to 
uncertainties over corporate tax, payroll and VAT liabilities and related provisions. The Committee 
discussed the activities which management undertakes to resolve the matters that give rise to such 
provisions. Where advice from our tax advisers is received, the results and views of their work are also 
reviewed. The Committee concluded that the provisions at the year end were appropriate (see note 2.3).
Risk Management and Internal 
Controls
Risk management
The Committee continued to consider 
the process for managing risk within 
the business and assisted the Board 
in relation to compliance with the Code 
and development of the risk appetite 
framework. Further information on our 
HILL and strategic risks and uncertainties 
and risk management process is 
included within the Strategic Report 
on pages 46 to 51.
For the Group’s HILL risks the Committee 
reviewed the Group’s current level 
of exposure and considered the 
appropriateness of the mitigating 
actions being taken by management.
The Committee also considered 
management’s response to strategic risk, 
including the level of assurance provided 
around the risk and how the risk is tracked 
using key risk indicators. With regard to 
process risks the Committee reviewed 
how effective management was in 
addressing the findings of internal and 
external audit, as well as the method 
by which management accepted 
process risks.
The Committee has in place a rolling 
programme to review key compliance 
and other risk.
Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility 
for the Group’s systems of internal 
control and for regularly reviewing the 
effectiveness of those systems. The 
Committee assists the Board in reviewing 
the systems of internal control. The 
primary responsibility for the operation 
of these systems is delegated to 
management. Such systems can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. Key control procedures are 
designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk.
The Committee satisfies itself that 
internal controls are operating 
throughout the year principally based 
on the programme of internal audit 
reviews. In addition to the internal 
audit programme, there is a suite of 
exception reports that cover transaction 
processing. For those subsidiaries not 
covered by exception reporting software, 
management recently implemented a 
monthly self assessment which is subject 
to independent internal review.
Strategy and financial reporting: 
The strategy is reviewed and approved 
by the Board. The Group performs a 
comprehensive annual strategy review 
and a rolling five year financial planning 
exercise. The five year plan feeds into 
the annual budget cycle. The Executive 
Directors review formal forecasts, 
detailed budgets, strategies and action 
plans and the Board approves the overall 
Group budget as part of its normal 
responsibilities. The results of operating 
units are reported monthly, along with 
an update of the Group’s performance 
against strategic KPIs and cash. Actual 
results are compared to budget and 
forecasts, and key trends and variances 
are explained and analysed. 
Post-acquisition review: When 
introducing the Group’s procedures and 
control environment to an acquisition, 
management is responsible for ensuring 
that key areas of governance are 
implemented and that operational and 
financial processes are aligned to the 
Group. A full post-acquisition review is 
presented to the Committee in the year 
following a material acquisition. The 
Committee reviewed Leftfield in 2015 
and plans to review T alpa in 2016.

 Audit Committee Report Audit Committee Report continued
Our auditors
Internal auditor
The Group’s internal audit activity is 
outsourced to Deloitte who report 
directly to the Committee. During the 
year the Committee reviewed this 
internal audit model. We concluded that 
outsourcing offers access to the wide 
range of skills and resources in the 
various geographies required and 
endorsed its continuing use.
The Committee keeps under review 
the internal audit relationship with 
Deloitte and the procedures to ensure 
appropriate independence of the 
internal audit function is maintained. In 
particular, the Committee has approved 
guidelines in relation to other advisory 
and consultancy work that Deloitte 
may undertake for the Company, which 
adheres to the underlying principle that 
they cannot implement controls that 
they audit. Other services provided by 
Deloitte included tax and corporate 
finance advice.
The effectiveness of internal audit is 
assessed over the year using a number 
of measures that include (but are not 
limited to):
Data analytics: the Group has a suite of 
automated analytics tests that enables 
the Group to continuously highlight 
exceptions from the norm over its 
transactional financial data. The 
analytics have been expanded and have 
contributed to a stronger and more 
efficient control environment.
Whistleblowing
ITV has arrangements in place that 
enable employees to raise concerns in 
confidence about any possible risks to 
employees, customers, viewers or the 
Company. The Committee considers 
the process and procedures each year 
and is of the view that they are operating 
appropriately and that colleagues are 
aware of and trust the process. Every 
three years ITV asks the whistleblowing 
charity Public Concern at Work to carry 
out an independent review of these 
arrangements. ITV is a signatory to The 
First 100 campaign which seeks to 
champion enlightened organisations 
that are committed to ensuring that 
their arrangements meet best practice.
• an evaluation of each audit assignment 
completed using feedback from the 
part of the business that has been 
audited; and
• a high level annual review that is 
completed by obtaining feedback from 
senior management in each division.
At the start of the year the Committee 
considered and approved the internal 
audit plan, that included audits across 
the Group as well as assurance over live 
projects. During the year the Committee 
reviewed findings from these internal 
audit reports, the actions taken to 
implement the recommendations made 
in the reports and the status of progress 
against previously agreed actions. All 
internal audit reports are available to 
the Committee.
The Committee reviewed and approved 
the 2016 internal audit plan.
External auditor
Engagement
The Committee is responsible for 
agreeing the terms of the engagement 
letter. Throughout the year the 
Committee received reports from the 
auditor (KPMG) on their plans and the 
progress and results of their work.
The Committee considers carefully 
the scope of planned work and the 
assessment of risk and materiality on 
which it is based. In particular through 
the Chairman the Committee 
participates in the negotiation of the 
audit fee arrangements to ensure that 
there is an appropriate balance between 
the scope of work and the cost of 
assurance. The Committee’s aim is to 
support a robust and effective audit and 
strong reporting lines to the Committee.
Audit tendering and rotation 
During the year the Committee has 
continued to monitor changes in 
regulation for auditor appointments. 
The Department for Business (BIS) has 
recently issued further guidance on their 
consultation, setting out how EU audit 
rules will be implemented in the UK. 
Technology risk
As we continue to execute our strategy the technology infrastructure supporting 
the business also has to evolve. A number of legacy systems supporting the 
existing business remain in place, while at the same time new revenue streams 
require systems to support them. It therefore remains important to have an 
effective technology governance framework that seeks to address the risks 
arising from the above environment. In 2015, the Committee continued to review 
the Group’s governance over its legacy systems, including ongoing projects to 
migrate certain legacy systems to newer technology while implementing new 
systems to support our new revenue streams.
Media companies in particular have continued to face increased frequency and 
sophistication of cyber-attacks, with a number of well publicised cases in 2015 
targeting services and customer data. As part of ongoing governance the 
Committee reviewed the steps that management are taking on cyber security. 
These included: increasing awareness and education of staff with regards to types 
of security threat, improving the monitoring of internal network activity and the 
implementation of enterprise security management tools. The Group’s response 
to cyber security will require continuing effort, especially as the types of attacks 
and their sophistication will continue to evolve, and the Committee will continue 
to focus on this area in 2016.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 66
Governance The BIS guidance specifically highlights 
that companies which tendered the 
audit engagement before the 
application date for the EU Regulation, 
that resulted in the reappointment of 
the incumbent auditor, should benefit 
from the transitional provisions where 
the tender would meet the objectives 
of the EU Regulation. 
Having recommended the reappointment 
of KPMG in 2012 following a competitive 
tender, and applying the above BIS 
guidance, the next mandatory tender 
would be for the 2023 financial year. 
However, the Committee will continue 
to monitor audit quality, to ensure the 
Group continues to have a robust and 
effective audit.
Effectiveness and quality
Audit quality is reviewed throughout the 
year and in 2015 the Committee used 
the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) 
Audit Quality Practice Aid to help 
structure its review of audit quality at 
ITV. When making its assessment of 
audit quality, the factors the Committee 
focused on included: 
• External audit quality reports – 
reviewing the FRC’s Audit Quality 
Review reports and discussing with 
the auditor specific topics that may 
be applicable to ITV, and how their 
audit strategy for the year addressed 
thematic concerns that the FRC 
had highlighted.
• Auditor interaction with management 
– reviewing the auditor’s understanding 
of business progress against the 
strategy and emerging industry 
themes, as well as the auditor’s 
discussions with management on 
key corporate transactions.
• Auditor’s own view of effectiveness – 
enquired with regards to: their 
audit methodology and its effective 
application to ITV; their robustness of 
challenges and findings on areas which 
require management judgement; 
whether there had been an internal 
peer review of the ITV audit and what 
the findings were; and the experience 
of the senior members of the 
audit team.
Further in its assessment of audit quality 
the Committee took into account:
• the detailed audit strategy for the 
year, including the coverage of 
emerging risks;
• Group materiality and component 
materiality;
• how the auditor communicated any 
key accounting judgement and 
conclusions; and
• feedback from management of the 
performance of the external auditor. 
There were no significant findings 
from the evaluation this year and the 
Committee considers the external audit 
to have been robust and effective.
Independence, objectivity and fees
The Committee seeks to ensure the 
objectivity and independence of our 
auditor through:
• focus on the assignment and rotation 
of key personnel;
• the adequacy of audit resource; and
• policies in relation to non-audit work.
The senior audit partner serves no more 
than five years continuously and the 
independent review partner serves no 
more than seven years continuously. 
Other key partners serve for no longer 
than seven consecutive years. The 
Committee monitors the tenure of 
partners and senior staff as well as 
former employees working for the 
Company. Following completion of the 
2015 audit, Mark Summerfield our Senior 
Statutory Auditor and KPMG partner will 
rotate off our engagement and will be 
replaced by Paul Sawdon. During the 
year the Chairman of the Committee 
and management met partners from 
KPMG who might serve as our senior 
audit partner making a final proposal 
which was approved by the Committee.
The Committee regularly monitors the 
other services being provided to the 
Group by its external auditor, and has 
developed a formal policy and sign off 
process with management to ensure 
this does not impair their independence 
or objectivity. 
The policy is reviewed annually and is 
available in full on our website together 
with further information on how the 
Committee manages the external 
audit relationship.
 www.itvplc.com/about/governance
Other than in exceptional circumstances 
management and the Committee do 
not expect non-audit fees to be in excess 
of fees for audit and audit-related 
services. The non-audit fees for 2015 
were one third of the audit fees. A report 
on the level of non-audit work provided 
by the auditor is given to the Committee 
half yearly. The significant non-audit 
engagements related to corporate tax 
advice and other assurance. Full details 
are set out on page 110.
The Committee has formally reviewed 
the work undertaken by KPMG for the 
Committee and elsewhere in the 
Company and is satisfied that the advice 
they have received has been objective 
and independent.
Reappointment
During the year the Committee 
considered the performance and audit 
fees of the external auditor, and the level 
of non-audit work undertaken, and 
recommended to the Board that a 
resolution for the reappointment of 
KPMG for a further year as the 
Company’s auditor be proposed to 
shareholders at the AGM in May 2015. 
The resolution was passed and KPMG 
was reappointed for a further year.
The Committee has recommended the 
reappointment of KPMG at the AGM on 
12 May 2016.

Annual Remuneration Report 
Dear shareholder,
On the following pages we set out:
• Our Annual Remuneration Report 
(pages 70 to 80) which will be subject 
to an advisory vote at our Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) in May 2016; 
and 
• Our Remuneration Policy table (pages 
81 to 84) which was approved at the 
AGM in May 2014 for a three year 
period. The full Remuneration Policy 
is available on our website.
 www.itvplc.com/about/governance
We believe that our remuneration 
framework remains aligned with the 
strategy of the business and is linked 
to our key KPIs, which are set out in 
the Strategic Report. In addition we 
are satisfied that our remuneration 
framework promotes long-term 
alignment with shareholders and 
does not encourage undue risk taking.
During 2016 we will be undertaking a 
review of the remuneration policy for 
the Executive Directors in preparation 
for the AGM in 2017 , when the existing 
policy will reach its third anniversary and 
require resubmission to shareholders. 
Our performance in 2015
As discussed in the Strategic Report, over 
the last six years ITV has delivered strong 
revenue and double-digit profit growth 
in key profit measures every year. In 2015 
we delivered £865 million adjusted EBITA 
(before exceptionals) (2014: £730 
million) and adjusted EPS of 16.5 pence 
(2014: 13.8 pence). We remain focused on 
our original vision and are confident that 
our strategy, focused on three key 
Strategic Priorities, remains appropriate 
for the long-term.
Performance measures for our Annual 
Bonus Awards and Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) are closely aligned to our KPIs 
(set out on pages 32 to 35). Our KPIs have 
been defined to align our performance 
and accountability to our strategy. 
The KPIs are the key measures of our 
success and cover all of our Strategic 
Priorities.
Performance against KPIs which are 
aligned to our Bonus and LTIP is set 
out below:
2015 2014
Adjusted EBITA £865m £730m
Profit to cash conversion 91% 91%
Adjusted EPS 16.5p 13.8p
Family SOV 21.2% 22%
Total non-NAR growth 25% 10%
In addition, over the past few years we 
have included a cost-saving target in 
our Bonus Awards to ensure that 
management continues to focus on 
streamlining the business.
Remuneration outcomes in 2015
As explained above, the performance 
against financial targets other than 
Share of Viewing (SOV) has been strong. 
The bonus payout levels for the Executive 
Directors were 96% for Adam Crozier and 
95% for Ian Griffiths. Further information 
and details of the bonus targets are set 
out on page 72. Previously we reported 
that the Board believed that targets 
remained commercially sensitive for a 
two year period following the relevant 
year end and we committed to including 
the targets for 2013 in this year’s report. 
During the year, we reviewed emerging 
best practice in this area and have 
concluded that it is more appropriate to 
disclose targets following the relevant 
year end. To this end, in addition to the 
targets for the financial year ended 
2013, we have also included details of the 
targets for the financial years ended 2014 
and 2015, which are set out on page 72.
During the year, awards made under the 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) in 2013 
reached the end of their performance 
period, and will become exercisable 
in March 2016. Details are set out 
on page 73. Over the three year 
performance period, the Company’s 
share price increased from 105.2 pence 
In this report
The purpose of this report is to set out for shareholders the 
principles and policy we apply to remuneration for our Executive 
Directors and to update you on how we have applied these for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2015. The report also aims to demonstrate how our 
Remuneration Policy is aligned to our strategy, supports the retention of the 
Executive Directors and rewards them for strong performance.

Governance to 276.6 pence with a total return to 
shareholders (TSR) of 202%. This resulted 
in the Company being the second best 
performing company in the FTSE100 
over the period. The Committee 
considers the total pay of the Executive 
Directors to be a fair reflection of their 
overall contribution in this context.
The Remuneration Committee has not 
exercised any discretion during the year 
or felt it appropriate to call on malus

One specific change is being made to 
the bonus framework for the Executive 
Directors to increase the proportion 
aligned to financial targets from 60% 
to 75% and reduce the proportion 
aligned to personal targets from 40% 
to 25%. This follows a review during 
2015, based on feedback from some 
institutional shareholders that the 
weighting on personal measures 
was above the market norm. While 
previously appropriate given the 
turnaround phase, the Committee 
concluded that making such change 
was now relevant to ensure focus on 
the targets with the greatest impact 
on overall business performance. We 
believe this is a more usual approach 
and in line with shareholder 
expectations. There has not been 
any change to the target or maximum 
level of bonus.
The Executive Directors each received 
a 2.5% increase in their salaries from 
1 January 2016 which is in line with 
the increase for employees generally. 
No other material changes will apply 
for 2016. 
Who is on the Committee
The Committee is composed entirely of Non-executive Directors. The current 
members are:
• Andy Haste (Chairman)
• Sir Peter Bazalgette
• Archie Norman
• John Ormerod
Full details of attendance at Committee meetings can be found in the table on 
page 59.
Our role
The role of the Committee is primarily to:
• review the ongoing appropriateness, relevance and effectiveness of the 
Remuneration Policy including in relation to retention and development;
• propose to shareholders changes to the Remuneration Policy and approve its 
implementation for the Executive Directors, Management Board and other 
Senior Executives (together the Senior Executive Group) taking into account 
arrangements for the wider employee group. Details on employee 
remuneration can be found on page 87;
• approve the design of the Company’s annual bonus arrangements and LTIPs, 
including the performance targets that apply for the Senior Executive Group; 
and
• determine the award levels for the Senior Executive Group based on 
performance against annual bonus targets and long-term incentive conditions.
Following each meeting the Committee communicates its main discussion points 
and findings to the Board.
Annual Review
An annual review of the performance of the Committee was conducted. In 
addition to feedback from members of the Committee input was also sought 
from the Chief Executive, Group HR Director and FIT Remuneration Consultants, 
the independent adviser to the Committee. Overall the review concluded that 
the Committee is responding appropriately to its terms of reference and will 
continue to develop its role. Priorities for this year will include consideration of 
Committee membership and continued alignment to the corporate strategy.
The Committee’s terms of reference can be accessed on our website.

What we did in 2015
During 2015 our work was broadly in four areas:
Setting targets
• setting the business and personal performance targets for 2015 bonuses, aligned with the business plan for the year;
• setting the performance targets that would apply to awards made under the LTIP and PSP in 2015; and
• carrying out a preliminary review of annual bonus targets for 2016.
Reviewing outcomes
• reviewing the bonus outcomes and award levels for 2014 and indicative 2015 outcomes ahead of final approval in 2016; and
• approving the performance outcomes of the 2012 awards under the PSP .
Reward framework
• agreeing the base salaries for the Senior Executive Group using the same process as applied to the wider employee population;
• agreeing the remuneration packages for new appointments to the Senior Executive Group and the arrangements for any 
leavers from this group.
Governance
• agreeing the Remuneration Report for 2014 prior to its approval by the Board, and approval by shareholders at the AGM 
in May 2015.
Principles considered when setting remuneration
The Company operates in the particularly competitive media market. We aim to balance the need to attract and retain high-
quality talent essential to the Company’s success with the need to be cost-effective and to reward exceptional performance. 
The Committee has developed a Remuneration Policy for the Company that balances these factors, while taking into account 
the prevailing best practice and a fair outcome for investors.
A significant proportion of the remuneration package is tied to the achievement of stretching performance conditions, that 
align remuneration with our strategy to deliver strong business performance and create shareholder value. Individuals should 
be rewarded for success and performance measured over clear timescales. The remuneration package is focused on rewarding 
sustained long-term performance and aligning executives with the shareholder experience.
Throughout this report we make reference to Strategic Priorities. For reference these are as detailed in the tables below.
For awards made in 2015 and 2016 
Target
Maximise audience and revenue from free-to-air and VOD business
Grow an international content business
Build a global pay and distribution business

Salary
Salaries are paid in line with our Remuneration Policy.
T axable benefits
The benefits provided to the Executive Directors include the cost of private medical insurance and car-related benefits.
Bonus (cash and shares)
Annual incentives are provided to Executive Directors through the bonus, with one-third of any award deferred into shares under 
the Deferred Share Award Plan (DSA). The performance conditions that apply to the bonus are set on an individual basis and are 
linked to the Company’s corporate, financial and strategic priorities. This enables the Committee to reward both annual financial 
performance delivered for shareholders, and performance against specific financial, operational or strategic objectives set for 
each Executive Director, which are closely linked to the strategic priorities of the business. Payments and deferrals in respect of 
the financial year are set out below.

When considering performance outcomes, the Committee looks beyond formulaic results to ensure the outcomes align with 
overall business performance.
The majority of the bonus (60%) was based upon the achievement of corporate and financial targets, with payout determined 
in accordance with pre-set target ranges subject only to the usual adjustments to exclude the impact of in-year acquisitions and 
disposals, significant unbudgeted initiatives and currency movements. 
The remainder of the bonus (40%) was based upon the Committee’s assessment of the contribution the Executive Director has 
made to the overall strategy through the delivery of specific targets. Both Executive Directors had a number of common objectives 
aligned to our Strategic Priorities. The Strategic Report sets out more detail of the Company’s achievements in the year.

ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 71
 Annual Remuneration Report During the year particular achievements, in addition to the delivery of the stretching business plan, related to international 
expansion and development of organic growth and new commissions. This was achieved with the acquisition of T alpa,  
Twofour Group and other production businesses and investments.
Adam Crozier was also assessed against the continuing international expansion of ITV Studios, as well as the growth of the UK 
and international Pay and Online businesses.
Ian Griffiths was also assessed against effective M&A activity, and supporting ITV Studios and Broadcast to develop their 
international businesses and creative performance.
With regard to disclosure of performance against the corporate and financial targets, previous reports stated that these targets 
contained commercially sensitive information, which would remain so until two years after the end of the relevant financial year, 
at which point they may be disclosed. However, to reflect emerging best practice, the Committee has decided to provide 
immediate disclosure of the corporate and financial targets used following the relevant year end, together with performance 
against those targets and the resulting level of payout. Consequently, the tables below provide this detail for the 2015 bonus 
year, as well as for 2013 and 2014.

On 28 March 2015 awards were made under the LTIP to both Executive Directors in the form of nil-cost options, subject to 
performance over the period to 31 December 2017 . 50% of any shares that vest will be subject to a one year holding period, 
the remaining 50% will be subject to a two year holding period as follows:

50% – 28 March 2020
The number of nil-cost options was calculated using the average share price over the three day period prior to the award date (256.7 pence).
The LTIP was introduced in 2014 following the remuneration review at that time and subsequent approval by shareholders at the 
2014 AGM. The holding periods were phased in over the first two annual awards made in 2014 and 2015. For awards made in 
2016, 100% of any shares that vest will be subject to a two year holding period. 
The Committee sets targets for the LTIP taking into account external forecasts, internal budgets, business priorities, and risks 
and uncertainties. T argets are set to be appropriately stretching in this context, with maximum performance set at a level which 
is considered to be the delivery of exceptional performance.
The awards made in 2015 are subject to performance measures and targets as set out below. Awards will be subject to an initial 
cumulative adjusted EPS performance gateway equal to that required for threshold performance (45.7 pence) before any 
portion of the award can vest.

Threshold vesting for all targets is 20%. Vesting between threshold and maximum is on a straight-line basis.
When assessing performance against the Family SOV target, the Committee will also have regard to the health of the main 
ITV channel.
Payments to past Directors or for loss of office
No payments were made during the year.
Consideration of Directors’ remuneration
The Directors who were members of the Committee when matters relating to the Executive Directors’ remuneration for the 
year were considered, are set out on page 69.
The Committee obtains advice from various sources in order to ensure it makes informed decisions. The Chief Executive and

to their own remuneration.
The Group HR Director is the main internal adviser and provides updates on remuneration, employee relations and human 
resource issues.

Bonus (cash and shares)
Awards will continue to be made in line with the Remuneration Policy, with annual incentives paid to Executive Directors through 
the bonus with two-thirds in cash, and one-third deferred into shares under the DSA. The proposed performance measures for 
awards are detailed below and remain unchanged from 2015. The weightings for 2016 reflect the changes to the bonus 
framework outlined in the Chairman’s letter on page 68. The Board considers the actual targets for 2016 to be commercially 
sensitive at this time and we envisage including equivalent disclosures to those included in respect of the 2015 bonus in next 
year’s report.

ITV plc EBITA (before exceptional items) 60%
Profit to cash conversion 10%
Cost savings 5%
Individual targets 25%
Share awards
Awards will continue to be made under the LTIP in line with the Remuneration Policy. The proposed performance measures and 
targets for awards to be made in 2016 are detailed below. 
Under the LTIP rules, the maximum annual award that can be granted in any financial year is 350% of salary. This is to allow the 
Committee flexibility when recruiting Executives and to ensure the longevity of the plan. There is currently no intention to grant 
awards at this level. Awards in 2016 will be made to the Executive Directors with a value of 225% of salary, at the same level as 
awarded in 2015 and in line with the operational maximum set out in the Remuneration Policy.
In order to ensure that Executive Directors are only rewarded if value is delivered to shareholders, awards will be subject to an 
initial cumulative adjusted EPS performance gateway equal to that required for threshold performance (54.6 pence). If this 
gateway is achieved, performance will then be assessed by reference to the conditions set out below.
Performance measure Strategic target Weightings Threshold Maximum
Cumulative adjusted EPS 50% 54.6p 62.4p
Family SOV 20% 20.2% 21.6%
Total non-NAR 10% 5% growth pa 10% growth pa
International Production revenue 10% 5% growth pa 15% growth pa
Online, Pay & Interactive revenue
  
10% 5% growth pa 18% growth pa
Threshold vesting for all targets is 20%. Vesting between threshold and maximum (100%) is on a straight-line basis except in 
respect of the Family SOV measure. This has a lower level of vesting that occurs at 21.2% (75% vesting) with straight-line vesting 
to that position from each threshold and maximum. When assessing performance against this target, the Committee will also 
have regard to the health of the main ITV channel.
Shares that vest will be subject to a two year holding period. 
Malus and Clawback
Malus and clawback provisions may be operated at the discretion of the Committee in respect of any cash and deferred share 
elements of the bonus and awards made under the LTIP following the introduction/amendment of these clauses. Under malus, 
unvested share awards (including any LTIP shares subject to a post vesting holding period) can be reduced (down to zero if 
considered appropriate) or be made subject to additional conditions. Clawback allows for repayment of bonuses previously paid 
and/or shares previously received following vesting. Malus/clawback can be operated up to four years following the start of the 
relevant bonus year for bonuses, and up to six years from the relevant date of grant for LTIP awards. The circumstances in which 
the operation of these provisions may be considered include material misstatement of results, gross misconduct or fraud.

Directors’ share interests
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee continues to recognise the importance of Executive Directors being shareholders so as to align their interests 
with other shareholders. Shareholding guidelines are in place, which encourage Executive Directors to build up a holding of ITV 
plc shares based on a percentage of base salary. 50% of the requirement must be obtained within three years of appointment 
and the remainder within five years.

The Company may also make a payment in respect of outplacement costs, legal fees and the cost of any settlement agreement 
where appropriate.
With the exception of termination for cause or resignation, Executive Directors will be eligible for a bonus award prorated to 
reflect the proportion of the financial year for which they were employed and subject to performance achieved, provided they 
have a minimum of three months service in the bonus year.
Non-executive Directors
Each Non-executive Director, including the Chairman, has a contract of service with the Company. Non-executive Directors will 
serve for an initial term of three years, subject to election and annual re-election by shareholders, unless otherwise terminated 
earlier by and at the discretion of either party upon one month’s written notice (12 months for the current Chairman). After the 
initial three year term reappointment is on an annual basis.
All Non-executive Directors are subject to election or re-election at the AGM in 2016. Details of unexpired terms are set out in the 
table on page 59.
The Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.

Governance The Company’s policy on remuneration for Executive and Non-executive Directors was approved by shareholders at the AGM 
on 14 May 2014 for a three year period. The full policy can be found on our website:
 www.itvplc.com/about/governance
The table below contains the principal elements of the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors.
Fixed elements Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum potential payment Performance metrics
Base 
salary
Reflects the individual’s 
skills, responsibilities 
and experience.
Supports the 
recruitment and 
retention of Executive 
Directors of the calibre 
required to deliver 
the business strategy 
within the competitive 
media market.
Reviewed annually and paid 
monthly in cash.
Consideration is typically given 
to a range of factors when 
determining salary levels, 
including:
• Personal and Company-wide 
performance.
• Typical pay levels in relevant 
markets for each Executive 
whilst recognising the need 
for an appropriate premium 
to attract and retain superior 
talent, balanced against 
the need to provide a 
cost-effective overall 
remuneration package.
• The wider employee pay review.
There is no maximum 
salary increase. However, 
ordinarily salary increases 
will be in line with the 
average increase awarded 
to other employees in 
the Company.
Increases may be made 
above this level to take 
account of individual 
circumstances, which 
may include:
• Increase in size or 
scope of the role or 
responsibility.
• Increase to reflect the 
individual’s development 
and performance in role.
None, although 
overall individual 
and business 
performance is 
considered when 
setting and 
reviewing salaries.
Provision for 
an income in 
retirement
To provide competitive 
post-retirement benefits 
or cash allowance as 
a framework to save 
for retirement.
Supports the 
recruitment and 
retention of Executive 
Directors of the calibre 
required to deliver 
the business strategy 
within the competitive 
media market.
Executives can choose to 
participate in the ITV defined 
contribution scheme, receive 
a cash allowance or receive 
payments into a personal 
pension or a combination 
thereof.
Contributions are set as a 
percentage of base salary.
Post-retirement benefits do 
not form part of the base 
salary for the purposes of 
determining incentives.
The maximum 
contributions or cash 
allowances for the 
Executive Directors 
are 25% of base salary.
None
Benefits Ensures the overall 
package is competitive 
and provides financial 
protection for employees 
and their families.
The Company provides a range 
of market competitive benefits 
including travel-related benefits, 
private medical insurance and 
other insurance benefits.
Additional benefits may  
also be provided in certain 
circumstances, if required for 
business need. For example 
(but not limited to), relocation 
expenses, housing allowance 
and education support.
Set at a level which the 
Committee considers 
to be appropriately 
positioned taking into 
account typical market 
levels for comparable 
roles, individual 
circumstances and 
the overall cost to 
the business.

outcomes on an 
annual basis.
Focus on key financial 
metrics and objectives 
to deliver the business 
strategy.
The element 
compulsorily deferred 
into shares rewards 
delivery of sustained 
long-term performance, 
provides alignment 
with the shareholder 
experience and 
supports the retention 
of executives.
Measures and targets are set 
annually based on business 
plans at the start of the 
financial year and pay-out 
levels are determined by the 
Committee following the 
year-end based on performance 
against objectives.
Paid once the results have 
been audited. Annual bonus 
calculations that are based 
on the financial results for the 
year are audited by Internal 
Audit and reviewed by the 
Audit Committee before 
consideration by the 
Committee.
The Committee has the 
discretion to amend the bonus 
pay-out should any formulaic 
assessment of performance not 
reflect a balanced view of 
overall business performance 
for the year.
Two-thirds of the bonus is 
delivered in cash and one-third 
is deferred into shares under the 
DSA for a period of three years. 
During the deferral period 
share awards may be reduced 
or cancelled in certain 
circumstances. Further detail  
is provided on our website  
www.itvplc.com/governance.
Dividends are paid to 
participants on the deferred 
shares during the deferral 
period.
The maximum bonus 
opportunity for any 
Executive Director will 
not exceed 200% 
of salary.
The current bonus 
opportunities are 180% 
of salary for Adam 
Crozier and 165% of 
salary for Ian Griffiths.
Increases above the 
current opportunities, up 
to the maximum limit, 
may be made to take 
account of individual 
circumstances, which 
may include:
• Increase in size or 
scope of the role 
or responsibility.
• Increase to reflect 
the individual’s 
development and 
performance in 
their role.
Performance 
measures and targets 
are set by the 
Committee each year 
based on corporate 
objectives closely 
linked to the 
strategic priorities 
and individual 
contributions.
The majority of the 
bonus opportunity 
will be based on the 
corporate and 
financial measures.
The remainder of the 
bonus will be based on 
performance against 
individual objectives.
Up to 20% of 
the maximum 
opportunity will 
be received for 
threshold 
performance.

New LTIP Incentivises Executives 
to deliver performance 
which is aligned to 
the business strategy 
over the longer term 
and the creation of 
shareholder value.
Acts as a retention tool 
to retain the Executives 
required to deliver the 
business strategy.
Awards are made annually 
with vesting dependent on 
business performance during 
the performance period. The 
performance period will be 
three years, other than in 
exceptional circumstances.
The Committee has discretion 
to amend the final vesting 
level should any formulaic 
assessment of performance 
not reflect a balanced view 
of the business performance 
during the performance period.
Awards will be required to be 
held for an additional period of 
two years after the end of the 
performance period. This is 
called the holding period and 
will be phased in during 2014 
and 2015.
Dividends are earned on 
deferred shares during the 
holding period.
During the holding period 
awards may be reduced or 
cancelled in certain 
circumstances. Further detail 
is provided on our website 
www.itvplc.com/governance.
Our current operational 
policy is to make 
awards of 225% of salary 
each year.
Under the new LTIP rules, 
the maximum annual 
award that may be 
granted in any financial 
year is 350% of salary. 
The Committee would 
consult with 
shareholders if it was 
considering increasing 
awards above the 
current operational 
policy.
Performance is 
measured against 
corporate targets 
closely linked to the 
Company’s financial 
and strategic priorities.
Performance metrics 
are:
• Adjusted EPS
• Non-NAR and its 
components
• Viewing 
performance
LTIP awards will vest 
based on financial 
performance. 
A gateway condition 
must be achieved 
before any portion 
of the award vests. 
Each performance 
metric will operate 
independently.
The performance 
range will be 
determined for each 
metric. The proportion 
of each element of the 
award that will vest for 
threshold performance 
against a metric will 
be 20%.

 Remuneration Policy The table below summarises the main elements of remuneration for Non-executive Directors:
Component Approach of the Company
Chairman fees The Committee determines the fees of the Chairman and sets the fees at a level that is considered 
to be appropriate, taking into account the size and complexity of the business and the expected time 
commitment and contribution of the role.
The fee is a fixed annual fee of which 25% (40% for the current Chairman), after statutory deductions, 
is used to acquire shares in the Company. The shares are purchased quarterly and held by a nominee 
until retirement from the Board.
Non-executive fees The Board determines the fees of the Non-executive Directors and sets the fees at a level that is 
considered to be appropriate, taking into account the size and complexity of the business and the 
expected time commitment and contribution of the role.
Fees are structured as a basic fee with additional fees payable for membership and/or chairmanship 
of a committee or other additional responsibilities.
The Non-executive Directors are required to use 25% of their annual fees, after statutory deductions, 
to acquire shares in the Company. The shares are purchased quarterly and held by a nominee on their 
behalf until they retire from the Board.
Benefits Additional benefits may also be provided in certain circumstances, if required for business purposes.
Remuneration Policy continued
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 84
Governance The Directors present their Annual Report and the audited consolidated and parent company financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2015. The Directors’ Report required under the Companies Act 2006 comprises this report, the entire 
Governance section including the Annual Remuneration Report, and the Strategic Report, all of which are incorporated by 
reference and deemed to form part of this report.
Articles of Association 
Unless expressly specified to the contrary, the Articles of Association may only be amended by special resolution of the 
shareholders. The Articles are available on our website.
 www.itvplc.com/about/governance
Auditor
During the year the Audit Committee considered the performance and audit fees of the external auditor, and the level of 
non-audit work undertaken. They recommended to the Board that a resolution for the reappointment of KPMG LLP for a 
further year as the Company’s auditor be proposed to shareholders at the AGM in May 2016. 
Change of control
No person holds securities in the Company carrying special rights with regard to control of the Company.
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options would 
normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions and 
proration for time where appropriate.
Certain of the Group’s bonds/borrowing facilities have change of control clauses whereby the issuer can require ITV to repay/
redeem bonds in the event of a change of control. The Company is not aware of any other significant agreements to which it 
is party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company.
Directors
Appointments: A table showing Directors who served in the year can be found on page 59. Biographies for Directors currently 
in office can be found on pages 54 and 55. 
Directors are appointed for an initial three year period and annually thereafter. During the year Roger Faxon, Andy Haste, Archie 
Norman and John Ormerod were re-appointed for a further 12 month period. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, each Director will retire and submit himself or herself for election or re-election at the AGM on 12 May 2016.
Detail on compensation for loss of office can be found in the Annual Remuneration Report on page 79.
Conflicts of interest: The Board has delegated the authorisation of conflicts to the Nomination Committee and has adopted 
a Conflicts of Interest Policy. The Board has considered in detail the current external appointments of the Directors which may 
give rise to a situational conflict and has authorised potential conflicts where appropriate. This authorisation can be reviewed 
at any time but will always be subject to annual review. The Board is confident that these procedures operate effectively.
Contracts of significance: No Director had any interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiary undertakings.
Powers: The powers of the Directors are set out in the Articles of Association. The Articles and a schedule of Matters Reserved 
for the Board can be found on our website.

Employees 
Disability: The Company gives full and fair consideration to the employment of people with disabilities 
in accordance with the Equality Act 2010. This is reflected in an award from the Department for Work and 
Pensions of a Two Ticks Disability Symbol. In the event of a colleague becoming disabled, it is the Company’s 
policy, wherever possible, to support the individual to continue their employment or be considered for other 
open positions within the business. 
The Company’s employment and recruitment policy is based on non-discrimination and equal opportunities. We are committed 
to ensuring that all training, career development and promotional opportunities are accessible and inclusive to all and individuals 
with a disability are afforded the same career opportunities for growth and progression.
The Company provides tailored measures to ensure employees are fully supported and that reasonable 
adjustments are made, training is provided and resource materials are accessible. The Company continues 
to review its policies and practices to build confidence around the disability agenda, to attract, develop and retain those with a 
disability, both on and off screen. The Company is also able to draw on its in-house service SignPost for additional support and 
guidance around access and inclusion for particular audiences.
The Company’s commitment around the disability agenda extends beyond our legal obligations and partners with a variety of 
external specialists to drive best practice. For a comprehensive outline of our activity visit our Corporate Responsibility website. 
 www.itvresponsibility.com
Diversity: Diversity within the organisation is integral to achieving our business aims. Reflecting the demographics of our 
customers and understanding their needs ensures that our brand, programmes and services are accessible, inclusive and have 
wide appeal. Further information can be found on our Corporate Responsibility website. 
 www.itvresponsibility.com
Engagement: Attracting and retaining talent is critical to our success. It is therefore in our interest to ensure that we provide 
the appropriate rewards and opportunities for development so that colleagues feel engaged with the Company.
In 2015 the Company carried out an engagement campaign consisting of a series of Management Board led roadshows across 
the business. This gave colleagues an opportunity to feed back their thoughts and concerns about the business. Engagement 
was reinforced through forums such as the intranet, regular soft and hard-copy newsletters and briefings between management 
and their teams. These channels enabled colleagues to understand the financial and economic factors affecting the Company’s 
performance, how their role contributed towards the execution of the strategy and how they could benefit from Company 
success through involvement in employee share schemes and information on their rights and benefits. 
Directors’ Report continued
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 86
Governance To further promote colleague engagement, the Company has introduced a network of Ambassadors who have been nominated 
and elected by their colleagues to represent each part of the business. These Ambassadors share the views of colleagues with 
the business, enabling us to understand ways to make ITV a better place to work. The Ambassadors also keep colleagues up to 
date with what is going on across the business.
We have continued to measure and listen to colleagues through employee surveys. A short survey carried out at the end of 2015 
revealed that 93% of colleagues were proud to work for ITV, with the total engagement score of 89.33% (90% in 2014), 6% higher 
than the benchmark response.
Remuneration: When the Company reviews pay it takes a number of factors into consideration, including the need to stay 
competitive. Our focus on cash and costs remains incredibly important for the future health of our business. We need to balance 
our business and financial commitments with our continuing investment in our programming and people. 
The Company continues to be committed to ensuring colleagues earn at least the Living Wage or greater. Where appropriate 
we have agreed additional increases. On 1 January 2016, all eligible colleagues received a pay increase of 3.0% (2015: 2.2%), 
with all those on a full-time equivalent basic salary of £100,000 or above receiving 2.5%. 
In addition a bonus arrangement extends to all our colleagues, providing a comprehensive incentive framework which rewards 
everybody when the Company is successful. The all-colleague bonus award for 2015 was paid in full at £1,500 (2014: paid in full 
at £1,200). 
The Company also operates a successful and popular all-employee Save As You Earn scheme that encourages voluntary 
investment in Company shares and a package of voluntary benefits, which provides valuable cost savings for both colleagues 
and the Company.
Information about remuneration for the Directors is included in the Annual Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 80.
Succession planning: When planning succession within the Company consideration is given to emergency cover together with 
medium and long-term succession and this is reviewed annually by the Nomination Committee. There is particular emphasis on 
growing the internal leadership pipeline through the launch of the following key programmes:
Executive Development Programme – Next generation potential Board successors, giving them an opportunity to develop 
their management potential and gain a greater understanding of the business.
Developing Future Leaders Programme – Delegates selected from across the business identified as a result of the

The emissions data covers our global properties but not our US acquisitions. The latest conversion factors specified in Defra and DECC’s 2015 guidance were used to 
calculate emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. 35% of our data set is based on estimated data. Estimates are calculated from previous consumption 
trends and published benchmarks. The 2014 total is 19 (t CO 2 e) which is higher than reported last year due to additional data received.
Health and safety
The health and safety of our colleagues, contractors and visitors is always a high priority. The significant loss of human life as 
the result of a major incident has been identified as a specific risk to the organisation. The Company’s professional Health and 
Safety team continue to use a management system that meets the specific risk profile of the business which is communicated 
across the business. This is supported by a comprehensive training programme and direct support from the Health and 
Safety team.
Health and safety performance information is reported to the Board monthly and briefings were held in 2015 for the 
Management and Studios Boards. In 2015 a full health and safety compliance review was undertaken and work was done with 
external production companies to develop a model for compliance with the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 
2015 appropriate for a television production business. Work at height continues to be an area of focus for us as our reporting 
indicates this is an ongoing issue for productions.

Governance Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors consider that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s and the Group’s position 
and performance, business model 
and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 54 and 55, 
confirm that, to the best of their 
knowledge:
• the Group accounts, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group; and
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with 
a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces.
In accordance with Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Directors 
confirm that, so far as they are each 
aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware; and each Director 
has taken all steps that they ought to 
have taken as a Director in order to 
make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
The Board has conducted a review of 
the effectiveness of the Group’s systems 
of internal controls for the year ended 
31 December 2015. In the opinion of 
the Board, the Company has complied 
with the internal control requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
throughout the year, maintaining 
an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating, and minimising risk. 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group 
and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, 
the Directors are required:
• to select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• to make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, to state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
• to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent 
company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible 
for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Annual Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law 
and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the 
UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

 Directors’ responsibilities Financial Statements
In this section The financial statements have been presented in a style that attempts to make them less 
complex and more relevant to shareholders. We have grouped the note disclosures into five 
sections: ‘Basis of Preparation’, ‘Results for the Year’, ‘Operating Assets and Liabilities’, ‘Capital 
Structure and Financing Costs’ and ‘Other Notes’. Each section sets out the accounting policies 
applied in producing the relevant notes, along with details of any key judgements and estimates 
used. The purpose of this format is to provide readers with a clearer understanding of what drives 
financial performance of the Group. The aim of the text in boxes is to provide commentary on  
each section, or note, in plain English.
Keeping it 
simple
Notes to the financial statements provide information required by statute, accounting standards  
or Listing Rules to explain a particular feature of the financial statements. The notes which follow  
will also provide explanations and additional disclosure to assist readers’ understanding and 
interpretation of the Annual Report and the financial statements.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of ITV plc for the year ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages 97 to 170.  
In our opinion: 
• The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union; 
• The parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ; and
• The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit, were as follows:
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these significant risks is set out in the Audit Committee Report on pages 62 to 67 . 
The risk Our response
Revenue recognition and contractual arrangements (see note 2.1)  
The Group’s revenue consists primarily of advertising, programme production and programme rights. 
Net Advertising Revenue (‘NAR’) £1,719 million  
(2014: £1,629 million)
The majority of ITV’s advertising revenue (NAR) is subject to 
regulation under Ofcom’s Contract Rights Renewal system 
(‘CRR’). CRR works by ensuring that the annual share of TV 
advertising that will be placed with ITV by each advertising 
agency can change in relation to the viewing figures for 
commercial television that it delivers. The CRR system, the 
pricing of the annual contractual arrangements with advertising 
agencies and the details of each advertising campaign, together 
with the related processes and controls, are complex and 
involve estimation. 
In particular, the pricing mechanism means it is possible for a 
difference to arise between the price paid for an advertising 
campaign and the value it delivered, mainly as a result of the 
actual viewing figures being different from the agreed level. 
Where the Group has over-delivered viewers this is referred to 
as a ‘deal credit’, or a ‘deal debt’ where delivery has fallen short. 
Rather than the price paid for that campaign being adjusted, 
these differences are noted for each agency and then taken 
account of when agreeing either future campaigns or the 
annual contract. A net deal debt position with an agency is 
recorded in ITV’s accounts, as a liability. Net deal credit positions 
are not recognised.
NAR is therefore considered a significant risk due to:
• The number and complexity of contractual agreements with 
advertising agencies
• The complexity of the systems and processes of control used 
to record revenue and
• The level of estimation involved in determining the deal debt 
liability at the period end 
Our procedures included: 
• Testing of controls, assisted by our own IT specialists, including 
those over: input of individual campaigns’ terms and pricing, 
comparison of those terms and pricing data against the related 
contracts with advertising agencies; linkage to transmission/viewer 
data; and segregation of duties
• Testing management’s review controls over: contract approval; 
periodic deal reconciliations and the related deal debt adjustment 
• Analysing revenue based on our industry knowledge and external 
market data, following up variances and 
• Challenging the year-end deal debt position based on comparison 
with customers’ correspondence and agreed terms of business 
We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of the accounting policies on revenue recognition set out in note 2.1.

The risk Our response
Other revenue streams (‘Non-NAR revenue’) £1,253 million 
(2014: £961 million)
Non-NAR revenue includes revenue from; programme 
production, the sale of programme rights, transmission supply 
arrangements and the Online, Pay & Interactive division within 
the Broadcast segment.
Recognition of non-NAR revenue is driven by the specific terms 
of the related contracts. It is considered to be a risk as the terms 
of the contracts are varied and can be complex, with the result 
that accounting for the revenue generated in any given period 
can require individual consideration. 
Our procedures included:
• Testing of controls over the timing of revenue recognition. 
We considered the Group’s revenue recognition policies against 
the relevant accounting standards and 
• For a sample of contracts entered into during the year, we tested 
whether revenue had been recognised in accordance with the 
contractual terms in the correct accounting period, given the 
requirements of the relevant accounting standard
Acquisition accounting: Talpa Media B.V. (initial consideration £238 million and goodwill arising £41 million (see notes 3.3 and 
3.4) (2014: Leftfield Entertainment initial consideration £209 million and goodwill arising £139 million)
ITV acquired 100% of Talpa Media on 30 April 2015. The 
acquisition agreement requires the seller to provide services 
to ITV for a period of seven years, in order to qualify for 
performance-based payments after two, five and seven years. 
Further, a portion of the initial consideration is repayable if the 
seller ceases to provide services for a two year period after 
acquisition. Accounting for the Talpa acquisition is considered 
a significant risk as a result of the following factors: 
• The Group is required to make a number of judgements, 
which focus on, but are not limited to: assessment of whether 
the performance-related consideration arrangements are 
acquisition consideration or post-acquisition remuneration, 
identification of intangible assets acquired and assessment 
of fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and
• In determining the fair value of the acquired intangible assets 
and the contingent consideration and remuneration payable, 
medium term cashflow forecasts have been prepared by ITV. 
The inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting future cash 
flows and the judgement involved in the selection of the 
appropriate discount rate makes this a key area of focus
Our procedures included:
• Inspecting the terms of the acquisition contracts to determine 
whether the accounting treatment of performance-related 
consideration arrangements applied is appropriate based on the 
criteria of the relevant accounting standards
• Using our own valuation specialists to assist us in: assessing both 
the appropriateness of the identified intangibles, against the 
criteria of the relevant accounting standards, and the 
appropriateness of the discount rates
• Comparing the Group’s forecast revenue growth and margins 
assumptions to our own assessments, based on our industry 
knowledge, in relation to key inputs such as the useful lives of, 
and likelihood of revenue from, existing formats and
• Understanding of the principles applied by the Group in 
determining the acquisition date fair values for the remaining 
assets and liabilities and agreeing significant adjustments to 
supporting documentation, such as underlying contracts and 
vendor due diligence reports
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of the acquisition and the related judgments in note 3.4.
Defined benefit pension schemes £176 million (2014: £346 million) (see note 3.7)
Significant estimates are made in valuing the Group’s post-
retirement defined benefit schemes.
The key valuation assumptions are set out in note 3.7 in the 
‘Assumptions’ section. When making these assumptions the 
Group takes independent actuarial advice relating to their 
appropriateness.
The valuation is considered to be a significant risk as, given 
the quantum of the pension deficit, small changes in the 
assumptions can have a material financial impact on the Group.
In this area our procedures included challenging the key assumptions 
applied in determining the Group’s net deficit, being the discount 
rate, inflation rate and mortality/life expectancy, with the support 
of our own actuarial specialists. This included a comparison of these 
key assumptions against externally derived data. 
We also considered the adequacy of the group’s disclosures in respect 
of the sensitivity of the deficits to these assumptions in note 3.7.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 94
Financial Statements The risk Our response
Royalty accruals £69 million (2014: £70 million) (see note 3.1.5) 
The Group pays royalties directly to artists or producers for 
content used. The contractual terms of these agreements are 
varied and complex. 
The related IT systems can only address part of the processing, 
necessitating a significant manual element in calculating 
royalty accruals recorded by the Group. 
Overall the process is complex and the volume and variety of 
contracts being interpreted and accounted for combined with 
the manual nature of the process increases the risk of error. 
Among other procedures, we tested manual controls over the 
recording of royalty costs and the approval of royalty payments. 
We re-performed a sample of the Group’s annual royalty calculations, 
agreeing key inputs to contracts and the underlying system data. 
In addition, for a sample of programs, we performed analytical 
procedures, comparing the royalty costs recorded in the financial 
statements to our expectation using participation percentages from 
the underlying contracts, and following up variances. 
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £29 million (2014: £25 million), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Group profit before tax, of which it represents 4.6% (2014: 4.1%). 
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £1.5 million 
(2014: £1 million), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

The Group’s principal operations are in the United Kingdom and only the core UK operations (comprising Broadcast and Online, 
the UK Studios, Global Entertainment and the central functions) are scoped in for Group audit purposes. The Group audit team 
performed the audit of the core UK operations as if they were a single aggregated set of financial information using materiality 
of £25 million (2014: £23 million). The Group audit team performed all of the audit procedures over the risks related to the 
acquisition of T alpa Media.
Although not in-scope for Group reporting purposes, in agreement with the Audit Committee, specified audit procedures were 
also performed on two entities in the US and one entity in the Netherlands by component auditors simultaneously with the audit 
of the Group and UK operations. The Group audit team set the materiality for specified audit procedures at £5 million for all 
components. Together the above audit and these specified audit procedures covered 92% (2014: 96%) of total Group revenue, 
94% (2014: 99%) of Group profit before taxation; and 88% (2014: 99%) of total Group assets.

Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements
Section 1: Basis of Preparation
In this section This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that relate to the financial 
statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the 
policy is described in the note to which it relates. This section also shows new 
EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, and 
whether they are effective in 2015 or later years. We explain how these changes 
are expected to impact the financial position and performance of the Group.
The financial statements consolidate those of ITV plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interests in associates and jointly controlled entities. The 
Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom.
As required by European Union law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002) the Group’s financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘IFRS’), 
and approved by the Directors.
The financial statements are principally prepared on the basis of historical cost. Where other bases are 
applied these are identified in the relevant accounting policy.
The parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS101).
Going concern
At 31 December 2015 the Group was in a net debt position. The Group’s strong balance sheet and 
continued generation of significant free cash flows has enabled further acquisitions as well as the payment 
of a special dividend. The Group has also sought to gain further efficiencies in the balance sheet and 
maintain the flexibility to invest in the business by issuing a new Eurobond (see section 4 for details 
on capital structure and financing).
The Group continues to review forecasts of the television advertising market to determine the impact 
on ITV’s liquidity position. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, show that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its 
current funding.
The Group also continues to focus on development of the non-advertising business, and evaluates the 
impact of further investment in acquisitions against the strategy and cash headroom of the business.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operation for at least twelve months from the date of this report. Accordingly, 
the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and available for sale investments 
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists where the 
Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity in order to obtain benefits 
from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible 
are taken into account.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the Group holds an interest under a contractual 
arrangement where the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity that is 
subject to joint control. The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures using the equity method. 
Under the equity method the investment in the entity is stated as one line item at cost plus the investor’s 
share of retained post-acquisition profits and other changes in net assets.
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group has significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in, but not control or jointly control, the financial 
and operating decisions of an entity. These investments are also accounted for using the equity method.
Investments where the Group concludes it does not have significant influence are deemed ‘available for 
sale’. These investments are held at fair value unless the investment is a start-up business, in which case 
it is valued at cost and assessed for impairment.
Financial Statements
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 103
 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements
Section 1: Basis of Preparation continued
Current/non-current distinction
Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets 
expected to be realised in, or intended for sale or use in, the course of the Group’s operating cycle. All other 
assets are classified as non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in 
the course of the Group’s operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date. 
All other liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities.
Classification of financial instruments
The financial assets and liabilities of the Group are classified into the following financial statement captions 
in the statement of financial position in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
• Loans and receivables – separately disclosed as cash and cash equivalents (excluding gilts over which 
unfunded pension commitments have a charge) and trade and other receivables
• Available for sale financial assets – measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Includes 
gilts over which unfunded pension commitments have a charge
• Financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss – separately disclosed as derivative financial 
instruments in assets/liabilities and included in non-current other payables (contingent consideration) and
• Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost – separately disclosed as borrowings and trade and 
other payables
Judgement is required when determining the appropriate classification of the Group’s financial instruments. 
Details on the accounting policies for measurement of the above instruments are set out in the relevant note.
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
The Group recognises a financial asset or liability when it becomes a party to the contract. Financial 
instruments are no longer recognised in the statement of financial position when the contractual cash flows 
expire or when the Group no longer retains control of substantially all the risks and rewards under the 
instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits with a maturity of less than or equal to 
three months from the date of acquisition, cash held to meet certain finance lease commitments and gilts 
in respect of which a charging deed was executed on the unfunded pension commitments of four former 
Granada executives. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents is considered to approximate fair value.
Foreign currencies
The primary economic environment in which the Group operates is the UK and therefore the consolidated 
financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (‘£’).
Where Group companies based in the UK transact in foreign currencies, these transactions are translated 
into pounds sterling at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Foreign currency monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated into pounds sterling at the year end exchange rate. Where there is a movement in 
the exchange rate between the date of the transaction and the year end, a foreign exchange gain or loss 
is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is implemented on certain foreign currency firm commitments, which allows for the 
effective portion of any foreign exchange gains or losses to be recognised in other comprehensive income 
(note 4.3).
Where a forward currency contract is used to manage foreign exchange risk and hedge accounting is not 
applied, any movement in currency is taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into pounds sterling at the 
exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
The assets and liabilities of Group companies outside of the UK are translated into pounds sterling at the 
year end exchange rate. The revenue and expenses of these companies are translated into pounds sterling 
at the average monthly exchange rate during the year. Where differences arise between these rates, they 
are recognised in the translation reserve within other comprehensive income.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 104
Financial Statements Exchange differences arising on the translation of the Group’s interests in joint ventures and associates 
are recognised in the translation reserve within other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a subsidiary outside the UK or an interest in a joint venture or an associate, the related 
translation reserve is released to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the 
Group’s accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below and in more detail in the 
related notes:
• Revenue recognition (note 2.1)
• Business combinations (note 3.3 and note 3.4)
• Allocation of goodwill and assets to CGUs and impairment of assets (note 3.3)
In addition to the above, the areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are 
significant to the financial statements are set out below and in more detail in the related notes:
• Defined benefit pension schemes, including the related longevity swap (note 3.7)
• T axation (note 2.3)
New or amended EU endorsed accounting standards
The table below represents new or amended EU endorsed accounting standards relevant to the Group’s 
results that are effective in 2015: 
Accounting Standard Requirement Impact on financial statements
IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits
The amendment was to simplify the accounting for 
contributions that are independent of the number of years 
of employee service.
The amendment has not had 
any impact on the Group.
Annual 
Improvements 
to IFRS 2010 – 
2012 cycle 
Various amendments to simplify various standards including 
IFRS 2 Share-based payment, IFRS 3 Business Combinations, 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments, IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, 
IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 24 Related Party 
Disclosures and IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
The amendments do not 
change our accounting and 
therefore have no impact on 
the Group’s financial position 
or performance.
Annual 
Improvements 
to IFRS 2011 – 
2013 cycle
Various amendments to simplify various standards including 
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards, IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IFRS 13 
Fair Value Measurement, IAS 40 Investment Property.
The amendments do not 
change our accounting and 
therefore have no impact on 
the Group’s financial position 
or performance.
The Directors also considered the impact on the Group of other new and revised accounting standards, 
interpretations or amendments that are currently endorsed but not yet effective. There are none that are 
effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 that are expected to have a significant impact 
on the Group’s results. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective 1 January 2018 but has not yet been endorsed by the EU. 
The Directors are currently assessing the impact this standard would have on its financial position 
and performance.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is also effective 1 January 2018 and has also not been 
endorsed by the EU. The Directors have performed an initial assessment and do not expect a material 
impact on our Broadcast business. The assessment on our Studios business is ongoing.
IFRS 16 Leases is effective 1 January 2019 and has not been endorsed by the EU. The Directors are currently 
assessing the impact this standard would have on its financial position and performance.

Section 2: Results for the Year
In this section This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group. On the 
following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Group’s results for 
the year, segmental information, exceptional items, taxation and earnings 
per share.
Keeping it 
simple
This section analyses the Group’s profit before tax by reference to the activities 
performed by the Group and an analysis of key operating costs.
Earnings before interest, tax, amortisation (EBITA) and before exceptional items 
remains the Group’s key profit indicator. This reflects the way the business is 
managed and how the Directors assess the performance of the Group. This section 
therefore also shows each division’s contribution to total revenue and EBITA.
Accounting policies
Revenue recognition
Revenue is stated exclusive of VAT and comprises the sale of products and services to third parties. 
Judgement is required when determining the appropriate timing and amount of revenue that can be 
recognised, specifically around whether there is a firm contract and that the service has been provided, 
and if so, whether there is a fixed or reasonably determinable price that is reasonably certain will be 
collected. 
Revenue from the sale of products is recognised when the Group has transferred both the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership and control of the products sold, and the amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably. Revenue recognition criteria for the Group’s key classes of revenue are recognised on the 
following bases:
Applicable segment Class of revenue Recognition criteria
Broadcast & Online Advertising (NAR), Video on Demand 
(VOD)
on transmission, as audience targets are met
Broadcast & Online Sponsorship across period of transmission of the sponsored 
programme or series
Broadcast & Online Pay over the term of the contract or accrued in the 
month for the expected revenue per subscriber 
or download and trued up on receipt of third-
party reports showing revenue share calculation 
(showing subscribers or number of downloads)
Broadcast & Online Participation (Interactive & Brand 
Extensions)
as the service is provided or event occurs
Studios Programme production on delivery of episode and acceptance by the 
customer
Studios Programme distribution rights when the contract is signed and content is available 
for exploitation
Studios Format and licences at the point in time when the license is transferred 
and the customer is able to use and benefit from 
the licence
Studios Digital: Archive on delivery of content (one-off) or over the 
contract period in a manner that reflects the flow 
of content delivered (top-up)

Segmental information
Operating segments, which have not been aggregated, are determined in a manner that is consistent with 
how the business is managed and reported to the Board of Directors. The Board is regarded as the chief 
operating decision maker.
The Board considers the business primarily from an operating activity perspective. The reportable 
segments for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 are therefore Broadcast & Online 
and ITV Studios, the results of which are outlined in the following tables:

*  Revenue of £389 million (2014: £255 million) was generated in the US during the year, and represented £314 million (2014: £297 million) 
of non-current assets at year end.
Intersegment revenue, which is carried out on arm’s length terms, is generated from the supply of ITV 
Studios programmes to Broadcast & Online for transmission primarily on ITV. This revenue stream is a 
measure which forms part of the Group’s strategic priority of building a strong international content 
business, as by producing and retaining rights to the broadcast shows the Group benefits further from 
subsequent international content and format sales. 
In preparing the segment information, centrally managed costs have been allocated between reportable 
segments on a methodology driven principally by revenue, headcount and building occupancy of each 
segment. This is consistent with the basis of reporting to the Board of Directors.

Broadcast & Online 
The Group operates the largest commercial family of channels in the UK and delivers content through 
traditional television broadcasting. In addition to linear broadcast, the Group delivers its content on 
multiple platforms including the ITV Hub, pay platforms, or through direct content deals. Content, that is 
commissioned and scheduled by this segment, is funded primarily by television advertising, where revenue 
is generated from the sale of audiences for advertising airtime and sponsorship. 
Other sources of revenue are from: online advertising, HD digital channels on pay platforms (e.g. Sky and 
Virgin), SDN revenue (which generates licence sales for DTT Multiplex A), and participation revenue (which 
includes interactive sales from competitions) and ITV Choice in other countries.
ITV Studios 
ITV Studios is the Group’s international content business, creating and producing programmes and formats 
that return and travel, namely drama, entertainment and factual entertainment.
ITV Studios UK is the largest commercial producer in the UK and produces programming for the Group’s 
own channels, accounting for 60% of ITV main channel spend on commissioned programming. 
Programming is also sold to other UK broadcasters such as the BBC, Channel 4 and Sky. 
ITV America is the largest unscripted independent producer of content in the US and is growing its scripted 
presence by increasing investment in high profile dramas straight to series.
ITV Studios also operates in five other international locations being Australia, Germany, France, 
Netherlands (primarily T alpa) and the Nordics, where content is produced for local broadcasters. This 
content is either locally created IP or formats that have been created elsewhere by ITV, primarily in the UK. 
Global Entertainment and T alpa Global, ITV’s distribution businesses, license ITV’s finished programmes 
and formats and third-party content internationally. Within this business we also finance productions both 
on and off ITV to acquire global distribution rights. 
EBITA before exceptional items
The Directors assess the performance of the reportable segments based on a measure of EBITA before 
exceptional items. The Directors use this measurement basis as it excludes the effect of non-recurring 
income and expenditure. Amortisation and share of profit/(losses) of joint ventures and associates are also 
excluded to reflect more accurately how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis. 
Net financing costs and tax are not allocated to segments as the funding, cash and tax management 
of the Group are activities carried out by the central treasury and tax functions.
A reconciliation from EBITA before exceptional items to profit before tax is provided as follows:

The Group’s principal operations are in the United Kingdom. Revenue from external customers in the 
United Kingdom is £2,275 million (2014: £2,123 million), and total revenue from external customers in other 
countries is £697 million (2014: £467 million). 
There are two media buying agencies (2014: two) acting on behalf of a number of customers that 
represent the Group’s major customers. These agencies are the only customers which individually 
represent over 10% of the Group’s revenue. Revenue of approximately £576 million (2014: £571 million) 
and £339 million (2014: £312 million) was derived from these customers. This revenue is attributable to 
the Broadcast & Online segment.

319 62 381
The Group’s operating leases relate to transponder assets, offices and studio properties. The Group holds 
transmission supply agreements that require the use of specific transponder assets for a period of up to 
ten years with payments increasing over time, limited by specific RPI caps. These supply agreements are 
classified as operating leases, in accordance with the Group’s policy on leases detailed in note 3.2. 
Property leases run for terms ranging from five to twenty years, depending on the expected operational 
use of the site. Leases may include break clauses or options to renew (options to renew are not included 
in the commitments table). Lease payments are generally subject to market review every five years to 
reflect market rentals, but because of the uncertainty over the amount of any future changes, such changes 
have not been reflected in the table above. None of the lease agreements include contingent rentals. 
The total future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases 
at the year end are £1 million (2014: £2 million).
The total operating lease expenditure recognised during the year was £51 million (2014: £49 million) and 
total sublease payments received were £2 million (2014: £1 million).

Financial Statements Keeping it

Exceptional items are excluded from management’s assessment of profit 
because by their size or nature they could distort the Group’s underlying quality 
of earnings. They are typically gains or losses arising from events that are not 
considered part of the core operations of the business (e.g. costs relating to 
capital transactions, such as professional fees on acquisitions). These items are 
excluded to reflect performance in a consistent manner and are in line with how 
the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Accounting policies
Exceptional items as described above are disclosed on the face of the income statement. 
Subsequent revisions of estimates for items initially recognised as exceptional are recorded as exceptional 
items in the year that the revision is made. Gains or losses on disposal of non-core assets are also 
considered exceptional due to their nature and impact on the Group’s underlying quality of earnings.

A – Acquisition-related expenses
Acquisition-related expenses of £88 million includes £78 million (2014: £3 million) relating to performance-
based, employment linked costs to former owners mainly in relation to T alpa Media, and professional fees 
(mainly financial and legal due diligence) incurred on the acquisitions completed during the year of 
£10 million (2014: £3 million). See note 3.4 for further details on acquisitions. 
B – Reorganisation and restructuring costs
In 2015 £13 million (2014: £6 million) of costs were incurred as a result of a Group-wide initiative to 
significantly reduce the ongoing cost base, primarily comprised of restructuring of the US business, 
redundancy and excess space provisions.
C – Gain on sale of non-current assets
In 2015 a £5 million gain on sale of non-current assets arose primarily as a result of the sale of a freehold 
property and related assets in Manchester. The 2014 gain of £4 million arose as a result of the sale of a 
freehold property in Cardiff.
D – Gain on sale and impairment of subsidiaries and investments
The gain of £1 million (2014: £1 million) relates to a historical disposal.
E – Legal related costs
£8 million (2014: £nil) provision for anticipated costs of settling a legal dispute.

Section 2: Results for the Year continued
Keeping it 
simple
This section sets out the Group’s tax accounting policies, the current and deferred 
tax charges or credits in the year (which together make up the total tax charge or 
credit in the income statement), a reconciliation of profit before tax to the tax 
charge for the period and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policies
The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement, the statement of comprehensive 
income and directly in equity, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction. The tax 
charge comprises both current and deferred tax. The calculation of the Group’s tax charge involves a 
degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be fully 
determined until a resolution has been reached by the relevant tax authority. 
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any 
adjustment in respect of previous years. 
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes 
that are likely to become due, which require judgement. Amounts are accrued based on management’s 
interpretation of specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement. Where the final tax outcome of these 
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current 
tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes. 
The following temporary differences are not provided for:
• the initial recognition of goodwill
• the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than 
in a business combination and
• differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will 
be available to utilise the temporary difference. Recognition of deferred tax assets, therefore, involves 
judgement regarding the timing and level of future taxable income. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed net to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the 
same authority and the Group has the right of set-off.

In order to understand how, in the income statement, a tax charge of £139 million (2014: £132 million) 
arises on a profit before tax of £641 million (2014: £605 million), the taxation charge that would arise at the 
standard rate of UK corporation tax is reconciled to the actual tax charge as follows:
2015
£m
2014

Profit before tax 641 605
Notional taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 20.25% (2014: 21.5%) on profit

Adjustments to prior periods – (3)
Impact of overseas tax rates (7) (1)
Impact of changes in tax rates (2) –
Production tax credits 23 –
Total taxation charge in the income statement (139) (132)
Non-deductible expenses are expenses that are not expected to be allowable for tax purposes. Similarly 
non-taxable income is income that will not be taxed.
Adjustments to prior periods primarily arise where an outcome is obtained on certain tax matters 
which differs from expectations held when the related provision was made. Where the outcome is more 
favourable than the provision made, the difference is released, lowering the current year tax charge. 
Where the outcome is less favourable than our provision, an additional charge to current year tax will occur.
The impact of overseas tax rates reflects the fact that some of our profits are earned in territories other 
than the UK, and taxed at rates different to the UK corporation tax rate. 
On 26 October 2015, the UK corporation tax rate was substantively enacted to fall to 19% from 1 April 2017 
and 18% from 1 April 2020. The carrying value of UK temporary differences at the balance sheet date has 
been adjusted accordingly. This has given rise to a charge of £1 million (2014: £nil million) of which £2 million 
is recognised as a charge in the income statement and £1m as a credit in other comprehensive income.
Production tax credits are incentives provided to creative industries such as UK High-End Television (HETV) 
tax relief. The ability to access these tax credits is fundamental when assessing the viability of investment 
decisions in the production of high-end drama. Under IFRS certain production tax credits are reported 
within the total taxation charge in the income statement, however ITV considers them to be working capital 
in nature, and excludes them from its adjusted tax charge, including them instead within Adjusted EBITA.

ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 113
 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements
Section 2: Results for the Year continued
The effective tax rate is the tax charge on the face of the income statement expressed as a percentage of 
the profit before tax. In the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, the effective tax rate 
is comparable to the standard rate of UK corporation tax. As explained in the Financial and Performance 
Review, the Group uses an adjusted tax rate to show how tax impacts total adjusted earnings in a way that 
is more aligned with the Group’s cash tax position.
Taxation – Other comprehensive income and equity
As analysed in the table below, a deferred tax charge of £19 million on actuarial movements on pensions 
has been recognised in other comprehensive income. A deferred tax charge of £2 million has been 
recognised in equity in respect of share based payments. 
A current tax credit of £7 million has also been recognised in equity in relation to share based payments.

*  The prior year movements on deferred tax relating to overseas businesses have been reallocated to the relevant temporary 
difference categories. 
At 31 December 2015, total deferred tax assets are £22 million (2014: £55 million) and total deferred tax 
liabilities are £101 million (2014: £12 million). After netting off balances within countries, there is a net 
deferred tax liability of £79m (2014: net deferred tax asset of £43 million) recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position.
The deferred tax balance relates to:
• property, plant and equipment temporary differences arising on assets qualifying for tax depreciation
• temporary differences on intangible assets arising on business combinations
• programme rights – temporary differences on intercompany profits on stock
• pension scheme deficit temporary differences on the IAS 19 pension deficit and additional contributions 
resulting from funding through the SDN and LTVC pension partnerships (not recognised as contributions 
under IAS 19)
• temporary differences arising from the timing of the use of tax losses
• share-based compensation temporary differences on share schemes and
• other temporary differences on provisions and other items
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 114
Financial Statements The deferred tax balance associated with the pension deficit has been adjusted to reflect the current tax 
benefit obtained in the current year following the employer contributions of £102 million to the Group’s 
defined benefit pension scheme. The adjustment in other comprehensive income to the deferred tax 
balance primarily relates to the actuarial gains recognised in the period. 
A deferred tax asset of £399 million (2014: £444 million) in respect of capital losses of £2,215 million 
(2014: £2,221 million) has not been recognised due to uncertainties as to whether a capital gain will arise 
in the appropriate form and relevant territory against which such losses could be utilised. For the same 
reasons, deferred tax assets in respect of overseas losses of £15 million (2014: £14 million) that time expire 
between 2017 and 2026 have not been recognised.
Keeping it 
simple
Earnings per share (‘EPS’) is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share.
Basic EPS is calculated on the Group profit for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders of £495 million (2014: £466 million) divided by 4,006 million (2014: 
4,002 million) being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS reflects any commitments made by the Group to issue shares in the 
future and so it includes the impact of share options. 
Adjusted EPS is presented in order to show the business performance of the Group 
in a consistent manner and reflect how the business is managed and measured on a 
day-to-day basis. Adjusted EPS reflects the impact of operating and non-operating 
exceptional items on Basic EPS. Other items excluded from Adjusted EPS include 
amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired through business 
combinations; net financing cost adjustments and the tax adjustments relating to 
these items. Each of these adjustments are explained in detail in the section below.
The calculation of Basic EPS and Adjusted EPS, together with the diluted impact on each, is set out below:

and non operating) of £95 million (2014: £5 million).
B. Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets of £58 million (2014: £44 million) is excluded 
from adjusted profit. It is calculated as total amortisation and impairment of £67 million (2014: £67 million), 
less amortisation of software licences and development of £9 million (2014: £11 million). A related tax 
credit of £13 million (2014: £12 million) is also excluded in arriving at the net amount, which is further 
adjusted to recognise the £9 million cash tax benefit arising from goodwill on US acquisitions, which for 
tax purposes is amortised over a 15 year period (2014: £5 million shown within other tax adjustments). 
C. Gross adjustments of £18 million (2014: £44 million) have been made to net financing costs and relate to 
mark-to-market movements on derivative instruments, losses on buybacks and imputed pension interest 
charges (see note 4.4 for details). This is reduced by a tax credit of £3 million (2014: £10 million) to give a net 
adjustment of £15 million (2014: £34 million).

In this section This section shows the assets used to generate the Group’s trading 
performance and the liabilities incurred as a result. On the following pages 
there are notes covering working capital, non-current assets and liabilities, 
acquisitions and disposals, provisions and pensions.
Liabilities relating to the Group’s financing activities are addressed in

Working capital represents the assets and liabilities the Group generates through 
its trading activity. The Group therefore defines working capital as distribution 
rights, programme rights and production costs, trade and other receivables and 
trade and other payables.
Careful management of working capital ensures that the Group can meet its 
trading and financing obligations within its ordinary operating cycle. 
Working capital is a driver of the profit to cash conversion, a key performance 
indicator for the Group. The Group’s target profit to cash ratio on a rolling three 
year basis is at least 90%. For those subsidiaries acquired during the year, working 
capital at the date of acquisition is excluded from the profit to cash calculation so 
that only subsequent working capital movements in the period owned by ITV are 
reflected in this metric.
In the following section you will find further information regarding working 
capital management and analysis of the elements of working capital.
3.1.1 Distribution rights
Accounting policies
Distribution rights are programme rights the Group buys from producers to derive future revenue, 
principally through licensing to broadcasters. These are classified as non-current assets as these rights 
are used to derive long-term economic benefit for the Group.
Distribution rights are recognised initially at cost and charged through operating costs in the income 
statement over a maximum five year period that is dependent on either cumulative sales and programme 
genre, or based on forecast future sales. Advances paid for the acquisition of distribution rights are 
disclosed as distribution rights as soon as they are contracted. These advances are not expensed until 
the programme is available for distribution. Up to that point they are assessed annually for impairment 
through the reassessment of the future sales expected to be earned from that title. 
The net book value of distribution rights at the year end are as follows:
2015
£m
2014
£m
Distribution rights 29 13
The movement during the year comprises additions of £43 million (2014: £21 million) and amounts charged 
to the income statement of £27 million (2014: £18 million).

3.1.2 Programme rights and other inventory 
Accounting policies
Rights are recognised when the Group controls the respective rights and the risks and rewards associated 
with them. 
Programme rights and production costs not yet written off are included in the statement of financial 
position at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Broadcast programme rights
Acquired programme rights (which include films), and sports rights, are purchased for the primary purpose 
of broadcasting on the ITV network. These are recognised within current assets as payments are made 
or when the rights are ready for broadcast. The Group generally expenses these rights through operating 
costs over a number of transmissions reflecting the pattern and value in which the right is consumed.
Commissions, which primarily comprise programmes purchased based on editorial specification and 
over which the Group has some control, are recognised in current assets as payments are made and 
are generally expensed to operating costs in full on first transmission. Where a commission is repeated, 
incremental costs associated with the broadcast are included in operating costs. 
In assessing net realisable value for acquired and commissioned rights, the net realisable value assessment 
is based on estimated airtime value, with consideration given to whether the number of transmissions 
purchased can be efficiently played out over the licence period. 
Studios production costs
Production inventory comprises the costs incurred by ITV Studios in producing a programme, where the 
programme is part way through the production process and not yet available for delivery to a broadcaster. 
They are recognised within current assets at the production cost incurred, and are expensed in operating 
costs on delivery of episodes.
Also included here are dramas that have been commissioned straight to series. Although more expensive 
than producing a pilot, this method attracts high profile talent to the production and raises the profile of 
the series to support its distribution. The production cost is partly funded by the commissioning network 
licence fee, the remaining production deficit is recovered by future distribution sales, and once the 
production is complete any remaining deficit is classified as a Distribution Right.
In assessing net realisable value for programmes in production, judgement is required when considering 
the contracted sales price and estimated costs to complete.

3.1.4 Trade and other receivables
Accounting policies
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently 
at the amounts considered recoverable (amortised cost). Where payments are not due for more than one 
year, they are shown in the financial statements at their net present value to reflect the economic cost of 
delayed payment. The Group provides goods and services to substantially all its customers on credit terms.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, 
be collected. These estimates include such factors as historical experience, the current state of the UK 
and overseas economies and industry specific factors. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value.
Trade and other receivables can be analysed as follows:
2015

(see note 3.4 for details). This represents the portion of the initial consideration that is recoverable from 
the seller in the event he leaves within the initial two years following acquisition and is amortised over 
that period.

Financial Statements Keeping it 
simple
The following section shows the physical assets used by the Group to operate the 
business, generating revenues and profits. These assets include office buildings 
and studios, as well as equipment used in broadcast transmission, programme 
production and support activities.
The cost of these assets is the amount initially paid for them. A depreciation 
expense is charged to the income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and 
the reduced value of the asset over time. Depreciation is calculated by estimating 
the number of years the Group expects the asset to be used (useful economic 
life). If there has been a technological change or decline in business performance 
the Directors review the value of the assets to ensure they have not fallen below 
their depreciated value. If an asset’s value falls below its depreciated value an 
additional one-off impairment charge is made against profit.
This section also explains the accounting policies followed by ITV and the specific 
estimates made in arriving at the net book value of these assets.
Accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that were revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004 
(the date of transition to IFRS) are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount less 
depreciation up to the date of transition.
Leases 
Finance leases are those which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
Certain service contracts involve the use of specific assets (e.g. transmission equipment) and therefore 
contain an embedded lease. 
Determining whether a lease is a finance lease requires judgement as to whether substantially all of the 
risks and benefits of ownership have been transferred to the Group. Estimates used by management in 
making this assessment include the useful economic life of assets, the fair value of the asset and the 
discount rate applied to the total payments required under the lease. Assets held under such leases 
are included within property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful lives. 
Outstanding finance lease obligations, which comprise the principal plus accrued interest, are included 
within borrowings. The finance element of the agreements is charged to the income statement over the 
term of the lease on an effective interest basis. 
All other leases are operating leases, the rentals on which are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term (see note 2.1 for further details of operating lease commitments). 
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less estimated residual 
value, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The annual depreciation charge is sensitive 
to the estimated useful life of each asset and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The major 
categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows:
Asset class Depreciation policy
Freehold land not depreciated
Freehold buildings up to 60 years
Leasehold improvements shorter of residual lease term or estimated useful life
Vehicles, equipment and fittings
 *
3 to 20 years
* Equipment includes studio production and technology assets.

During the year, the Group disposed of the Quay Street site and related assets in Manchester for £23 million, 
representing a gain on sale of £5 million. In 2014, the Group sold a freehold property in Cardiff for proceeds 
of £15 million, representing a gain on sale of £5 million. In 2013 the Group acquired the freehold for the 
London Television Centre for £58 million, although the Directors’ view is that fair value of the property 
would be significantly higher.
Capital commitments
There are £2 million of capital commitments at 31 December 2015 (2014: £2 million).
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 122
Financial Statements Keeping it 
simple
The following section shows the non-physical assets used by the Group to 
generate revenue and profits.
These assets include formats and brands, customer contracts and relationships, 
contractual arrangements, licences, software development, film libraries and 
goodwill. The cost of these assets is the amount that the Group has paid or, where 
there has been a business combination, the fair value of the specific intangible 
assets that could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights. In the case of 
goodwill, its cost is the amount the Group has paid in acquiring a business over 
and above the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired. The value 
of goodwill is ‘intangible’ value that comes from, for example, a uniquely strong 
market position and the outstanding productivity of its employees.
The value of intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, reduces over the 
number of years the Group expects to use the asset, the useful economic life, via 
an annual amortisation charge to the income statement. Where there has been 
a technological change or decline in business performance the Directors review 
the value of assets, including goodwill, to ensure they have not fallen below their 
amortised value. Should an asset’s value fall below its amortised value an 
additional one-off impairment charge is made against profit.
This section explains the accounting policies applied and the specific judgements 
and estimates made by the Directors in arriving at the net book value of 
these assets.
Accounting policies
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits that arise from assets that are not capable of being 
individually identified and separately recognised. The goodwill recognised by the Group has all arisen 
as a result of business combinations. Goodwill is stated at its recoverable amount being cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses and is allocated to the business to which it relates.
Due to changes in accounting standards goodwill has been calculated using three different methods 
depending on the date the relevant business was purchased.
Method 1: All business combinations that have occurred since 1 January 2009 were accounted for using 
the acquisition method. Under this method, goodwill is measured as the fair value of the consideration 
transferred (including the recognition of any part of the business not yet owned (non-controlling interests)), 
less the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured at the acquisition 
date. Any contingent consideration expected to be transferred in the future will be recognised at fair value 
at the acquisition date and recognised within other payables. Contingent consideration classified as an asset 
or liability that is a financial instrument is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the 
income statement. The determination of fair value is based on discounted cash flows. The key assumptions 
take into consideration the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount rate.
Where less than 100% of a subsidiary is acquired, and call and put options are granted over the remaining 
interest, a non-controlling interest is initially recognised in equity at fair value, which is established based 
on the value of the put option. A call option is recognised as a derivative financial instrument, carried at fair 
value. The put option is recognised as a liability within other payables, carried at the present value of the 
put option exercise price, and a corresponding charge is included in merger and other reserves. Any 
subsequent remeasurement of the put option liability is recognised within finance income or cost.
Subsequent adjustments to the fair value of net assets acquired can only be made within 12 months of 
the acquisition date, and only if fair values were determined provisionally at an earlier reporting date. 
These adjustments are accounted for from the date of acquisition.

ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 123
 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements
Section 3: Operating Assets and Liabilities continued
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners and therefore no 
goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. Transaction costs incurred in connection with those 
business combinations, such as legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional fees, are expensed 
as incurred.
Method 2: All business combinations that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008 
were accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2004). 
Goodwill on those combinations represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair 
value of the identifiable net assets acquired and did not include the value of the non-controlling interest. 
Transaction costs incurred in connection with those business combinations, such as legal fees, due 
diligence fees and other professional fees, were included in the cost of acquisition.
Method 3: For business combinations prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at its deemed cost, 
which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP at that time less accumulated amortisation up to 
31 December 2003. The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations occurring prior 
to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has not been reconsidered as permitted under IFRS 1. 
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill are those that are distinct and can be sold separately or which arise 
from legal rights.
Within ITV there are two types of other intangible assets: those assets directly purchased by the Group 
for day-to-day operational purposes (such as software licences and development) and intangible assets 
identified as part of an acquisition of a business. 
Intangible assets acquired directly by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Those 
separately identified intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition or business combination are 
shown at fair value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation.
The main intangible assets the Group has valued are formats, brands, licences, contractual arrangements, 
customer contracts and relationships and libraries.
Each class of intangible asset’s valuation method on initial recognition, amortisation method and 
estimated useful life is set out in the table below:

Financial Statements Determining the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisition requires judgement. The Directors 
make estimates regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows derived from exploiting the assets 
being acquired. The Directors then estimate an appropriate discount rate to apply to the forecast cash 
flows. Such estimates are based on current budgets and forecasts, extrapolated for an appropriate period 
taking into account growth rates, operating costs and the expected useful lives of assets. Judgements 
are also made regarding whether, and for how long, licences will be renewed; this drives our amortisation 
policy for those assets.
The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets or businesses being acquired.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets 
unless such lives are judged to be indefinite. Indefinite life assets, such as goodwill, are not amortised but 
are tested for impairment at each year end.
Impairment
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position is less 
than its recoverable amount.
Determining whether the carrying amount of intangible assets has any indication of impairment requires 
judgement. Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
An impairment test is performed by assessing the recoverable amount of each asset, or for goodwill, 
the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) related to the goodwill. Total assets (which 
includes goodwill) are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(‘cash-generating unit’ or ‘CGU’).
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The value 
in use is based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the asset. 
The Group applies cautious assumptions for impairment testing. Estimates are used in deriving these cash 
flows and the discount rate. Such estimates reflect current market assessments of the risks specific to 
the asset and the time value of money. The estimation process is complex due to the inherent risks and 
uncertainties associated with long-term forecasting. If different estimates of the projected future cash 
flows or a different selection of an appropriate discount rate or long-term growth rate were made, these 
changes could materially alter the projected value of the cash flows of the asset, and as a consequence 
materially different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed. In respect of assets other than goodwill, an 
impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation,  
if no impairment loss had been recognised.

There has been no impairment charge for any CGU during the year (2014: £nil).
When assessing impairment, the recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations. 
These calculations require the use of estimates, specifically: pre-tax cash flow projections; long-term 
growth rates; and a pre-tax market discount rate. 
Cash flow projections are based on the Group’s current five year plan. Beyond the five year plan these 
projections are extrapolated using an estimated long-term growth rate of 2% (2014: 2%). The growth rate 
used is consistent with the long-term average growth rates for both the industry and the country in which 
they are located and is appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The discount rate has been revised for each CGU to reflect the latest market assumptions for the risk-free 
rate, the equity risk premium and the net cost of debt. There is currently no reasonably possible change in 
discount rate that would reduce the headroom in any CGU to zero.
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 126
Financial Statements Broadcast & Online
The goodwill in this CGU arose as a result of the acquisition of broadcasting businesses since 1999, the 
largest of which was the merger of Carlton and Granada in 2004 to form ITV plc, which was treated as 
an acquisition of Carlton for accounting purposes.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flow projections for this CGU are based include: the 
share of the television advertising market; share of commercial impacts; programme and other costs; 
and the pre-tax market discount rate.
The key assumption in assessing the recoverable amount of Broadcast & Online goodwill is the size of 
the television advertising market. In forming its assumptions about the television advertising market, 
the Group has used a combination of long-term trends, industry forecasts and in-house estimates, which 
place greater emphasis on recent experience. No impairment was identified. Also as part of the 
impairment review, a sensitivity of up to -15% was applied to 2016, again with no impairment identified. 
The Directors believe that currently no reasonably possible change in these assumptions would reduce the 
headroom in this CGU to zero.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 9.7% (2014: 10.6%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
SDN
Goodwill was recognised when the Group acquired SDN (the licence operator for DTT Multiplex A) in 2005. 
It represented the wider strategic benefits of the acquisition specific to the Group, principally the enhanced 
ability to promote Freeview as a platform, business relationships with the channels which are on Multiplex 
A and additional capacity available from 2010.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows are based are: income to be earned from 
medium-term contracts; the market price of available multiplex video streams in the period up to 
and beyond digital switchover; and the pre-tax market discount rate. These assumptions have been 
determined by using a combination of current contract terms, recent market transactions and in-house 
estimates of video stream availability and pricing. No impairment was identified. 
As part of the impairment review sensitivity was applied to the main assumptions with no impairment 
identified (2016: -5% growth, 2017: -10% growth). The Directors believe that currently no reasonably 
possible change in the income and availability assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 11.5% (2014: 12.6%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
ITV Studios
The goodwill for ITV Studios has arisen as a result of the acquisition of production businesses since 1999. 
Significant balances were created from the acquisition by Granada of United News and Media’s production 
businesses in 2000 and the merger of Granada and Carlton in 2004 to form ITV plc. ITV Studios goodwill 
also includes all of the goodwill arising from recent acquisitions in 2012 to 2015, with the largest acquisition 
addition to goodwill being Leftfield in 2014, followed by T alpa and Twofour in 2015. 
The key assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include revenue (including international 
revenue and the ITV Studios share of ITV output, growth in commissions and hours produced), margin 
growth and the pre-tax market discount rate. These assumptions have been determined by using a 
combination of extrapolation of historical trends within the business, industry estimates and in-house 
estimates of growth rates in all markets. No impairment was identified. 
As part of the impairment review sensitivity was applied to the main assumptions with no impairment 
identified (2016: -5% growth, 2017: -10% growth). The Directors believe that currently no reasonably 
possible change in the income and availability assumptions would reduce the headroom in this CGU to zero.
A pre-tax market discount rate of 10.1% (2014: 11.7%) has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
Following the acquisitions made by ITV Studios in 2015, the Directors considered how assets and resources 
are shared across the Studios division and the level of integration within the management structure for 
the purposes of reporting and strategic decision-making. They concluded that a single ITV Studios CGU 
continues to remain appropriate.

The following section outlines what the Group has acquired in the year. 
All of the deals are structured so that a large part of the payment made to the 
sellers is determined based on future performance (‘consideration’). This is done 
so that the Group can both align incentives for growth, while reducing risk so that 
total consideration reflects actual performance, not expected. 
IFRS accounting standards require some of this consideration to be included in 
the purchase price used in determining goodwill (‘contingent consideration’). 
Examples of contingent consideration include top-up payments and recoupable 
performance adjustments. Any remaining consideration is required to be recognised 
as a liability or expense outside of acquisition accounting (put option liabilities and 
employment-linked contingent payments known as ‘earnout’ payments).
The Group considers the income statement impact of all consideration to be 
capital in nature and are therefore excluded from adjusted profit. Therefore, for 
each acquisition below, the distinction between the types of consideration has 
been explained in detail.
Acquisitions
During the period, the Group completed four acquisitions, all of which have been included in the results 
of the ITV Studios operating segment. Each of the businesses fit with the strategy of growing the Group’s 
content business and to work with other parts of the ITV Studios segment to exploit that content globally. 
The following section provides a summary of the material acquisitions.
Talpa Media B.V.
On 30 April 2015 the Group acquired 100% controlling interests in T alpa Media B.V. and its subsidiaries. 
T alpa Media is the entertainment show producer behind The Voice, The Voice Kids, I Love My Country, 
Dating In The Dark and Dance Dance Dance. The Group consolidates 100% of the earnings of the business.
Key terms:
Cash consideration of £362 million (€500 million) was paid at acquisition and the maximum total 
consideration for 100% of the business, including the initial payment, is £796 million (€1,100 million, 
undiscounted). 
The deal structure allows for a further £434 million (€600 million) payable after two, five and eight years, 
on the achievement of stretching performance targets for the business in the years following acquisition. 
For these amounts to be payable in the future, the deal requires the seller to remain with the business 
during the earnout period. Further, if the seller leaves within the first two years following acquisition, 
a significant portion of the initial consideration would be refunded to ITV. 
Structuring the deal in this way helped manage risks in terms of initial capital outlay and created a joint 
incentive between ITV and the seller to grow the business, however IFRS requires any payment that links a 
seller to remaining in the business as an employment cost. The Group considers these payments as capital 
in nature, and therefore expenses in relation to these payments are excluded from adjusted profits as an 
exceptional item. 
Acquisition accounting:
Intangibles, being the value placed on formats, brands, customer contracts, non-compete arrangements 
and libraries, of £276 million (€382 million) were identified and goodwill was valued at £41 million 
(€57 million). Goodwill represents the value placed on the opportunity to diversify and grow the content 
and formats produced by the Group. The goodwill arising on acquisition is not expected to be deductible 
for tax purposes. Other fair value adjustments have been made to the opening balance sheet, though 
none of them are individually significant.

Financial Statements Twofour Group
On 24 June 2015 the Group acquired Boom Supervisory Limited, the holding company of Twofour Group. 
Twofour Group owns 51% of Mainstreet Pictures. Twofour Group is an independent production business 
with a range of scripted and unscripted programmes including The Jump, Educating Series (Educating 
Essex, Educating Yorkshire), Hotel Inspector, T aking New York and Ibiza Weekender.
Key terms:
The Group purchased the Twofour Group for a cash consideration of £55 million, subsequently the sellers 
subscribed to 25% of the share capital of the acquiring company. A put and call option has been granted 
over this 25% in Twofour Group; these options both being exercisable over the next three to five years. 
The transaction has been accounted for on an anticipated acquisition basis and a non-controlling interest 
has not been recognised. The maximum total consideration for 100% of the business, including the initial 
payment, is £280 million (undiscounted). These payments are dependent on future performance of the 
business and linked to ongoing employment. The Group considers these payments as capital in nature, 
and therefore expenses in relation to these payments are excluded from adjusted profits as an 
exceptional item.
Provisional acquisition accounting:
Intangibles, being the value placed on formats, brands, customer contracts, non-compete arrangements 
and libraries, of £18 million were identified and goodwill was valued at £50 million. Goodwill represents 
the value placed on the opportunity to diversify and grow the content and formats The Group is currently 
in the process of completing the valuations for the net assets acquired with the businesses. The Group 
expects to finalise the valuations of acquired assets and liabilities in the first half of 2016.
Goodwill represents the value placed on the opportunity to diversify and grow the content and formats 
produced by the Group. The goodwill arising on acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax 
purposes. Other fair value adjustments have been made to the opening balance sheet, though none 
of them are individually significant.
Other 2015 acquisitions
The Group made an initial payment of £15 million for two smaller acquisitions, Cats on the Roof Media Ltd 
and Mammoth Screen Ltd, with a view that these acquisitions will strengthen and complement ITV’s 
existing position as a producer for major television networks in the UK. The maximum additional 
consideration that the Group could pay is £66 million (undiscounted).
Goodwill, which represents the value placed on the opportunity to grow the content produced by the 
Group, has been provisionally valued at £11 million. The goodwill arising on these acquisitions are not 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisitions in 2014
Leftfield Entertainment was acquired for an initial consideration (net of cash acquired) of £214 million 
($360 million) for 80% of the membership interests in May 2014. The remaining 20% equity interest 
was acquired in December 2015. In consideration for the acquisition of the minority interest the Group 
assumed certain obligations of the seller, most notably earnout arrangements for its subsidiaries. 
No additional cash consideration was payable to the seller as a result of the purchase of the remaining 
minority interest. 
The total maximum additional consideration payable by ITV for the acquisition of 100% of the membership 
interest of Leftfield Entertainment, including the additional assumed earnout obligations, is £65 million 
($100 million) and is dependent on future performance and is linked to ongoing employment.
Intangible assets of £65 million ($109 million) were identified in 2014, being the value placed on brands, 
customer contracts, non-compete arrangements and libraries.
The Group also acquired 51% of the membership interest in DiGa Vision, a US-based producer and 100% of 
the controlling interest in United Productions, a company based in Denmark. The total initial consideration 
(net of cash acquired) was £5 million and the maximum additional amount payable is £32 million 
(undiscounted). The final payout is dependent on future performance and is linked to ongoing employment.

The Group holds non-controlling interests in a number of different entities. 
Accounting for these investments, and the Group’s share of any profits and losses, 
depends on the level of control or influence the Group is granted via its interest. 
The three principal types of non-consolidated investments are: joint arrangements 
(joint ventures or joint operations), associates and available for sale investments.
A joint venture is an investment where the Group has joint control, with one or 
more third parties. An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence (i.e. power to participate in the investee’s financial and operating 
decisions). Any other investment is an available for sale investment.
Accounting policies
For joint ventures and associates the Group applies equity accounting. Under this method, it recognises the 
investment in the entity at cost and subsequently adjusts this for its share of profits or losses, which are 
recognised in the income statement within non-operating items and included in adjusted profit. Available 
for sale investments are held at fair value unless the investment is a start-up business, in which case it is 
valued at cost and assessed for impairment. 
The carrying value of all investments are shown as non-current assets on the Statement of Financial 
Position. The £16 million increase in the year comprises £14 million in relation to the acquisition of 
associates and available for sale investments and £2 million of funding to existing joint ventures. 
Please refer to page 170 for the list of principal investments held at 31 December 2015.
Keeping it 
simple
A provision is recognised by the Group where an obligation exists relating to 
events in the past and it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it.
A provision is made where the Group is not certain how much cash will be 
required to settle a liability, so an estimate is required. The main estimates relate 
to the cost of holding properties that are no longer in use by the Group, the 
likelihood of settling legal claims and contracts the Group has entered into that 
are now unprofitable.
Accounting policies
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation arising from past events, it is probable cash will be paid to settle it and the amount 
can be estimated reliably. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows by a 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a financing cost in the income statement. The value 
of the provision is determined based on assumptions and estimates in relation to the amount and timing 
of actual cash flows which are dependent on future events.

Legal and Other provisions totalling £25 million (2014: £15 million) primarily relate to potential liabilities 
that may arise as a result of Boxclever having been placed into administrative receivership, most of which 
relate to pension arrangements. In 2011 the Determinations Panel of the Pensions Regulator determined 
that Financial Support Directions (FSDs) should be issued against certain Group companies, which would 
require the Group to put in place financial support for the Boxclever Scheme. The Group is challenging this 
in the Upper Tribunal. The reference process is ongoing and aside from procedural issues there were no 
substantive case developments in the period. The Directors have obtained leading counsel’s opinion and 
extensive legal advice in connection with the proceedings and continue to believe that the provision held 
is appropriate. The increase in provisions during the year was primarily due to anticipated costs of settling 
other legal matters.

In this note we explain the accounting policies governing the Group’s pension 
scheme, followed by analysis of the components of the net defined benefit 
pension deficit, including assumptions made, and where the related movements 
have been recognised in the financial statements. In addition, we have placed text 
boxes to explain some of the technical terms used in the disclosure. 
What are the Group’s pension schemes? 
There are two types of pension schemes. A ‘Defined Contribution’ scheme that 
is open to ITV employees, and a number of ‘Defined Benefit’ schemes that have 
been closed to new members since 2006. 
What is a Defined Contribution scheme?
The ‘Defined Contribution’ scheme is where the Group makes fixed payments into 
a separate fund on behalf of those employees that have elected to participate 
in saving for their retirement. ITV has no further obligation to the participating 
employee and the risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are 
assumed by the members rather than the Group. It is the members’ responsibility 
to make investment decisions relating to their retirement benefits.
What is a Defined Benefit scheme? 
In a ‘Defined Benefit’ scheme, members receive cash payments during retirement, 
the value of which is dependent on factors such as salary and length of service. 
The Group manages the necessary investment, mortality and inflation risks in 
order to meet these obligations. In the event of poor returns the Group needs 
to address this through a combination of increased levels of contribution or by 
making adjustments to the scheme. Schemes can be funded, where regular 
cash contributions are made by the employer into a fund which is invested, or 
unfunded, where no regular money or assets are required to be put aside to cover 
future payments.
The Group makes contributions to the scheme, a separate trustee-administered 
fund that is not consolidated in these financial statements, but is reflected on the 
defined benefit pension deficit line on the consolidated statement of financial 
position. It is the responsibility of the Trustee to manage and invest the assets 
of the Scheme and its funding position. The Trustee, appointed according to the 
terms of the Scheme’s documentation, is required to act in the best interest of 
the members and is responsible for managing and investing the assets of the 
scheme and its funding position.
Accounting policies
Defined contribution scheme
Obligations under the Group’s defined contribution schemes are recognised as an operating cost in the 
income statement as incurred. For 2015, total contributions expensed were £16 million (2014: £14 million).
Defined benefit scheme
The Group’s obligation in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) is calculated by estimating 
the amount of future retirement benefit that eligible employees (‘members’) have earned in return for 
their services. That benefit payable in the future is discounted to today’s value and then the fair value of 
scheme assets contributed by the Group is deducted to measure the net pension deficit. 
The liabilities of the Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be 
paid using the ‘projected unit’ method. This method is an accrued benefits valuation method that makes 
allowance for projected earnings of members in the future up to retirement.

These calculations are complex and are performed by a qualified actuary. There are many judgements and 
estimates necessary to calculate the Group’s estimated liabilities, the main assumptions are set out later in 
this section. Movements in assumptions during the year are called ‘actuarial gains and losses’ and these are 
recognised in the period in which they arise through the statement of comprehensive income. 
The latest triennial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken as at 1 January 2014 by an independent 
actuary appointed by the Trustee of the Scheme and agreed in early 2016. The next triennial valuation will 
be as at 1 January 2017 and is expected to be agreed in 2018. This will drive subsequent contribution rates.
An unfunded scheme in relation to previous Directors is accounted for under IAS 19 and the Group is 
responsible for meeting the pension obligations as they fall due. It is securitised by assets held outside of 
the ITV Pension Scheme in the form of gilts and included within cash and cash equivalents (see note 4.1).
The defined benefit pension deficit
The net pension deficit at 31 December 2015 was £176 million (2014: £346 million).
The net assets and liabilities of the Scheme are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial 
position and shown within non-current liabilities. The totals recognised in the current and previous

Defined benefit scheme obligations
Keeping it 
simple
What cause movements in the defined benefit pension obligations?
The areas that impact the defined benefit obligation (the pension scheme 
liabilities) position at the year end are as follows:
• Current service cost – the cost to the Group of the future benefits earned 
by members that relates to the members’ service in the current year. This is 
charged to operating costs in the income statement.
• Interest cost – the pension obligations payable in the future are discounted 
to the present value at year end. A discount factor is used to determine the 
current value today of the future cost. The interest cost is the unwinding of 
one year’s movement in the present value of the obligation. It is broadly 
determined by multiplying the discount rate at the beginning of the period by 
the updated present value of the obligation during the period. The discount 
rate is a key assumption explained later in this section. This interest cost is 
recognised through net financing costs in the income statement (see note 4.4).
• Actuarial gains or losses – there are broadly two causes of actuarial 
movements. ‘Experience’ adjustments, which arise when comparing 
assumptions made when estimating the liabilities and what has actually 
occurred, and adjustments resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions 
e.g. movements in corporate bond yields. Key assumptions are explained in 
detail later in this section. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised through 
other comprehensive income.
• Benefits paid – any cash benefits paid out by the Scheme will reduce 
the obligation.

schemes (2014: £48 million). See note 4.1 for details.
Assumptions used to estimate the Scheme obligations
Keeping it 
simple
What are the main assumptions used to estimate the Scheme obligations?
The main assumptions are: 
• future salary levels 
• future pensionable salary levels 
• an estimate of increases in pension payments 
• the life expectancy of members
• the effect of inflation on all these factors 
• the discount rate used to estimate the present day fair value of these obligations 
How do we determine the appropriate assumptions? 
The Group takes independent actuarial advice relating to the appropriateness 
of the assumptions used.
IFRS requires that we estimate a discount rate by reference to high quality 
fixed income investments in the UK that match the estimated term of the 
pension obligations. 
The inflation assumption has been set by looking at the difference between the 
yields on fixed and index-linked Government bonds. The inflation assumption is 
used as a basis for the remaining financial assumptions, except where caps have 
been implemented.
The discount rate has therefore been obtained using the yields available on AA 
rated corporate bonds which match projected cash flows. The Group’s estimate 
of the weighted average term of the liabilities is 15 years (2014: 15 years). 
The principal assumptions used in the Scheme’s valuations at the year end were:
2015 2014
Discount rate for:
Past service liabilities 3.80% 3.50%
Future service liabilities 4.00% 3.70%
Inflation assumption for:
Past service liabilities 3.00% 3.00%

Which assumptions have the biggest impact on estimating the Scheme 
liabilities?
It is important to note that comparatively small changes in the assumptions 
used may have a significant effect on the consolidated income statement and 
statement of financial position. This ‘sensitivity’ to change is analysed below to 
demonstrate how small changes in assumptions can have a large impact on the 
estimation of the Scheme’s liabilities.
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the defined benefit obligation are 
set out below:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on defined benefit obligation
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.1% Decrease/increase by £50 million / £55 million
Rate of inflation  
(Retail Price Index)
Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by £15 million / £15 million
Rate of inflation  
(Consumer Price Index)
Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by £10 million / £10 million
Life expectations Increase by one year Increase by £90 million
The analysis above considers the impact of the single change in the assumption while keeping the other 
assumptions unchanged, except for inflation. The inflation sensitivities allow for consequential changes 
to all pension increases linked to the relevant index. The sensitivity analyses have been determined 
by extrapolating the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the year end with changes in key 
assumptions that might reasonably occur.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption 
(although this is not always the case). Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes 
in the market value of Scheme assets, which may or may not offset the changes in assumptions.
The sensitivity analysis for the impact of life expectations on the defined benefit liability does not include 
the potential offsetting benefit of the longevity swap classified as a Scheme asset. It is estimated that a 
£75 million benefit would arise on the value of the longevity swap from a one year increase in the market-
based assumption of mortality. (Please refer to the ‘Keeping it simple’ box in the following section for 
further information on the longevity swap).
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 136
Financial Statements Total defined benefit scheme assets
Keeping it 
simple
The Scheme holds assets across a number of different classes which are 
managed by the Trustee, who consults with the Group on changes to its 
investment policy. 
What are the pension Scheme assets?
At 31 December 2015 the Scheme’s assets were invested in a diversified portfolio 
that consisted primarily of equity and debt securities. The tables below set out 
the major categories of assets.
Financial instruments are in place in order to provide protection against changes 
in market factors (interest rates and inflation) which could act to increase the net 
pension deficit. These financial instruments are classified as Scheme assets.
One such instrument is the longevity swap which the Scheme transacted in 2011 
to obtain protection against the effect of increases in the life expectation of the 
majority of pensioner members at that date. Under the swap, the Trustee agreed 
to make pre-determined payments in return for payments to meet the specified 
pension obligations as they fall due, irrespective of how long the members and 
their dependants live. The difference in the present values of these two streams 
of payments is reflected in the Scheme assets. The swap had a nil valuation at 
inception and, using market-based assumptions, is subsequently adjusted for 
changes in the market life expectancy and market discount rates.
How do we measure the pension Scheme assets?
Defined benefit scheme assets are measured at their fair value and can change 
due to the following:
• Interest income on scheme assets – this is determined by multiplying the fair 
value of the Scheme assets by the discount rate, both taken as of the beginning 
of the year. This is recognised through net financing costs in the income 
statement.
• Return on assets arise from differences between the actual return and interest 
income on Scheme assets and are recognised through other comprehensive 
income.
• Employer’s contributions are paid into the Scheme to be managed and invested.
• Benefits and administrative expenses paid out by the Schemes will lower the 
fair value of the Scheme’s assets
The movement in the fair value of the defined benefit scheme’s assets is analysed below:

Employer contributions 102 103
Benefits paid (158) (145)
Administrative expenses paid (5) (5)
Fair value of Scheme assets at 31 December 3,270 3,341
The actual return on the Scheme’s assets, being the sum of the interest income on Scheme assets and 
return on Scheme assets, for the year ended 31 December 2015 was a decrease of £10 million 
(2014: increase of £518 million).

How are the Scheme’s assets invested? 
At 31 December 2015 the Scheme’s assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily 
of equity and debt securities. The fair value of the Scheme’s assets are shown in the following table by

Included in the above are overseas assets of £1,198 million (2014: £1,218 million), comprised of equities 
of £564 million (2014: £569 million) and bonds of £634 million (2014: £649 million).
When selecting the mix of assets to hold, and considering their related risks and returns, the Trustee will 
weigh up the variability of returns against the target long-term rate of return on the overall portfolio.

What was the impact of movements on the Scheme’s assets and liabilities?
The sections above describe how the Scheme obligations and assets are

– updated valuation data – 36
217 (366)
Total recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 91 24
The £217 million actuarial gain on the Scheme’s liabilities was principally due to an increase in bond yields 
over the year, which has resulted in a decrease in the liabilities. The £126 million loss on the Scheme’s 
assets primarily results from decreases in the market values of gilts and swaps, which has led to assets 
underperforming expectations.
Addressing the net pension deficit
Keeping it 
simple
The Group works closely with the Trustee to agree appropriate levels of funding 
for the Scheme. This involves agreeing a Schedule of Contributions at each 
triennial valuation, which specifies the contribution rates for the employer and 
scheme members and the date these contributions are due. A recovery plan 
setting out the steps that will be taken to address a funding shortfall is also agreed.
In the event that the Group’s defined benefit scheme is in a net liability position, 
the Directors must take steps to manage the size of the deficit. Apart from the 
funding agreements mentioned above, this could involve pledging additional 
assets to the Scheme, as was the case in the SDN and London Television Centre 
(‘LTVC’) pension funding partnerships (explained below).
The levels of ongoing contributions to the Scheme are based on the current service costs (as assessed by 
the Scheme Trustee) and the expected future cash flows of the Scheme. Normal employer contributions 
in 2016 for current service are expected to be in the region of £12 million (2015: £11 million) and deficit 
funding contributions in 2016 are expected to be £66 million (2015: £76 million), assuming current 
contribution rates continue as agreed with the Trustee. 
Under the SDN pension partnership, set up in 2010, the Group has agreed to make payments of £11 million 
for 12 years from 2011. The LTVC partnership, established in March 2014, commits the Group to an annual 
payment of £2 million in 2016, increasing by 5% per annum until 2038.
IFRIC 14 clarifies how the asset ceiling should be applied, in particular, how local minimum funding rules 
work. The Group has determined that it has an unconditional right to a refund of surplus assets if the 
Schemes are run off until the last member dies, on which basis IFRIC 14 does not cause any change in the 
balance sheet disclosures before tax.
Financial Statements
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 139
 Financial Statements In this section This section outlines how the Group manages its capital structure and 
related financing costs, including its balance sheet liquidity and access to 
capital markets.
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of ITV, specifically, 
how much is raised from shareholders (equity) and how much is borrowed 
from financial institutions (debt) in order to finance the Group’s activities 
both now and in the future. Maintaining capital discipline and balance sheet 
efficiency remains important to the Group, as seen through the issuance of 
a new Eurobond during the year. Any potential courses of action will take 
into account the Group’s liquidity needs, flexibility to invest in the business, 
pension deficit initiatives and impact on credit ratings.
The Directors consider the Group’s capital structure and dividend policy at 
least twice a year ahead of announcing results and do so in the context of its 
ability to continue as a going concern, to execute the strategy and to invest 
in opportunities to grow the business and enhance shareholder value.
A Tax and Treasury committee acting under delegated authority from the 
Board, approves certain financial transactions and monitors compliance with 
the Group’s tax and treasury policies.
Keeping it

Net cash / (debt) is the Group’s key measure used to evaluate total cash resources 
net of the current outstanding debt.
Adjusted net debt is also monitored by the Group and more closely reflects how 
credit agencies see the Group’s gearing. To arrive at the adjusted net debt amount, 
we add our total undiscounted expected contingent payments on acquisitions, 
our IAS 19 pension deficit and our undiscounted operating lease commitments. 
A full analysis and discussion of adjusted net debt is included in the Financial and

Included within cash equivalents is £10 million (2014: £16 million), the use of which is restricted to 
meeting finance lease commitments under programme sale and leasebacks (see note 4.2), and gilts of 
£38 million (2014: £39 million) in respect of which a charging deed was executed on the unfunded pension 
commitments of four former Granada executives. Legal action has commenced to try and remove 
the charge.
Loans and facilities due within one year
In October 2015 the unsecured £78 million Eurobond matured, resulting in a net payment by the Group 
of £76 million, after settlement of the Group’s related outstanding interest rate swaps. 
At various periods during the year the Group drew down on the Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’) to meet 
short-term funding requirements. All short-term drawings were repaid by the end of the year. The 
maximum draw down of the RCF during the year was €500 million (£362 million) in April to fund the 
acquisition of T alpa Media. The maximum draw down on the RCF during 2014 was £321 million to fund 
the 2014 acquisitions.
Loans and loan notes due after one year 
In September 2015 the Group issued a seven year €600 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 2.125% which 
will mature in September 2022. The bond refinanced the 12 month bridge loan facility of €500 million that 
was used to repay the RCF, which initially funded the purchase of T alpa Media in April.
The Group also has an unsecured £161 million Eurobond which matures in January 2017 and has a coupon 
of 6.125%.

The Group borrows money from financial institutions in the form of bonds, bank 
facilities and other financial instruments. The interest payable on these 
instruments is shown in the net financing costs note in note 4.4.
There are Board-approved policies in place to manage the Group’s financial risks. 
Macroeconomic market risks, which impact currency transactions and interest 
rates, are discussed in note 4.3. Credit and liquidity risks are discussed below.
• Credit risk: the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty 
fails to meet its contractual obligations and 
• Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial 
obligations as they fall due
The Group is required to disclose the fair value of its debt instruments. The fair 
value is the amount the Group would pay a third party to transfer the liability. It is 
calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, 
discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. This calculation 
of fair value is consistent with instruments valued under level 2 in note 4.5.
Accounting policies
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent 
measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Under the amortised cost 
method the difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recorded in 
the income statement over the period of the borrowing on an effective interest basis.
Finance leases
Historically, ITV has entered into sale and leaseback agreements in relation to certain programme titles. 
Related outstanding sale and leaseback obligations, which comprise the principal and accrued interest, 
are included within borrowings. The finance related element of the agreement is charged to the income 
statement over the term of the lease on an effective interest basis. Sale and leaseback obligations are 
secured against an equivalent cash balance held within cash and cash equivalents.
Managing credit and liquidity risk
Credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of derivative financial 
assets (see note 4.3), trade receivables (see note 3.1.4), and cash and cash equivalents (note 4.1).
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. 
The majority of trade receivables relate to airtime sales contracts with advertising agencies and advertisers. 
Credit insurance has been taken out against these companies to minimise the impact on the Group in the 
event of a possible default.
Cash 
The Group operates investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash that emphasise preservation of 
capital. The guidelines set out procedures and limits on counterparty risk and maturity profile of cash 
placed. Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long-term ratings published by the 
major credit rating agencies and perceived state support. Deposits longer than 12 months require the 
approval of the Board.

ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 142
Financial Statements Borrowings
ITV is rated as investment grade by Moody’s and S&P. ITV’s credit ratings, the cost of credit default swap 
hedging and the absolute level of interest rates are key determinants in the cost of new borrowings for ITV. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s financing policy is to fund itself for the medium to long-term by using debt instruments with 
a range of maturities and to ensure access to appropriate short-term bank facilities with a minimum of 
£250 million of undrawn facilities available at all times. 
Long-term funding comes from the UK and European Capital markets, while any short to medium-term 
debt requirements are provided through bank credit facilities totalling £775 million (see below). 
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve (comprising undrawn bank facilities 
and cash and cash equivalents) on the basis of expected cash flows. This monitoring includes financial 
ratios to assess possible future credit ratings and headroom and takes into account the accessibility of cash 
and cash equivalents. 
The Group has available funds through a Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’) with a group of relationship banks. 
This £525 million facility is committed with leverage and interest cover financial covenants and matures 
in 2019. In addition, the Group has £250 million of financial covenant free financing which runs for three 
to seven years. All of these facilities were undrawn at 31 December 2015 (2014: no drawings).

What is a derivative?
A derivative is a type of financial instrument typically used to manage risk. 
A derivative’s value changes over time in response to underlying variables such 
as exchange rates or interest rates and is entered into for a fixed period. A hedge 
is where a derivative is used to manage exposure in an underlying variable.
The Group is exposed to certain market risks. In accordance with Board approved 
policies, which are set out in this note, the Group manages these risks by using 
derivative financial instruments to hedge the underlying exposures.
Why do we need them?
The key market risks facing the Group are:
• Currency risk arising from: 
 i.  translation risk, that is, the risk in the period of adverse currency fluctuations 
in the translation of foreign currency profits, assets and liabilities (‘balance 
sheet risk’) and non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities 
(‘income statement risk’) and 
 ii.  transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative 
effect on the value of the Group’s non-functional currency trading cash flows. 
A non-functional currency transaction is a transaction in any currency other 
than the reporting currency of the subsidiary. 
• Interest rate risk to the Group arises from significant changes in interest rates 
on borrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates.
How do we use them?
The Group mainly employs three types of derivative financial instruments when 
managing its currency and interest rate risk:
• Foreign exchange swap contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge 
income statement translation risk arising from short term intercompany loans 
denominated in a foreign currency
• Forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge 
transaction risk so they enable the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a 
known fixed rate on an agreed future date and
• Interest rate swaps are derivative instruments that exchange a fixed rate of 
interest for a floating rate, or vice versa, or one type of floating rate for another, 
and are used to manage interest rate risk
Analysis of the derivatives used by the Group to hedge its exposure and the various 
methods used to calculate their respective fair values are detailed in this section.
Accounting policies
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured 
at fair value with the movement recorded in the income statement, except where derivatives qualify for 
cash flow hedge accounting. In this case, the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognised in other 
comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve within equity. The cumulative gain or loss 
is later reclassified to the income statement in the same period as the relevant hedged transaction is 
realised. Derivatives with positive fair values are recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.

Notes to the Financial Statements
Section 4: Capital Structure and Financing Costs continued
ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 144
Financial Statements Determining Fair Value
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by using the difference between the 
contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the reporting date. The fair value of 
interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap 
at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and our current creditworthiness, as well 
as that of our swap counterparties.
Third-party valuations are used to fair value the Group’s interest rate derivatives. The valuation techniques 
use inputs such as interest rate yield curves and currency prices/yields, volatilities of underlying 
instruments and correlations between inputs.
How do we manage our currency and interest rate risk?
Currency risk
As the Group expands its international operations, the performance of the business becomes increasingly 
sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro. 
The Group’s foreign exchange policy is to use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge material 
non-functional currency denominated costs or revenue at the time of commitment for up to five years 
forward. The Group also hedges a proportion of highly probable non-functional currency denominated 
costs or revenue on a rolling 18 month basis (see ‘Keeping it simple box’ for explanation of non-functional 
currency transactions).
The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency denominated cash balances is kept to a 
minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into sterling or by buying or 
selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary.
The Group also utilises foreign exchange swaps both to manage foreign currency cash flow timing 
differences and to hedge foreign currency denominated monetary items. 
The Group’s net investments in overseas subsidiaries may be hedged where the currency exposure is 
considered to be material. In 2015 the Group designated a portion of its euro borrowings into a net 
investment hedge against its euro denominated assets following the acquisition of T alpa Media.
The following table highlights the Group’s sensitivity to translation risk resulting from a 10% 
strengthening/weakening in sterling against the US dollar and euro, assuming all other variables are 
held constant:
2015 – post-
tax profit 2015 – equity
2014 – post-
tax profit 2014 – equity
US dollar £10 million £63 million £8 million £34 million
Euro £8 million £41 million £8 million £29 million
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate policy is to allow fixed rate gross debt to vary between 20% and 100% of total 
gross debt to accommodate floating rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility. 
At 31 December 2015 the Group’s fixed rate debt represented 99% of total gross debt (2014: 100%). 
Consequently a 1% movement in interest rates on negligible floating variable rate debt would not impact 
the post-tax profit for the year. 
For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss, the movements in the year 
relating to changes in fair value and interest are not separated.

Interest rate swaps
On issuing the 2017 Eurobond, the Group entered into a portfolio of fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
and then subsequently overlaid a portfolio of floating to fixed interest rate swaps with the result that 
interest was 100% fixed on these borrowings. The timing of entering into these swaps locked in an interest 
benefit for the Group, resulting in a net mark-to-market gain on the portfolio.
Cash flow hedges
The Group applies hedge accounting for certain foreign currency firm commitments and highly probably 
cash flows where the underlying cash flows are payable within the next two years. In order to fix the 
sterling cash outflows associated with the commitments – which are mainly denominated in AUD or euros 
– the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts for the same foreign currency amount and 
maturity date as the expected foreign currency outflow. The amount recognised in other comprehensive 
income during the period all relates to the effective portion of the revaluation loss associated with these 
contracts. There was less than £1 million (2014: £nil) ineffectiveness taken to the income statement and 
£6 million cumulative loss (2014: £nil) recycled to the income statement in the year.
Net investment hedges
The Group uses euro denominated debt to partially hedge against the change in the sterling value of its 
euro denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of debt in a net 
investment hedge was £141 million (2014: £nil). A foreign exchange loss of £2 million (2014: £nil) relating 
to the net investment hedges has been netted off within exchange differences on translation of foreign 
operations as presented on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

This section details the interest income generated on the Group’s cash and other 
financial assets and the interest expense incurred on borrowings and other 
financial liabilities. 
In reporting ‘adjusted profit’, the Group adjusts net financing costs to exclude 
unrealised mark-to-market movements on interest rate and foreign exchange 
derivatives, gains/losses on bond buybacks, net pension interest, interest and fair 
value movements in acquisition-related liabilities and other financing costs.
Our rationale for adjustments made to financing costs is set out in the Financial 
and Performance Review.
Accounting policies
Net financing costs comprise interest income on funds invested, gains/losses on the disposal of financial 
instruments, changes in the fair value of financial instruments, interest expense on borrowings and finance 
leases, unwinding of the discount on provisions, unwinding of the discount on liabilities to non-controlling 
interest, foreign exchange gains/losses, and imputed interest on pension assets and liabilities. Interest 
income and expense is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.

Interest on financial liabilities relates to the interest incurred on the Group’s borrowings in the year.
The losses on early settlement in the prior year of £30 million were incurred as a result of the repurchase 
of the remaining £62 million 2019 bilateral loan.
Other finance income in the prior year primarily relates to acquisition-related contingent liabilities. This is 
where estimates of the future performance against stretch targets is reassessed, resulting in adjustments 
to the related put option liabilities. Other finance expense includes the amortisation of facility 
commitment and upfront fees.

Financial Statements Keeping it 
simple
The financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position are 
measured at either fair value or amortised cost. The measurement of this fair 
value can in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs used in the 
calculations. ITV generally uses external valuations using market inputs or market 
values (e.g. external share prices). The different valuation methods are called 
‘hierarchies’ and are described below.
Level 1
Fair values are measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Fair values are measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within 
Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
Interest rate swaps and options are accounted for at their fair value based upon 
termination prices. Forward foreign exchange contracts are accounted for at the 
difference between the contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange 
rate at the reporting date.
Level 3
Fair values are measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data.
The tables below set out the financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position 
at ‘fair value’.

Contingent consideration is the Group’s only financial instrument classified as Level 3 in the fair value 
hierarchy. As noted in the accounting policy section of note 3.3, the key assumptions taken into 
consideration when measuring this acquisition-related liability are the performance expectations of the 
acquisition and a discount rate that reflects the size and nature of the new business. There is no reasonable 
change in discount rate or performance targets that would give rise to a material change in the liability at 
year end.

4.6.6 Non-controlling interests
The movement for the year comprises:
• the fair value of the non-controlling interest acquired in the year of £19 million relates to the acquisition 
of the remaining 20% in Leftfield Entertainment (2014: £20 million);
• the share of profits attributable to non-controlling interests of £7 million (2014: £7million); and
• the distributions made to non-controlling interests of £5 million (2014: £8 million).
Keeping it 
simple
The Group utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration 
packages, and therefore operates a number of share-based compensation 
schemes, namely the Deferred Share Award (DSA), Performance Share Plan (PSP), 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes.
A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Group 
receives services from employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity 
instruments. If the Group incurs a liability based on the price or value of the Group’s 
shares then this will also fall under a share-based transaction. 
A description of each type of share-based payment arrangement that existed at 
any time during the period are set out in the Annual Remuneration Report.
Accounting policies
For each of the Group’s share-based compensation schemes, the fair value of the equity instrument 
granted is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period via a charge to the income 
statement with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value of the share options and awards is measured using either market price at grant date or, for 
the Save As You Earn scheme (SAYE), a Black–Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
of the individual scheme. 
Vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions. For performance-based 
schemes, the relevant Group performance measures are projected to the end of the performance period 
in order to determine the number of options expected to vest. The estimate is then used to determine the 
option fair value, discounted to present value. The Group revises its estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to vest, including an estimate of forfeitures at each reporting date. The impact of the 
revision to original estimates, if any, are recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be satisfied by market purchase or issue of new 
shares. No new shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the DSA. During the year 
all exercises were satisfied by using shares purchased in the market and held in the ITV Employees’ 
Benefit Trust.
Share-based compensation charges totalled £14 million in 2015 (2014: £14 million).

Employees’ Benefit Trust
The Group has investments in its own shares as a result of shares purchased by the ITV Employees’ Benefit 
Trust (‘EBT’). Transactions with the Group-sponsored EBT are included in these financial statements and 
primarily consist of the EBT’s purchases of shares in ITV plc, which are accounted for as a reduction to 
retained earnings.
The table below shows the number of ITV plc shares held in the EBT at 31 December 2015 and the 
purchases/(releases) from the EBT made in the year to satisfy awards under the Group’s share schemes:

The total number of shares held by the EBT at 31 December 2015 represents 0.42% (2014: 0.56%) of 
ITV’s issued share capital. The market value of own shares held at 31 December 2015 is £47 million (2014: 
£48 million).
The shares will be held in the EBT until such time as they may be transferred to participants of the various 
Group share schemes. Rights to dividends have been waived by the EBT in respect of shares held which do 
not relate to restricted shares under the DSA. In accordance with the Trust Deed, the Trustees of the EBT 
have the power to exercise all voting rights in relation to any investment (including shares) held within 
that trust.

A contingent liability is a liability that is not sufficiently certain to qualify for 
recognition as a provision where uncertainty may exist regarding the outcome 
of future events.
There are contingent liabilities in respect of certain litigation and guarantees, broadcasting issues, and in 
respect of warranties given in connection with certain disposals of businesses. None of these items are 
expected to have a material effect on the Group’s results or financial position.
Keeping it 
simple
Where the Group receives information in the period between 31 December 2015 
and the date of this report about conditions related to certain events that existed 
at 31 December 2015, we update our disclosures that relate to those conditions 
in light of the new information. Such events can be categorised as adjusting or 
non-adjusting depending on whether the condition existed at 31 December 2015. 
If non-adjusting events are material, non-disclosure could influence the economic 
decisions that users make on the basis of the financial statements. Accordingly, 
for each material category of non-adjusting event after the reporting period we 
disclose in this section the nature of the event and an estimate of its financial 
effect, or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. 
On 19 October 2015 the Group announced that it had agreed to acquired 100% of the share capital 
of UTV Limited for a total cash consideration of £100 million, subject to regulatory and UTV Media plc 
shareholder approval. Final approvals were obtained by 18 February 2016 and the acquisition completed

The Company is taking advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS101.
• Presentation of a Statement of Cash Flows
• Disclosure of key management personnel compensation
• Disclosure of related party transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries and parents within a group
• Disclosures required under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of group settled share based 
payments
• Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: Disclosure 
• Certain disclosures required under IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
• Disclosure of information in relation to new standards not yet applied
As permitted by section 408 (3) of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement dealing with 
the results of the parent company has not been presented.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Company. Control exists where 
the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. The investment in the Company’s subsidiaries is recorded at cost. Annual 
share-based payment compensation costs are recharged to the subsidiaries through the profit and 
loss account.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated 
into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognised in the profit and loss account. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical 
cost are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value including directly attributable transaction costs, with 
subsequent measurement at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The difference 
between initial fair value and the redemption value is recorded in the profit and loss account over the 
period of the liability on an effective interest basis.
Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Company uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to 
fluctuations in interest and other foreign exchange rates. The Company does not hold or issue derivative 
instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at 
fair value with the movement recorded in the profit and loss account within net financing costs, except 
where derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. In this case, the effective portion of cash flow 
hedge is recognised in retained profits within equity. The cumulative gain or loss is later reclassified to the 
profit and loss account in the same period as the relevant hedged transaction is realised. Derivatives with 
positive fair values are recorded as assets and negative fair values as liabilities.
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined by using the difference between the 
contract exchange rate and the quoted forward exchange rate at the balance sheet date.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to 
terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current 
creditworthiness of swap counterparties.
Third-party valuations are used to fair value the Company’s derivatives. The valuation techniques use 
inputs such as interest rate yield curves and currency prices/yields, volatilities of underlying instruments 
and correlations between inputs. For financial assets and liabilities classified at fair value through profit 
or loss the fair value change and interest income/expense are not separated. 
Deferred tax
The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement or directly in equity according to the 
accounting treatment of the related transaction.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax 
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to utilise the temporary difference. Recognition of deferred tax assets, 
therefore involves judgement regarding timing and level of future taxable income. 
Share-based compensation
The Company utilises share award schemes as part of its employee remuneration packages, and therefore 
operates a number of share-based compensation schemes, namely the Deferred Share Award (DSA), 
Performance Share Plan (PSP), Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes.
A transaction will be classed as share-based compensation where the Company receives services from 
employees and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments. If the Company incurs a liability 
based on the price or value of the shares then this will also fall under a share-based transaction.
The fair value of the equity instrument granted is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting 
period via a charge to the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of 
the share options and awards is measured using either market price at grant date or, for the Save As 
You Earn scheme (SAYE), a Black–Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions of the 
individual scheme. 
Vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions. For performance-based 
schemes, the relevant performance measures are projected to the end of the performance period in order 
to determine the number of options expected to vest. The estimate is then used to determine the option 
fair value, discounted to present value. The Company revises its estimates of the number of options that 
are expected to vest, including an estimate of forfeitures at each reporting date. The impact of the revision 
to original estimates, if any, are recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment 
to equity.
Exercises of share options granted to employees can be satisfied by market purchase or issue of new 
shares. No new shares may be issued to satisfy exercises under the terms of the DSA. During the year 
all exercises were satisfied by using shares purchased in the market and held in the ITV Employees’ 
Benefit Trust.
The weighted average share price of share options exercised during the year was 16.65p (2014: 9.02p). 
The options outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range of nil to 206.83p and a 
weighted average contractual life of 1 year (2014: 1 year).
Dividends
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders 
or their payment. 
Employees
Two (2014: two) Directors of ITV plc were employees of the Company during the year, both of whom 
remain at the year end. The costs relating to these Directors are disclosed in the Remuneration Report.

Financial Statements Investments in subsidiary undertakings
The principal subsidiary undertakings are listed on page 166. The balance at 31 December 2015 was 
£1,861 million (2014: £1,705 million).
During the year, the Company set up a subsidiary investment, ITV (Europe) Holdings BV for £146 million 
in exchange for 10 £1 ordinary shares. The Company also increased its investment in ITV Investments 
Limited by £5 million in exchange for 1 £1 ordinary share. The Company increased its investment in Carlton 
Communications Limited by £5 million in exchange for 1 £1 ordinary share. 
Amounts owed (to)/from subsidiary undertakings
The Company operates an intra-group cash pool policy with certain 100% owned UK subsidiaries. The pool 
applies to bank accounts where there is an unconditional right of set off and involves the daily closing cash 
position for participating subsidiaries whether positive or negative, being cleared to £nil via daily bank 
transfers to/from ITV plc. These daily transactions create a corresponding intercompany creditor or debtor 
which can result in significant movements in amounts owed to and from subsidiary undertakings in the 
Company balance sheet.
Borrowings
Loans repayable in less than one year
In October 2015 the unsecured £78 million Eurobond matured, resulting in a net payment by the company 
of £76 million, after settlement of the related outstanding interest rate swaps. 
Loans repayable after more than one year
The unsecured £161 million Eurobond matures in January 2017 and has a coupon of 6.125%. 
At various periods during the year the Company drew down on the Revolving Credit Facility (‘RCF’) to 
meet short-term funding requirements. All short-term drawings were repaid by the end of the year. 
The maximum draw down of the RCF during the year was €500 million (£362 million) in April to fund the 
acquisition of T alpa Media. The maximum draw down on the RCF during 2014 was £321 million to fund 
the 2014 acquisitions.
Loans repayable after more than one year
In September 2015 the Company issued a seven year €600 million Eurobond at a fixed coupon of 
2.125% which will mature in September 2022. The bond refinanced the 12 month bridge loan facility of 
€500 million that was used to repay the RCF, which initially funded the purchase of T alpa Media in April.

The Company mainly employs three types of derivative financial instruments when managing its currency 
and interest rate risk:
• Foreign exchange swap contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge income statement 
translation risk arising from short term intercompany loans denominated in a foreign currency.
• Forward foreign exchange contracts are derivative instruments used to hedge transaction risk so 
they enable the sale or purchase of foreign currency at a known fixed rate on an agreed future date.
• Interest rate swaps are derivative instruments that exchange a fixed rate of interest for a floating rate 
or vice-versa or one type of floating interest rate for another and are used to manage interest rate risk. 
Interest rate swaps
On issuing the 2017 Eurobond, the Company entered into a portfolio of fixed to floating interest rate 
swaps and then subsequently overlaid a portfolio of floating to fixed interest rate swaps with the result 
that interest was 100% fixed on these borrowings. The timing of entering into these swaps locked in an 
interest benefit for the Company, resulting in a net mark-to-market gain on the portfolio.
Cash flow hedges
The Company applies hedge accounting for certain foreign currency firm commitments and highly 
probably cash flows where the relevant cash flows are payable within the next two years. In order to fix 
the sterling cash outflows associated with the commitments – which are mainly denominated in AUD or 
euros – the Company has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts for the same foreign currency 
amount and maturity date as the expected foreign currency outflow. The amount recognised in other 
comprehensive income during the period all relates to the effective portion of the revaluation loss 
associated with these contracts. There was less than £1 million (2014: £nil) ineffectiveness taken to the 
income statement and £6 million cumulative loss (2014: £nil) recycled to the income statement in the year.
Undiscounted financial liabilities 
The Company is required to disclose the expected timings of cash outflows for each of its derivative 
financial liabilities. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows 
(including interest), so will not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the statement of 
financial position.

The Company’s ordinary shares give shareholders equal rights to vote, receive dividends and to the 
repayment of capital. 
Equity
The retained earnings reserve includes profit after tax for the year of £671 million (2014: £44 million loss) 
which includes dividends of £700 million from subsidiaries in 2015 (2014: £nil). The retained earnings 
reserves of £880 million are all distributable. 
The Directors of the Company propose a final dividend of 4.1p per share and a special dividend of 10.0p 
per share.
Other reserves of £36 million (2014: £36 million) relate to share-buy backs in prior periods. 
Contingent liabilities
Under a Group registration, the Company is jointly and severally liable for VAT at 31 December 2015 of 
£59 million (31 December 2014: £58 million). The Company has guaranteed certain finance and operating 
lease obligations of subsidiary undertakings. 
There are contingent liabilities in respect of certain litigation and guarantees, broadcasting issues, and in 
respect of warranties given in connection with certain disposals of businesses. None of these items are 
expected to have a material effect on the Company’s results or financial position.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other 
companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for 
them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such 
time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Capital and other commitments
There are no capital commitments at 31 December 2015 (2014: none).

Transition to FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework
For all periods up to and including 31 December 2014, the Company prepared its financial statements in 
accordance with previously extant United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice (UK GAAP). 
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, are the first the Company has prepared 
in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS101). Accordingly 
the Company has prepared these financial statements to comply with FRS101 for periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2014 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in 
the relevant notes.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company has started from an opening balance sheet as at 
1 January 2014, the Company’s date of transition to FRS101 and made those changes in accounting policies 
and other restatements required for the first-time adoption of FRS101. As such this note explains the 
principal adjustments made by the Company in restating its balance sheet as at 1 January 2014 prepared 
under previously extant UK GAAP and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2014. 
On transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 1 first time adoption of 
International Financial Reporting Standards. 
Under FRS 101 deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the estimated future 
tax deductions for share-based compensation and the related cumulative share-based compensation 
expense. To the extent that the estimated future tax deductions exceed the cumulative expense, 
the excess deferred tax is recognised directly in equity.

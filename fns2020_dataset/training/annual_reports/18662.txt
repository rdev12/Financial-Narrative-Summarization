Chairman’s Statement
A particular feature of these results is 
the significant increase in year-end cash 
balances, demonstrating the ability of 
our business to benefit from previous 
capital expenditure and generate 
significant cash flow. As the current 
capital expenditure programme is now 
largely complete, it has been decided 
to return some of the group’s surplus 
cash to shareholders as a special 
dividend.
Overview
Group revenues in the year were up 
3.0% at £654.1 million. In the UK, which 
represented 88% of group sales in 
the year, revenues were up 4.9% at 
£575.3 million, reflecting organic and 
acquisitive growth. 
On a like for like basis, UK revenues 
were up 3.9% at £570.0 million. The 
growth in the second half was less than 
the first half increase of 5.4%, reflecting 
in part strong second half comparatives 
in 2014. The group has again delivered 
organic growth in excess of the UK 
floorcoverings market, which for 2015 
is forecast to be 3.4% (Source: AMA 
Research Limited).
Revenues from the Continental 
European businesses were down 3.8% 
in constant currency at £83.6 million. 
The second half decrease of 2.7% 
was less than the first half decrease 
of 4.8%, indicating that trading had 
begun to stabilise and improve. On 
translation to sterling, Continental 
European revenues were down 9.3% at 
£78.7 million. Whilst European markets 
remain challenging for the group, they 
represent a decreasing proportion of 
group revenues, at just 12.0% during 
2015 (2014: 13.7%).
 
Since the year end, 
the aggregate revenue performance 
from the three Continental territories, 
France, Switzerland and the 
Netherlands, in constant currency, has 
improved by 1.5%.
One bolt-on acquisition was completed 
during the year, Matty’s Wholesale 
Carpets, a Midlands-based distributor 
of residential floorcoverings to 
independent flooring retailers. The 
acquisition, completed on 30 January 
2015, has been earnings enhancing. 
The group continues to evaluate 
potential bolt-on acquisitions in line 
with its growth strategy.
 
The group also 
continued to invest in the development 
of its operations, including the opening 
of a showroom in Clerkenwell, London, 
as a marketing base for Headlam 
Corporate, a new business unit 
targeting specifiers of commercial 
flooring. The group also added to its 
network of service centres, opening 
a new service centre in Cheltenham 
in July 2015. During March 2016, two 
additional service centres are expected 
to open in Croydon and Hull which 
would bring the total to 31.
Earnings and dividend
Basic earnings per share for the year 
increased by 18.2% to 33.8 pence (2014: 
28.6 pence), reflecting an increase of 
17.6% in the group’s profit before tax to 
£35.6 million. 
The board is proposing to increase the 
final ordinary dividend by 19.5% from 
12.30 pence to 14.70 pence resulting 
in a total ordinary dividend for the 
year of 20.70p, which represents an 
increase on 2014 of 18.3%.
 
The final 
dividend, if approved by shareholders 
at the group’s Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”), will be paid on 1 July 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 3 June 2016.
Special dividend
Throughout the downturn in the UK 
floorcoverings market between 2008 
and 2011, the group continued to 
invest in its infrastructure, particularly 
in its distribution centre network. This 
capital expenditure programme, which 
has positioned the group to benefit 
from operational gearing as markets 
improve, is now largely complete. The 
final significant investment currently 
intended as previously announced, is 
a major distribution centre in Ipswich 
with an estimated project cost of £13.5 
million. Construction of this project 
has been delayed as a result of the 
planning process but work is now 
expected to begin in the latter half of 
this year.
The revised timing for the construction 
of the Ipswich facility, and its effect 
on the amount of capital expenditure 
this year, has created the opportunity 
to pay a special dividend, which the 
board believes is the best way to return 
surplus capital to shareholders. The 
board has therefore declared that 
a special dividend of 6.0 pence per 
ordinary share shall be paid on 25 April 
2016 to shareholders on the register at 
8 April 2016. 
I am pleased to report that 2015 was another year of good 
progress at Headlam. It was a year that delivered good 
growth in revenues and profitability, reflecting positive trends 
in the group’s marketplace in the UK along with further 
progress in the delivery of the group’s strategy.

Governance and board
We continue to promote a culture 
of openness and transparency 
and encourage participation and 
contribution from all our board 
members.
 
The board recognises the 
value derived from good governance 
and the setting of high standards, 
not least in the confidence it brings 
to our shareholders, management, 
employees, suppliers and customers.
On 31 May 2015, after serving over 
nine years as a non-executive director, 
Mike O’Leary resigned from the board.
 
On behalf of the board, I would like 
to thank Mike for his commitment 
and participation and we wish him 
well for the future.
 
Philip Lawrence 
was appointed to the board with 
effect from 1 June 2015, at which time 
he was appointed as a member of 
the Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees and Chairman of the 
Audit Committee.
 
Also, with effect 
from 1 June 2015, Andrew Eastgate 
stepped down as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee and was appointed 
Chairman of the Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees and Senior 
Independent Director. 
Following a competitive tender process 
and a recommendation from the Audit 
Committee, the board has invited 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) 
to accept appointment as auditor in 
respect of the group’s accounts for the 
year ended 31 December 2016.
 
The 
appointment is in line with guidance in 
the 2014 Corporate Governance Code.
 
The board would like to thank KPMG 
for their services to the group since 
1992 and look forward to working with 
PwC in the future.
Employees and shareholders
Once again, our employees’ 
commitment and determination 
has been pivotal to the continued 
success of the group. Thank you to all 
our employees across the group for 
their dedication and hard work and 
our shareholders for their continuing 
support.

STRA TEGIC REPORT
Headlam Group Plc 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015
www.headlam.com
Stock code: Head 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
The group’s size and structure 
provides a unique competitive 
advantage allowing it to deliver a 
range of benefits, including continuous 
product development, wide and 
diverse product portfolio, extensive 
marketing support and next day 
distribution services, all of which are 
aimed at supporting and enhancing its 
customers’ market position.
Development of the group’s overall 
business is achieved by operating each 
of the group’s 56 businesses on an 
autonomous basis and encouraging the 
managers of each individual business 
to develop their own unique trading 
style, albeit within a well-developed 
and consistently applied framework of 
operational and financial control.
This diverse business structure, 
particularly in the UK, covering the 
retail and commercial sectors, gives 
the group substantial reach across 
floorcovering markets and provides 
suppliers with a flexible channel for the 
sales, marketing and distribution of 
their products.
In addition, the structure has allowed 
the group to be active with a wide 
and diverse product portfolio across 
a significant proportion of the 
floorcovering market and will, to a 
degree, help insulate the business from 
the downside risk arising from static or 
contracting markets.
In the UK, the business operates with 
56 businesses (2014: 55) served from 
four national distribution hubs
 
(2014: 4), 
14 distribution centres (2014: 14) and 29 
service centres (2014: 27).
Each individual business is supported 
by the group’s commitment to 
continued investment in people, 
product, marketing, distribution 
facilities, service centres and IT. This 
structural investment, in conjunction 
with the development of the identity of 
each individual business, has enabled 
us to bring together the benefits of a 
market facing culture delivering the 
latest selling, marketing and product 
initiatives with a comprehensive and 
sophisticated logistics operation.
Ultimately, the total investment 
has underpinned the growth and 
performance of each business thus 
enabling the group to establish itself 
as Europe’s leading floorcovering 
distributor.
Performance
One of the group’s key performance 
objectives is aimed at achieving growth 
in market share. We drive this growth 
by setting each of our individual 
businesses, in conjunction with the 
management teams, an annual growth 
parameter, which is collectively set to 
outperform the anticipated underlying 
growth in the market.
Once again, it is pleasing to record 
that the group’s growth in UK revenue 
during 2015, as has consistently 
been the case for a number of years, 
outperformed growth in the UK 
floorcovering market with the like 
for like growth of 3.9% exceeding 
the estimated market growth in 2015 
of 3.4%.
 
The increase in like for like 
revenue reflected slightly stronger 
growth in residential, up 4.1%, 
compared with commercial up 3.5%. 
The revenue mix between residential 
and commercial floorcoverings in the 
UK has remained broadly at the same 
level for a number of years, and 2015 
maintained the balance at 69% and 
31% respectively. 
The resilience of residential sales is in 
part because a typical purchase by a 
residential end-user is of one piece of 
carpet at an average size of 4m by 5m.
 
It is well-established that people in the 
UK tend to replace carpets one room 
at a time, helping with the affordability 
of the purchase. The trend towards 
grey coloured carpeting has continued 
and, of the new best-selling carpet 
products launched during the year, grey 
carpet accounted for about 40% of the 
content of each range in the middle to 
higher price points.
 
All of the group’s principal product 
groups showed growth on the 
corresponding period. Sales of the 
Lifestyle Floors brand increased by 
28% as a result of further investment in 
sampling, an improving product profile 
and increased market penetration.
On the Continent, economic 
headwinds continue to influence 
performance and the overall trading 
result has registered a further decline 
during the year.  It is encouraging 
that the rate of decline slowed in the 
second half with the markets showing 
signs of stabilisation.
 
We continue to 
believe that there are opportunities 
to develop each individual business 
irrespective of the market conditions in 
each individual territory. Gross margins 
continue to be protected and costs 
managed diligently. As ever, additional 
revenue volume would transform 
the operating performance of these 
businesses.
Chief Executive’s Review
Our Strategy
The group continues to follow a strategy focused on 
developing its floorcovering distribution business in the UK 
and Continental Europe and improving the all-round service 
offering it provides to customers.
06 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
During the year, we have maintained 
our investment in people, marketing, 
infrastructure and the promotion and 
development of each of our individual 
business identities. We continue to 
provide extensive marketing support 
to our customers and, through our 
well trained and knowledgeable sales 
teams, seek to gain an increasing share 
of their business opportunities. In 
addition, our teams are also focused 
on prospecting for new customers and 
business opportunities.
Developments in the year included a 
new buyers app for use on an iPad to 
promote group-wide best practice and 
an iPhone based driver delivery app to 
further improve customer service.
Investments
Over the six year period from 2010 to 
2015, we have used the group’s balance 
sheet strength, allied with its positive 
cash flow, to invest £39.1 million in 
property, plant and equipment, with 
a further £19.7 million expenditure 
forecast for 2016 and 2017. This level of 
capital expenditure has been running, 
on average, at a rate of 1.5 times 
depreciation.
Expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment during 2015 was £2.9 
million, with the investment being 
focused on maintenance covering 
items such as forklift trucks and 
racking. Expenditure for 2016 was 
previously forecast to be £18.0 million, 
a significant portion of which was 
earmarked for the new 160,000 square 
foot distribution facility in Ipswich 
for Faithfull’s Floorcovering, one of 
the group’s regional multi-product 
businesses. Owing to delays to the 
start of construction at Ipswich, which is 
now expected in the latter half of 2016, 
projected expenditure is expected to 
be £13.5 million over the course of 2016 
and 2017.
Once the Ipswich distribution facility 
is fully operational, the group will 
have a well invested portfolio of four 
national distribution hubs and 14 
regional distribution centres in the UK 
as well as four distribution centres on 
the Continent. These facilities should 
be able to satisfy the group’s capacity 
requirements and growth expectations 
for a number of years and there 
should be no requirement for further 
investment in additional or replacement 
distribution facilities in this time frame. 
During recent years, we have 
supplemented our distribution network 
in the UK with a number of service 
centres with the aim of improving 
customer service by making product 
more readily available. This type of 
investment is particularly helpful for 
customers who prefer to collect their 
product needs as opposed to relying 
on our delivery service.
During the year, we continued to 
expand the number of service centres 
we operate across the UK and at the 
end of the year they numbered 29.
 
The provision of trade counters is 
also offered within our distribution 
centres thereby bringing the number of 
collection points in the UK to 44. There 
are still some locations that would 
benefit from the opening of a service 
centre and we anticipate expanding 
our coverage in the future, subject to 
the availability of suitable sites. The 
opening of two new service centres in 
Croydon and Hull is imminent
Acquisitions
We intend to continue to utilise our 
capital resource to augment the group’s 
growth with further acquisitions. 
We have a history of quickly and 
successfully integrating small bolt-
on acquisitions into our existing 
infrastructure, achieving overhead 
synergies and an earnings enhancing 
performance.
During the year, we acquired Matty’s 
Wholesale Carpets, and integrated its 
operations into our distribution facility 
in Coleshill. The acquisition has been 
immediately earnings enhancing and 
the group has also benefited in 2015 
from acquisitions completed in the 
prior year.
Prospects
Trading in the current year has started 
well, with like for like growth in the UK 
of 6.3% during the first eight weeks 
of the year. We are confident that the 
group will continue to perform well 
during the year ahead.

With the support of third party training providers, 
the group continued with its programmes for senior 
managers, sales managers and representatives 
throughout the year and expanded the number  
of courses with the introduction of additional 
training opportunities for our sales office and 
distribution managers.
In addition, the induction training offered to all our new sales 
representatives was reviewed and improved. The enhanced 
programme, which includes supplier led training to provide  
better product knowledge, has proven to be both rewarding  
and beneficial.
The group has also looked to widen its appeal and a recruitment 
process aimed at attracting graduates by developing a set 
programme which allows the individuals to gain a thorough 
knowledge and understanding of all aspects of the business.  
Past experience has taught us that our best talent is home grown 
so by attracting and recruiting able young people at the start of 
their career, we have an improved potential to develop future 
managers to take the business forward.

Supplier App
During the year, we introduced a supplier app to promote 
and share best practice amongst our buying managers with 
the purpose of enabling our managers to record and share 
information gathered during their supplier meetings with 
appropriate colleagues elsewhere around the group.
The app will allow our managers to function more 
efficiently in their meetings with suppliers and in many ways 
provides a mirror image of the CRM app used by our sales 
representatives with their customers.
The functionality of the app allows meeting notes to be 
taken, images of product to be recorded and attached to 
text and a planning facility and diary reference for the quick 
and easy scheduling of meetings and visits with suppliers.
In addition to posts, a manager can also request his/her 
supplier reports to be downloaded and viewed within the 
app. Previously these were viewed via email. The apps built 
in calendar enables the manager to customise the various 
options. For example, the manager can request a date and 
time for information and a suite of reports relating to the 
supplier meeting to be generated in a timely manner so 
that they contain the most up to date information prior to 
attending their meeting. They can also state the duration of 
the meeting and make note of the expected attendees as 
well as send the appointment as an invite to other managers 
or the suppliers themselves
When in use, the app invites the manager to follow a process 
both before and after the supplier meeting; the manager 
will now create meeting plans which highlight the meeting 
objectives. Once the meeting is concluded, the manager will 
complete their meeting notes and any follow up actions. The 
notes of the meeting can then be shared with other relevant 
managers.
Driver App
The new driver app has been designed for use on the 
iPhone 6 plus and provides our drivers and customers with 
a comprehensive suite of information that enhances the 
service we are able to provide.
The app gives the driver a vehicle check facility that all our 
drivers must complete before leaving the distribution facility 
to ensure the vehicle is fit for purpose; a schedule of the 
deliveries loaded on the vehicle; and the ability to generate 
electronic proof of delivery and subsequent invoice.
Satellite navigation is included within the package and 
importantly, it allows the driver to notify the customers when 
he estimates arriving at their premises.

Supporting our supply chain and managing our relationships
Headlam distributes a wide range of products, sourced from a variety of floorcovering suppliers located around the globe, to its 
customer base who, in the main, are independent floorcovering retailers and contractors. Essential to the group’s ongoing success are 
its strong relationships with suppliers, which have developed over many years, at both senior level and within each of our operating 
businesses. The collaborative effort that exists between our senior and individual management teams and suppliers is aimed at ensuring 
that our businesses remain at the forefront of all new products introduced into our particular markets.
Delivering long-term shareholder value
This structure permits broad access to floorcovering markets, allows the group to react swiftly to emerging opportunities and 
assists with managing downside risks when trading environments are challenging. Whilst each business is encouraged to 
adopt an entrepreneurial style, they are operated within a well developed and consistently applied framework of operational 
and financial control.
Headlam forms an essential 
link that enables suppliers of 
floorcovering products to gain 
extensive access to markets 
located in Western Europe.

How we differentiate ourselves to  
deliver competitive advantages
Supported by our clear Business Model
We have a clear and straightforward business model which is 
aimed at delivering to our customer an enhanced service based on 
wide product choice and immediate availability and providing our 
suppliers with market reach and a wide customer base.
Diverse Business 
Portfolio
Headlam operates through a 
number of individual and diverse 
businesses located in the UK, 
France, Switzerland and the 
Netherlands. Each business has 
its own trading identity and is 
operated on an autonomous basis 
by local management teams. 
The autonomous operations are 
a key contributor to the group’s 
success, providing opportunity for 
experienced management teams 
to develop their individual identity, 
market presence and profitability 
of the business for which they are 
responsible.
Key Resources
Headlam’s collection of businesses, 
assembled over many years, has 
allowed the group to continually 
outperform the floorcovering market 
through various economic cycles. 
This has been very evident in recent 
years when conditions have proved 
to be particularly demanding and 
during which time the group has 
consistently maintained its ability to 
achieve an increased market share. 
Our continued investment in our 
people, processes and infrastructure 
continues to give us a strong 
position in the marketplace.

Each of the businesses utilises an

The distribution centres maintain 
substantial investment in products 
to ensure that customers’ orders are 
swiftly processed and their delivery 
expectations fully satisfied.
We would not be able to achieve the

employ reliable and accurate tracking 
systems. These systems facilitate the

Our deliveries to customers are made on 
group vehicles. The fleet is completely

to maintain a constant improvement 
in operating efficiency and reduced 
operating costs and vehicle emissions.

The principal characteristic of the floorcovering 
market is its maturity and as such, a vast majority of 
transactions relate to refurbishment.
Overview
The principal characteristic of the floorcovering market is its 
maturity and as such, a vast majority of transactions relate to 
refurbishment. Market size tends to be dictated by factors 
relating to consumer and business confidence and tend to 
be underpinned by a healthy residential housing market and 
a buoyant economy.
Due to the well documented events which occurred during 
2008 and the subsequent contraction in the UK economy, the 
UK floorcovering market contracted by 20.7% during 2008 to 
2011, with a modest recovery during 2012 of 1.5%, broadly 
flat during 2013, an estimated further growth of 2.4% during 
2014 and 3.4% for 2015.
How we service the market
The UK operating structure is based 
on five business sectors each aimed 
at maximising market penetration and 
supporting different aspects of the 
floorcovering market.
Our regional and national multi-product 
businesses provide a comprehensive 
residential and commercial product 
range and extensive geographical 
coverage.
The regional commercial businesses 
focus on strong relationships with 
suppliers and a high level of localised 
service for their customers. 
Our residential specialist businesses 
supply medium to premium residential 
carpet on a national basis and the 
commercial specialist businesses, which 
have a national presence, provide a 
range of products servicing various 
aspects of the commercial market.
Our business in France operates from 
two distribution centres and 18 service 
centres, whereas the businesses in 
Switzerland and the Netherlands each 
operate from a single distribution 
centre. All five businesses on the 
continent offer an extensive range 
of products providing full national 
coverage across their respective 
countries.

Corporate Responsibility
Living our values
Policy
We periodically review our 
policy towards Corporate Social 
Responsibility (“CSR”) to ensure 
that it continues to meet the needs 
of the markets and communities in 
which we operate. In recognising the 
importance of CSR issues, we seek 
to encourage and facilitate positive 
management behaviour in alignment 
with the group’s business strategy. 
This includes the morale and welfare 
of our employees, the satisfaction of 
our customers and our impact on the 
environment. 
Through the individual businesses and 
at a group level, we consider social 
and environmental factors, managing 
relationships with stakeholders and 
communicating with them through a 
variety of channels. These include the 
AGM, annual and interim reporting and 
announcements through a regulatory 
news service for matters relating to 
trading and the development of the 
business, all of which are available on 
our website at www.headlam.com. 
Additionally, in order to assist with 
their understanding of the business 
and to ensure that the board is aware 
of their views and concerns, meetings 
are held with our major institutional 
shareholders.
People
Equal opportunities
Our policy is that all employees 
should have access to employment 
opportunities, irrespective of age, 
gender, ethnic origin, religion or 
disability. Consideration is given to 
applications for employment, having 
due regard to the particular aptitudes 
and abilities of the applicants and 
to our responsibilities under the 
Disability Discrimination Act. Where 
practicable, subject to the nature of 
our activities, employees who develop 
a disability during employment are 
given the opportunity to retrain 
for alternative employment. Our 
recruitment, training and development 
processes are designed to ensure 
that we have suitably skilled and 
qualified employees to meet the 
operational needs of the business. We 
also participate in work experience 
placement schemes. We are 
committed to developing the potential 
of our people, offering opportunities 
for employees to develop and grow 
and periodically reviewing succession 
planning processes. Employee 
turnover remains relatively low 
resulting in a stable employee base.
Communications
The continued success of our 
business relies on good relations 
and communications with employees 
and on the provision of a safe and 
environmentally sound workplace, 
which complies with applicable 
laws and regulations, providing 
an environment in which people 
can flourish and succeed. Our 
employees’ wellbeing and professional 
development is a key element 
to recruiting and retaining high-
performing individuals.
Our people seek to deliver their best 
for the business, which, combined 
with a fair and responsible way of 
doing business, generates a common 
ambition to add value. We expect 
employees to respect confidential 
information, company time and assets, 
and believe in open and honest 
communication, fair treatment and 
equal opportunities, all of which 
support the fundamental principles of 
good governance.
We encourage the involvement and 
participation of employees in matters 
that affect their interests through 
formal and informal meetings, and 
value their communication with 
management, both senior and at the 
business unit. 
We are committed to managing the business in a socially 
responsible way, recognising that the proper management 
of such matters makes good business sense and can result in 
strategic, commercial and reputational benefits. We aim to 
consistently improve the social, environmental and economic 
issues within our control or influence throughout the business 
and our supply network. 
22 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
Employees continue to be informed 
on matters affecting them and on 
the various factors influencing the 
performance of the group. Eligible 
employees are able to benefit from 
the group’s performance through 
participation in share schemes, 
including a savings-related share option 
scheme. 
Considering it important for our 
employees to make provision for 
their retirement, the group offers 
opportunities for participation in 
retirement plans, also providing death 
in service benefits through a group life 
assurance scheme.
Training
Employees are encouraged to 
take advantage of our training and 
development opportunities, which 
are an important part of our strategy 
for success. Training is delivered 
through internal resources, a significant 
proportion of which is on a one-to-
one basis, and external providers. In 
2016 we have continued the bespoke 
training programme for our managers 
and sales representatives.
We require our employees to act 
ethically and responsibly in accordance 
with the policies and procedures within 
our employment handbook, which 
covers our policies on ethics, bribery, 
fraud and whistleblowing. Utilising 
the services of an external trainer, 
continuing professional competence 
training for commercial vehicle drivers 
was undertaken during the year with 
further training scheduled during 2016. 
Our externally sourced driver training 
team continues to deliver the driver 
Certificate of Professional Competence 
(“CPC”) to all of our commercial 
drivers to ensure that the statutory 
requirement of 35 hours’ CPC training 
for every driver over a five year period 
is achieved, a total of 469 drivers 
each receiving seven hours’ training 
in 2015. Training is facilitated using 
our distribution facilities, with course 
material in 2015 including customer 
service, health and safety, hazard 
perception, city safe and highway 
code. The 2016 training programme 
is following a similar approach to that 
in 2015 albeit with different subject 
matter, including manual handling, 
lifting accessories, load restraint 
mechanisms and hazard awareness. We 
continue to offer the opportunity for 
class 2 driver training to drivers where 
changes in business need require a 
heavy goods vehicle to be used.

Health and safety
The health and safety of employees 
and individuals likely to be affected by 
our business, including contractors, 
customers, staff and members of the 
public where appropriate, is treated 
with the utmost importance. We 
are committed to developing and 
maintaining a positive and effective 
health and safety culture. It is our policy 
to seek to ensure that the group’s 
operations are carried out at all times 
in compliance with the relevant health 
and safety guidance in the jurisdictions 
in which we operate. 
Our health and safety policy, which 
is endorsed by the board, is tailored 
to each of our business operations 
and the circumstances in which they 
operate. It is amended to reflect 
changes in procedures and processes 
and any modifications to our control 
and inspection procedures. The board 
receives a detailed presentation on 
health and safety issues, covering each 
trading location, on an annual basis, 
with interim updates as considered 
necessary. These include comments on 
improvements following inspections of 
the UK businesses undertaken by our 
advisers. At least once a year, each of 
the UK businesses receives an updated 
bespoke comprehensive health and 
safety manual for use as a source of 
information, guidance and training 
together with a set of compliance 
documentation. Each of our businesses 
has a Health and Safety Committee 
comprising representatives from the 
various business departments. These 
meet on a periodic basis and are co-
ordinated by the on-site health and 
safety manager. Management teams 
are encouraged to create a supportive 
health and safety culture and recognise 
the value of employee participation. 
The report to the board includes our 
businesses in Europe, which operate in 
accordance with the health and safety 
legislation and inspection practices in 
their respective countries. Inspections 
undertaken by our third party adviser 
form the basis on which we determine 
our standards and are continually 
reviewed and improved. Additional 
inspections are undertaken where 
changes to operations have occurred or 
new premises occupied.
These are complemented by annual 
inspections of racking systems 
carried out by independent externally 
appointed assessors and, in the UK, risk 
inspections undertaken by our insurers 
at several of our businesses.
Health and safety is an important 
part of employee induction, at which 
time we ensure that all employees 
are aware of our policies and of the 
commitment that is expected of them 
towards their safety. Managers, to 
whom the day-to-day responsibility 
for health and safety is delegated 
and who are best placed to monitor 
and control safety, are guided and 
supported by our third-party advisers 
in risk assessment techniques. Job-
specific training, including periodic 
refresher training, is supported by 
good practice guides which set out 
the important features associated with 
many aspects of the roles and duties 
undertaken by employees. Good 
practice guides are reviewed not less 
than annually to ensure they remain 
relevant to the business and include 
an awareness of impending changes in 
relevant legislation and other specialist 
subjects. They are also reviewed, as 
appropriate, following any accident or 
incident. The local business managers 
with responsibility for health and 
safety have completed the Institute 
of Occupational Safety and Health 
“Managing Safely” course.
24 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
Our businesses maintain good 
relationships with health and safety 
and environmental health regulators 
with positive and prompt responses to 
any findings or observations following 
compliance inspections. In 2015 there 
were 15 reportable incidents, compared 
to nine in 2014, none of which had 
resulted in a serious injury or fatality. All 
reportable accidents are investigated 
and, in the minority of instances where 
improvement is required, changes are 
implemented in a timely manner. There 
were no prosecutions for breaches 
of health and safety or enforcement 
actions in the year. 
Containment and inspection regimes 
in higher risk areas, such as fuel and 
lubrication stores, compressors and 
forklift truck battery charging areas, are 
kept under review. Fire risk protection 
continues to be improved, training 
and awareness increased and special 
containers are sited at least five 
metres from the main buildings for the 
storage of flammable products and 
combustible waste. Bespoke provision 
for such aspects of the business is 
incorporated within the design of the 
new distribution facilities. 
Environmental
Product sourcing
As an importer of wood products from 
outside the EU, we have a procedure in 
place to comply with the requirements 
of the European Union Timber 
Regulations which came into force in 
March 2013. The procedure culminates 
in a documented trail confirming that 
the wood products are sourced from 
authorised and renewable supplies. 
As part of this procedure, we also 
make enquiries to ensure that the 
manufacturers we deal with do not use 
child labour or exploit children and 
treat their workforce fairly. 
Further procedures are being finalised 
to meet the requirements of the 2015 
Modern Slavery Act which includes 
verification that those manufacturers 
from which we source products treat 
their employees fairly and do not use 
child labour.
 
Utilities
As a wholesale distributor of 
floorcoverings operating from 
distribution facilities in the UK, France, 
Switzerland and the Netherlands, we 
are not a significant consumer of water, 
electricity or gas. Electricity and gas 
supplies are purchased on a group 
contract basis.
Water
Water consumption arises 
predominantly in respect of employee 
welfare and commercial vehicle 
washing. The majority of our water 
charges are in respect of water 
supplied and used. We encourage our 
drivers to keep the commercial vehicles 
clean and tidy. To assist them, we have 
a combination of jet wash machines 
and, at four of the distribution facilities 
from which a significant number of 
commercial vehicles operate, specialist 
truck washes. Each truck wash utilises 
100% recycled water, helping with 
conservation, and environmentally 
friendly washing detergents.
We seek to reduce charges by 
analysing invoices received in respect 
of water, through the installation 
of water meters and by reducing 
consumption through repair, renewal 
or installation of equipment to improve 
efficiency. 
Our water consumption in 2015 was 
consistent with the 32,660 cubic metres 
consumed in 2014 and 2013.
Electricity
Electricity consumption is 
predominantly in respect of forklift 
truck battery charging, the operation 
of specialist cutting tables used to 
cut lengths from full and part rolls 
of broadloom products, associated 
mechanical handling and compressed 
air equipment, office and warehouse 
lighting and office equipment.

Corporate Responsibility
Living our values
Modern and energy efficient construction techniques and 
products are incorporated when we invest in new facilities 
or undertake refurbishment or repair works, which are more 
efficient, automatically switching off during periods of 
inactivity. Photovoltaic panels, installed on the roof of the 
Coleshill facility in 2014, are operational and generating 
an estimated 46,000 kWh of electricity. Consideration will 
be given to further similar installations following a period 
of evaluation. Future construction projects will similarly 
incorporate intelligent lighting systems and, where practical, 
renewable energy solutions. During the year we used the 
improved information arising following the installation of 
automated meters to seek reductions in consumption. 
We also installed more energy efficient LED units when 
undertaking lighting repairs and replacement.
The actual cost of electricity and gas in 2015 at 0.2% of 
revenue was consistent with prior year.
Gas
Gas is consumed predominantly in respect of office heating 
and very limited localised radiant heating above work 
stations on the cutting tables located within the distribution 
centre. The installation of a sophisticated heating control 
system in the recently constructed Coleshill facility has 
resulted in lower consumption. A similar control system 
has also been installed in the Tamworth facility, resulting in 
savings in consumption of electricity and gas. Consideration 
will be given to installing such control systems in other 
premises if considered viable.
Owing to the nature of our business and with our proactive 
approach when planning and developing new facilities, we 
believe that our activities generally have a low impact on 
the environment, with no environmental legal or compliance 
issues arising during the year.
Carbon reporting
We are required to report on all the measured emissions 
sources under The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. Data has been 
collected in accordance with the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme. Conversion factors 
for electricity, gas and fuel are those published by the 
Carbon Trust and Defra in 2013.

The increase in respect of commercial vehicle fuel was a 
result of an increase in the number of deliveries made in the 
year as reflected in the uplift in revenue. 
Following the opening of the trans-shipping facility in 
Aberdeen in late March 2014, further improvements in 
service levels and efficiency in deliveries to the north east of 
Scotland have been achieved
 
resulting in reduced fuel costs. 
Commercial and motor vehicles are replaced respectively 
on a five-and three-year basis, in doing so improving 
operational efficiencies and reducing operating costs and 
vehicle emissions. All of our commercial vehicles comply 
with Euro 5 emission standards which, when introduced, 
further reduced the levels of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, 
nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions. New commercial 
and motor vehicles delivered to us since October 2014 have 
been compliant with Euro 6 emission standards which were 
binding for the registration of new commercial and motor 
vehicles from September 2015. Euro 6 more than halves 
the amount of nitrogen oxides that a diesel car can emit 
with a cap of 80mg/km. We periodically review our fleet 
requirements to ensure the optimum design to maximise 
capacity and improve aerodynamics.
ESOS
The Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”) 
is a mandatory energy assessment scheme for large 
organisations in the UK. An ESOS assessment was carried out 
by an external assessor in the latter part of the year ensuring 
compliance by the deadline of 5 December 2015. Due to 
the mix of energy, with the majority related to transport fuel, 
the assessment comprised an audit of the energy used by 
our transport activities, there being no requirement to audit 
the energy consumed in respect of buildings and industrial 
processes. The assessment identified a number of potential 
cost–effective energy saving measures, the practicality of 
implementing them being assessed.

FORS
During the year, several of our businesses supplying goods 
into and around London sought and achieved a mix of 
bronze and silver accreditation with the Fleet Operator 
Recognition Scheme (“FORS”). FORS is a voluntary scheme 
that helps improve operators’ performance in respect of 
all aspects of safety, fuel efficiency, economical operations 
and vehicle emissions. For vehicle operators, it confirms 
that they are meeting their legislative requirements, as well 
as helping to increase efficiency, reduce costs and secure 
work. Increasingly contractors insist upon a minimum of 
FORS bronze accreditation before accepting deliveries to 
premises in and around the London area, rejecting deliveries 
from non–accredited suppliers. As part of the accreditation 
process, additional signs and mirrors are fitted to vehicles in 
order to reduce cycling and motorcycling accidents. 
Waste
The waste arising from our operations is predominantly 
protective plastic packaging, cardboard poles and boxes 
and wooden pallets. The cardboard poles from the centre 
of full rolls, part rolls and cut lengths of carpet and vinyl 
delivered to our customers are later collected and re–used 
until no longer fit for purpose.
We continue to increase the percentage that we recycle, 
baling plastics and cardboard, and stacking unwanted pallets 
for dispatch to specialist reprocessing agents, when it is 
economic to do so. This has further reduced the quantity 
of our waste going to landfill sites. Guidance on waste 
management is issued to the managers of the individual 
businesses to increase awareness of the need to control 
and reduce waste. Where possible, wrapping and packing 
materials are sourced from manufacturers using a high 
proportion of recycled materials.
We participate in initiatives to reduce the amount of waste 
going to landfill and increase that going into recycling both 
local to our businesses and on a national basis, in recent 
years receiving recognition for our proactive approach. 
According to Carpet Recycling UK, of which we are a 
member, 81,000 tonnes of carpet were recovered for energy 
and 44,000 tonnes recycled in 2015, 125,000 tonnes in total, 
equivalent to a landfill diversion rate of 31%, an 11% increase 
on the 2014 diversion total of 113,000 tonnes. During the 
year, we have extended initiatives to recover and recycle 
trimmings of carpet, vinyl and underlay arising during 
installation by our customers through the provision of on site 
dedicated containers.
 
Our approach to recycling is of environmental and financial 
benefit, the bales of plastic and cardboard and the broken 
and unwanted wooden pallets either generating income or 
being collected for minimal charge.

Revenue
During the year, group revenue increased by £18.9 million from £635.2 million to £654.1 million.
As highlighted in the table below, the group’s UK organic growth of 3.9% once more outperformed the annual market 
growth, which for 2015 was forecast to be 3.4% (Source: AMA Research Limited).
 
The contribution from the UK acquisitions 
completed during 2014 in addition to the acquisition of Matty’s Wholesale Carpets, completed during 2015, amounted to 
£5.4 million bringing the total revenue increase in the UK to 4.9%, an improvement of £26.9 million on the previous year.
The combined revenue performance from the Continental European businesses showed further contraction during the year, 
declining by 3.8% on a like for like basis which, once translated into sterling, showed a reduction of 9.3% for the year.

As a result of the increase in UK revenues and a contraction on the Continent during 2015, the proportion of group revenue 
from the UK increased from 86.3% to 88.0%.
Gross Margin
The group’s gross margin increased during the year from 30.0% to 30.7%, with three factors contributing to the 0.7% 
improvement. Firstly a reduction in the cost of goods purchased provided a gain of 17 basis points; secondly, an 
improvement in volume related purchase rebates generated an improvement of 22 basis points; and thirdly,
 
one-off benefits, 
which are unlikely to repeat during 2016 and beyond, amounting to 31 basis points and totalling £2.0 million, were secured 
during the year, principally in connection with the appreciation of sterling against the euro.

Expenses
During the year, distribution and administrative expenses increased by £4.6 million, up 2.9% from £159.1 million to £163.7 
million.
 
The mix of distribution to administration cost remained broadly unchanged, finishing the year at 73.3%:26.7%.
 
People 
cost in isolation was the largest increase, amounting to 48.4% of the gross cost increase before currency translation.
 
Just over 
a third of the increase in people cost was offset by the gains arising from the reduction in fuel cost of £1.0 million.

Elsewhere, the continued investment in sampling, IT and the expansion of the service centre infrastructure generated 
combined cost increases of £2.7 million.
 
The need to impair receivables, an increase in the cost of share based payments, and 
the intangible cost relating to the acquisition of Matty’s Wholesale Carpets created an additional increase of £1.3 million.
 
The 
currency effect of translating the overseas businesses reduced the gross cost increase by £1.5 million.

Increase 15.4%
Operating profit during 2015 increased by 16.9% compared 
with 2014 with the operating margin improving from 5.0% to 
5.6%, reflecting the increase in gross margin and operational 
gearing generated on the higher revenue base.
 
The 
operating margin generated by the incremental year on year 
revenue improvement amounted to 28.2%. 
Tax
The effective underlying rate of taxation reduced to 20.25% 
during the year, reflecting the decrease in UK headline 
corporation tax rate and also the further future reductions, 
already enacted, that impact upon deferred taxation. The 
anticipated effective underlying rate for 2016 is expected to 
reduce to 20% due to further UK rate reductions which have 
been enacted.
During the period, the board approved a tax strategy which 
is aligned to the group’s overall strategic aims and values. 
The strategy sets out the group’s approach to tax, including 
the tax governance framework, attitude to tax risk and its 
relationship with tax authorities.
The group is committed to being fully compliant with the 
relevant tax laws and compliance obligations regarding 
the filing of tax returns, payment and collection of tax. The 
group maintains an open and honest relationship with HM 
Revenue & Customs and currently operates with a level of 
tax compliance risk that is rated as “low”.
The group does not undertake any form of artificial tax 
planning but does seek to maximise tax reliefs available, for 
example by making capital allowance claims on fixed asset 
expenditure.
Earnings and dividend
Ordinary dividends
The board’s existing ordinary dividend policy is aimed at 
improving dividends annually, such that the total of the 
interim and final dividends for any particular year increases in 
line with the basic earnings per ordinary share for that year.
When declaring the interim and recommending the final 
dividend, the board considers the group’s cash resource and 
adequacy of distributable reserves.
 
Over the last five years, the group’s total dividends and basic 
earnings per ordinary share have grown at a compound 
average growth rate of 9.4% and 10.5% respectively.

Basic earnings per share for the year amounted to 33.8p, 
an improvement of 18.2% on the basic earnings of 28.6p for 
2014.
 
Total ordinary dividends paid and proposed for 2015 
have increased by 18.3% from 17.5p to 20.70p.
The relationship between ordinary dividends and basic 
earnings can also be expressed as a cover ratio which over 
the last five years has averaged 1.67 but in the last two years 
has been lowered to a ratio of 1.63.
The board believes that whilst there is a continuing 
underlying risk relating to potential volatility around 
future growth in European floorcovering markets and, as a 
consequence, a lack of predictability around future earnings, 
it is nonetheless of the view that the current policy will 
continue during the medium term.
 
Additionally, and subject 
to the nature and term of any adverse movement in earnings, 
financial strength, cash resource and the assessment of 
future trading, the board has the option to allow a temporary 
fall in the cover ratio in order to maintain the dividend. 
Financial Review
32 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
In implementing the policy, the board ensures the parent 
company has sufficient distributable reserves available from 
which to make the distribution.
 
The table below illustrates 
the reserves position for the last five years and the ability 
of the parent to fund the dividend payment as measured 
by the number of years cover.
 
On average, over the last five 
years’, the parent has maintained reserves sufficient to cover 
4.8 years of dividend.

reserves are shown in the retained earnings column in the

Special dividends
For a number of years, the group has undertaken an 
expansionary investment programme to improve and 
increase the capacity and reach of its infrastructure in the UK.
 
The final significant element in the current programme will 
be the construction of a new distribution facility in Ipswich.
Once this project is completed, the group’s commitment 
to expansionary capital expenditure will largely cease 
and, subject to ongoing levels of cash generation being 
maintained, should lead to a position whereby the group 
will carry a level of funding in excess of that which would be 
required to maintain its asset base.
This development, therefore, paves the way for a return of 
surplus funds to shareholders and the board is of the opinion 
that this can be best achieved through the payment of 
special dividends.
Whilst the timing of the Ipswich construction has been 
delayed over the last few years, the prospect of initiating the 
project during the latter half of 2016 now appears likely.
   
This timetable is still behind the schedule previously advised 
to shareholders and therefore, given that capital expenditure 
will not be at the levels previously advised, the board is 
declaring the payment of a special dividend during  
April 2016. 
Once the cash effect of the capital outlay on the Ipswich 
development has been fully assessed following its 
completion, the board will give further consideration to the 
distribution of surplus capital by the use of special dividend 
payments.
 
The conditions that will apply to any special dividend 
payments are: firstly, the group’s forecast average net debt 
in the year in which the special dividend is paid should be 
approximately equal to or less than 0.5 of EBITDA; secondly, 
the cover ratio of the aggregated ordinary and special 
dividends when expressed in terms of dividend cover will 
not be less than one; and thirdly, the payment must be made 
from available distributable reserves.
The board believes this approach provides a flexible 
mechanism for managing the maintenance and expansion of 
the group’s asset base.

Employee benefits
The liability attaching to employee benefits is as follows:
2015  
£000
2014 
£000
Current liabilities 2,171 2,933
Non-current liabilities 16,843 18,803
Total 19,014 21,736
The year on year decrease in the deficit amounts to £2.7 
million. Whilst the liability relates to both the UK and Swiss 
defined benefit pension plans, its composition is dominated 
by the UK plan. Relative to the equivalent period last 
year, average bond yields in the UK have increased, and 
therefore the discount rate assumption has increased by 
0.3% per annum from 3.4% to 3.7% (causing a reduction in 
the value placed on the Scheme’s liabilities).  However, the 
market implied level of price inflation has edged up slightly, 
increasing from 3.2% to 3.3% (which, other things being 
equal, would lead to an increase in the Scheme’s liabilities). 
The net effect of these two factors is positive in the sense of 
reducing the Scheme’s deficit compared to the prior year. 
With regard to life expectancy assumptions, mortality has 
been based on the CMI 2013 tables and not the more recent 
CMI 2015 tables, which predict an improvement in mortality. 
The later tables have not been adopted in order to avoid 
potential movements in the liability as a result of a volatility 
arising from potential short term trends.
Cash flow
Net cash flow from operating activities
During the year, net cash flow from operating activities

driven by a substantial increase in payables of £7.3 million. 
The additional contributions funding the UK defined benefit 
pension plan deficit amounted to £3.0 million but, following 
the triennial actuarial valuation of the UK plan at 31 March 
2014, the additional contributions for 2016 will fall to £2.1 
million.
 
The next triennial valuation will take place on 31

Subject to the outcome, contributions for 2017

during the year arising from investing and financing activities.
 
The overall cash outflow from the two activities was down

in net capital expenditure of £3.0 million, the incremental 
investment as a result of the Matty’s Wholesale Carpets 
acquisition, a substantial reduction in cash outflows directed 
at reducing borrowings and an increase in the dividend 
payment.

appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the group’s financial accounts.

Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 
revision of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the board has assessed the prospects 
of the group over a period in excess of the 
twelve months required by the ‘Going Concern’ 
provision, selecting instead a three year period 
which takes into account the group’s current 
position and the potential impact of the principal 
risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 38 to 
39.
 
Based on this assessment, the board confirms 
it has a reasonable expectation that the group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the three year 
period to 31 December 2018.
The board has determined that three years 
constitutes an appropriate period over which to 
provide its viability statement.
 
This is the period 
focussed on by the board during the strategic 
planning process.
 
Whilst the board have no reason 
to believe the group will not be viable over a 
longer period, given the inherent uncertainty 
involved we believe this presents users of the 
Annual Report with a reasonable degree of 
confidence while still providing a medium term 
perspective.
In making this statement, the board carried out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance and solvency 
or liquidity.
The board considers annually, and on a rolling 
basis, a three year strategic plan.
 
The output of 
this plan is used to perform an analysis of central 
debt, the ability of the group to raise finance and 
the headroom requirement needed to run its 
operations.
 
The board’s evaluation also includes 
a review of the group’s exposure and sensitivity 
to operational business risks with an emphasis 
on trading performance, taking into account 
the availability and likely effectiveness of the 
mitigating actions that could be taken to avoid or 
reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying 
risks.
 
The review considers the principal risks identified 
by the group and whilst it does not consider all of 
the risks the group may face, in the circumstances, 
the board considers that this basis of assessment 
of the group’s prospects is reasonable.

Like for like revenue growth measures 
changes in revenue in the current 
year compared with the previous year. 
The measure excludes the effects of 
acquisitions and movement in working 
days and currency.
The group’s medium term growth objective 
is to achieve an increase in like for like 
revenue which exceeds the growth in the 
floorcovering market in the territories in 
which it operates, thereby maintaining 
growth in market share.
The ratio of gross profit to revenue.
Gross profit margin is a primary indicator 
of business performance and market 
competitiveness. A movement in gross 
margin generally reflects a change in the 
business product mix or market pricing or a 
combination of both.
Underlying operating profit margin is 
determined by adding back finance income 
and expense and non-underlying items to 
profit before tax and then measuring as a 
percentage of revenue.
The majority of the group’s operating 
costs are fixed and therefore changes in 
operating profit margin provide a measure 
of operating efficiency and the effects of 
incremental profitability arising from an 
increase in revenues.

Earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated 
by reference to post tax profit divided by 
the weighted average number of issued 
shares during the year.
Underlying EPS is calculated by adjusting 
for non-underlying items.
EPS and EPS growth are widely used 
measures of company performance.  
EPS growth forms the basis of the group’s 
current dividend policy since the board 
anticipates dividend growth to be broadly in 
line with the growth in EPS.
Return on capital employed is derived from 
underlying operating profit divided by 
the simple average of the net assets after 
adjusting for cash and borrowings at the 
start and end of the year.
Return on capital employed provides an 
indication on whether the group’s activities 
are creating value for its shareholders.
Credit taken is calculated by reference 
to trade receivables net of impairment 
provisions expressed as a proportion of 
current and prior months’ revenue inclusive 
of VAT. The receivables impairment loss 
percentage is calculated by expressing the 
annual impairment loss as a percentage of 
revenue.
These two indicators provide a regular 
check on the financial health of independent 
customers.

Managing our Risks
During the year the board carried out a robust assessment  
of the financial risks facing the group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity.
The group’s business, results and financial condition are influenced by a range of risks and uncertainties, a number of which 
remain beyond the control of the board. 
The board reviews key risks and controls and, whilst the following highlights some of the key risks that have or could affect 
the business, it is not an exhaustive analysis of the threats that may affect or influence the conduct of the business.
Area of risk
Market demand 
A significant proportion of the 
group’s revenue arises from 
trade with independent retailers 
and flooring contractors. 
The activity levels within this 
customer base are determined 
by consumer demand created 
through residential property 
refurbishment or moves, 
new residential housing 
developments and a wide range 
of commercial refurbishment 
and building projects.
Periods of economic recession 
that create reduced consumer 
confidence or contraction 
in the construction industry 
and changes in trends and 
preferences all have the 
potential to affect market 
activity and demand for 
products supplied by the group. 
This risk has been a feature 
of the floorcovering markets 
since 2008 in the territories 
where the group has traded. 
Each of these markets has 
contracted significantly and is 
either exhibiting continuing 
contraction or, in the case of the 
UK, signs of a modest recovery.
Market activity is monitored daily 
in each individual business and 
collectively at group level. This 
visibility allows prompt response to 
factors adversely affecting trading. 
Furthermore, since the group’s 
principal activities are supply and 
distribution, the group has the ability 
to react quickly to market changes. 
In addition, the development of 
a range of regional, national and 
specialist businesses provides 
the group with broad market 
penetration and the capability to 
manage the downside risk arising 
from a market contraction.
Competitor risk
The group operates across 
four geographical markets, 
each of which has a number of 
similar trading characteristics. 
Within each market, the group 
competes directly with a 
variety of regional and national 
distributors and manufacturers 
selling directly to its customer 
base and indirectly with multiple 
retail chains.
The emergence of a competitor 
with a strong business model 
could undermine the group’s 
growth objectives.
The group seeks to sustain its 
competitive position by maintaining 
close relationships with its supplier 
and customer base. Substantial 
and continued investment in 
management and facilities, an 
extensive product offering, a 
knowledgeable selling resource, 
product availability, IT, efficient 
material handling and logistics 
enables the group to continue to 
improve its market position.
Technology
The software platform is 
a vital component of the 
group’s operating strategy, 
underpinning the delivery of 
operational objectives and 
providing the framework for 
the maintenance of financial 
control. 
Given its importance, any 
prolonged system failure has 
the potential to adversely affect 
business performance.
Each business has its own dedicated 
hardware and failure in one will not 
interrupt another. Furthermore, the 
group operates well defined backup 
procedures and has contingency 
plans in place to enable swift 
recovery from a failure of this nature.

Area of risk
People
The group’s ability to deliver 
continued success is very 
dependent upon its people. 
An inadequate pool of 
suitably qualified and talented 
people can disrupt business 
development and undermine 
the group’s ability to deliver 
sustainable growth.
Recruitment, training and 
development are aimed at ensuring 
the group has suitably skilled and 
qualified people to meet the current 
and future operational needs of 
its businesses. Furthermore, the 
group is committed to creating 
opportunities for individuals to 
progress their careers.
Employee 
benefits
The costs associated with 
funding the group’s defined 
benefit plans continue to be 
affected by the volatility in 
investment returns, bond yields, 
inflation and an improving 
mortality trend. 
The group operates defined 
benefit plans in the UK and 
Switzerland.
 
As at 31 December 
2015, the UK plan deficit of 
£16.2 million represented 85% 
of the total group deficit.
 
An 
increase in the plan deficit 
could require the group to 
increase the deficit reduction 
contributions.
 
The group’s most recent triennial 
valuation of the UK plan was 
assessed as at 31 March 2014.
 
The 
trustees commissioned an annual 
update valuation as of 31 March 
2015; as a result of this valuation, it 
was agreed to decrease the deficit 
reduction contribution during 2016 
to circa £2.1 million. From 1 January 
2017, the annual deficit reduction 
contribution will be increased by 
3.3% each subsequent 1 January, 
with a view to eliminating the 
shortfall by 30 April 2019. The next 
triennial valuation will take place at 
31 March 2017.
The reduction in the annual UK 
contribution has been agreed by 
the company and trustee because 
the trustee is content with setting 
a deficit reduction programme 
over a longer time frame given the 
underlying financial strength of the 
company. 
Legislation and 
regulation
The group’s operations are 
regulated by a variety of laws 
and regulations, the principal 
ones relating to health and 
safety, the environment, 
employment, commerce, 
corporate, financial reporting 
and taxation. 
Failure to comply could cause 
reputational harm and lead 
to serious civil or criminal 
proceedings, causing disruption 
to the group’s operations and 
leading to financial loss.
The group manages its obligations 
through a framework of set policies 
and procedures and, where 
appropriate, engages the services of 
competent third–party advisers.

The stewardship and governance of 
your company is the responsibility of 
the board of directors, part of which 
includes the setting of the company’s 
strategic aims and values. Additionally 
it oversees the executive management, 
who carry out the operational 
running of the business, and report 
to shareholders on the company’s 
performance in compliance with the 
revised requirements of the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the 
“Code”) to make the Annual Report 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the group’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy.
We continue to believe that our 
board has the diversity and mix of 
skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge required in order for the 
company to be able to discharge its 
responsibilities successfully.
We seek by way of this report to 
explain how, through the membership 
and work of the board and its 
committees, the approach to ensuring 
board members have an appropriate 
understanding of the business and how 
the board considers its effectiveness, 
your company is directed and 
controlled. The report also explains the 
executive direction and control and 
our corporate governance structures 
and procedures which continue to 
change in response to changes in the 
rules that are in place at any point in 
time to ensure that they continue to be 
robust. We remain committed to high 
standards of corporate governance, 
which we consider to be essential to 
support sustainable growth and to 
protect shareholder value.
In this report we set out how the 
principles of the Code are applied, 
report on the company’s compliance 
with the Code’s provisions and provide 
an explanation where the provisions 
have not been complied with. The 
Code sets out guidance in the form 
of principles and provisions on how 
companies should be directed and 
controlled to follow good governance 
practice.
As applicable to the company, the 
board considers that it has complied 
with the provisions of the Code 
throughout the year ended 31 
December 2015 and up to the date 
of this report. The Code is available 
on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website (www.frc.org.uk).
The basis on which the group 
generates and preserves value over 
the longer term and the strategy for 
delivering the objectives of the group 
are to be found in the Strategic Report 
on pages 2 to 39.

Board of directors
The board is collectively responsible to shareholders for the proper management and success of the group. Its role is to 
provide entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of control which:
 ■ enables risks to be assessed and managed;
 ■ sets strategic aims;
 ■ ensures that the necessary financial and human resources are in place to meet its objectives;
 ■ reviews management performance;
 ■ sets the group’s values and standards; and
 ■ ensures that its obligations to its shareholders and others are understood and met.
As at 31 December 2015 the board consisted of two executive directors, Tony Brewer, Group Chief Executive, and Steve 
Wilson, Group Finance Director, and three independent non-executive directors, Dick Peters, Chairman, Andrew Eastgate 
and Philip Lawrence.
The board is supported in its role by the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees, all of which have written terms 
of reference, the details of which are set out below. 
The directors’ roles and membership of the committees are as set out on pages 42 and 43 in the directors’ biographies.
The biographies also document each director’s significant other commitments and any changes to these commitments that 
occurred during the year.
Directors’ attendance during the year at board meetings is set out on page 47, and meetings of the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees is given in the relevant committee report.
The board considers that it is beneficial for the executive directors to hold an external directorship to broaden their 
experience and normally this would be limited to one company. With effect from 31 January 2014, Steve Wilson was 
appointed a non-executive director of Conviviality Retail Plc.
The board considers the balance achieved between executive and non-executive directors during the year was appropriate 
and effective for the control and direction of the business.
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive are clearly divided and periodically reviewed by 
the board. Whilst collectively they are responsible for the leadership of the group, the Chairman’s primary responsibility 
is for leading the board and ensuring its effectiveness. The Group Chief Executive is responsible for implementing 
strategy, running the businesses in accordance with the objectives and policies agreed by the board and for the executive 
management of the group.
The Chairman communicates frequently with the non-executive and executive directors, and the non-executive directors 
have the opportunity to meet with and discuss any issues or concerns with the Chairman at any time throughout the year. 
Matters that are not specifically reserved for the board and its committees under their terms of reference or for shareholders 
in general meeting are delegated to the Group Chief Executive.
Corporate Governance Report
The directors bring strong judgement to the board’s

GOVERNANCE 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
Through the Nominations Committee, the board ensures that plans are in place for the succession of the executive and 
non-executive directors.
The board maintains overall control of the group’s affairs through a schedule of matters reserved for its decision which are 
periodically reviewed. These include, but are not limited to:
 ■ setting group strategy; 
 ■ corporate governance; 
 ■ risk management; 
 ■ board composition; 
 ■ succession planning; 
 ■ committee terms of reference; 
 ■ changes to capital structure and dividend policy;
 ■ approval of the business objectives and annual plan;
 ■ financial reporting and controls;
 ■ acquisitions and disposals;
 ■ authority limits for capital and other expenditure;
 ■ material treasury matters; and
 ■ health and safety.
The directors bring strong judgement to the board’s deliberations and the size, diversity and balance of skills and experience 
of the board are considered appropriate for the requirements of the business. The board believes that all three non-
executive directors are independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially 
interfere with the exercise of independent and objective judgement. In making this determination the board has considered 
whether each director is independent in character and judgement and whether there are relationships or circumstances 
which are likely to, or could, affect the director’s judgement. Andrew Eastgate, who served as the Senior Independent 
Director following the resignation of Mike O’Leary at the end of May, is available to shareholders if they have concerns which 
are not resolved through the normal channels of the Chairman, Group Chief Executive or Group Finance Director, or for 
which such contact is inappropriate. The non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus, share option or pension 
scheme of the company. They are initially appointed for a three-year term and, subject to review and re-election, can serve 
up to a maximum of three such terms.
In order to fulfil their duties, procedures are in place for directors to seek both independent advice and the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising the board, through the Chairman, on all governance 
matters.
The non-executive directors periodically meet without the Chairman present, and also meet with the Chairman without 
management present. 
All directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment by the board. 
Under the articles of association of the company, each of the directors is required to retire by rotation at least once every 
three years. 
Details of the directors retiring and seeking re-election at the forthcoming AGM are given to shareholders in the Notice 
of AGM.
Board information, induction, training and professional development
The board has a rolling agenda which is regularly updated in respect of specific topics that affect the group, including:
 ■ governance and best practice guidelines;
 ■ risk management;
 ■ finance and operational performance;
 ■ business development initiatives;
 ■ health, safety and environmental matters; and
 ■ legal and regulatory developments.
Corporate Governance Report
46 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
The board reviews the key activities of the business, receiving papers and presentations from executives and senior 
management generally a week in advance of the meeting. The Company Secretary is responsible to the board in respect of 
board procedures and is available to individual directors. In conjunction with the Chairman, the Company Secretary ensures 
that information distributed to the board is sufficient, clear and accurate, circulated in a timely manner, and is appropriate 
to enable the board to discharge its duties. All directors are equally accountable for the proper stewardship of the group’s 
affairs. However, the non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the 
executive directors are fully discussed and critically examined.
This enables the directors to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole, while having 
regard to, among other matters, the interests of employees, the fostering of business relationships with customers, suppliers 
and others, and the impact of the company’s operations on the communities and environment in which the business operates.
Board meetings and attendance
The board usually meets nine times a year at times that ensure the latest operating information is available for review and 
sufficient focus can be given to matters under consideration. During the year there is ample opportunity for the Chairman to 
meet with the non-executive directors without the executive directors being present, should this be deemed appropriate. 
In addition, directors have contact between meetings and, on occasions, visit trading locations in order to maintain contact 
with the group’s business. A record of directors’ attendance at board meetings held during the year is set out below and 
committee meeting attendance is given in the relevant committee report.

In addition to the nine principal board meetings held during 2015, there were two meetings which approved the 2015 Interim 
and 2014 Annual Report and Accounts. These meetings are constituted by a committee of the board formed for that sole 
purpose comprising the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, having considered the views of the whole board 
beforehand.
Directors’ interests and indemnity arrangements
At no time during the year did any director hold a material interest in any contract of significance with the company or any of 
its subsidiary undertakings, other than a third-party indemnity provision between each director and the company, and service 
contracts between each executive director and the company. The company has purchased and maintained throughout the 
year directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and its directors. The directors also have the benefit of the 
indemnity provision contained in the company’s articles of association. This provision extends to include the directors of 
Headlam Group Pension Trustees Limited, a corporate trustee of the company’s occupational pension schemes, in respect 
of liabilities that may attach to them in their capacity as directors of that corporate trustee. These provisions were in force 
throughout the year and are currently in force. Details of directors’ remuneration, service contracts and interests in the shares 
of the company are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Directors’ conflicts of interest
Procedures are maintained by the board whereby potential conflicts of interests are reviewed regularly. These procedures 
have been designed so the board may be reasonably assured that any potential situation where a director may have a direct 
or indirect interest which may conflict, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the company are identified and, where 
appropriate, dealt with in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the company’s articles of association. The board has 
not had to deal with any conflict during the period.
Induction and training
The induction of newly appointed directors includes background information about the group, directors’ responsibilities, 
board meeting procedures, a number of other governance–related issues and procedures for dealing in company shares. 
A briefing on the general group strategy, including visits to group businesses, is provided by the Group Chief Executive. 
Training and development in the year took various forms, including visits to group businesses and attendance at courses 
run by professional bodies on various commercial and regulatory matters. Directors receive regular updates appropriate 
to the business throughout the year aimed at developing and refreshing their knowledge and capabilities. All directors are 
considered to be suitably qualified, trained and experienced so as to be able to participate fully in the work of the board. To 
assist with the independent conduct of their function and, if required, in connection with their duties, a process is in place for 
the non-executive directors to obtain professional advice at the company’s expense.
Performance evaluation 2015
Last year, for the first time, the annual evaluation of the effectiveness of the board and its committees, as required by the 
Code, was externally facilitated by KPMG, the board determining that at least every third year the evaluation would be 
externally facilitated.
During the year, an evaluation of the board’s effectiveness, including the effectiveness of the board committees, was 
undertaken internally. This included consideration on how well the board measured against boardroom best practice, 
enhancing the effectiveness of the board, an evaluation of the performance of the board throughout the year and how the 
board perceived it had performed. It also included risk management and succession planning. In respect of the committees, 
the evaluation considered the performance of the respective committees throughout the year whether agendas covered the 
remits of the committees and the appropriateness of the respective committees’ remit. 
It concluded that the board and its committees continued to operate effectively, meeting the requirements and spirit of the 
Code. The Nominations Committee has access to the performance evaluation process and the Chairman has confirmed 
that Tony Brewer and Philip Lawrence, the two directors standing for re-election at this year’s AGM, continue to perform 
effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles. The board will continue to review its performance and that of its 
committees and individual directors on an annual basis and for 2016 the process will again include internal evaluation with 
externally facilitated evaluation in 2017.
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment
In accordance with the Code’s requirement that the board should consider whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, reviews are undertaken by the finance team as part of the year–end process.
The board receives drafts of the Annual Report and Accounts to allow sufficient time to review and provide an opportunity for 
challenge and discussion, ahead of approving the final documents. In addition, the external auditor reviews the consistency 
between the narrative reporting and financial disclosures.
Communication with shareholders
The company places considerable importance on communication with shareholders. When reporting to shareholders, the 
board aims to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the group’s financial position and prospects, reporting 
twice a year, when its half year and full year results are announced and respectively an interim and annual report is issued 
to shareholders. Additionally as necessary, the company issues a trading update in advance of the interim and final results 
announcements. Further information regarding business developments is available to investors on the group’s website: 
www.headlam.com.

The company has an ongoing programme of dialogue and meetings between the executive directors and institutional 
investors and analysts which cover strategy, trading and market conditions. Contact with the major shareholders is principally 
maintained by the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. During the year a number of meetings were 
held at certain of our businesses with the aim of providing shareholders with increased exposure to our operations and 
management. The Chairman ensures that the views of shareholders are communicated to the board as a whole.
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director have met with the company’s brokers during the year to ensure 
they are aware of the current views of major shareholders and of any material issues they may have. These reports include 
summaries on the market’s reaction to results announcements and the subsequent meetings between management and 
investors. External brokers’ reports on the company are circulated to all directors. The Senior Independent Director and 
the other non-executive directors are invited to attend presentations to analysts and institutional shareholders, in particular 
the annual and interim results presentations, the Chairman attending meetings with the representatives of the largest 
shareholders in the year. In February 2015, Buchanan was appointed financial and investor relations adviser with the objective 
of improving communication with stakeholders.
Board committees
The board has established Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees to oversee and debate important issues of 
policy and assist in attending to its responsibilities, with terms of reference that each comply with the provisions of the Code 
and are available on written request from the Company Secretary at the registered office or on the company’s website. The 
roles of the established Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees, whose membership is comprised of the three 
independent non-executive directors, with the Group Chief Executive additionally serving on the Nominations Committee, 
are set out below.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised of the three non-executive directors and was chaired by Philip Lawrence. The Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to the committee. Philip Lawrence trained as a chartered accountant and, for the purposes of the 
Code, is considered by the board to be independent and to have recent and relevant financial experience.
Further information on the activities of the committee is given in the Audit Committee Report on pages 52 to 57 which 
should be read in conjunction with this report.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of the three non-executive directors and was chaired during the year by Andrew 
Eastgate. It establishes, on behalf of the board, the remuneration policy, approves specific arrangements for the Chairman 
and the executive directors, and reviews and comments upon the proposed arrangements for senior management so as to 
ensure consistency within the overall remuneration policy and group strategy. Further information on the activities of the 
committee is given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 74 which should be read in conjunction with 
this report.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report also describes how the principles of the Code are applied in respect of remuneration 
matters and includes a statement on the company’s policy on directors’ and senior managers’ remuneration, benefits, share 
scheme entitlements and pension arrangements. The committee has an agenda linked to events in the group’s financial 
calendar, normally meeting at least twice a year, including meetings before the annual and interim results announcements. 
The committee met twice in the year, the three members each attending all meetings, during which it discharged its 
responsibilities as set out in its terms of reference and schedule of business for the year. The Chief Executive may, by 
invitation, attend Remuneration Committee meetings, except when his own remuneration is discussed. During the period 
no director was – and procedures are in place to ensure that no director is – involved in deciding or determining their own 
remuneration. A resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report will be proposed at the AGM.

Corporate Governance Report
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is comprised of the three non-executive directors and the Group Chief Executive and was 
chaired during the year by Andrew Eastgate.
The committee leads the process for identifying, and makes recommendations to the board on, candidates for appointment 
as directors and Company Secretary, giving full consideration to succession planning and the leadership needs of the 
group. It also makes recommendations to the board on the composition and chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. It keeps under review the structure, size and composition of the board, including the balance of skills, 
knowledge, experience and independence of the non-executive directors, and makes recommendations to the board with 
regard to any changes.
The committee meets when required and met twice in the year, with all members in attendance. Only members of the 
committee are entitled to be present at meetings but other directors may be invited by the committee to attend. The board 
has agreed the procedures to be followed by the committee in making appointments to the various positions on the board 
and as Company Secretary.
The committee has access to such information and advice, both from within the group and externally, at the cost of 
the company, as it deems necessary. This may include the appointment of external executive search consultants, where 
appropriate. No director is involved in any decisions regarding their reappointment or re-election.
New directors are appointed by the board and, in accordance with the company’s articles of association, they must be 
elected at the next AGM to continue in office. Existing directors retire by rotation in accordance with article 89 of the articles 
of association which require them to retire from office and, if eligible for reappointment, stand again at the third AGM after 
which they were appointed or last reappointed.
Items discussed by the committee during the year to enable it to discharge its duties in accordance with its terms of 
reference included the proposals to elect Philip Lawrence and re-elect Tony Brewer under the retirement by rotation 
provisions.
The committee, in conjunction with the board, receives updates from the Group Chief Executive on succession and 
development planning for senior positions within the group. Changes to directors’ commitments are reported to the 
committee as they arise and are considered on their individual merits. Appointments to the committee are made by 
the board.
Risk management and internal controls
The board recognises that the management of risk through the application of a consistent process is essential to ensuring 
a robust system of internal control. The principal risks and uncertainties facing the company have been identified in the 
Managing our Risk report on pages 38 and 39.
The group’s risk management processes seek to ensure sustainable development throughout the conduct of its business in 
a way which:
 ■ satisfies its customers;
 ■ maintains proper relationships with suppliers and contractors;
 ■ provides a safe and healthy workplace;
 ■ develops environmentally aware processes;
 ■ minimises the cost and consumption of increasingly scarce resources; and
 ■ maintains a positive relationship with the communities in which it operates.
50 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
The systems are designed to meet the group’s particular needs and to manage rather than eliminate risks, by their nature, 
providing reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The measures taken, including 
physical controls, segregation of duties and reviews by management, are considered by the board to provide sufficient and 
objective assurance.
The board maintained its process of hierarchical reporting and review during the year in order to evaluate the effectiveness 
of the group’s systems of financial and non-financial controls. A comprehensive series of operating and financial control 
procedures applying to all businesses has been developed and the group finance team performs monthly reviews to verify 
that the businesses are complying with the prescribed operating and financial control procedures. Additionally, the board 
reviews risk management arrangements and the Audit Committee receives reports from the external auditor on matters 
identified in the course of its statutory audit work.
These procedures provide a documented and auditable trail of accountability, the results of which are periodically reviewed 
for completeness and accuracy. These procedures allow for successive assurances to be given at increasingly higher levels 
of management through to the board. Planned corrective actions are monitored for timely completion. The board has not 
identified any failings or weaknesses, or been advised of any, which it has determined to be significant during the course 
of its review of the system of internal control. There were in addition no changes in the group’s internal controls or financial 
reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, the group’s systems of internal control.
A comprehensive planning system includes detailed reviews at all business and formal reviews and approval of annual 
plans by the board. Actual performance is measured on a monthly basis against plan and prior year, including a detailed 
explanation of significant variances. Revenue, gross margin and cash flow are reported on a daily basis against plan and prior 
year. The control procedures operated by the group are designed to ensure complete and accurate accounting for financial 
transactions and to limit the potential exposure to fraud. Guidelines for capital expenditure and investment appraisal include 
annual plans, detailed appraisal and review procedures, authority levels and due diligence requirements when businesses are 
acquired and the acquisition or disposal of a business requiring formal board approval.
These detailed reviews are an important aspect of management reporting in the identification of new and emerging risks. 
An ongoing process of risk management and internal control in accordance with the Code has been in place for the financial 
year under review and up to the date of this report, the careful management of risk considered to be a key activity in 
delivering business opportunities.
The ethos of the group, delegation of responsibility and other control procedures together with accounting policies and 
procedures are communicated through the group and employment handbook, supported by the group’s anti-bribery 
policy. The integrity and competence of personnel is assessed during the recruitment process and monitored throughout 
employment.
The group promotes a high standard of health and safety management at all levels supported by training programmes at 
operating businesses. Group health and safety rules are monitored and audited to promote a high level of awareness and 
commitment, with individual businesses assessed on a periodic basis. Remedial solutions are implemented where necessary, 
action plans and progress being monitored and reported.

Audit Committee Report
The three committee members, each considered to be independent, bring considerable experience to the matters 
considered, challenged and debated by the committee to effectively assess the external audit of the company and the 
internal control and risk management systems. Dick Peters and I are considered by the board to meet the requirements of 
the Code as having recent and relevant financial experience. 
The new requirements of the 2014 Code have been a significant focus for the committee this year, particularly the process 
by which the directors are able to confirm they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and consideration of the 
period over which the viability statement will apply.
To ensure that it remains appropriate and provides a robust assessment of the principal risks, the committee has reviewed the 
risk management framework and the assurance process, further details of which are set out below.
The committee also conducted an external audit tender, KPMG having been the company’s external auditor since 1992. 
The process met the recommendations in the associated guidance to conduct a fair and open process. Following the 
tender PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been recommended to the board to be appointed auditor with effect for the 
2016 financial year. Their proposed appointment as external auditor will be tabled to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. 
Further information is set out below.

Audit Committee Report
Key activities of the committee during the year
In addition to matters relating specifically to its terms of reference, agendas incorporate matters arising and topical items on 
which the committee has chosen to focus.
The work of the committee during the year principally fell under three main areas and is summarised in the table below.
Internal controls and risk External auditor Accounting, tax and financial reporting
Considered reports from the external 
auditor on their assessment of the 
control environment.
Considered and approved the audit 
approach and scope of the audit work 
to be undertaken by the external 
auditor and the fees for the same.
Reviewed the half year and annual 
financial statements and the significant 
financial reporting judgements.
Assessed the effectiveness of the 
group’s internal control environment.
Reviewed reports on audit findings. Considered the liquidity risk and the 
basis for preparing the group half 
yearly and full year accounts on a
going concern basis and reviewed the 
related disclosures in the annual
report and accounts.
Assessed the need for an internal audit 
function.
Considered the independence 
of the external auditor and their 
effectiveness.
Reviewed reporting disclosures in 
relation to internal controls, risk 
management, principal risks and 
uncertainties and the work of the 
committee.
Reviewed matters reported in 
accordance with the whistleblowing 
policy.
Conducted an external 
audit tender following which 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were 
recommended to the board to be 
appointed auditor with effect for the 
2016 financial year.
Reviewed and considered whether 
the annual report and accounts is 
balanced, fair and understandable, 
and provides information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the company’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy.
Considered the implications of the 
new requirements introduced in the 
2014 Code.
Drafting a viability statement that 
assesses the prospects of the group 
over an appropriate period. The 
committee considered that the group’s 
existing three year financial planning 
view makes that time period the most 
appropriate.
Significant issues considered by the committee
After discussion with both management and the external auditor, the committee determined that the key risks of 
misstatement of the group’s financial statements, consistent with prior year, related to:
 ■ impairment of goodwill;
 ■ impairment of property; and
 ■ inventory valuation.
These issues were discussed with management during the year and with the external auditor at the time the committee 
reviewed and agreed the external auditor’s group audit plan and also at the conclusion of the audit of the financial statements.
54 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
Impairment of goodwill
As more fully explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the group’s principal non-financial assets are grouped into cash 
generating units (“CGUs”) for the purpose of assessing the recoverable amount.
The group’s CGUs represent individual operating businesses, either in the UK or in Continental Europe. As set out in note 11 
to the financial statements, all CGUs to which goodwill is allocated, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS, are tested 
for impairment on an annual basis.
This year, the impairment reviews for the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated did not result in an impairment loss. 
In performing their impairment tests, management determined the recoverable amount of each CGU and compared this 
to the carrying amount. Management reported to the committee the results of its impairment assessment, noting to the 
committee that future cash flows for each CGU had been estimated based on the most up to date business forecasts or 
actual financial results and discounted using discount rates that reflected current market assessments of the time value of 
money and risks specific to the assets. Management highlighted to the committee how they arrived at the key assumptions 
to estimate future cash flows for the CGUs, specifically future growth rates and discount rates.
Management also brought to the attention of the committee the sensitivity analysis to be disclosed in note 11 to the financial 
statements with regard to the recoverable amount of the CGUs’ goodwill.
The committee interrogated management’s key assumptions to understand their impact on the CGUs’ recoverable amounts. 
The committee was satisfied that the significant assumptions used for determining the recoverable amount of CGUs to which 
goodwill is allocated had been appropriately scrutinised and challenged and were sufficiently robust.
Impairment of property
As set out in note 10 to the financial statements, the carrying value of freehold and long leasehold property in the group’s 
statement of financial position as at 31 December 2015 amounted to £91.6 million.
As set out in note 1 to the financial statements, the group has a policy of formally assessing the market value of the UK 
property portfolio every three years using independent, external valuation experts. The valuation performed in 2013 
indicated that the carrying value of the entire portfolio exceeded the market value by £15.2 million. Market value equates to 
fair value as defined by the Valuation – Professional Standards 2014 published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.
Across the portfolio there were circumstances where the market values of individual properties were higher or lower than 
the carrying value, dependent on the condition and location of each individual property. Where the carrying value of a 
property exceeded the market value, management considered this to represent an indicator of impairment and accordingly 
performed an impairment review for each CGU to which those properties belonged. The outcome of the impairment reviews 
indicated that the carrying value of those CGUs was supported by their ongoing value in use, and accordingly, no impairment 
adjustment was required.
In performing their impairment tests, management determined the recoverable amount of each CGU and compared this to 
the carrying amount. Management reported the results of its impairment assessment to the committee, noting that future 
cash flows for each CGU had been estimated based on the most up to date business forecasts or actual financial results and 
discounted using discount rates that reflected current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to 
the assets. Management highlighted to the committee how they arrived at the key assumptions to estimate future cash flows 
for the CGUs, specifically future growth rates and discount rates.
The committee interrogated management’s key assumptions to understand their impact on the CGUs’ recoverable amounts. 
The committee was satisfied that the significant assumptions used for determining the recoverable amount of the relevant 
CGUs had been appropriately scrutinised and challenged and were sufficiently robust.

Audit Committee Report
Inventory valuation
As set out in the statement of financial position, inventory amounts to £119.1 million and represents the group’s second 
largest asset class. Inventory is held across a broad and diverse product range which is subject to a risk that changes in 
consumer tastes and demand result in some inventory lines becoming slow-moving or obsolete, such that the recoverable 
amount is less than the carrying value.
The committee discussed the group’s management of its inventory position and gave careful consideration to the gross 
carrying value and related provisions. Management explained to the committee that the process of determining the 
appropriate valuation of inventory entailed close monitoring of inventory levels, review of the ageing profile and consideration 
of inventory sold for less than its carrying value. These three measures are reported to senior management on a monthly basis 
by individual businesses. Management uses this information to determine the provisions to be made against inventory.
The committee reviewed the valuation basis and challenged management’s assumptions. The committee was satisfied 
that the significant assumptions used for determining the valuation of inventory had been appropriately scrutinised and 
challenged and were sufficiently robust.
Other matters considered by the committee
Valuation of employee benefit liabilities
In the UK, the group operates a defined benefit pension plan, further details of which are set out in note 19 to the financial 
statements. At 31 December 2015, the scheme had assets of £86.6 million and liabilities, measured on an IAS 19 basis, of 
£102.8 million, with a net deficit of £16.2 million.
As set out in note 1 to the financial statements, the plan liabilities are calculated by estimating the amount of benefit that 
employees have earned for their service in current and future periods. This estimation requires making certain assumptions, 
notably in relation to inflation rates, mortality rates and the discount rate to apply to determine present value. The selection 
of these assumptions is subjective and small changes in these assumptions can materially impact the net IAS 19 deficit 
reported in the statement of financial position. The assumptions adopted by management are set out in note 19 to the 
financial statements.
In selecting the assumptions, management took advice from the group’s external actuary and considered the 
appropriateness of this advice in light of the specific circumstances of the UK plan. Management highlighted to the 
committee how they arrived at the key assumptions.
The committee reviewed management’s assumptions and were satisfied that they had been appropriately scrutinised and 
challenged and were robust. They also reviewed the sensitivity analysis set out in note 19 to the financial statements and 
consider it to be appropriate.
The committee considered the views and procedures of the external auditor, which entailed a benchmarking of 
management’s assumptions with the external auditor’s expectations.
Misstatements
Management reported to the committee that they were not aware of any material misstatements or immaterial misstatements 
made intentionally to achieve a particular presentation. The external auditor reported to the committee the misstatements 
that they had found in the course of their work and no material amounts remain unadjusted. The committee confirmed that it 
was satisfied that the external auditor had fulfilled their responsibilities with diligence and professional scepticism. 
After reviewing the presentations and reports from management and consulting, where necessary, with the external 
auditor, the committee was satisfied that the financial statements appropriately addressed the critical judgements and key 
estimates, both in respect to the amounts reported and the disclosures. The committee was also satisfied that the significant 
assumptions used for determining the value of assets and liabilities had been appropriately scrutinised and challenged and 
were sufficiently robust.
56 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
Internal audit
In accordance with the Code, the committee has undertaken an assessment of the need for a group internal audit function. 
The committee considers that the group’s control systems and associated procedures are adequate for the business and 
therefore does not currently propose to introduce a group internal audit function. The committee will continue to keep the 
matter under review.
External audit
The committee reviews annually the appointment and performance of the external auditor and considers their independence 
and objectivity taking into account all appropriate guidelines. Following a review of KPMG’s performance and independence 
in 2015, including compliance with rules on non-audit services, the committee was satisfied with the external auditor’s 
effectiveness and independence.
The committee assessed the ongoing effectiveness of the external auditor and audit process on the basis of meetings with 
executive directors. In reviewing the independence of the external auditor, the committee considered a number of factors 
which included the standing, experience and tenure of the external audit partner, the nature and level of services provided by 
the external auditor and confirmation from the external auditor that it had complied with relevant regulatory requirements.
The committee has the specific task of keeping the nature and extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditor 
under review in order to ensure that objectivity and independence are maintained. The external auditor has processes in place 
to ensure independence is maintained when providing non-audit services and has written to the committee confirming that, in 
its opinion, they remain independent within the meaning of the regulation on this matter and their professional standards.
In addition, the fees and objectivity of the external auditor were considered by the committee. The committee recognises 
that there are occasions when it is advantageous to use the external auditor to undertake non-audit services, where they are 
best placed to do so. The policy states that non-audit fees paid to the external auditor should not exceed 250% of the audit 
fee, except in the case of significant events. The Chairman of the committee is required to authorise non-audit work above a 
pre-agreed threshold. A breakdown of audit and non-audit fees is provided in note 3 to the financial statements.
The committee has independent access to the external auditor and the external auditor has direct access to the Chairman 
of the committee outside formal committee meetings. At each meeting there is an opportunity for the external auditor to 
discuss matters with the committee without executive management being present.
Audit tender
KPMG has been the company’s external auditor since 1992 with the lead audit partner changing every five years. Following 
the requirement to put the external audit contract out to tender at least every ten years in accordance with the 2012 edition 
of the Code, recent EU directives on auditor rotation and the length of their tenure, the committee decided to undertake 
an audit tender during 2015 and, due to their length of tenure, without inviting KPMG. A process commenced in September 
2015, with two firms shortlisted ahead of a final selection meeting with the committee in October 2015. In assessing the firms, 
consideration was given to their international strengths and capabilities relevant to our business and the markets within 
which we operate, the technical specialists that would be dedicated to the audit and the uniqueness of the audit approach 
and audit coverage of the group. The process met the recommendations in the associated guidance to conduct an open 
and fair process and, following the tender, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) has been recommended to the board to 
be appointed auditor with effect for the 2016 financial year. The committee recommends that shareholders appoint PwC as 
the group’s external auditor, in accordance with resolution 5 set out in the Notice of AGM, and authorises the directors to 
determine their remuneration, as set out in resolution 6.
Summary
The committee has concluded, as a result of its work during the year, that it has acted in accordance with its terms of 
reference and fulfilled its responsibilities. The committee Chairman will be available at the AGM to answer any questions on 
the work of the committee.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
THE CHAIRMAN’S ANNUAL STATEMENT
 ■ The directors’ remuneration policy, which was approved by shareholders and became effective at the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 21 May 2014. 
 ■ The annual report on directors’ remuneration, which sets out how the remuneration policy was applied during 2015. This 
report will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM in 2016. 
In 2013 the Remuneration Committee (the “committee”) undertook a review of the company’s remuneration arrangements 
which formed the basis of the remuneration policy as approved by shareholders in 2014. This year the committee concluded 
that the remuneration policy remained fit for purpose but that best practice developments required refinement of its 
operation of clawback provisions for performance based remuneration, as recommended by the recently revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code. With effect from 1 January 2015, the committee implemented a malus and clawback policy 
to enable the company to withhold and/or recover incentive payments in certain circumstances. Further details about malus 
and clawback are set out on page 63. The committee is satisfied that these refinements to the remuneration policy are in 
accordance with current best practice, do not exceed the authorised limits or payments permitted by the existing approved 
policy and overall are in the interests of shareholders. 
Headlam’s remuneration policy has been designed to incentivise performance through effective and appropriate reward. 
Levels of remuneration must allow the company to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executive managers and link their 
rewards to business performance, aligning their interests with those of shareholders. The committee recognises shareholders’ 
concerns and expectations on executive pay and shareholders are consulted as the remuneration policy is reviewed 
and developed. The committee has considered the salaries of the executive directors. In determining an appropriate 
remuneration package, the committee considers each individual’s experience and contribution in order to align reward with 
the future achievement of the business strategy. 
The committee continues to exercise a responsible approach to executive pay, key decisions on executive pay – including 
increases to salary and bonus payments – being made after consideration of similar decisions affecting all employees. For 
2016 the committee has agreed that the executive directors’ base salary be increased by 2.5%, in line with the cost of living 
increase awarded to all UK employees. The executive directors did not receive the cost of living increase of 2.5% that was 
granted to UK employees in 2015 and no cost of living increase was made in 2014 to any employee. 
The committee has also agreed to increase the executive directors’ minimum shareholding requirement in line with market 
practice to broadly two times base salary, effective from 1 January 2015. The executive directors both currently have 
shareholdings that are significantly in excess of their increased minimum shareholding requirements. 
After examination of current business strategy and guidelines for executive remuneration, the committee concluded that 
the existing framework remains appropriate. The long term incentive awards granted in 2012 for the 2012–2014 performance 
period have lapsed after confirmation that the performance conditions were not achieved. An award was made in the year to 
the executive directors under the co-investment plan, by reference to 25% of base salary.
Reflecting the trading performance in the year, which was above the financial target for the year, an award of 109% of base 
salary was made in respect of the annual performance related bonus scheme. 
The committee remains satisfied that overall progress has continued to be delivered. An assessment of progress included a 
review of the 2015 financial statements and took into account the reporting of the auditor to the Audit Committee.
The committee will continue to monitor the appropriateness and effectiveness of its policy with particular regard to 
legislative changes, market developments and business strategy and performance.
The committee is committed to delivering clarity and transparency of reporting whilst continuing its independent role, 
bringing logic and challenge to the process of setting remuneration. 
As its Chairman, I will be present at the AGM to answer any questions.
Andrew Eastgate 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
3 March 2016 
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present, for the year 
ended 31 December 2015, my first Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, which is presented in two sections: 
58 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
Introduction
This report is on the activities of the committee for the year ended 31 December 2015. It sets out the company’s 
remuneration policy and remuneration details for the executive and non-executive directors. 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (“Regulations”). It also meets 
the requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules. 
The report is split into three main areas, these being :
 ■ a statement by the Chairman of the committee;
 ■ a policy report; and
 ■ an annual report on remuneration.
The policy report was subject to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and, after receiving positive shareholder 
support, the policy took effect from the conclusion of the AGM. The annual report on remuneration provides details on 
remuneration in the year and includes other information required by the Regulations. It will be subject to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.
The Companies Act 2006 requires auditors to report to the shareholders on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and to state if, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Regulations. The following parts of the remuneration report 2015, which are identified as such, are audited: the single total 
figure of remuneration for directors, including annual incentive and long term incentive outcomes for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2015; long term incentives awarded during 2015; and directors’ shareholdings and share interests. The 
statement by the Chairman of the committee and the policy report are not subject to audit.
Policy report
This part of the report sets out the company’s policies on directors’ remuneration which were adopted by shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM, took effect from the conclusion of that AGM and have been applied in the current year. It will be subject to 
approval by shareholders by an ordinary resolution every three years, or sooner where the policy is revised.
This will be adhered to for the following year, the objectives of which continue to be to:
 ■ ensure that the business strategy is supported by the remuneration structure;
 ■ ensure that the remuneration structure motivates the executive directors to succeed and rewards them appropriately for 
their contribution to the attainment of the group’s strategic objectives;
 ■ maintain motivation for future achievement through reward schemes based on performance;
 ■ facilitate the building and retention of a high calibre and focused team;
 ■ align the executive directors’ interests with those of shareholders by offering participation in schemes which provide 
opportunity to build meaningful shareholdings in the company; and
 ■ facilitate effective succession planning.
In order to encourage and reward enhanced business performance and shareholder returns, the committee considers that a 
substantial proportion of the executive directors’ remuneration should be variable and performance related. The committee 
is satisfied that the incentive structure does not raise governance issues by inadvertently motivating or encouraging 
irresponsible or reckless behaviour.
In deciding that the current remuneration strategy remains appropriate for 2016, the committee has taken into account the 
group’s performance over the last year and the current economic environment. The remuneration policy will continue to be 
monitored and reviewed by the committee to ensure that the remuneration structure and associated performance measures 
remain appropriately aligned with the group’s strategic objectives.
The individual salary, bonus and benefit levels of the executive directors are and will continue to be reviewed annually by the 
committee. When reviewing base salaries, the committee takes account of the current economic climate, challenges facing 
the business and pay environment for employees in general.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
The committee is committed to open dialogue and receives periodic feedback from major shareholders and shareholder 
representatives which is considered as part of its annual review of remuneration policy and, if any material changes to the 
remuneration policy are contemplated, the committee would seek the views of major shareholders about these in advance.
The committee considers that in making smaller but more frequent awards under the long term incentive schemes, each 
subject to the attainment of specific performance targets over a three-year period, it further aligns the interests of directors 
with those of shareholders. During the year the committee did not consult directly with shareholders; however feedback was 
received on their views through investor meetings.
REMUNERATION POLICY 
Remuneration components
The current components of executive remuneration and how they are aligned with the overall business strategy are 
summarised in the table below.
Component Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Performance metrics, 
purpose and link to business 
strategy
Base salaries Core fixed remuneration 
reflecting the responsibility 
and scope of the role. 
Competitive salaries help 
the group to recruit, retain 
and motivate the best 
talent.
Reviewed annually and 
usually fixed for 12 months 
commencing 1 January, 
although there is no 
entitlement to an increase. 
Influenced by role, 
experience, individual’s 
contribution, overall 
performance and value to 
the business. 
Employees are not 
consulted when setting 
directors’ remuneration.
Movements determined 
by reference to cost of 
living increases to the 
workforce, prevailing 
market conditions, similar 
roles in companies 
of a comparable size, 
complexity and risk and 
increases in individual’s 
responsibility. 
Any increase is only 
implemented after 
careful consideration of 
individual contribution and 
performance. 
Annual 
performance 
bonus 
Rewards performance 
against stretching annual 
group profit before tax 
target which is aligned 
with the group’s strategic 
objectives. 
Target is set annually and 
any payout is determined

strategy
Share related 
benefits – 2008 
Co-Investment 
Plan (“CIP”) 
Incentivises delivery 
against company strategy 
over the medium term and 
aligns executives’ interests 
with strategic objectives. 
Medium term performance 
targets and share-based 
remuneration support the 
creation of sustainable 
shareholder value and 
growth. 
The committee intends to 
make any future long term 
incentive awards through 
the CIP . 
Under the CIP , nil 
cost option awards 
may be made with 
vesting dependent on 
the achievement of 
performance conditions, 
normally over a three-year 
period. 
Awards may vest early 
on a change of control 
or other relevant event 
subject to satisfaction 
of the performance 
conditions and prorating 
for time and may also 
vest early in “good 
leaver” circumstances, 
although the committee 
has discretion to increase 
the extent of vesting 
having due regard to 
performance over the 
period.
Maximum award of 75% of 
annual bonus in respect of 
any financial year with up 
to two for one matching. 
Vesting is dependent 
on achievement of the 
performance targets with 
straight-line matching 
between median (30%) 
and upper quartile (100%) 
for the TSR condition and 
between RPI +3%p.a. 
(30%) and RPI+6%p.a. 
(100%) for the EPS 
condition. 
80% of the award is 
subject to the EPS target 
and 20% to the TSR target. 
The committee reviews the 
performance conditions 
prior to making an award 
to ensure they are aligned 
to the group’s strategy, 
remain challenging 
and are reflective of 
commercial expectations. 
Executive directors must 
retain shares vesting in 
respect of the CIP for a 
period of five years.
Other benefits Ensure the overall package 
is competitive. Assist the 
group to recruit, retain and 
motivate. 
The group provides 
a company car, or car 
allowance, medical 
insurance and life 
assurance cover to its 
executive directors. 
Set at a level that the 
committee considers 
appropriate against the 
market and provides a 
sufficient level of benefit 
based on individual 
circumstances.

Malus and clawback
The Remuneration Committee approved amendments to the rules of the company’s Co-investment Plan, inserting malus 
(withholding) and clawback (recovery) provisions to take account of changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code in 
effect for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2014, market practice and corporate governance best practice. In 
accordance with the amendments, malus and clawback may be applied, at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion, until 
the third anniversary of relevant award shares becoming vested matching shares, in circumstances where there has been 
a material misstatement of the Company’s audited financial results, circumstances justifying the summary dismissal of an 
awardholder or where the Remuneration Committee in its reasonable opinion determines that any act or omission of the 
awardholder has caused or is reasonably expected to cause a material injury to the business interests or reputation of the 
Group, or that such action would be appropriate having regard to any other circumstances that involve the Group and/or 
the awardholder. Awards will be forfeited in accordance with remuneration policy in the event that a participant voluntarily 
terminates his employment and breaches restrictive covenants.
Illustration of application of remuneration policy
The charts below show the relative split of remuneration between fixed pay, comprising base salary and benefits, and 
variable pay, comprising annual bonus and CIP awards, for each executive director on the basis of minimum remuneration, 
remuneration receivable for performance in line with the company’s expectations, and maximum remuneration, not allowing 
for any share price appreciation.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
In illustrating the potential award, the following assumptions have been made.
Fixed pay Annual bonus CIP
Minimum performance Fixed elements of remuneration 
are base salary and benefits. 
No bonus No CIP vesting
Performance in line with 
expectations 
Base salary is the latest known 
salary effective from 1 January 
2016 and the value of benefits 
has been assumed to be 
equivalent to that included in 
the single figure calculation on 
page 66.
75% of base salary awarded for 
achieving target performance. 
30% of maximum award 
vesting for achieving threshold 
performance. 
Maximum performance Base salary is the latest known 
salary effective from 1 January 
2016 and the value of benefits 
has been assumed to be 
equivalent to that included in 
the single figure calculation.
125% of salary awarded for 
delivering at or above the 
highest performance in respect 
of target. 
100% of award vesting 
delivered for achieving 
the most stretching level 
of performance measures 
attached to the CIP awards.
Awards under the CIP are stated by reference to the share price at the 2015 year end.
No assumption as to share price growth is made in either the on-target or the maximum scenarios.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The principles which the company would apply when agreeing the various components of a remuneration package for 
the appointment of a new director would typically be to use the policy detailed in the table above to determine the 
executive director’s ongoing remuneration package. In determining appropriate remuneration, the committee will take into 
consideration all relevant factors including the quantum and nature of remuneration to ensure the arrangements are in the 
best interests of the company and its shareholders.
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
Contracts in respect of the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Finance Director are on a rolling 12-month basis. 
These were entered into on 11 October 2005 and are terminable by either the director or the company subject to 12 months’ 
written notice.
The non-executive directors do not have service agreements but instead are appointed for an initial period of three years 
by letter of appointment which is terminable by either party subject to one month’s notice, for which no compensation 
is payable. At the end of the initial period, the company discusses with the non-executive director whether they wish to 
renew their appointment and if it is in the best interests of the company for their appointment to be renewed. Such renewal 
would normally be for a further period of three years and subject to the same termination conditions. All appointments and 
subsequent reappointments are subject to approval by shareholders.
The executive directors’ contracts and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection at the 
registered office of the company during normal business hours on each business day.

The principles on which the determination of benefits on loss of office will be approached are summarised below.
Provision Treatment on loss of office
Payment in lieu of notice Payments to executive directors upon termination of their contracts will be equal to base salary plus the 
value of core benefits for the duration of the notional notice period. Benefits may include but are not 
limited to legal fees.
Annual bonus Payments to current executive directors upon the company terminating their contracts, other than in bad leaver 
cases such as gross misconduct, dishonesty, bankruptcy or failure to perform duties, will be equal to 
the average performance related bonus calculated by reference to the two immediately preceding financial 
years. The committee will, though, take note of the circumstances of their departure and their contribution 
to the business during the period in question. Any bonus amounts paid, as estimated by the committee, will 
typically be prorated for time in service to termination and will, subject to performance, be paid at the usual 
time. Contracts for future appointees will not include bonus within the termination provisions.
CIP Any award under the CIP would be determined based on the leaver provisions contained within the CIP 
rules. For good leavers, CIP awards will usually vest at the ordinary vesting point, be subject to performance 
conditions and be prorated for time. Good leavers are participants who leave as a result of retirement, fatality, 
ill health, injury or disability. In other circumstances CIP awards will lapse upon the cessation of employment. 
The committee retains the discretion to accelerate vesting and to waive prorating for time.
Change of control Upon a change of control, incentive awards will usually vest and be subject to performance conditions and 
prorated for time. The committee reserves the discretion to waive prorating for time.
Mitigation Payments upon the termination of executive directors’ contracts will be equal to base salary and other benefits 
for the duration of the notice period together with the average performance related bonus calculated by 
reference to the immediately preceding financial years. It is the company’s policy that any payments made to a 
director in the event of termination reflect the circumstances giving rise to termination and, where considered 
appropriate, the obligation of the outgoing director to mitigate his loss.
Accordingly, consideration is given to making compensation payments in instalments and is conditional on 
the leaver’s employment and earnings status. Full compensation, due to being a long-standing employee of 
the company, may however be merited in the event of unilateral termination of employment.
External appointments of executive directors
The board believes that experience of other companies’ practices and challenges is valuable both for the personal 
development of its executive directors and for the company. It is therefore the company’s policy to allow each executive 
director to accept one non-executive directorship of another company, provided that there is no conflict of interest, although 
the board retains the discretion to vary this policy. Fees received by executive directors in respect of external non-executive 
appointments are retained by the individual director. 
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
The remuneration policy is designed to ensure that executive directors are aligned to pursuing the company’s medium term 
strategic objectives.
Certain information provided in this part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report is subject to audit. This is annotated as

The figures in the single figure table are derived from the following:
Base salary and fees The amount of salary/fees received in the period.
Non-salary benefits The taxable value of benefits received in the period. These are car benefit, car fuel 
benefit, private medical insurance and other benefits deemed to be an employment 
benefit.
Company car allowances were unchanged year on year and the related taxable benefits 
were amended in accordance with HM Revenue & Customs guidance. However, in the 
latter part of the year, a new scheme was introduced offering a cash allowance in lieu of a 
company car. The two executive directors chose to accept the alternative cash allowance 
and relinquished the company car benefit, accepting in its place an annual taxable cash 
allowance of £14,000. This was expected to remain unchanged for a period of three years, 
at which time the car would be replaced and the level of allowance reviewed. Private 
medical insurance premiums reduced marginally for all eligible members of the scheme 
including the executive directors. The company also provides travel, accommodation and 
meals while on company business. The policy allows the company to provide any other 
benefits that are deemed to be an employment benefit by the relevant tax authority, or in 
certain circumstances are considered appropriate and reasonable by the committee.
Performance related pay The amount of performance related bonus received in the period.
Pension related benefits There was no provision.
Share-based incentive schemes The value of CIP awards that vest in respect of the financial period and the value of SAYE 
options granted in the financial period.
Individual elements of remuneration
Base salaries and fees
Base salaries for individual executive directors are reviewed annually by the committee and are set with reference to 
individual performance, experience and responsibilities as well as with reference to similar roles in comparable companies. 
For 2015, there was no increase in executive directors’ base salaries, which was at variance with the average 2.5% cost of 
living salary increase awarded across the group.
For 2016, the committee determined that it was appropriate for the executive directors to receive a cost of living increase to 
their base salary in line with the 2.5% average salary increase across the group.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed annually and reflect the responsibilities and duties placed on them whilst also 
having regard to market practice. There was no increase in 2014, however there was an increase in 2015 reflecting a 2.5% 
increase in fees and a change in responsibilities and duties. Following a review in late 2015 of base salaries applying to 
non-executive directors in the FTSE SmallCap indices, the executive directors concluded that the base salaries of the non-
executives were below the market rate. For 2016, the executive directors determined that the non-executive Chairman’s 
salary should increase to £110,000 and for the base salary of the other two non-executive directors to increase to £40,000 with 
an additional sum of £5,000 for holding the office of Audit or Remuneration Committee Chairman and an additional amount 
of £10,000 payable for holding the role of Senior Independent Director. 
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the group’s share incentive plans nor do they receive any benefits or 
pension contributions.

Performance related pay
Payments are calculated based upon achievement or exceeding a pre-set target for group profit before tax. For 2015, 
executive directors could earn a bonus equivalent to 75% of base salary on attainment of on-target performance which 
increased on a broadly linear basis up to a maximum of 125% of base salary for achieving a performance of 18% or more 
above the target. If actual performance is 90% of the financial target, a bonus of 10% of base salary will be awarded, 
however a bonus is not awarded for performance below 90% of target. Performance targets are set at the challenging levels 
of previous years with performance based upon group profit. The committee considers that the performance targets are 
commercially sensitive as they are linked to annual projections for 2016 and should therefore remain confidential to the 
company, otherwise providing an unfair advantage to the company’s competitors. 
The group achieved a profit before tax in 2015 of £35.6 million, which exceeded the financial target of £32.1 million and 
resulted in the executive directors being entitled to a performance related bonus of 109% of base salary, as disclosed in the 
directors’ remuneration table on page 66. 
Share-based incentive schemes
The committee recognises the importance of share incentives in recruiting and retaining directors and employees, on whose 
performance the success of the company depends. The share incentive arrangements also provide a key link between 
rewards to executive directors and senior executive management and the achievement of a sustained improvement in long 
term financial performance.
Shareholders have approved the following share-based incentive schemes:
 ■ Headlam Group Sharesave Scheme 2012
 ■ Headlam Group Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 2008
 ■ Headlam Group Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 2008 (“ESOS”)
 ■ Headlam Group Performance Share Plan 2008 (“PSP”)
 ■ Headlam Group Co-investment Plan 2008 (“CIP”)
The committee intends to use the CIP as the principal incentive vehicle for executive directors, with awards being made on 
an annual basis. Whilst awards have been made under the CIP , the committee has not yet implemented either the PSP or 
the ESOS and does not intend to do so during 2016. Details of the schemes will be disclosed in the event of an award being 
made under these schemes or plans.

Headlam Group Sharesave Scheme 2012
Employee share ownership is encouraged and, with the exception of non-executive directors, all employees are eligible to 
participate in the scheme. Options granted under the scheme may not normally be exercisable until the option holder has 
completed their three or five year savings contract, monthly savings currently being a minimum of £5 and a maximum of 
£500. Options may be granted at a price which represents a discount to market price at the date of grant of up to 20%. On 
5 May 2015, options were granted over 617,026 shares to 401 employees, including the executive directors, for savings terms 
of either three or five years at an option price of 340p per share, representing a 20% discount to the average market price of 
the three days immediately preceding the award.
Headlam Group Co-investment Plan 2008 (the “CIP”)
Participants may be invited, at the discretion of the committee, to take not less than 15% and up to 37.5% of their annual 
bonus in the form of shares, the number of shares allocated being calculated by reference to the net value of the bonus 
after deduction of income tax and employees’ national insurance. If an annual bonus award is not achieved in any year 
and therefore not available for investment in the CIP , the committee may permit participants to invest alternative funds but 
subject to a maximum of 50% of any bonus paid in the preceding year. In addition, instead of investing a bonus award or 
other funds, the participant may utilise shares already held. 
Participants are granted awards in the form of matching shares. The maximum value of the matching share award is twice 
the value of the shares that would have been acquired with the gross bonus award. It is currently intended that awards will 
be satisfied by the transfer of shares from an employee share trust, such shares having been acquired by the trust on the 
market to the extent required. Subject to the satisfaction in full or part of the relevant performance targets, an award will be 
exercisable between three and ten years after the award date.
Performance targets are measured over a fixed period of three years, beginning not earlier than the year in which an award 
is made, with 80% of the award determined by EPS growth targets and 20% by TSR targets as measured by reference to the 
FTSE SmallCap Index, of which the company is a constituent member.
CIP awards made to the executive directors on 1 May 2015 were subject to growth in performance conditions over a three year 
period, 80% in respect of EPS and 20% in respect of TSR. Awards vest on a sliding scale. If EPS growth is less than 3%, none 
of the EPS tranche shall vest, with 50% becoming exercisable if EPS growth over the three-year period is equal to 3%; and for 
100% of an award to vest, EPS growth must be equal to or exceed 6%, with straight-line vesting between 50% and 100%. 
With respect to TSR, vesting is determined by reference to the company’s relative position to the FTSE SmallCap indices. 
None of the TSR tranche shall vest if the company is ranked below the median level, with 50% vesting if the company is 
ranked at or immediately above the median level and 100% vesting if the company is ranked within the top quartile, with 
straight-line vesting between 50% and 100%.
In October 2015, the committee reviewed the performance criteria attaching to the CIP awards granted in October 2012, 
concluding that as the criteria had not been attained, awards were to lapse.
No share-based awards were made to the non-executive directors in the year. 
The Remuneration Committee approved amendments to the rules of the company’s Co-investment Plan, inserting malus 
(withholding) and clawback (recovery) provisions to take account of changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code in 
effect for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2014, market practice and corporate governance best practice. In 
accordance with the amendments, malus and clawback may be applied, at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion, until 
the third anniversary of relevant award shares becoming vested matching shares, in circumstances where there has been 
a material misstatement of the Company’s audited financial results, circumstances justifying the summary dismissal of an 
awardholder or where the Remuneration Committee in its reasonable opinion determines that any act or omission of the 
awardholder has caused or is reasonably expected to cause a material injury to the business interests or reputation of the 
group, or that such action would be appropriate having regard to any other circumstances that involve the group and/or 
the awardholder. Awards will be forfeited in accordance with remuneration policy in the event that a participant voluntarily 
terminates his employment and breaches restrictive covenants.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dilution
The committee is aware of, and supports, the ABI guidelines regarding dilution and regularly monitors compliance with these 
requirements. The committee included provisions which limit the number of newly issued shares which can be granted in a 
ten-year period to 10% of the issued share capital under all employee schemes and 5% under the discretionary share plans.
As at the date of this report, the company’s usage of shares against the limits detailed above in respect of the all employee 
schemes was 2% of the issued share capital and in respect of grants under discretionary plans was 0.4% of issued capital. It 
is the committee’s intention that options exercised under the SAYE scheme will be satisfied by shares held in treasury. With 
regard to the CIP , the committee will instigate market purchases of shares, through a trust, taking account of the likelihood of 
performance targets being met and also potential lapsing of awards because of leavers.
Further information on share-based payments is set out in note 20 to the financial statements.
Pension related benefits
No executive director has received any pension benefit during the current or prior year.
Payments to past directors
No payments were made to past directors in the current or prior year other than Mike O’Leary who received non-executive 
director fees earned up until the date of his retirement.
Payments for loss of office
No executive directors left the company during the year and therefore no payments were made to directors for 
compensation of loss of office in the current or prior year.
Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited)
In order to align their interests with the company’s shareholders, the committee is keen to encourage executive directors to 
increase their shareholdings in the company. An executive director is required to have a beneficial, including family, interest in 
the shares of the company excluding matching share awards granted in respect of the CIP equivalent in value to two times their 
annual base salary. Newly appointed directors are expected to build their interest over a five-year period. Executive directors’ 
shareholdings throughout the year complied with the shareholding requirement holding in excess of 200% of base salary.
Details of executive directors’ share interests are set out below, a description of which, together with relevant performance 
conditions, is given on pages 68 to 69.

The graph below shows the value at 31 December 2015 of £100 invested in the company on 1 January 2010 compared to 
the value of £100 invested in the FTSE SmallCap index, making the assumption that dividends are reinvested to purchase 
additional equity.
The FTSE SmallCap index has been selected as a comparator due to the company being a constituent member within 
the household goods and home construction sector. This allows comparison of the company’s performance against the 
performance of the index as a whole.

Consideration by the directors of matters relating to directors’ remuneration
The board has approved the terms of reference delegating certain responsibilities to the committee. The terms of reference 
are reviewed periodically, most recently in October 2015, and are available on the company’s website. 
The committee comprises the three independent non-executive directors and met twice during the year, with all three 
members present at the meeting. By invitation, the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director may attend meetings. 
No one attending a committee meeting may participate in discussions relating to their own terms and conditions of service 
or remuneration. 
The committee is responsible for selecting the framework and policy for executive directors’ remuneration and determining 
the remuneration packages for the executive directors and Chairman. In doing so, it takes note of any major changes in 
employee benefit structures throughout the group and ensures that executive director remuneration practice is consistent 
with any such changes. It is also responsible for monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior executive 
management and approving bonus payments.

Dear shareholder
As previously reported, this year saw a change to the board and 
committees. After nine years’ service, on 31 May 2015, 
Mike O’Leary retired from the board. 
I succeeded Mike as Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration and Nominations Committees. I was 
succeeded as Chairman of the Audit Committee by Philip Lawrence, who joined the board as a non-executive director on 
1 June 2015, at which time he also joined the Remuneration and Nominations Committees. 
Composition
The members of the Nominations Committee (“committee”) are the three non-executive directors, Dick Peters, Philip 
Lawrence and myself, and the Group Chief Executive, Tony Brewer. 
Responsibilities
The committee leads the process for identifying, and makes recommendations to the board on, candidates for appointment 
as directors and Company Secretary, giving full consideration to succession planning and the leadership needs of the 
group. It also makes recommendations to the board on the composition and chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. It keeps under review the structure, size and composition of the board, including tenure, the balance of skills, 
knowledge, experience and independence of the non-executive directors, and makes recommendations to the board with 
regard to any changes. 
Ahead of this year’s internal evaluation process, the committee met to consider the most effective method for the review of 
the board, its committees and the individual contribution of each director.
The committee meets when required and met twice in the year, with all members in attendance. Only members of the 
committee are entitled to be present at meetings but other directors and advisers may be invited by the committee to 
attend. The board has agreed the procedures to be followed by the committee in making appointments to the various 
positions on the board and as Company Secretary.
The committee has access to such information and advice, both from within the group and externally, at the cost of 
the company, as it deems necessary. This may include the appointment of external executive search consultants, where 
appropriate, although none were appointed in the year. No director is involved in any decisions regarding their own 
reappointment or re-election.
Terms of reference
Full terms of reference of the committee can be found in the investors section of the company’s website.
Diversity policy
Unchanged from prior years, we take note of the guidance provided and continue to make appointments on the basis of 
merit. However, we recognise the benefit that greater diversity can bring and take into account such factors when considering 
any particular appointment. Currently there are no female board members and no specific numeric target has been set. 
Re-election and evaluation
The committee considered the time required from each non-executive director, their effectiveness and the experience 
brought to the board. New directors are appointed by the board and, in accordance with the company’s articles of 
association, they must be elected at the next AGM to continue in office. Existing directors retire by rotation in accordance 
with article 89 of the articles of association, which requires them to retire from office and, if eligible for reappointment, stand 
again at the third AGM at which they were appointed or last reappointed.
Items discussed by the committee during the year to enable it to discharge its duties in accordance with its terms of 
reference included the consideration of candidates for a non-executive director role, the appointment of Philip Lawrence and 
proposals to elect Philip Lawrence and re–elect Tony Brewer under the retirement by rotation provisions.

completion of an internally prepared questionnaire, the performance of each board member continues to be effective and 
therefore shareholders are recommended to vote in favour of resolutions 3 and 4 at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.
The committee, in conjunction with the board, receives updates from the Group Chief Executive on succession and 
development planning for senior positions within the group. Changes to directors’ commitments are reported to the 
committee as they arise and are considered on their individual merits. Appointments to the committee are made by 
the board.
After review, the committee was satisfied that it continues to perform its duties in accordance with its terms of reference.

Other Statutory Disclosures
The directors present their report, together with the audited financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
This report, which has been prepared solely for the company’s shareholders, contains forward-looking statements which 
have been made by the directors in good faith based on the information available to them up to the time of their approval 
of the report and which should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties underlying such forward-looking 
information. No obligation is accepted by the company to update these forward-looking statements and nothing in the 
report should be construed as a profit forecast. 
Principal activities
The principal activities of the group are wholly aligned to the sales, marketing, supply and distribution of floorcovering and 
certain other ancillary products. The principal activity of the company is that of a holding company and its subsidiaries are 
listed on page 141. Further details of the group’s activities and future plans are set out in the Chief Executive’s Review on 
pages 6 to 7.
Acquisitions
Details of acquisitions made in the year are set out in note 23.
Results and ordinary dividends
The results for the year and financial position at 31 December 2015 are shown in the Consolidated Income Statement on 
page 89 and Statements of Financial Position on page 91.
An interim ordinary dividend of 6.00p per share (2014: 5.20p) was paid on 4 January 2016 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 4 December 2015. The directors propose a final ordinary dividend of 14.70p per ordinary share 
(2014: 12.30p), to be paid on 1 July 2016 to shareholders on the register of members at the close of business on 3 June 2016, 
the associated ex-dividend date being 2 June 2016.
This would bring the total ordinary dividend for the year to 20.70p per ordinary share (2014: 17.50p). The payment of the final 
ordinary dividend is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).
Share capital
As at 31 December 2015, the issued share capital of the company comprised a single class of ordinary shares of 5p each, with 
85,363,743 shares in issue at that date. The company’s ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. No shares 
were issued during the year and there were no additions to treasury shares. 
Of the 1,296,517 shares held in treasury at the start of the year, 390,866 were transferred from treasury in connection with the 
SAYE and executive share option schemes leaving 905,651 at the year end representing 1.06% of the issued share capital.
Proceeds received in respect of the 390,866 shares were £1,005,123. Details of the company’s share capital are set out in 
note 21 to the financial statements, which should be treated as forming part of this report.
Subject to the provisions of the articles and the Companies Acts, shares may be issued with such rights or restrictions as the 
company may by ordinary resolution determine or, if the company has not so determined, as the directors may decide. There 
are however no restrictions on the transfer of securities in the company, except that certain restrictions may from time to time 
be imposed by law or regulation, for example, insider trading laws, and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority (the Listing Rules), whereby certain employees require the approval of the company to deal in the company’s 
shares.
The company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities in the company.
Directors
The membership of the board and biographical details of the directors are given on pages 42 and 43 and are incorporated 
into this report by reference. 
The directors shall be not less than three and not more than eight in number, although the company may by ordinary 
resolution vary these numbers. Directors may be appointed by the company by ordinary resolution or by the board, a director 
appointed by the board holding office only until the next AGM of the company after their appointment, at which they are 
then eligible to stand for election.

Other Statutory Disclosures
There were two changes to the board in the year, no other person acting as a director of the company during the year.  
Mike O’Leary stepped down as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and retired from the board on 31 May 2015.  
Philip Lawrence was appointed to the board on 1 June 2015 when he assumed the chairmanship of the Audit Committee 
from Dick Peters. Andrew Eastgate was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and Senior Independent 
Director. 
The company’s Articles of Association (“articles”) give directors power to appoint and replace directors. Each new appointee 
to the board is required to stand for election at the next AGM following their appointment. In addition, the company’s 
articles of association require each director to stand for re-election at least once every three years.
Accordingly, Tony Brewer who retires by rotation and Philip Lawrence who retires at the first AGM following his appointment, 
and being eligible, offer themselves for re-election and election respectively at the forthcoming AGM. In proposing their 
re-election or election, the board confirms to shareholders that following evaluation, each of these individuals’ performance 
continues to be effective and they have expressed a willingness to continue in their roles.
The company does not seek to comply with the provision in the UK Corporate Governance Code which requires the annual 
re-election of all directors.
The company may by ordinary resolution, but subject to special notice, remove any director before the expiry of the director’s 
period of office. The office of a director shall be vacated if certain circumstances arise, as set out in the articles.
The table below shows the dates of appointment and the most recent re-election dates for directors.

Directors’ and officers’ indemnity insurance
The articles entitle the directors of the company, to the extent permitted by the Companies Act 2006, to be indemnified out 
of the assets of the company in the event that they suffer any expenses in connection with certain proceedings relating to the 
execution of their duties as directors of the company. In addition, and in common with many other companies, the company 
has insurance in favour of its directors and officers in respect of certain losses or liabilities to which they may be exposed due 
to their office.
Directors’ conflict of interests
No director had, at any time during the period under review, any interests in any contract with the company or any of its 
subsidiaries, a position which was unchanged at 3 March 2016.
Directors’ interests
The interests of the persons, including the interests of any connected persons who were directors at the end of the year, in 
the share capital of the company, and their interests under share option and incentive schemes, are shown on page 71.

Management of conflicts of interest
The company’s articles of association include certain provisions relevant to the activity of the board and its committees. 
These provisions include requirements for disclosure and approval by the board of potential conflicts of interest. It is the 
board’s view that they operated effectively during 2015. Each director has a duty to avoid a situation in which they have or 
may have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts or possibly may conflict with the interests of the company. This duty is in 
addition to the duty that they owe to the company to disclose to the board any interest in any transaction or arrangement 
under consideration by the company. If any director becomes aware of any situation which may give rise to a conflict of 
interest, that director informs the rest of the board and the board is then permitted to decide to authorise such conflict, the 
matter being recorded in the relevant board minutes.
Change of control
The company has entered into certain agreements that may take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of 
the company following a takeover bid. The significant agreements in this respect are the group’s term loan and certain 
of its employee share schemes. The group’s term loan facilities include a provision such that, in the event of a change of 
control, the lender may cancel all or any part of the facility and/or declare that all amounts outstanding under the facility are 
immediately due and payable by the company.
Outstanding options granted under the SAYE scheme may be exercised within a period of six months from a change of 
control of the company following a takeover taking place.
Matching share awards granted under the 2008 CIP may, proportionate to the performance period, vest within a period of six 
months from a change of control of the company. At the end of such period, awards will lapse and cease to be exercisable to 
the extent not exercised.
Details regarding directors’ service agreements are included within the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Rights under employees’ share schemes
As at 31 December 2015, Kleinwort Benson (Channel Islands) Limited (“Kleinwort Benson”), as trustee of the Headlam Group 
Employee Trust Company Limited (“Trust”) which acts as the trustee of the Headlam Group Co-investment Plan 2008 (“CIP”) 
and the Headlam Group Performance Share Plan 2008 (“PSP”), which was approved by shareholders on 20 June 2008, held 
224,941 shares, approximately 0.3% of the issued share capital of the company, on trust for the benefit of the directors and 
certain senior managers of the group. Kleinwort Benson waives the dividends payable in respect of these shares.
As at the same date, the Headlam Group Employee Trust Company Limited held 100,088 shares, approximately 0.1% of the 
issued share capital of the company, which may be used to fulfil the exercise of SAYE options, the dividend payable in respect 
of these shares similarly being waived.
Securities carrying special rights
There are no requirements for prior approval of any transfers and no person holds securities in the company carrying special 
rights with regard to control of the company.
Employees
The group recognises the value of its employees and seeks to create an energetic, dynamic and responsive environment in 
which to work. The company maintains a policy of employing the best candidates available in every position, regardless of 
gender, ethnic group or background, and is committed to fair and equal treatment. It places considerable importance on 
communications with employees which take place at many levels through the organisation and by a variety of means on both 
a formal and informal level.
Reward is linked to business plans and targets, thereby giving employees the opportunity to share in the financial success 
of the group. In keeping with the structure of the business, this policy is applied locally and, as a result, staff of all levels 
regularly benefit from achieving local targets.
Where existing employees become disabled, it is the group’s policy, wherever practicable, to provide continuing employment 
under normal terms and conditions and to provide training, career development and promotion wherever appropriate, 
and the group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons. Further details of 
arrangements relating to employees are described in Corporate Responsibilities on pages 22 to 27, and the average number 
of employees and their remuneration are shown in note 4 to the financial statements.
The company has communicated an internally operated whistleblowing policy and procedure to employees. The policy 
enables them to report any concerns on matters affecting the group or their employment without fear of recrimination, and 
reduces the risk of malpractice taking place and remaining unreported. In addition, the group does not tolerate matters of 
discrimination or harassment and bullying, and policies and procedures are in place for reporting and dealing with these 
matters.
Employees are encouraged to own shares in the company and the group operates an HMRC Approved Savings Related 
Share Option Scheme (SAYE). Those employees who choose to take up the option to purchase shares in the company may 
enter into a savings arrangement for either a three or five year period, with the option price determined by reference to 
the share price at the date of grant. On exercise the shares are purchased by the employee free of income tax and national 
insurance although capital gains tax rules apply.
The company considers that diversity, including gender diversity, is essential to good business and measures are in place to 
ensure all appointments are made on merit. Currently there are no female directors out of a total of five board members.
Without seeking to set a specific goal for female representation on the board, the company is committed to maintain 
diversity, including gender diversity, appropriate to and reflecting the nature and strategic aims of the company. This similarly 
applies to women in leadership positions in the company.
As at 31 December 2015 we had 2,311 employees of which 18% are female. The significant majority of our employees work 
regular full time hours with a minority working flexible hours.

So far as each director is aware, there is no audit information relevant to the preparation of the auditor’s report of which the 
auditor are unaware and each director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.

At the AGM on 21 May 2015, the company was given the authority to purchase shares in the company up to 10% of the

directors will be seeking to renew this authority for the company to purchase its ordinary shares at the forthcoming AGM.
Further details are set out in the Notice of AGM.

agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on voting rights. Further shareholder information is 
available on pages 151 to 152.
Amendment of articles
The company’s articles may only be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders.

This year’s AGM will be held at the group’s distribution facility in Coleshill on Friday 20 May 2016 at 10.00 a.m. The notice 
convening this meeting is set out within this Annual Report and Accounts on page 143, along with explanatory notes 
regarding the resolutions that will be proposed at the meeting on pages 145 to 147. The directors consider that each of the 
resolutions to be proposed is in the best interests of the company and the shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the directors 
unanimously recommend that all shareholders vote in favour of all resolutions, as the directors intend to do in respect of their 
own beneficial holdings.
Auditor
During the year the Audit Committee conducted an external audit tender in accordance with best practice guidance and 
recommended to the Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) be appointed as the Company’s auditor in place of 
KPMG LLP with effect from the forthcoming AGM. The Board approved the recommendation. Further information regarding 
the tender process is given in the Audit Committee Report on page 57.
As a consequence, KPMG LLP has notified the company that it is not seeking reappointment at the forthcoming AGM and 
PwC has agreed to be appointed in its place. The statement of circumstances required under section 519 of the Companies 
Act 2006 is reproduced in the Appendix to the Notice of AGM after the financial statements. 
In accordance with section 489 of the Companies Act 2006 and the recommendation of the Audit Committee, a resolution is 
to be proposed at the AGM for the appointment of PwC as auditor of the Company.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND 
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts and the group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
 
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.
 
Under 
that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.
 
In preparing each of 
the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 
 ■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 
 ■ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 
 ■ state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
 
 ■ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
 
They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website.
 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts and 
the financial statements
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 ■ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards,
 
and contained in this 
Annual Report and Accounts, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 ■ the Strategic Report, included in this Annual Report and Accounts, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.

TO THE MEMBERS OF HEADLAM GROUP PLC ONLY
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Headlam Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages 89 
to 140. In our opinion: 
 ■ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2015 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 ■ the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
 ■ the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 ■ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit were as follows:
Carrying amount of goodwill (£10.4 million): 
Refer to page 55 (Audit Committee Report), page 96 (accounting policies) and pages 111 to 112 (financial disclosures).
 ■ The risk –The determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill is a key judgment area as small changes in 
assumptions, notably in respect of the 2016 cash flow forecasts (e.g. forecast sales volume and gross profit margins), 
forecast growth and discount rates, can result in materially different outcomes. This is particularly true of the goodwill 
allocated to the Belcolor AG CGU in Switzerland where macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of the removal 
of the fixed exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the euro, could continue to adversely affect the performance and 
competitiveness of the business going forward, resulting in an impairment of goodwill.
 ■ Our response – Our audit procedures in this area included, among others, critically assessing the key assumptions 
applied by the group in determining the recoverable amounts of each Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) and testing the 
integrity of the group’s discounted cash flow model. We considered the appropriateness of the growth assumptions 
applied with reference to historical forecasting accuracy, comparison of forecast cash flows to those currently being 
achieved by the CGUs, and challenged the group’s justification for using any cash flows in their forecast that were higher 
than our expectations, based on current levels adjusted for known or probable changes in business environment. We 
used our own valuation specialist to assist us in evaluating the appropriateness of the discount rates applied to the CGUs 
in the UK and Switzerland. We performed our own sensitivity analysis, including assessing the effect of a reasonably 
possible reduction in growth rates and forecast cash flows. We also considered whether the group’s disclosures regarding 
the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment review to changes in key assumptions appropriately reflected the 
subjectivity in the valuation. 
Carrying amount of freehold property (£86.5 million): 
Refer to page 55 (Audit Committee Report), page 96 (accounting policies) and pages 111 to 112 (financial disclosures).
 ■ The risk – The group holds a number of freehold properties that are used for trading purposes (as distribution branches) 
in the UK and in Continental Europe. The carrying amount of the freehold property represents original cost less 
accumulated depreciation. The aggregate carrying value of the property portfolio exceeds its current market value, 
indicating that the carrying amount of the property may be impaired. 
 ■ Our response – Our audit procedures included, among others, comparing the carrying value of the group’s freehold 
properties to recent external market valuations prepared for the group by an independent expert. We used our own 
valuation specialist to assist us in evaluating the external market valuations, including assessing whether the most recent 
valuation remains an appropriate reflection of year end market value. Where the carrying amount of a property exceeded 
the external market valuation, we assessed the directors’ estimate of the value to be recovered from the ongoing use 
of the property within the cash generating unit to which it belongs, including testing the integrity of the model used to 
determine its value in use. We considered the appropriateness of the growth assumptions applied by comparing the 
forecast cash flows to those currently being achieved by the CGUs and challenged the group’s justification for using 
86 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
any cash flows in their forecast that were higher than our expectations, based on current levels adjusted for known or 
probable changes in business environment. We used our own valuation specialist to assist us in evaluating the discount 
rates applied. We also performed break even analysis in relation to key assumptions and considered whether the group’s 
disclosures regarding the outcome of the impairment review were appropriate.
Carrying amount of inventory (£119.1 million): 
Refer to page 56 (Audit Committee Report), page 96 (accounting policies) and pages 111 to 112 (financial disclosures).
 ■ The risk – The group holds a significant amount of inventory across a broad and diverse product range, which is subject 
to a risk that changes in consumer tastes and demand could result in some products becoming slow-moving or obsolete, 
such that they could not be sold or could only be sold for sales prices that are less than the current carrying value. This 
means there is inherent subjectivity and estimation required in determining the level of inventory provision required. 
 ■ Our response – Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the historical accuracy of management’s 
calculation of the provision with reference to the value of inventory sold at a loss or written off in the past. We considered 
the carrying amount, ageing profile and turnover of inventory to form our own expectation of the level of provision 
required, and challenged management’s provision with reference to our expectations. We used our own IT specialist 
to perform data analytics to determine the accuracy of the ageing profile of inventory by extracting data from the 
group’s accounting system and reproducing the aged inventory report. We also considered the adequacy of the group’s 
disclosures about the degree of estimation involved in arriving at the provision. 
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £1.78 million (2014: £1.80 million), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of group profit before taxation (of which it represents 5.0% (2014: 5.9%)).
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected misstatements exceeding £80,000, in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the group’s 11 reporting components, we subjected five to audits for group reporting purposes. These audits covered 
98% of group revenue, 99% of group profit before taxation and 95% of group total assets. The group audit team instructed 
component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information 
to be reported back. The group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from £0.1 million to £1.8 
million, having regard to the size and risk profile of the group across the components. 
The group audit team visited 14 locations in the UK and France. Telephone conference meetings were also held with the 
component auditors in Switzerland. At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to the group audit team were 
discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the group audit team was then performed by the component 
auditor.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
 ■ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; 
 ■ the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 ■ the information given in the Corporate Governance Report set out on pages 50 and 51 with respect to internal control 
and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent 
with the financial statements.
5 We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
 ■ the directors’ statement of viability on page 35, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the 
directors’ assessment and expectations of the group’s continuing in operation over the three years to 31 December 2018; or 
 ■ the disclosures in note 1 to the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Reporting entity
Headlam Group plc (the “company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
Statement of compliance
Both the company’s and the group’s financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“adopted IFRS”). On publishing the company’s 
financial statements here together with the group financial statements, the company is taking advantage of the exemption 
in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these 
approved financial statements.
The company and group financial statements were authorised for issuance on 3 March 2016.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements of the company and the financial 
statements of the group are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently to all years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
Judgements made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial 
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, are discussed below.
(a) Measurement convention
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the company’s functional currency. All financial 
information presented in pounds sterling has been rounded to the nearest thousand.
The company and group financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of derivative 
financial instruments and pension scheme assets, both of which are stated at fair value. Non-current assets held for sale are 
stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In determining the appropriate basis of preparation 
of the financial statements the directors are required to consider whether the group can continue in operational existence for 
a period no shorter than 12 months from the date of approval of the Annual Report.
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Chairman’s Statement on pages 4 and 5 and Chief Executive’s Review on pages 6 and 7. 
The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial 
Review on pages 30 to 34. In addition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its banking facilities. The group’s long term banking 
arrangements run to March 2017; its level of committed funds is £40 million. The group also has short term uncommitted 
facilities at £35 million, which are renewable on an annual basis. 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
a period no shorter than 12 months from the date of approval of the Annual Report. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
(b) Use of accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of 
the amount, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Statement of Financial Position date that may give rise to a material 
adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The group is committed to investing in new facilities where existing facilities fail to provide satisfactory customer service 
in a cost effective manner. When construction on a new facility commences, the existing facility is marketed for sale and 
this action can on occasion give rise to an adverse difference between carrying value and market value. At the Statement 
of Financial Position date, the assets have been reported at their carrying value. Market values are formally assessed for all 
properties on a triennial basis and compared with the carrying values.
At the latest review, carried out at 31 December 2013, the 2015 carrying value of UK freehold and long leasehold land and 
buildings would have exceeded market value (on an existing use basis) by £13,763,000. The directors consider that the 
carrying value of the UK freehold and long leasehold land and buildings is supported by their ongoing value in use within the 
business. An impairment review has been undertaken on the portfolio each year. No impairment was considered necessary in 
2015 or 2014. 
A review of the properties held in Continental Europe has been undertaken and no impairment was considered necessary for 
the years ended 31 December 2015 or 31 December 2014.
Goodwill impairment
The outcome of the group’s annual impairment test for goodwill is dependent on the forecast cash flows of each cash-
generating unit together with key management assumptions, which are subject to inherent estimation and uncertainty, 
including the discount rate and future profit growth. No impairment resulted from the annual impairment test for 2015 and 
2014 in the UK or in Continental Europe.
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised at the Statement of Financial Position date based on the assumption that there is a high 
expectation that the asset will be realised in due course. This assumption is dependent on the group’s ability to generate 
sufficient future taxable profits.
Inventory
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provision is calculated based on the ageing profile and 
consideration of inventory sold for less than its carrying value.
Employee benefits
The deficit relating to the group’s defined benefit plans is assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19 and after taking 
independent actuarial advice. The principal assumptions are set out in note 19. The amount of the deficit is dependent on 
plan asset and liability values and the actuarial assumptions used to determine the deficit. 
The assumptions include asset growth rates, pension and salary increases, price inflation, discount rate used to measure 
actuarial liabilities and mortality rates.
(c) Impact of newly adopted accounting standards
There have been no significant changes in accounting policies or any material impact on the group financial statements 
arising from the adoption of new accounting standards and interpretations in 2015.
96 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
(d) IFRS not yet applied
The following standards and interpretations, which were not effective as at 31 December 2015 and have not been early 
adopted by the group, will be adopted in future accounting periods:
 ■ International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ (effective 1 January 2017)
 ■ International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 ‘Financial instruments’ (effective 1 January 2018)
 ■ International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 16 ‘Leases’ (effective 1 January 2019)
 ■ Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38.
 ■ Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements – Amendments to IAS 27
 ■ Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS 1
 ■ Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2012–2014 Cycle. 
None of the standards above are expected to have a material impact on the group.
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate those of the company and its subsidiaries which together are referred to as the 
“group”. The company’s financial statements present information about the company as a separate entity and not about its 
group.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control exists when the group has power over an entity, is exposed or has 
rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the group’s financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group companies are 
eliminated in the group’s financial statements.
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Statement of Financial Position date are translated at the 
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the Statement of Financial 
Position date. 
The revenues, expenses and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate 
approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign subsidiaries are taken directly to the translation reserve and 
reflected as a movement in the statement of comprehensive income.
In respect of all foreign operations, any differences that have arisen after 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are 
presented as a separate component of equity.
Foreign currency exposure
Note 22 contains information about the foreign currency exposure of the group and risks in relation to foreign exchange 
movements.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Derivative financial instruments
The group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency, commodity and its interest rate risk exposures. 
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement when 
incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as 
described below. 
Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly 
in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are 
recognised in the income statement. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity remains there until the forecast transaction occurs. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, 
the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised. In other cases the 
amount recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or 
loss. 
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on third-party valuations. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by 
discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for 
a similar instrument at the measurement date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their market price at the Statement of Financial Position date, being the 
present value of the forward price. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value of forward exchange contracts is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. 
The fair value of the commodity transaction swap is based on third-party valuations. These quotes are tested for reasonableness 
by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using rates for a similar 
instrument at the measurement date.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of self-
constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset 
to a working condition for its intended use. Self-constructed assets begin to be depreciated from the date they become 
available for use.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items 
of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis. The annual rates applicable are:
Freehold and long leasehold properties – 2%
Short leasehold properties – period of lease
Motor vehicles – 25%
Office and computer equipment – 10%–33.3%
Warehouse and production equipment – 10%–20%
Land is not depreciated. 
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from 
disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on 
acquisition of subsidiaries. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents 
the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired.
Notes to the Financial Statements
98 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
Following the requirements of IFRS 3 revised, transaction costs associated with acquisitions and movements in contingent 
consideration are recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not 
amortised but tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when there is an indicator that the unit may be impaired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the 
amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable save that only separable intangibles were recognised and 
goodwill was amortised. This is in accordance with IFRS 1.
Other intangibles
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Intangible assets recognised as a result of a business combination are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition 
less cumulative amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible 
assets unless such lives are indefinite. Amortisation on customer lists is charged to administrative expenses in the income 
statement.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each Statement of 
Financial Position date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful 
lives of customer lists are deemed to be between one and 24 months. 
Non-current assets held for sale
A non-current asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than 
through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to the income statement. The same applies to gains and 
losses on subsequent remeasurement.
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less impairment losses. Debts 
are provided for, the credit loss allowance, on specific receivables in full as soon as they are known to be “bad” or it becomes 
apparent that payment is “doubtful”.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution. 
Allowances for inventory losses are determined by reference to each individual product and are calculated by assessing the 
age and quantity of each individual product.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of cash management of both the company and group are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose only of the Cash Flow Statement.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each Statement 
of Financial Position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount for goodwill is estimated at each Statement of Financial Position date.
For the purposes of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
flows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro 
rata basis. 
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of assets, with the exception of the group’s receivables, is the greater of their fair value less cost to 
sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount of the group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated 
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate, i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial 
recognition of these financial assets. Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer 
exist and there had been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and then are stated at amortised cost.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the group constructs qualifying assets. All other borrowing costs are written off to the 
income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs are charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.

Employee benefits
The company and the group operate both defined benefit and defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in 
independent trustee-administered funds. The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as 
incurred.
Defined benefit plans
The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to 
determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at the 
Statement of Financial Position date using AA rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of 
the group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is 
recognised as an expense in the income statement immediately. 
To the extent that any benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised directly in the income statement.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the group’s obligation in respect of a scheme are recognised 
immediately in reserves and reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future 
refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The group operates a UK defined benefit pension plan and a defined benefit plan in Switzerland. In the UK, there is no 
contractual agreement or stated group policy for allocating the net defined benefit liability between the participating 
subsidiaries and as such the full deficit is recognised by the company, which is the sponsoring employer. 
The participating subsidiary companies have recognised a cost equal to contributions payable for the period as advised by a 
professionally qualified actuary.
Share-based payment transactions
The company and group operate various equity-settled share option schemes under the approved and unapproved 
executive schemes and savings-related schemes.
For executive share option schemes, the option price may not be less than the mid-market value of the group’s shares at the 
time when the options were granted or the nominal value.
Further details of the share plans are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 68 to 69.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the 
period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the award. The fair value is measured at grant date and 
spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that 
vest except where forfeiture is due only to market conditions such as share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
When options are granted to employees of subsidiaries of the company, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an 
employee expense in the financial statements of the subsidiary undertaking together with the capital contribution received. 
In the financial statements of the company, the options granted are recognised as an investment in subsidiary undertakings 
with a corresponding increase in equity.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Repurchase of share capital
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, net of any tax effects is 
recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction 
from total equity. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase 
in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from retained earnings.
Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust
Transactions of the group sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are included in the Group Financial Statements. In particular, 
the Trust’s purchases of shares in the company are debited directly to equity.
Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration and excludes intra-group sales and value 
added and similar taxes. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
of the goods are transferred to the buyer (which is the date on which goods are received by the customer), the amount of 
revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to 
the group.
Lease payments
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
group. All other leases are treated as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of fair value at the date of 
acquisition or the present value of the minimum lease payments. The capital element of outstanding finance leases is 
included in financial liabilities. The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the income statement at a constant period 
rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities, finance leases, interest 
receivable on funds invested, foreign exchange gains and losses and gains and losses on hedging instruments as outlined in 
the accounting policy relating to derivative financial instruments and hedging described above.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established.
The group determines the net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability for the period by applying the discount 
rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then net defined benefit 
liability, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability during the period as a result of contributions and 
benefit payments.
Dividends
Interim and final dividends are recognised when they are paid or when approved by the members in a general meeting. Final 
dividends proposed by the board and unpaid at the end of the year are not recognised in the financial statements. 
Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the Statement of Financial Position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Notes to the Financial Statements
102 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary 
differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.
2 SEGMENT REPORTING
The group has 56 operating segments in the UK and five operating segments in Continental Europe. Each segment 
represents an individual trading operation, and each operation is wholly aligned to the sales, marketing, supply and 
distribution of floorcovering products. The operating results of each operation are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker, which is deemed to be the Group Chief Executive. Discrete financial information is available for each 
segment and used by the Group Chief Executive to assess performance and decide on resource allocation.
The operating segments have been aggregated to the extent that they have similar economic characteristics. The key 
economic indicators considered by management in assessing whether operating segments have similar economic 
characteristics are the products supplied, the type and class of customer, method of sale and distribution and the regulatory 
environment in which they operate.
As each operating segment is a trading operation wholly aligned to the sales, marketing, supply and distribution of 
floorcovering products, management considers all segments have similar economic characteristics except for the regulatory 
environment in which they operate, which is determined by the country in which the operating segment resides.
The group’s internal management structure and financial reporting systems differentiate the operating segments on the basis 
of the differing economic characteristics in the UK and Continental Europe and accordingly present these as two separate 
reportable segments. This distinction is embedded in the construction of operating reports reviewed by the Group Chief 
Executive, the board and the executive management team and forms the basis for the presentation of operating segment 
information given below.

In the UK the group’s freehold properties are held within Headlam Group plc and a rent is charged to the operating 
segments for the period of use. Therefore, the operating reports reviewed by the Group Chief Executive show all the UK 
properties as unallocated and the operating segments report a segment result that includes a property rent. This is reflected 
in the above disclosure.
Each segment is a continuing operation.

11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS – GROUP CONTINUED
Impairment
Each year, or whenever events or a change in the economic environment or performance indicates a risk of impairment, the 
group reviews the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash-generating units. 
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or CGU to their recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount represents the higher of the CGU’s fair value less the cost to sell and value in use. Where the recoverable 
amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results. During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no 
impairment charge resulting (2014: No impairment).
Value in use was determined by discounting the future cash flows generated from the continuing use of the CGU on a basis 
consistent with 2014, and applying the following key assumptions.
Key assumptions
Cash flows were projected based on actual operating results, the approved 2016 business plan and management’s 
assessment of planned performance in the period to 2020. For the purpose of impairment testing the cash flows were 
assumed to grow into perpetuity at a rate of 2.5% beyond 2020.
The main assumptions within the operating cash flows used for 2016 include the achievement of future sales volumes and 
prices for all key product lines, control of purchase prices, achievement of budgeted operating costs and no significant 
adverse foreign exchange rate movements. These assumptions have been reviewed in light of the current economic 
environment.
The directors have estimated the discount rate by reference to an industry average weighted average cost of capital. This 
has been adjusted to include an appropriate risk factor to reflect current economic circumstances and the risk profile of the 
CGUs. A pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.1% (2014: 8.7%) has been used for impairment testing, adjusted to 
12.0% (2014: 9.8%) for Continental Europe to reflect the differing risk profile of that segment. The pre-tax discount rate has 
been applied to the pre-tax cash flows. 
The CGUs in the UK have similar characteristics and risk profiles, and therefore a single discount rate has been applied to 
each UK CGU. Similarly, the directors view the CGUs in Continental Europe as having consistent risk profiles and therefore a 
single risk factor has been applied. The CGUs in Continental Europe operate under a different regulatory environment and 
this is therefore reflected in the risk factor used to determine the discount rates in the UK and Continental Europe.
Sensitivity analysis
The group has applied sensitivities to assess whether any reasonable possible changes in these key assumptions could cause 
an impairment that would be material to these consolidated financial statements. The sensitivity analyses did not identify any 
material impairment risks with the exception of the goodwill attributed to Belcolor.
Belcolor
The key assumptions used in the Belcolor impairment review relate to the 2016 budgeted cash flows and the future growth 
rates assumed thereafter. The budget for 2016 assumes a 151% increase in operating profit (equivalent to a 1% increase in 
sales) compared with 2015. Subsequently the calculations assume future annual growth in operating profit of between 1.5% 
and 2.5%, resulting in calculated headroom of £1.5 million. A reduction of 15% in the 2016 budgeted operating profit would 
reduce the headroom to zero. In the event that 2016 budget is achieved but there is no subsequent growth, a goodwill 
impairment charge of £0.2 million would arise. The carrying value of goodwill of £3.3 million would be fully impaired if the 
2015 operating profit recurred in 2016 and there was no forecast future growth thereafter.

On 8 March 2012 the group refinanced the terms of its banking facilities. The refinancing increased the availability of 
committed facilities from £30 million to £40 million, and extended the availability to four years. On 15 January 2013 an option 
was taken to extend this by an additional year in line with the facility agreement and the renewal date is now March 2017. 
Uncommitted facilities were maintained at £35 million, renewable on an annual basis.

The group has undrawn borrowing facilities expiring in one year or less which, at 31 December 2015, amounted to 
£61,706,000 (2014: £62,883,000). The facility conditions for drawdown had been met during the period. The borrowing is 
unsecured and there is a cross guarantee in place between the company and its UK subsidiaries. There is a downstream 
guarantee from the company in relation to its borrowing facility in the Netherlands.
The undrawn borrowing facilities are as follows:

All the borrowing facilities above bear interest at floating rates, however the group entered into two interest rate swaps on 11 
June 2012 to fix £20 million of its sterling denominated borrowings. The swaps are due to mature on 8 March 2016. The Swiss 
facility may be drawn as an overdraft or fixed rate loan with different rates depending on the term and amount.

19 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
During the year, the group operated a UK and Swiss defined benefit plan and defined contribution plans in the UK, France 
and the Netherlands. 
UK defined benefit plan
The Headlam Group plc Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme is the principal defined benefit plan which provides pensions in 
retirement and death benefits to members. The majority of members are entitled to receive pensions from age 65, equal to 
either 1/50 or 1/60 of final salary for each year of service that the employee provided, depending on which section of the plan 
the member is part of.
The plan is a registered scheme under UK legislation and is contracted out of the State Second Pension. The plan is legally 
separated from the company and assets are held independently of the company’s finances. 
The plan is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in UK legislation.
The company has a right to a refund of any surplus in the plan if the plan winds up, after payment of expenses, members 
benefits and any enhancements to the members’ benefits as the Trustee sees fit. In addition, if the assets of the plan exceed 
the estimate by the actuary of the cost of buying out the benefits of all beneficiaries with an insurance company, including 
the associated expenses, and the plan is not being wound up, then the company may request a payment of the excess funds. 
There have been no payments made to the company out of the plan’s assets over the year, and so no additional liability has 
been recognised on the balance sheet.
The plan was established from 11 February 1983 under trust and is governed by the plan’s Trust Deed and Rules dated 26 
March 2015. The Trustee of the plan comprises two employee representatives and three employer representatives. The 
Trustee of the plan is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants. The Trustee is responsible for the 
operation and the governance of the plan, including making decisions regarding the plan’s funding and investment strategy 
in conjunction with the company.
The ultimate cost of the plan to the company will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made. Many 
of the assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost of the plan may be higher (or lower) 
than disclosed.

The plan exposes the company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, market (investment) risk and 
currency risk. The risk to the company is that the assumptions underlying the disclosures, or the calculation of contribution 
requirements, are not borne out in practice and the cost to the company is higher than expected. This could result in higher 
contributions required from the company and a higher deficit disclosed. More specifically, the assumptions not being borne 
out in practice could include:
 ■ The return on the plan assets being lower than assumed, resulting in an unaffordable increase in the required company 
contribution rate.
 ■ Falls in asset values not being matched by similar falls in the value of liabilities. 
 ■ Inflation being higher than that assumed, resulting in an increase in the value of the members’ benefits and therefore a 
higher cost to the plan.
 ■ Unanticipated future changes in mortality patterns leading to an increase in the plan’s liabilities. Future mortality rates 
cannot be predicted with certainty. 
 ■ The potential exercise of options against the plan, for example taking early retirement or exchanging a portion of pension 
for a cash lump sum.
There have been no amendments, curtailments or settlements made to the plan during 2015.
The plan’s investment strategy is to invest broadly 90% in return seeking assets and 10% in matching assets, mainly 
government bonds. This strategy reflects the plan’s liability profile and the Trustee’s and company’s attitude to risk. The 
matching fund seeks to match the return achieved on the liabilities.
The plan’s investments include interest rate and inflation hedging.
The plan holds a number of annuity policies which match a portion of the pensions in payment.
The scheme is funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from the company at rates advised 
by professionally qualified actuaries. The last scheme funding valuation of the plan was as at 31 March 2014 and revealed a 
funding deficit of £10,883,000. The trustees of the scheme commissioned an annual update valuation as at 31 March 2015 
and this reported an increase in deficit from £10,883,000 to £14,211,000. The main factors that have combined to produce this 
change in the position since the last formal valuation are shown in the table below:
£000
Shortfall as at 31 March 2014 (10,883)

Contributions paid to repair the shortfall 2,929
Change in the market conditions (16,295)
Miscellaneous (12)
Estimated shortfall as at 31 March 2015 (14,211)
The main annual rate assumptions used by the actuary in the 2014 valuation were: increase in salaries 4.8%; increase of 
pensions in payment 3.3%; discount rate before retirement 5.46%; discount rate after retirement 3.71%; and inflation 3.3%. 
Assets were taken at their market value at the valuation date. 
The main annual rate assumptions used by the actuary in the 2015 annual update valuation were: increase in salaries 4.8%; 
increase of pensions in payment 3.3%; discount rate before retirement 4.24%; discount rate after retirement 2.49%; and 
inflation 2.96%. 
In the recovery plan dated 26 March 2015 the company has agreed to pay contributions of £175,000 per month from 1 
January 2016, increasing by 3.3% each subsequent 1 January, with the view to eliminating the shortfall by 30 April 2019. 
Notes to the Financial Statements
118 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
In accordance with the recovery plans dated 29 July 2011 and 26 March 2015, payments were made to the plan during 2015 
of £2,925,000 towards the deficit. The company is expected to pay contributions of £3,301,000 over the next accounting 
period. This includes £2,171,000 for payments under the recovery plan and £1,130,000 for the accrual of benefits.
In addition to the recovery payments, under the schedule of contributions dated 29 July 2011, company contributions were 
fixed at 28.9% of pensionable salaries at 1 July 2011, increased by 3.4% per annum, with no allowance made in respect of 
subsequent leavers. This represented an additional contribution amounting to approximately £43,000 during 2015 (2014: 
£276,000). The new schedule of contributions dated 26 March 2015 came into force on 1 April 2015, and under this company 
contributions are based on 35% of pensionable salaries each month.
In addition, the company is expected to meet the cost of administrative expenses and insurance premiums for the plan. 
The liabilities of the plan are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members of the plan over 
the next 60 years or more. The weighted average duration of the liabilities is approximately 20 years.
During 2010, the UK Government announced a move to adopting Consumer Price Inflation (“CPI”) rather than Retail Price 
Inflation (“RPI”) as the basis for inflation assumptions underpinning retirement benefit obligations. The directors have 
considered this change and associated guidance. Having taken advice, the company has determined that RPI remains 
the appropriate basis for measuring its obligations, such that the change announced has had no impact on the group’s 
retirement benefit obligations.
Swiss defined benefit plan
The plan provides occupational retirement, disability and survivors’ benefits. The members are entitled to receive pensions 
from age 64 (female) or 65 (male), equal to the old age savings balance multiplied with a conversion rate of 6.8% for the 
mandatory part of the savings balance and 5.85% for the part beyond the mandatory part. The minimum interest rate on old 
age savings has legally been fixed. 
The company is affiliated to the Columna Collective Foundation Client Invest. The plan is legally separated from the 
company. The executive body of the collective foundation is the board of trustees, which is elected directly by the insured 
of the affiliated companies/occupational benefits funds and functions independently of AXA. Its members include employer 
and employee representatives from a wide range of occupations and companies of different sizes. The board of trustees’ 
responsibilities include, among other things, supervising compliance with legal provisions and issuing the regulations that 
govern the various activities. The company elects an occupational benefits fund commission (“OBC”). The Foundation was 
established on 20 March 1974 by Credit Suisse Ltd. 
The collective foundation is reinsured for risk benefits with AXA Winterthur Life insurance company. 
The plan exposes the company to market (investment) risk. The risk to the company is that return on assets may be lower 
than legally required. This could result in higher contributions required from the company and a higher deficit disclosed. 
There have been no amendments, curtailments or settlements made to the plan during 2015.
The OBC defines the investment strategy; the affiliated occupational benefits fund itself bears the investment risk. The 
investments are managed with Credit Suisse. 
The last (provisional) scheme funding valuation of the plan was as at 31 December 2015 and revealed cover ratio of 116.36% 
(overfunding). This overfunding is appropriate to Swiss legislation and cannot be considered in the context of IAS 19. 
According to Swiss rules there is no need to evaluate the scheme using assumptions for future changes of salary increase, 
benefit increase or inflation. 
The last IAS 19 valuation at year end 2015 revealed a funding deficit of £2,517,000. The group is expected to pay £656,000 for 
future service costs over the next accounting period. 
The liabilities of the plan are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members of the plan over 
the next 50 years or more. The weighted average duration of the liabilities is approximately 17 years.

Defined benefit obligation
In the UK there is no contractual agreement or stated group policy for allocating the net defined benefit liability between 
the participating subsidiaries and as such the full deficit is recognised by the company, which is the sponsoring employer. 
The participating subsidiary companies have recognised a cost equal to contributions payable for the period as advised by 
a professionally qualified actuary. The company recognises a cost equal to its contributions payable for the period net of 
amounts recharged in relation to the group deficit to the participating subsidiary companies.

The group operated an employment indemnity scheme in connection with a foreign subsidiary undertaking to provide for 
lump sum cash payments due to employees retiring on their normal retirement date. The present value of the retirement 
indemnity obligation at 31 December 2015 is £332,000 (2014: £287,000). This was reported as other long term employee 
benefits within the employee benefits disclosure. 
Total group pension costs
Included within the total staff costs as disclosed in note 4 are costs relating to the group’s defined contribution plans. The 
pension cost for the year represents contributions payable by the group to the plans and amounted to £2,785,000 (2014: 
£2,587,000). Contributions amounting to £166,000 (2014: £157,000) in respect of December 2015 payroll were paid in January 
2016.
The total group cost of operating the plans during the year was £4,958,000 (2014: £3,733,000) and, at 31 December 2015, 
there was an amount of £321,000 (2014: £296,000) owed to the plans, being employer and employee contributions due for 
December 2015, which was paid in January 2016.

Group and company
Executive directors and executive management currently participate in executive share option schemes. The option price 
may not be less than the greater of the mid-market value of the group’s shares at the time when the options were granted 
or the nominal value. Options granted under the 1998 Inland Revenue approved scheme are normally exercisable between 
the third and tenth anniversaries of their date of grant, subject to the movement of the group’s basic earnings per share 
exceeding RPI over the relevant period.
Options granted under the 1998 unapproved scheme are normally exercisable between the third and seventh anniversaries 
of their date of grant. Awards are subject to the movement of the group’s basic earnings per share exceeding RPI between 
3% and 5% per annum respectively over the relevant period.
Additionally, the group operates a savings-related share option scheme (“Sharesave scheme”) which is open to employees 
subject to eligibility criteria determined by the directors prior to each option grant. The most recent grant was on 5 May 2015 
when employees with over one month’s service were invited to participate. 
The group also operates a 2008 HMRC approved scheme, a 2008 unapproved scheme, the Headlam Group Performance 
Share Plan 2008 and the Headlam Group Co-Investment Plan 2008. Further details of these schemes and plans are given in 
the Remuneration Report on pages 68 and 69.

The weighted average share price for options exercised during the year was 468.5p (2014: 414.3p).
The options outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range of 0.0p to 420.0p and a weighted average 
contractual life of 2.6 years.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share 
options granted. In order to estimate the fair value of the services received the company uses an appropriate option pricing 
model, either the Black–Scholes or the Monte Carlo option pricing model.
It is expected that the options will be exercised as soon as they reach maturity. 
The expected volatility is based on historic volatility calculated over the weighted average remaining life of the share options.

21 CAPITAL AND RESERVES CONTINUED
Reserves
Other reserves
Other reserves as disclosed on the Statement of Financial Position comprise the capital redemption reserve, translation 
reserve, cash flow hedging reserve and treasury reserve. For the company this also includes a special reserve.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of shares repurchased and cancelled during 2007.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
foreign subsidiaries.
Cash flow hedging reserve
The cash flow hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow 
hedging instruments relating to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Treasury reserve
The treasury reserve comprises the cost of the company’s shares held by the group.
Special reserve
The special reserve arose on the issuance of shares in connection with acquisitions made by the company in earlier years. 
22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The main financial risks arising in the normal course of the group’s business are credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risks 
arising from interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. This note presents information about the group’s exposure to 
each of the above risks, the group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks and the group’s 
management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.
Credit risk and credit quality 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations and arises principally from the group’s trade receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset and, as at the Statement 
of Financial Position date, in the directors’ opinion there were no significant concentrations of credit risk likely to cause 
financial loss to the group. 
The group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations 
are performed on all new customers requiring credit and these are frequently reviewed by management to limit exposure. 
Businesses must obtain central approval from executive directors or senior executive management for credit limits in excess 
of £10,000. The group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The credit control procedures described above, coupled with the diversified nature of the group’s trade receivables, lead the 
directors to believe that there is limited credit risk exposure and that the credit quality of these assets is robust.
Other receivables comprise amounts due to the group which historically have been received within three months of the year 
end. The directors have considered the inherent risk profile of other receivables at the year end and are of the view that this 
historical experience will prevail for the foreseeable future and accordingly consider the credit quality of these assets to be 
robust.
Cash and cash equivalents represent deposits with reputable financial institutions in the UK and Continental Europe and 
hence, the directors consider the credit quality of cash and cash equivalents to be robust.

All other receivables and derivative financial assets are not past due (2014: not past due).
The company had trade receivables of £nil (2014: £nil).

Based on historic default rates, the group believes that no general impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade 
receivables; however, the group provides fully for specific debts when required. During the year the group’s impairment loss 
as a percentage of revenue amounted to 0.24% (2014: 0.17%).

22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The group’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when 
due, with sufficient headroom to cope with abnormal market conditions. As at 31 December 2015 cash and cash equivalents 
covered the amounts of borrowings maturing in the next 12 months with a net positive liquidity of £63,932,000 (2014: 
£47,385,000). Details of the total facilities that the group has access to are given in note 17.

The value of the group’s and company’s financial liabilities as detailed above at 31 December 2015 and 2014 were not 
materially different to the carrying value. Fair values were calculated using market rates, where available. Where market 
values are not available, fair values have been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using prevailing interest 
rate curves. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the Statement of 
Financial Position date.

22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Interest rate risk
The company and group are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on their borrowings and cash deposits. Borrowings are 
principally held in sterling and euros at both fixed and floating rates. Deposits are in sterling, euros and Swiss francs at 
floating rates. 
Floating rate borrowings are linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate and Euribor Over Night Index Average. The 
group adopts a policy of reviewing its floating rate exposure to ensure that if interest rates rise the effect on the group’s 
income statement is manageable. In accordance with this policy, and in order to manage its exposure to UK interest rates, 
the group entered into two interest rate swaps in 2012 to fix £20 million of its sterling denominated borrowings. These 
interest rate swaps were designated as a hedging instrument and accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with the 
requirements of IAS 39. The cash flows will occur over the period to 8 March 2016.
The fair value of these interest rate swaps are included in the Statement of Financial Position as a £30,000 derivative liability 
(2014: £132,000).
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

A change of 100 basis points in the interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit or

Commodity risk
The company and group are exposed to the commodity risk of rising fuel prices. On 1 November 2015, in order to manage 
this risk the group has entered into a hedging instrument that is a two year commodity transaction swap. The risk hedged 
is the diesel fuel price risk, being the change in fuel price payments on the specified diesel consumption. The notional 
amount is 6,768 metric tons, under which a fixed diesel price of £348.25 per metric ton is paid monthly and the floating price 
according to Platts European is received.
The fair value of this diesel commodity swap is included in the Statement of Financial Position as a £485,000 derivative 
liability. 
Notes to the Financial Statements
134 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
Foreign currency risk
The group and company are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates arising from transaction currency cash flows 
and the translation of the results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily 
the euro, Swiss franc and US dollar.
The group and company use forward exchange contracts to hedge their foreign currency transactional risk. A future foreign 
currency contract would be entered into where there was a known requirement for the currency due to planned imports 
that are not invoiced in the functional currency of the acquiring company. These forward exchange contracts would have 
a maturity of less than one year after the Statement of Financial Position date. The group also enters into foreign currency 
contracts at spot rate where the amounts are not frequent or material. Gains and losses on currency contracts recognised as 
an asset as at 31 December 2015 amounted to £40,000 (2014: asset of £2,000).
For the 12-month period to 31 December 2015, 1.6% (2014: 3.8%) of the group’s operating profit was derived from overseas 
subsidiaries and at 31 December 2015, 17.4% (2014: 16.0%) of the group’s net operating assets related to overseas subsidiary 
operations. Hedge accounting, following the adoption of IFRS, has not been applied to these operations.
The group and company do not use derivatives other than as described above.

Sensitivity analysis
A 10% weakening of sterling against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased/(decreased) profit or

Fair values hierarchy
The financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised according to their valuation method. The different levels have 
been defined below:
 ■ Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 ■ Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly, 
as prices or indirectly, derived from prices.
 ■ Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The group has two interest rates swaps used for hedging which were fair valued in accordance with level 2 for the year ended 
31 December 2015 (2014: level 2) and forward currency contracts which were fair valued in accordance with level 2 (2014: level 
2). 
Fair values
The carrying amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position for financial instruments are a reasonable approximation 
to fair value.
Trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents
Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost due to the short term maturity of the instrument.
Borrowings, other financial assets and other financial liabilities
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values. Where market values are not available, fair values 
have been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves. Amounts denominated 
in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the Statement of Financial Position date.
Capital management
The group views its finance capital resources as primarily comprising share capital, bank loans and operating cash flow.
The board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business. The board closely monitors its shareholder base, dividend yield and earnings per 
share. In the medium term the group aims to maintain a dividend cover of 1.6 times.
The board encourages employees of the group to hold the company’s ordinary shares. The group operates a number of 
employee share option schemes. In previous years the company has acquired a number of its own shares under a share 
buy-back programme, and some of these shares have been used for issuing shares under the group’s various share option 
incentive schemes. 
Certain of the company’s subsidiaries are required to maintain issued share capital at levels to support capital adequacy 
requirements prevailing in the legislative environment in which they operate.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends made payable to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
On 8 March 2012, the group completed a refinancing of its banking facilities. The new facilities comprise a £40 million 
committed facility and a £35 million uncommitted facility. This represents an increase in total available facilities of £10 million. 
The uncommitted facility, coupled with cash generated from operations, is used to fund the group’s ongoing working capital 
requirements. The committed facility is in place to support the group’s strategic investment plans.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 
2014.

Prior year acquisitions
On 2 July 2014, a group subsidiary company acquired the business and certain assets of Kalm Investments Limited.
Kalm Investments has two trading entities: RPS Flooring based in Mansfield and Mytton Flooring based in Norwich, both 
being suppliers to independent floorcovering retailers in their areas. Cash consideration was paid of £331,000. Since its 
acquisition the businesses have contributed revenue of £1,458,000 and a loss of £22,000 to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the year ended 31 December 2014. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2014 group 
revenue would have been an estimated £638.3 million and profit after tax would have been an estimated £23.9 million.

The book value of receivables given in the table above represented the gross contracted amounts receivable. At the 
acquisition date the entire book value of receivables was expected to be collected.
No goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of the business and certain assets of Kalm Investments Limited. The intangible 
assets on acquisition were attributed to customer order books.
Following acquisition, it is the group’s normal practice to implement its operational and financial procedures and standard IT 
systems.
Furthermore, acquired businesses gain access to the group’s extensive product ranges and benefit from enhanced sales 
and marketing investment. These changes typically enable acquired businesses to enhance the service provided to their 
customers and ultimately, develop and grow.
Whilst acquired customer order books are a key component at the point of acquisition, this position quickly dissipates 
during the post acquisition period. The dynamic and renewable nature of this class of asset is the reason the group elects to 
amortise it over a period of one to 24 months, the precise period being dependent upon the size of the acquired business.

(b) that, subject to paragraph (c), all existing authorities given to the directors pursuant to section 551 of the Act be 
revoked by this resolution; and

before the expiry of the authority pursuant to which such offer or agreement was made.
9. Disapplication of pre-emption rights

AGM if passed (or, if earlier, at the close of business on 30 June 2017), save that the company may, before such 
expiry, make an offer or agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry 
and the directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of any such offer or agreement as if this power had not 
expired; and

This year’s AGM will be held at the group’s distribution facility at Gorsey Lane, Coleshill, Birmingham B46 1JU on Friday  
20 May 2016 at 10.00 a.m.
A description of the resolutions that will be proposed at the meeting is set out below.
Resolutions 1 to 8 inclusive are proposed as ordinary resolutions which means that for each of these resolutions to be passed, 
more than half the votes cast must be cast in favour of the resolution. Resolutions 9 to 11 inclusive are proposed as special 
resolutions, which means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast must be 
cast in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 1 – Annual Report and Accounts
The company is required by law to present to shareholders at the AGM its audited accounts and the directors’ and 
independent auditor’s reports for the financial year ended 31 December 2015. Shareholders are invited to vote to receive and 
adopt the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Resolution 2 – Declaration of ordinary dividend
The directors recommend the payment of a final ordinary dividend of 14.70p on each of the ordinary shares entitled thereto, 
which, together with the interim ordinary dividend of 6.00p, gives a total ordinary dividend of 20.70p for the year ended  
31 December 2015. Subject to approval of the declaration of the final ordinary dividend at the AGM, the final ordinary 
dividend will be paid on 1 July 2016 to the holders of ordinary shares whose names are recorded on the register of members 
at the close of business on 3 June 2016.
Resolution 3 – Election of Philip Lawrence as a director
Philip Lawrence was appointed to the board on 1 June 2015, at which time he was also appointed to the Nominations, Audit 
and Remuneration Committees. In accordance with the company’s articles of association, he offers himself for election at the 
forthcoming AGM. Philip is the Chief Executive of the Coal Authority, prior to which he held significant roles with Marconi plc 
and Deloitte & Touche having trained as a chartered accountant after attaining a BSc in Mathematics. 
In accordance with the recommendations of the combined code relating to non-executive directors, the board believes that 
Philip Lawrence should be elected and makes such a recommendation to shareholders. 
Resolution 4 – Re-election of Tony Brewer as a director
Tony Brewer is retiring by rotation in accordance with the company’s articles and is offering himself for re-election by 
shareholders. Under the articles of association, directors are required to retire every three years. Tony was appointed an 
executive director in June 1991, becoming Managing Director of the Floorcoverings Division in 1992 and Group Chief 
Executive in November 2000. The board believes that Tony Brewer should be re-elected and makes such a recommendation 
to shareholders. 
Resolution 5 – To appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s Auditor
An auditor must be appointed at every Annual General Meeting at which accounts are presented to the shareholders. 
Following a tender process, which is described in the report on the activities of the Audit Committee set out on page 57 of 
the company’s Annual Report and Accounts, KPMG LLP is not seeking reappointment.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has advised its willingness to stand for appointment as auditor of the Company. The Board 
recommends the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP following recommendation by the Audit Committee, which 
has considered the circumstances of the change of auditor.

Resolution 6 – Agreement of auditor remuneration
In addition to the company’s requirement to appoint an auditor, shareholder authority is sought for the directors to 
determine the remuneration to be paid to the auditor for the period of appointment.
Resolution 7 – Directors’ Remuneration Report
Shareholders are being asked to approve the 2015 Directors’ Remuneration Report, which gives details of the directors’ 
remuneration for the period ended 31 December 2015 and is set out on pages 58 to 74 of the company’s Annual Report and 
Accounts. Whilst the payment of remuneration to the directors is not dependent on the passing of the resolution, the board 
will take the vote into account when considering the future development and operation of the company’s remuneration 
policy and practice. As required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, KPMG LLP has audited those parts 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report capable of being audited and their report can be found on pages 86 to 88 of the 
Annual Report and Accounts.
SPECIAL BUSINESS – RESOLUTIONS 8 TO 11
Resolution 8 – Authority to allot shares
Shareholders are being asked to pass the necessary resolution to grant to the directors a general authority, for the purpose 
of section 551 of the Companies Act 2006, to allot relevant securities. With due regard to the ABI guidelines and to 
comments received from shareholders, the proposed general authority, similar to last year, is to allot up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £620,000 representing 12,400,000 ordinary shares (15% of the company’s ordinary share capital (excluding 
treasury shares) in issue at 3 March 2016). As at 3 March 2016, the company held 905,651 treasury shares, which represented 
approximately 1.1% of the company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares), which the company can cancel or hold 
for sale or use to meet the obligations under the company’s employee share schemes. 
This authority will lapse at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2017, or, if earlier, on 30 June 2017. The directors consider 
that this authority is desirable to allow the company to retain flexibility, although they have no current intention of exercising 
this authority except in connection with the company’s employee share schemes.
Resolution 9 – Disapplication of pre-emption rights
Shareholders are being asked to pass a resolution to empower the directors to allot equity securities, or sell treasury shares, 
for cash as if section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 (which gives shareholders certain pre-emption rights on the issue of 
shares or rights to subscribe for or convert securities into shares) did not apply to any such allotment. The resolution allows 
the issue or sale of shares of up to an aggregate nominal amount of £620,000 representing 12,400,000 ordinary shares in 
respect of rights issues and other issues pro rata to existing entitlements, and also allows issues or sales for cash (other than 
in relation to a rights issue) limited to shares having an aggregate nominal amount of £213,000 (5% of the company’s ordinary 
share capital in issue at 3 March 2016). The authority will lapse at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2017 or, if earlier, 
on 30 June 2017. 
The directors confirm that they have no present intention of exercising this authority.
In accordance with The Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles available at www.pre-emptiongroup.org.uk, the 
directors also confirm their intention that no more than 7.5% of the issued share capital of the company (excluding treasury 
shares) will be issued for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis during any rolling three-year period.

146 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
Resolution 10 – Purchase of own shares
The directors believe that it is in the interests of the company and its members to continue to have the flexibility to purchase 
its own shares and this resolution seeks authority from members to do so. The directors intend only to exercise this authority 
where, after considering market conditions prevailing at the time, they believe that the effect of such exercise would be 
to increase the earnings per share and be in the best interests of shareholders generally. The effect of such purchases 
would either be to cancel the number of shares in issue or the directors may elect to hold them in treasury pursuant to the 
Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares) Regulations 2003 (“the Regulations”). The Regulations enable 
certain listed companies to hold shares in treasury, as an alternative to cancelling them, following a purchase of own shares 
by a company in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Shares held in treasury may subsequently be cancelled, sold for cash or used to satisfy share options and share awards under 
a company’s employee share scheme. Once held in treasury, a company is not entitled to exercise any rights, including the 
right to attend and vote at meetings in respect of the shares. Further, no dividend or other distribution of the company’s 
assets may be made to the company in respect of the treasury shares.
This resolution renews the authority given at the AGM held in 2015. The authority is in respect of 10% of the company’s 
issued ordinary share capital as at 3 March 2016 and will lapse at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2017 or, if earlier, 
on 30 June 2017. The resolution specifies the maximum and minimum prices at which the shares may be bought. If the 
company buys any of its shares under the authority proposed by resolution 10, the board will decide at the time whether to 
cancel them immediately or hold them in treasury. The purchase of shares will be dependent on market conditions and will 
also take into account the cash generated in the business and other investment opportunities that may arise over time.
During the year the company made no purchases of its own shares.
Details of share options outstanding and treasury share movements including details of own shares acquired by the company 
are shown respectively in notes 20 and 21 to the financial statements.
Resolution 11 – Shareholder Rights Directive
This will be proposed as a special resolution to approve the holding of general meetings, other than AGMs, on 14 days’ 
notice. Although the company’s articles currently permit this, the Shareholder Rights Directive requires a shareholder 
resolution to be passed to authorise general meetings to be held on 14 days’ notice. Without the passing of resolution 
11, the minimum notice period under the regulations would be 21 days. If resolution 11 is passed by the shareholders, 
the regulations would only allow the company to call a general meeting on 14 days’ notice if it were to make a system of 
electronic voting available to its shareholders in respect of the meeting in question. The directors consider it to be in the best 
interest of shareholders to pass resolution 11, which is a repeat of the same resolution passed at the AGM in 2015, in order 
to prevent being constrained by the regulations implementing the directive. It will be necessary for a similar resolution to be 
put to shareholders at each subsequent AGM. It is intended that this flexibility will only be used for non-routine business and 
where merited in the interests of shareholders as a whole.

Notes 1 to 17 below give further explanation as to the proxy, voting and attendance procedures at the AGM.
1. Entitlement to appoint proxies
A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is also entitled to appoint a proxy or proxies to attend, speak and vote 
instead of him.
A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise 
the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A proxy need not be a member of the company.
Appointment of a proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting in person at the meeting. To appoint more 
than one proxy, a member must complete a photocopy of the enclosed proxy card or obtain additional forms from our 
registrars, Capita Asset Services, telephone 0871 664 0300 (Calls cost 12p per minute plus your phone company’s access 
charge. Calls outside the United Kingdom will be charged at the applicable international rate. Capita are open between 
09:00 - 17:30, Monday to Friday excluding public holidays in England and Wales). Please also indicate by ticking the relevant 
box if the proxy appointment is one of multiple appointments being made.
Multiple proxy appointments should be returned together in the same envelope. Enter in the box provided the number of 
shares in relation to which your proxy is authorised or leave the box blank to authorise your proxy to act in relation to your full 
voting entitlement.
2. Appointing proxies
To be effective, the instrument appointing a proxy and any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed 
(or a notarially certified copy of such power or authority) must reach Capita Asset Services, Proxies Department, The Registry, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting. A form of 
proxy is enclosed with this Notice.
3. Electronic proxy appointment through CREST
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so by using the procedures described in the CREST manual (available via www.euro-clear.com/CREST). CREST personal 
members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), 
should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action on their 
behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (“Euroclear 
UK & Ireland”) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST 
manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction 
given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID 
RA10) by the latest time for the receipt of proxy appointments specified in note 2 above. For this purpose, the time of receipt 
will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by CREST application host) from which 
the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time 
any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other 
means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK 
and Ireland does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timing and 
limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST proxy instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST 
member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed 
a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be 
necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those 
sections of the CREST manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST systems and timing.
The company may treat as invalid a CREST proxy instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.

4. Joint holders
In the case of joint holders of a share the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be 
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For this purpose seniority is determined by the order in 
which the names of the holders stand in the register of members in respect of the joint holding.
5. Entitlement to attend and vote
Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the time by which a person must be entered 
on the register of members in order to have the right to attend and vote at the AGM is 6.00 p.m. on 18 May 2016 or, if the 
meeting is adjourned, 6.00 p.m. on the date two days before the date for the adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on 
the register of members after that time will be disregarded in determining the right of any person to attend or vote at the 
meeting.
6. Corporate representatives
Corporations may appoint one or more corporate representatives who, on its behalf, may exercise all of its powers as a 
member.
7 . Nominated person
If you are a person who has been nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy nomination rights (a 
“Nominated Person”) you may, under an agreement between you and the member of the company who has nominated you, 
have a right to be appointed (or have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the meeting. If you do not have such a proxy 
appointment right, or you do but do not wish to exercise it, you may have a right to give instructions to the member who has 
appointed you as to the exercise of voting rights. If you are a Nominated Person, the statement of the rights of members in 
relation to the appointment of proxies above does not apply. Such rights can only be exercised by a registered member of 
the company.
8. Issued share capital/voting rights
As at 3 March 2016, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document, the company’s issued share 
capital, including treasury shares, consisted of 85,363,743 ordinary shares of 5p (“shares”). Of these, 905,651 shares were 
held in treasury, the voting rights and entitlement to dividend of which were automatically suspended. Accordingly, the total 
number of voting rights in the company as at that date was 84,458,092.
9. Right to ask questions
A shareholder attending the meeting has the right to ask questions relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting 
in accordance with section 319A of the Act. In certain circumstances prescribed by section 319A of the Act, the company 
need not answer a question.
10. Shareholder requests under section 527 of the Act
Under section 527 Companies Act 2006, members of the company representing at least 5% of the total voting rights of the 
company, or at least 100 members who have a right to vote and hold shares in the company on which there has been paid up 
an average sum per member of at least £100, may require the company to publish on its website a statement setting out any 
matter relating to the audit of the company’s accounts or any circumstances connected with KPMG LLP ceasing to hold office 
since the last AGM that the members propose to raise at the meeting. 
Where the company is required to publish such a statement on its website, it may not require the members making the 
request to pay its expenses in complying with the request. The company must forward the statement to the company’s 
auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on its website. The business of the meeting includes 
any such statement that the company has been required to publish on its website.

HMRC confirms legislation to implement changes 
to dividend payments
What does the new legislation mean for issuers? 
A new zero rate tax will be introduced, effective from 6 April 
2016, to dividends. The Dividend Tax Credit will no longer be 
required. 
The way in which companies paying dividends advise 
shareholders of the funds they have received remain 
broadly unchanged, a payment advice still being required. 
The obligation to show the dividend tax credit is, though, 
removed and the new notification is likely to be called a 
“dividend confirmation”. 
What does it mean for Shareholders?
Currently all UK dividends are paid with a notional 10% tax 
credit, so for every £1,000 of dividend income received it is 
assumed that £111 in basic rate tax has already been paid 
(the total dividend is therefore £1,111). For this reason, non 
and basic rate tax payers have no further tax liability on 
dividends received. This tax credit is being scrapped, so 
in future all dividend income will be treated as gross (i.e. 
untaxed) income.
From April 2016, there will be an income tax charge on 
dividends at the rate of 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5% 
for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate 
taxpayers. 
The long-standing system of tax credits attached to 
dividends will be replaced with a new tax-free Dividend 
Allowance. This will mean that there will be no tax to pay on 
the first £5,000 of dividend income, no matter what non-
dividend income a shareholder may have. Dividends paid 
on shares held within pensions and ISAs will be unaffected, 
remaining tax-free.
Non-taxpayers and basic rate taxpayers who receive 
dividend income between £5,001 and £10,000 will need to 
make a self assessment declaration to HMRC for the first

time. Individuals with dividend income of more than £10,000 
are already required to submit a self assessment declaration. 
It is expected that most of those individuals who will have 
some tax to pay on dividend income will have it collected by 
PAYE. Further details of how this will be done are yet to be 
published but will be in time before the tax is due.
ShareGift
ShareGift, the charity share donation scheme, is a free 
service for shareholders wishing to give shares to charitable 
causes. It may be especially useful for those who wish to 
dispose of a small parcel of shares which would cost more 
to sell than they are worth. There are no capital gains tax 
implications (i.e. no gain or loss) on gifts of shares to charity 
and it is also possible to obtain income tax relief. Further 
information can be obtained at www.sharegift.org.
The Unclaimed Assets Register
The Unclaimed Assets Register is a unique search service 
that helps individuals to find their lost assets and re-establish 
contact with financial institutions. It has a database of 
unclaimed life policies, pensions, unit trust holdings, and 
share dividends drawn from many companies and can 
search for lost assets and entitlements. The Unclaimed 
Assets Register charges a small fixed fee for each search, 
10% of which goes to charity. For further information, visit 
www.uar.co.uk.
Warning to shareholders – boiler room 
scams
We have been made aware of our shareholders receiving 
unsolicited telephone calls from companies offering to buy 
Headlam shares at a substantial premium to the prevailing 
market price for a large shareholder intending to make a 
takeover bid. These callers, who can be extremely persuasive 
and persistent, are usually based overseas and are commonly 
known as “boiler room scams”. Shareholders are advised to 
be wary of any unsolicited investment advice or approach 
to buy or sell shares . . . if it sounds too good to be true, it 
probably is.
If you receive an unsolicited investment approach, you 
should:
 ■ Confirm the name of the person calling and the 
organisation they represent.
 ■ Check that they are registered with the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) by calling 0800 111 6768 or by visiting 
www.fca.org.uk and contact the firm using the details on 
the register.
 ■ Report the matter to the FCA by calling 0800 111 6768 or 
by visiting www.fca.org.uk.
Please note that if you deal with an unauthorised firm, you 
will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme. Further information on this 
or similar activity can be found on the FCA website www.
moneymadeclear.org.uk. If you have any queries, please 
contact the Company Secretary.

08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  27/3/08  12:20  Page 03 I am pleased to report Melrose’s fifth set of annual results since
flotation in October 2003.
Results for the continuing group
Following the sale of McKechnie Aerospace and Aerospace
Aftermarket divisions (“McKechnie Aerospace”) and the majority 
of our PSM division (“PSM”) (together the “Disposals”), these
accounts report the results of our businesses for the twelve months 
to 31 December 2007 and the relevant comparatives for the previous
year. They take into account the effect of the return of capital and
share consolidation during August 2007.
Revenue for the year was £344.0 million (2006: £323.6 million).
Headline profit before tax (before exceptional costs, exceptional
income and intangible asset amortisation other than computer
software) was £27.0 million (2006: £12.1 million). 
After these items the profit before tax was £21.2 million (2006: 
£4.8 million) and basic earnings per share were 7.4p (2006: 1.2p)
Further explanation of these results is provided in the Finance
Director’s review.
Our businesses and their employees have worked very hard to
produce these good results and I thank them on behalf of our
shareholders.
2007 was a very busy year 
in which much was achieved. 
In May we sold McKechnie
Aerospace for £428 million and
PSM for £30 million realising 
a combined profit of over 
£190 million in the two years
since acquisition.

Chairman’s statement
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  26/3/08  18:19  Page 04 2007 was a very busy year in which much was achieved. In May we
sold McKechnie Aerospace for £428 million and PSM for £30 million
realising a combined profit of over £190 million in the two years since
acquisition. In line with our stated objectives, we returned £220
million of capital to shareholders in August. Together with dividends
this means we have returned to shareholders 95% of the equity
raised since Melrose’s inception in 2003. At the same time as the
return of capital shares in issue were reduced by means of a share
consolidation. Notwithstanding this repayment of capital, Melrose had
year end net cash of £32.4 million, compared with net debt of
£162.6 million at the end of last year.
In such an active year it would be easy to overlook the strong
performances of our continuing businesses. All three divisions have
bettered their results of last year, and although MVC continues to
trade in a very difficult market place in the USA, we are optimistic that
this overall improvement will continue into 2008. Cash generation
remains very strong.
David Roper reports in more detail on each of our businesses in his
Chief Executive’s review.
Dividends
The Board intends to propose a final dividend of 4.25p per share
(together with an interim dividend of 2.5p per share paid on 
16 November 2007, a total of 6.75p per share) (2006: 6.0p 
per share) at the Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2008. The
dividend is payable on 16 May 2008 to shareholders on the register
at 14 March 2008.
Strategy and outlook
Our model is to acquire businesses which we understand and which
are capable of substantial improvement under our ownership. It is an
important part of this model that we return capital to shareholders as
and when value has been created and realised. We are pleased to
have been able to give an effective demonstration of this during 2007.
I said last September that we were well placed to pursue suitable
acquisitions and that market conditions were potentially aiding us 
in this respect. That continues to be the case and we are optimistic 
of concluding one or more acquisitions in the next twelve months
which will give us the opportunity for substantial further growth 
and profitability.

subscribed capital
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  25/3/08  14:20  Page 05 I am very pleased with the results of the Group in 2007. A lot
happened during the year and the make-up of the Group is markedly
different from this time last year.
The sale of the McKechnie Aerospace division and PSM in May,
resulting in a profit to Melrose of over £190 million after only two
years in our ownership, was very gratifying. This enabled us to return 
£220 million to shareholders in August. This means that shareholders
have received by way of distribution or return of capital 95% of the
equity capital raised since Melrose floated in October 2003.
In addition, the trading result for the Group in 2007 was good. I set
out below the reports on the divisions and would mention the
following highlights:
■
At Dynacast a major investment programme in South China is
underway to take advantage of the continuing strong trading
conditions in the Far East. Having completed the restructuring of its
operational base and turned its attention to bolt-on acquisitions, it is
pleasing to report that Dynacast has successfully completed two
such acquisitions in the second half of the year – the search
continues for more.
■
At MVC, although market conditions remain extremely challenging,
operational improvements continue to be made and the new
chrome plating line was successfully introduced, which assisted the
launch of MVC’s new plasticlad product.
■
At MPC the benefits of operational restructuring and of focusing on
higher margin value added products are coming through well. New
product introductions, supported by targeted capital investment,
were notable achievements.
Having successfully sold
businesses and returned capital 
to our shareholders, we have been
able to show how our business
model works in practice.

Chief Executive’s review
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  26/3/08  18:22  Page 06 Outlook
Dynacast continues to show the quality of its business franchise by
reporting increased profits and margins, even in the face of large raw
material price rises. In addition to its active ongoing capital investment
programme, particularly in the Far East, the company is looking to 
make further value-enhancing bolt-on acquisitions. 
At both MVC and MPC the strategy is to exploit the high level of
technical engineering and design expertise in the businesses,
supported by bold but highly focused capital investment, to deliver
improved returns.
As Chris Miller says in his Chairman’s statement, having successfully
sold businesses and returned capital to our shareholders, we have
been able to show how our business model works in practice. Our
strong financial condition and solid trading performance position us
well to take advantage of the current market conditions to pursue
acquisition opportunities.
I am most encouraged by the trading performance of the Group 
and I look forward to further achievements in the year ahead.

Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007  07
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  27/3/08  19:41  Page 07 Dynacast is a global manufacturer of precision engineered, die-cast
metal components and assemblies. The products are manufactured
using proprietary die-casting technology and are supplied to a wide
range of end markets, including automotive, healthcare,
telecommunications, consumer electronics and computer hardware
and peripherals.
Dynacast performed well in 2007. Revenue and headline operating
profit were up by 6.4% and 15.1% respectively over the previous year.
These results are after suffering an exchange loss on translation
(resulting from the weakness of the US dollar) of £0.5 million and
exchange losses on transactions (primarily as a result of the increased
strength of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar) of £1 million. 
Whereas Dynacast’s 2006 headline operating profit was adversely
impacted by approximately £3 million because of the non-recovery of
zinc cost (the company’s major raw material), management’s actions
in the second half of 2006 in aligning movements in zinc input prices
with selling prices to customers have to a large degree removed the
effect of movements in the price of zinc from headline operating profit.
Europe was ahead of expectations, buoyed generally by favourable
economic and trading conditions in its markets. In particular, Germany,
Austria and Spain performed strongly and finished ahead of target. We
were pleased with the recovery of Dynacast France after having
transferred some of its less profitable work to lower cost countries.

line with original predictions. 
Performance in North America was reasonable, both at the revenue
and headline operating profit level. Market conditions in this region are
more difficult at present than in both Europe and Asia, largely due to a
higher proportion of sales to the automotive sector. It was encouraging
to see in the early part of the year, the operational benefits from the
closure of the Spartanburg factory in South Carolina. Of special note is
the continuing robust sales of handles for the “Mach III” Gillette razor,
which has been produced in our factory in Montreal for ten years. 
In Asia, trading continued to be buoyant with Dynacast China leading
the way with revenue and headline operating profit up 46.9% and
59.7% respectively over the previous year. Singapore performed
particularly well in winning new sales to replace products that reached
their “end-of-life” earlier in the year. In view of the continuing strong
demand in the region, a capital expenditure project has been
approved to invest approximately £4 million over the next four years
in a new manufacturing facility in Southern China. 
When Melrose acquired Dynacast in May 2005 we embarked upon a
restructuring programme to align Dynacast’s manufacturing sites with
its customer base, which itself was continuing to migrate production
to lower cost countries. This phase is now complete and we have
seen Dynacast’s return on sales (on a constant zinc and currency
basis) improve significantly since acquisition to 14.8%. Following this
in order to further develop the business and generate additional
revenue growth, Dynacast is now focusing on add-on acquisition
opportunities. The market that Dynacast operates in is very
fragmented and affords considerable consolidation opportunities.
Two businesses, QZD and Techmire (both based in Montreal,
Canada), were acquired in September 2007 for a total cost of 
£8.7 million. QZD, a precision zinc die-casting business, has been
successfully integrated into Dynacast’s Montreal factory. Techmire 
is a designer and manufacturer of multiple-slide die-casting machines
and will be operated as a stand-alone business. Techmire’s overheads
have already been significantly reduced and a new site has been
found close to the existing Dynacast site to rehouse the production
facilities. Both acquisitions are expected to improve the profitability 
of Dynacast’s operations.
Management are continuing to look for suitable acquisition
opportunities (including Eastern Europe) and to invest heavily in the
fast growing Far East markets, while maintaining their focus on
achieving the highest levels of operating efficiency in the business.
Dynacast benefits from a strong market share, a well diversified
geographic and product sector exposure, and excellent cash
generation qualities. We are confident that management will deliver
another strong set of results in 2008.

10 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007
Business Review continued
MVC manufactures decorated exterior trim products for the US
automotive industry, principally coated metal and plastic wheel
products.
Although MVC reported substantially improved results in 2007 over
2006, it is disappointing that the company did not reach breakeven.
MVC’s new products in 2007 were targeted towards the smaller
crossover vehicles rather than the SUVs and pick-up trucks, which
provided it with growth in a difficult marketplace. Unfortunately the
benefits of this growth have been reduced principally by higher raw
material costs. Whilst considerable progress was made by MVC
management to recover these raw material costs in 2007, a
combination of the growth in output and the size of the increases
resulted in higher overall costs. Improved levels of recovery negotiated
during the latter part of 2007 and the fall in raw material costs back
toward the prices at the beginning of 2007 should help to continue
with the progress of this business towards a more satisfactory result. 
A key challenge for MVC management during 2008 will be addressing
the profitability of a number of legacy products.
The highlight of the year was the successful introduction in
September of the new chrome plating line at our Nicholasville plant.
This was critical in enabling MVC to meet the high level of contracted
orders from customers for the new plasticlad product. In addition,
significant improvements have been made in the wheel assembly
process at Nicholasville which bode well for the forthcoming new
product launches in 2008.
Our Newberry plant continues to deliver a good performance. It
coped well with the transfer of the duraclad assembly line from
Nicholasville, which improved capacity utilisation, and has flexed its
operational cost base well to match demand.
The operational improvement in 2007 has been pleasing. However,
even allowing for its good position in a niche market, conditions in the
US automotive market are tough. With constant attention to the basics
and the new plating line geared up to meet the projected demands of
the new programmes coming on stream in the second half of 2008,
we expect a continuing improvement.

Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007  11
MPC is a UK producer of engineered plastic injection moulded
components for products used in a variety of industries, including
power tools, IT hardware, food and beverage packaging and
automotive. Following the sale of the fastener division of McKechnie
PSM in May 2007 the results of both the PSM Thread Locking and
Sealing business (which has been renamed Prelok) and Canning Brett
are included in this section.
MPC has delivered a strong set of results in 2007. Although the
closure of the Northampton plant in 2006 resulted in a fall in
revenue, this action had the desired effect of a more profitable
business with headline operating profit up by 30% over 2006.
MPC continues to focus its engineering expertise on more automated,
highly engineered, value added products and processes, whilst
building strong, long term relationships with its customers. This
strategy has enabled MPC to differentiate itself from its competitors.
The Stamford Bridge facility has had a good year as a result of its
rigorous adherence to the above strategy, supplemented by a
substantial capital expenditure programme. In addition to the
successful development of new highly automated production cells
together with process re-engineering for a number of key customers,
new long term contracts have been signed with Diageo and Scotco
for the supply of “widgets” for use in cans and bottles.
The quality of the business at MPC’s automotive operation at
Pickering has improved notably during the year – headline operating
profit has more than doubled on broadly unchanged sales. Again,
focusing on the core strategy of a targeted capital investment
programme together with emphasis on pricing discipline to recover
input costs has paid dividends.
Prelok’s results in the year were most encouraging. With production
volumes outstripping capacity in its Cologne facility, a new production
unit located in Germany became fully operational in July 2007. This
new facility, close to the Polish and Czech borders, is well positioned
to profit from new business opportunities in the burgeoning Eastern
European markets.
With a favourable start to 2008 and further opportunities in the UK
industry afforded by the demise of certain competitors, we expect
MPC to continue to build on its strong foundation and to deliver
another good performance this year.

08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  28/3/08  15:48  Page 11 The year to 31 December 2007 included the disposal of the
McKechnie Aerospace and PSM division. Taken together, these sold
businesses constituted 36% of Group sales and 66% of Group
headline operating profit in 2006.
Consequently the Melrose Group is now significantly smaller than in
2006, and in compliance with IFRS 5, the trading results for the Group
are split into continuing operations and discontinued operations.
Group trading results – continuing operations
The continuing operations comprise Dynacast, McKechnie Vehicle
Components (MVC) and McKechnie Plastic Components (MPC). The
latter division now includes the remaining smaller part of PSM, trading
as Prelok and Canning Brett.
To help understand the results the term “headline” has been used in
this review. This refers to numbers that are calculated before
exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset
amortisation other than computer software.
The Group achieved revenue from continuing operations for the year
ended 31 December 2007 of £344.0 million (2006: £323.6 million)
representing an increase of £20.4 million, 6.3% over the previous
year or 9.7% at constant currency. 
Headline operating profit grew by 27.6% to £24.5 million (2006:
£19.2 million). This represents a headline operating profit return on
revenue of 7.1% (2006: 5.9%), a 1.2 percentage point increase on
the previous year.
At constant currency the profit growth in 2007 was 30.2% as a £0.5
million translation exchange loss was incurred, largely due to the
weakness of the US dollar.
After exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset
amortisation, the operating profit was £18.7 million (2006: £11.9 million).
Trading results by division
The improvement in the trading results has been driven by stronger
performance at each division. A split of revenue and headline
operating profit by division is as follows:

The increase in the continuing Group return on revenue has been
driven by an improvement in all three divisions.
Cash generation and management
Melrose places strong emphasis on cash generation and management.
This is achieved by the careful monitoring of the key cash and working
capital metrics in each division and by ensuring that divisional
management is incentivised to turn profit into cash. 
Since the acquisition of the Dynacast and McKechnie businesses the
profit conversion to cash for the continuing Group has averaged 94%
(post working capital movement and capital expenditure). This high
conversion ratio has been achieved even after spending in excess of
depreciation on capital projects. Dynacast in particular, which now
trades with only two weeks of net working capital, has excellent profit
conversion to cash averaging 107% during Melrose ownership. Since
acquisition Dynacast has generated £68 million in cash after all
working capital movement, capital expenditure and restructuring costs.
The cash generation performance in 2007 is summarised as follows:
£m
Headline operating profit 24.5
Depreciation and computer software amortisation 10.4
Working capital increase (2.9)
Total capital expenditure (16.0)
Disposal of assets 0.4
Headline cash generated from operations 16.4
Disposal of businesses 446.7
Capital distribution paid (212.6)
Acquisition of subsidiaries (8.7)
Restructuring costs and spend on other provisions (1.9)
Interest and tax (2.8)
Pension contributions (26.1)
Dividends paid (13.0)
Exchange & other (including discontinued operations) (3.0)
Total movement in net debt/net cash in 2007 195.0
During 2007 67% of headline operating profit was converted into
cash (post working capital and capital expenditure). This was despite
the exceptionally high capital spend in MVC during the year. Adjusting
for this, the profit conversion to cash was 94% in 2007, in line with
the longer term Melrose average.
Capital and restructuring projects
Since the acquisition of the Dynacast and the McKechnie businesses,
Melrose has spent significant amounts on capital and restructuring
projects, averaging approximately £25 million per year, equal to 1.3x
depreciation on capital projects and 0.5x depreciation on restructuring
projects. This level of expenditure demonstrates the importance the
Board place on this method of creating shareholder value. The total
expenditure on these items over the last three reporting periods has
been as below.
2005 
(7 mths) 2006 2007 Average x 
£m £m £m £m
Capital expenditure 7 .1 19.7 18.7 1.3 x
Restructuring projects – 
cash spend 8.9 9.2 1.0 0.5 x
Total 16.0 28.9 19.7 1.8 x
The capital expenditure in 2007 includes continued investment in the
Dynacast production facility in China; however, the most significant
item of capital expenditure in 2007 was in MVC. Over the last 15
months, MVC has invested £7.5 million on a new nickel chrome
plating line for its plasticlad wheel cover ranges. As a consequence
the book value of the old discontinued plating line has been fully
impaired. This £1.5 million non cash charge has been shown in
exceptional costs. 
The new restructuring projects in 2007 relate mainly to integrating the
small acquisitions made by Dynacast.
Profit on sale of businesses
Gross proceeds from the Disposals during the year were £458.0 million
and costs charged during the period were £10.8 million. Net assets
disposed of were £233.6 million, (including goodwill and intangible
assets other than computer software of £152.5 million), and the
cumulative exchange translation movement on assets since acquisition
of £22.0 million, previously booked straight to reserves, was recycled on
disposal. As a result the profit on sale was £191.6 million.
Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007  13
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  25/3/08  14:20  Page 13 Tax
The Melrose Group remains in a strong tax position. The headline tax
charge in the profit and loss account has reduced to 26% in 2007
from 28% in 2006. This is below the UK statutory rate during the
period of 30% as the Group continues to benefit from lower Far East
tax rates, balanced in part with higher North American and European
tax rates.
The headline cash tax rate of 16% for the continuing Group remains
below the profit and loss account rate but as expected the gap
between the two is narrowing. The Group has significant tax losses
available to it but due to the split of profits geographically most are
not recognised as deferred tax assets because the majority of the
losses are in the UK where insufficient profits are generated. A
summary of tax losses by geography is shown below:
Recognised Unrecognised Total
£m £m £m
UK – 138.6 138.6
North America 2.6 6.7 9.3
Rest of world – 18.6 18.6
Total 2.6 163.9 166.5
The Group paid no corporation tax on the profits it made on the
Disposals. This is largely a result of the Group benefiting from the
substantial shareholder exemption rules in the UK.
Return of capital and subsequent share consolidation
During August 2007, following the Disposals and in line with the
Melrose strategy to return surplus cash to shareholders, the Group
returned £220 million of capital to shareholders. Shareholders had
the option of receiving a payment either in August 2007 or deferred
until 2008. This meant that within 28 months of acquiring the
McKechnie and Dynacast businesses in May 2005, 95% of capital
raised from shareholders had been returned, and the group had
moved to a net cash position. 
The capital return was made in conjunction with a 1 for 2 share
consolidation which resulted in the number of shares in issue
reducing from 267.3 million to 133.7 million. As permitted some
shareholders opted to defer the capital payment until 2008 and
therefore a £7.2 million creditor is included in the 31 December 2007
balance sheet to represent the outstanding balance on the £220
million capital repayment.
Long term incentive scheme
Melrose has an incentive scheme which rewards certain senior
management with Melrose shares as defined in the Remuneration
Report. The original scheme set up at the start of Melrose in October
2003 was due to run until May 2009. However, with the approval of
both the Remuneration Committee and Shareholders, on 14 August
2007, in conjunction with the return of capital to Shareholders, this
scheme was crystallised. This resulted in 10.2 million shares being
awarded to senior management and created a £1.9 million
crystallisation charge in the profit and loss account to recognise the
national insurance due on the value of the shares awarded and the
acceleration of the IFRS 2 charge associated with these shares. This
one off crystallisation charge has been shown in exceptional costs.
Shareholders approved a new incentive scheme on 14 August 2007
that mirrors the old scheme but has an end date extended to May
2012, and only rewards the creation of value above that which the
original scheme rewarded.
The charge to headline operating profit for the incentive scheme was
£2.0 million. This consisted of a £0.6 million charge relating to the
original Melrose scheme for the period 1 January 2007 to 14 August
2007, a £0.3 million charge for the new Melrose scheme from 
14 August 2007 to 31 December 2007 and a £1.1 million charge for 
a Dynacast senior management scheme.
Earnings per share and number of shares in issue
In accordance with IAS 33 two basic earnings per share numbers are
disclosed on the face of the income statement, one for continuing
operations only and one which also includes discontinued operations.
However, because a 1 for 2 share consolidation occurred part way
through the year these measures do not give a good indication of the
underlying earnings per share for the continuing Group on an ongoing
basis. The 1 for 2 share consolidation and the early crystallisation of the
original Melrose incentive scheme caused the number of shares to
change throughout the year as follows:
Number of
shares
At 1 January 2007 257 .1m
Crystallisation of original Melrose incentive scheme 
on 14 August 2007 10.2m
At 14 August 2007 267 .3m
1 for 2 share consolidation completed on 15 August 2007 (133.6m)
At 31 December 2007 133.7m
Weighted average number of shares in the year 210.5m
The earnings per share calculation for continuing operations uses the
weighted average number of shares in existence for the whole of
2007 and not the lower number of shares in issue post the share
consolidation. This therefore understates the underlying performance
on an on going basis. Conversely the earnings per share including
discontinued operations includes the one off profit on the Disposals
in the year and therefore significantly overstates the underlying
ongoing trading performance.

Acquisitions during the year
During the year two small acquisitions were made by Dynacast for a
combined consideration of £8.7 million including £0.3 million of costs.
Both transactions were asset purchases rather than share purchases.
The fair value of net assets purchased was £4.2 million, (including
intangible assets of £1.6 million) and therefore the goodwill was 
£4.5 million. These acquisitions contributed only £0.2 million to the
Dynacast headline operating profit in the year as they were not
completed until September.
Exceptional costs and income
Excluded from the headline operating profit are certain costs and
income of an exceptional nature that are considered outside the normal
course of business for the divisions. These charges are as follows:
Year ended 
31 December 2007
Cash Non cash Total
£m £m £m

Total exceptional cost 1.8 3.1 4.9
Exceptional income
Pension curtailment gain – 1.1 1.1
The three items of exceptional cost have all been discussed previously
in this review. The total cost of these exceptional items is £4.9 million
of which £1.8 million is a cash cost. The item of exceptional income
relates to the pensions curtailment gain that arose on the sale of the
McKechnie Aerospace division.

£m £m
Net (cash)/debt (32.4) 162.6

Total 235.1 417.7
The assets and liabilities of the Group have changed significantly
during 2007. As a result of the Disposals the Group has sold 
£233.6 million of assets and liabilities during the year, and moved
into a net cash position. 
Impairment review
In compliance with IAS 36 the carrying value of the net assets by
division has been compared to their future cash flows discounted 
at a rate reflective of their circumstances and method of funding. 
This confirmed the carrying value of each division in the Group
balance sheet.
Pensions
The Group has a number of defined benefit and defined contribution
schemes in place globally.
The current market value of the assets of the defined benefit
schemes is insufficient to satisfy the liabilities to members when they
are valued on a basis consistent with IAS 19. The net accounting
deficit on the schemes was £25.2 million (2006: £55.4 million) of
which 63% (2006: 82%) was derived from the most significant
scheme in the Group, the UK McKechnie Pension Plan (the “Plan”).
This had assets at 31 December 2007 of £114.7 million (2006:
£83.0 million), liabilities of £130.7 million (2006: £128.4 million)
and therefore a deficit of £16.0 million (2006: £45.4 million).
Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007  15
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  25/3/08  14:20  Page 15 As part of the disposal process of the McKechnie OEM division
Melrose obtained clearance from the UK Pensions Regulator for its
agreement with the Trustee of the Plan. Melrose made a cash payment
of £20.0 million to the Plan in May 2007 and agreed to pay a further
£18.3 million in equal quarterly instalments of £1.5 million over the
next three years starting in July 2007. Melrose PLC has also guaranteed
the funding of the Plan on an ongoing basis. As a consequence of this
the Company has contributed £25.8 million (2006: £5.4 million) into
the Plan in 2007, significantly more than in the previous year and the
total pension deficit in the Melrose Group has reduced by more than
half. The movement in the Plan deficit from £45.4 million in 2006 to
£16.0 million in 2007 is explained below:
£m
2006 IAS 19 deficit 45.4
Interest on liabilities 6.5
Expected return on assets (6.5)
Investment outperformance (2.3)
Change in key pension assumptions (8.0)
Increase in life expectancy (lower mortality) 7 .6
Curtailment gain (1.1)
Employer contributions (25.8)
Other 0.2
2007 IAS 19 deficit 16.0
The assumptions used to calculate the IAS 19 deficit are considered
carefully by the Board of Directors and are considered suitable for a
scheme of this nature. The mortality assumption has been made more
prudent during the year to allow both for a higher level of current life
expectancy than previously used but also for further increases in the
expected future improvements to life expectancy. A male aged 65 in
2007 is expected to live for 20.6 years. This life expectancy is assumed
to increase by 1.2 years (6%) by 2020. This has added a further £7.6
million to liabilities in the year. A summary of the key assumptions of
the Plan are disclosed below:
31 December 31 December
2007 2006
% %
Discount rate 5.7 5.1
Inflation 3.3 2.9
Pension increases 3.3 2.9
31 December 31 December
2007 2006
Age Age
Life expectancy for 
a male aged 65 in 2007 85.6 83.6
Life expectancy for 
a male aged 65 in 2020 86.8 85.1
The long term strategy for the Plan is to concentrate on the cash flows
required to fund the liabilities as they fall due. These cash flows
extend many years into the future and the ultimate objective is that
the total pool of assets derived from future company contributions
and the investment strategy allows each cash payment to members
to be made when due. Viewed on this basis the investment strategy
has many years for the assets to grow to help fund the liabilities.
Consistent with this approach a new investment strategy targeted at
an absolute rate of return has been implemented by the Trustee, with
the Company’s agreement, during 2007.
Risk management
The significant financial risks the Group faces have been considered
and policies have been implemented to best deal with each risk. The
four most significant financial risks are considered to be liquidity risk,
finance cost risk, exchange rate risk and commodity risk. These are
discussed in turn.
Liquidity risk
The Group moved from a net debt position of £162.6 million at 
31 December 2006 to a net cash position at 31 December 2007 of
£32.4 million. As a result, the Group repaid a significant amount of its
bank term loans during the year. The committed bank term loan facility
comprises a term loan of £11.0 million (2006: £190.4 million) which
expires in 2010. The additional committed working capital facility of 
£30 million remains unchanged from the previous year and the Group
also benefits from a few small local overdraft facilities and some finance
lease arrangements for specific assets which have £1.2 million (2006:
£3.8 million) outstanding capital balances at 31 December 2007.
The combination of having a net cash position and a reduced
committed bank facility means that the Directors consider 
that the Group has sufficient capital for its current needs.
Finance cost risk
The interest rates the Group is exposed to are variable and linked to
LIBOR. Previously, when the Group had net debt it was appropriate
that financial instruments were entered into to protect against
movements in interest rates. Now that the Group has net cash this
protection is not considered necessary. Since moving into a net cash
position and repaying the majority of the term loan in May 2007, the
Group has received interest at an average rate of 5.7%.

Finance Director’s review continued
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  25/3/08  14:20  Page 16 Exchange rate risk
The Group trades in various countries around the world and hence the
Group is exposed to many different foreign currencies. The Group
therefore carries an exchange risk that can be categorised into three
types, described below. The Board policy is designed to protect against
some of the cash risks but not the non-cash risks. The most common
cash risk is the transaction risk the Group takes when it invoices a sale
in a different currency to the one in which its cost of sale is incurred.
This is addressed by taking out forward cover against approximately
80% of the anticipated cash flows over the following twelve months,
placed on a rolling quarterly basis. This does not eliminate the cash risk
but does bring some certainty to it. During 2007 the Group incurred a
£1.0 million transaction exchange loss.
Exchange rates used in the period
Average Rate Closing Rate
to £ sterling to £ sterling
US dollar
2007 2.00 2.00
2006 1.84 1.96
Euro
2007 1.46 1.36
2006 1.47 1.49
The effect on the key headline numbers in 2007 for the continuing
Group due to the translation movement of exchange rates from 2006
to 2007 is summarised as follows:
2007 
exchange rate 
versus 2006 
exchange rate
£m
2007 Effect
Sales reduction 11.0
Headline operating profit reduction 0.5
Net asset increase 3.7
For reference, guidelines to show the net translation exchange risks that
the Group currently carries are shown below:
Increase in 
profit
£m
For every 10 cent strengthening 
of the US dollar against sterling 0.2
For every 10 cent strengthening 
of the euro against sterling 1.1
As the translation risk is not a cash cost no exchange instruments are
used to protect against this risk. However, when the Group has net
debt, which it currently does not, the hedge of having a multicurrency
debt facility funding these foreign currency trading units protects
against some of this risk.
The most significant exchange risk that the Group takes arises when 
a division that is predominantly based in a foreign currency is sold. 
The proceeds for those divisions will most likely be received in a
foreign currency and therefore an exchange risk arises if these
proceeds are converted back to sterling, for instance to pay a dividend
to shareholders. Protection against this risk is taken on a case-by-case
basis. On the signing of the agreement to sell the McKechnie
Aerospace OEM and Aerospace Aftermarket divisions, Melrose
purchased sterling call options to protect against the currency exposure
on US$575 million of the proceeds at an average exchange rate of
£1=US$1.986. No financial instruments of this nature currently exist 
in the Group.
Commodity risk
As Melrose owns engineering businesses across various sectors the
cumulative expenditure on commodities is significant to the Group
results. The Group addresses the risk of base commodity costs
increasing by, wherever possible, passing on the cost increases to
customers or by having suitable purchase agreements with its
suppliers which sometimes fix the price over some months in the
future. Melrose does not generally enter into financial instruments on
commodities, as this is not considered to be the most efficient way of
protecting against movements.

Audited Financial Statements of the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2007.
Principal activities and business review 
Melrose PLC’s stated strategy is to acquire companies and businesses
whose operational performance the Melrose PLC Directors believe
can be improved to create shareholder value. The executive Directors
have extensive experience of identifying and evaluating acquisition
opportunities, quoted and unquoted, both UK and overseas. 
On 26 May 2005, Melrose PLC acquired the Dynacast Group and the
McKechnie Group for a consideration of £429 million plus costs.
Since acquisition, Melrose has significantly improved the performance
of these businesses. 
The Board announced on 14 May 2007 that the Company had
completed the disposal of its Aerospace OEM and Aerospace
Aftermarket divisions for a consideration of £428 million. Further, it
announced on 18 May 2007 that it had completed the sale of part of
the McKechnie PSM division for a consideration of £30 million. 
The Board used £173 million of the proceeds of the disposals to
repay term loan facilities, and returned £220 million of the proceeds
to shareholders. Details of the capital reorganisation are shown on
page 21 and in the Finance Director’s review.
The Chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5, together with the 
Chief Executive’s review, Business review and Finance Director’s 
review on pages 6 to 17 describe the principal activities, operations,
performance, financial position and likely future prospects of the Group.
The results of the Group are set out in detail on pages 36 to 39 and in
the accompanying notes.
The subsidiary and associated undertakings principally affecting the
profits or net assets of the group in the year are listed in note 3 to the
Melrose UK GAAP accounts (Company balance sheet).
In addition to the disposals referred to above, actions taken to enhance
the value of the Group during the year included investment across all
divisions, further restructuring within MVC and two targeted acquisitions
by Dynacast.
The Company is required by the Companies Acts to set out in this
report a fair review of the business of the Group during the year and of
the position of the Group at the end of the year and a description of
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. The information
that fulfils these requirements can be found within the Chief
Executive’s review, Business review and Finance Director’s review on
pages 6 to 17. The Finance Director’s review also indicates the key
performance indicators that management use.
Financial results and dividend 
The Group’s profit for the financial year attributable to members was
£215.0 million (2006: £37.8 million) including £0.2 million minority
interests (2006: £0.1 million). The Directors are pleased to
recommend the payment on 16 May 2008 to Ordinary shareholders
on the register at the close of business on 14 March 2008, of a final
dividend of 4.25 pence per Ordinary Share.
It is the intention of the Board to maintain a progressive dividend
policy going forward.
Directors’ Appointment and Powers
The Directors of Melrose PLC as at the date of this report, together
with their biographical details, are given on pages 18 to 19. No other
person served as a Director during the year. There were no changes
to the Board during the year.
The Company’s Articles of Association (the “Articles”) give the Directors
power to appoint and replace Directors. Under the terms of reference
of the Nomination Committee, any appointment must be
recommended by the Nomination Committee for approval by the
Board of Directors. The Articles also require Directors to retire and
submit themselves for election at the first Annual General Meeting
following their appointment and at each Annual General Meeting one
third of the Directors are subject to retirement by rotation and must
therefore submit themselves for re-election.
The Directors are responsible for managing the business of the
Company and may exercise all the power of the Company subject to
the provision of relevant statutes, to any directions given by special
resolution and to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles. The
Articles, for example, contain specific provisions concerning the
Company’s power to borrow money. Powers relating to the issuing of
shares and powers to purchase the Company’s own shares are also
included in the Articles and such authorities are renewed by the
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting each year.
Pursuant to section 166 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company
has power to purchase its own shares, limited to an aggregate
maximum number of 13,366,502 Ordinary Shares.
Directors’ interests and remuneration
Information on Directors’ beneficial interests, including those of
connected persons (within the meaning of section 252 of the
Companies Act 2006), in the shares of the Company is shown in the
Remuneration report on pages 30 to 33.
No Director had a material interest at any time during the year in any
contract, other than a service contract, with the Company or any of its
subsidiary undertakings.
Directors’ indemnities
The Directors have the benefit of “qualifying third party indemnity
provisions” for the purposes of sections 309A to 309C of the
Companies Act 1985.

Directors’ report
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  26/3/08  18:24  Page 20 Significant agreements – change of control
There are no agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a
change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, that are
considered to be significant in terms of their potential impact on the
business of the Group as a whole on 5 March 2008.
In the event of the takeover of the Company, the 2007 Incentive Shares
would convert into Ordinary Shares, the conversion being based upon
the offer price of shares as calculated on the date of change of control
of the Company. If part or all of the offer price were not in cash, the
remuneration committee would determine the value of the non-cash
element, having been advised by an investment bank of repute that
such valuation is fair and reasonable.
Share capital
Details of the structure of the Company’s share capital and rights
attached to the Company’s shares are set out below in compliance
with the requirements of section 992 of the Companies Act 2006.
Changes to the issued share capital of Melrose PLC in issue during
the year are detailed below.
Ordinary Shares
Following approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 14 August
2007, options over 8,877 Convertible B Shares (“Original Incentive
Shares”) were exercised by executive Directors and senior management
and converted into Original Incentive Shares. This resulted in 59,170
Original Incentive Shares being held by Directors, senior management
and the Employee Benefit Trust, which were converted into 10,210,069
Ordinary Shares of 0.1p. The total number of Ordinary Shares of 0.1p
then in issue was 267,330,058.
On 15 August 2007 these Ordinary Shares of 0.1p were consolidated
so that Shareholders received one Ordinary Share of 0.2p for every
two Ordinary Shares of 0.1p. Ordinary Shares of 0.2p are traded on
the London Stock Exchange in the same way as the Ordinary Shares
of 0.1p and are equivalent in all material respects to the Ordinary
Shares of 0.1p, including their dividend, voting and other rights.
Incentive shares
On 14 August 2007, the original incentive scheme was replaced by a
new share incentive scheme (the “2007 Incentive Scheme”) running
until 31 May 2012, based on the same principles as the original share
incentive arrangements, other than the trigger dates. 50,000 new
2007 Incentive Shares of £1 each were issued to Directors, senior
management and Ogier Employment Benefit Trustee Limited, as
trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust. 
The 2007 Incentive Shares do not confer a right to be paid a dividend
or the right to vote at a general meeting. On winding up, the holders
are entitled to participate in the Company’s assets equal to an amount
to which they would have been entitled if their Incentive Shares had
converted into Ordinary Shares as at the date of winding up.
C Shares and return of capital
On 14 August 2007, shareholders approved the return of £220
million in capital to shareholders and as a result 267,330,058
Redeemable Preference C Shares of 82.3p (“C Shares”) were issued
on the basis of one C Share for every Ordinary Share of 0.1p held.
Holders of 187,786,984 C Shares opted to redeem their shares on 
23 August 2007 and these C Shares were subsequently cancelled.
Holders of 70,489,480 C Shares opted to take the Single C Share
Dividend on 23 August 2007 when C Shares were converted into C
Deferred Shares. Final Redemption of the C Shares will take place on
30 June 2008, when 9,053,594 C Shares will be redeemed and
these C Shares will then be cancelled together with the 
C Deferred Shares.
The holders of the remaining C Shares and C Deferred Shares shall
not be entitled to: 
■
any further right of participating in the profits of the Company;
■
the right to vote at general meetings except holders of C Shares
can vote on the winding up of the Company.
On a winding up, the holders of the C Shares shall be entitled in
priority to all other classes of shares to 82.3 pence per C Share. The
holders of the C Deferred Shares shall not be entitled to any right or
participation in the assets of the Company on a winding up.
Further rights and obligations attaching to shares
Following the implementation of the EU Takeover Directive into UK law,
the following description provides the required information for
shareholders where not already provided elsewhere in this report. This
summary is based on the Company’s current articles of association, but
please note that it is proposed that the Company will adopt new articles
of association with effect from the conclusion of the Annual General
Meeting on 7 May 2008, brief details of which are set out on pages 24
and 89.

08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  26/3/08  18:24  Page 21 Voting
Only Ordinary Shares have voting rights attached. In a general meeting
of the Company, subject to the provisions of the current Articles and to
any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached to any class of
shares in the Company (of which there are currently none):
■
On a show of hands, every member present in person shall have
one vote; and
■
On a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall
have one vote for every share of which he is the holder.
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class
meeting in respect of any shares held by him if any call or other sum
then payable by him in respect of that share remains unpaid. Currently,
all issued shares are fully paid. The Employee Benefit Trustee holds
25,279 Ordinary Shares and the Remuneration committee may direct
how the voting rights of those shares are exercised. 
Deadlines for voting rights 
Full details of the deadlines for exercising voting rights in respect of
the resolutions to be considered at the Annual General Meeting to be
held on 7 May 2008 are set out in the Notice of Annual General
Meeting on pages 87 to 90.
Dividends and distributions 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 and the
Companies Act 2006 (the “Companies Acts”), the Company may, by
ordinary resolution, declare a dividend to be paid to the members,
but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the
Board. The Board may pay interim dividends, and also any fixed rate
dividend, whenever the financial position of the Company, in the
opinion of the Board, justifies its payment. All dividends shall be
apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid up on
the shares. Currently, all issued shares are fully paid.
The Board may deduct from a dividend or other amounts payable to
a person in respect of the share amounts due from him to the
Company on account of call or otherwise in relation to a share.
Liquidation
Under the current Articles, if the Company is in liquidation, the
liquidator may, on obtaining any sanction required by law:
■
divide among the members in kind the whole or any part of the
assets of the Company; or
■
vest the whole or any part of the assets in trustees upon such trusts
for the benefit of members as the liquidator, with the like sanction,
shall determine.
Transfer of shares
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of his
certificated shares by an instrument of transfer in any usual form or in any
other form which the Board may approve, and the instrument shall be
executed by or on behalf of the transferor. Subject to the Articles and the
requirements of any relevant investment exchange, the Board may, in its
absolute discretion and without giving any reason, refuse to register any
instrument of transfer of a certificated share which is not a fully paid share
or on which the Company has a lien. The Board may also decline to
register a transfer of a certificated share unless the instrument of transfer
is: (i) in respect of only one class of shares; (ii) in favour of not more than
four joint transferees or renouncees; (iii) duly stamped (if required) and
(iv) delivered for registration to the registered office, or such other place
as the Board may decide, accompanied by the certificate for the shares 
to which it relates and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably
require to prove the title of the transferor or person renouncing and the
due execution by him of the transfer or renunciation.
The Board may permit any class of shares in the Company to be held
in uncertificated form and, subject to the Articles, title to uncertificated
shares to be transferred by means of a relevant system and may
revoke any such permission. Registration of a transfer of an
uncertificated share may be refused where permitted by the Articles.

Directors’ report continued
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  26/3/08  18:25  Page 22 Employees
The Group recognises its responsibilities for the fair treatment of all its
employees in accordance with national legislation applicable to the
territories within which it operates. Having regard to their skills and
abilities, the Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for
employment received from disabled persons, and so far as particular
disabilities permit, will give employees disabled during their period of
employment continued employment in the same job or, if this is not
practicable, a suitable alternative job. Equal opportunities for
appropriate training, career development and promotion are available
to all employees regardless of any physical disability, gender, religion,
race, nationality, sexual orientation or age.
Employee involvement and consultation 
The Directors attach great importance to good labour relations and
employee involvement and development. The results for the half year
and financial year are discussed with senior management and the
opportunity is taken where possible to inform them of Group
developments. The nature of the Group’s activities places the
responsibility for employee consultation with local management in a
manner appropriate to the particular circumstances of each business.
Several of the businesses operate works councils for the purposes of
consultation and dissemination of information. Newsletters are also
used as a means of communicating with employees.
Employee involvement in the Group’s profitability is encouraged
through appropriate bonus and incentive schemes.
Pensions
Companies within the Melrose Group operate various pension
schemes around the world. The only significant scheme to the Group
is the McKechnie Pension Plan (the “Plan”), a UK defined benefit
pension scheme with McKechnie Limited as its principal employer.
The Plan closed to new members on 9 May 2003 and for future
accrual as at 30 June 2005. The primary liability for funding the Plan
rests with the participating employers, although Melrose PLC has
guaranteed the payment of certain contributions. 
As part of the disposal process of the McKechnie Aerospace division
Melrose obtained clearance from the UK Pensions Regulator for its
agreement with the Trustee of the Plan.  Melrose made a cash
payment of £20 million to the Plan in May 2007 and agreed to pay a
further £18.3 million in equal quarterly instalments of £1.5 million
over the next three years starting in July 2007.  The Company further
agreed to meet the reasonable administration expenses of the Plan
and the Pension Protection Fund Levy up to 30 April 2010 and has
guaranteed the funding of the Plan on an ongoing basis.
On today’s assumptions, the above mentioned contributions will be
sufficient to eliminate the deficit in the Plan on an ongoing basis by
2010. The funding level of the Plan and the overall security of
members’ benefits have been significantly improved as a result of the
agreement reached with the Trustee.
Research and development
The Group continually invests in research and development into new
products and new products were launched across the Group during
the year, some of these are mentioned in the Business review. No
research and development expenditure has been capitalised in the
year. The Group continues to invest in new technology in order to
reduce manufacturing costs and to improve productivity. The Group
will continue to invest in research and development that has a
suitable payback.
Social responsibility
Melrose PLC recognises the importance of social, environmental and
ethical matters and the Directors endeavour to take into account the
interests of all stakeholders, including investors, employees, customers,
suppliers and business partners when managing the businesses within
the Group. 
Community involvement
During its ownership of the Dynacast and McKechnie businesses,
Melrose has invested in its businesses in order to enhance their
reputation within the markets and communities in which they
operate.
Dynacast provide training within the community through an Internship
Scheme. This programme is designed to provide work experience and
vocational training for local graduates, improving their opportunity to
obtain permanent employment in the local market where skilled and
experienced workers are in demand.
Risk factors
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies in
relation to the use of financial instruments are described in the
Finance Director’s review on pages 12 to 17. Additionally, key risks,
which if they were to occur could impact on the business, are covered
in the Business review on pages 8 to 11.
Health, safety and the environment
The Directors seek to minimise risk to the health and safety of the
Group’s employees by ensuring effective management of the Group’s
activities.
The Group uses external consultants where appropriate to carry out
health and safety and environmental audits. Areas for improvement
identified by the external auditor are monitored and audit reports
quantify performance in key areas. These audit reports facilitate the
targeting and measurement of future improvements. Operating
businesses have established Health and Safety Committees who
meet regularly to review health and safety incidents and to plan
initiatives to further reduce risks.
Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007  23
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  26/3/08  18:25  Page 23 The Group recognises the importance of its environmental
responsibilities, monitors its impact on the environment, and
implements local policies to reduce any damage that might be caused
by the Group’s activities. The Group is committed to ensuring that its
operations have minimum adverse effect upon the environment and
that employees are aware of their role in safeguarding the future of the
environment. Many sites have continued with a number of initiatives
targeted to enhance the Group’s environmental, and ultimately,
competitive position. 
Initiatives designed to minimise the Group’s impact on the
environment include improvements to energy efficiency, reductions in
CO2 emissions, re-cycling and waste reduction. McKechnie Plastic
Components established an energy committee during the year in
order to push forward ideas for reductions in energy consumption.
They undertook an initiative to measure their carbon footprint, which
has since reduced significantly as a result of changing to a “carbon
friendly” energy supplier and reducing transport between
manufacturing and warehouse locations. 
Other specific measures include management and recycling of waste
including scrap, solvents and plastics, energy efficient lighting and
reductions in water usage.
Many of the businesses across the Group are accredited to the
international environmental standard ISO14001. 
Payments to suppliers 
It is the Group’s general policy to abide by the terms of payment
agreed with its suppliers at the time of individual transactions and to
ensure that suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and
abide by them. The nature of the Company’s transactions is such that
any calculation of creditor days in the Company only accounts does
not have any meaning.
Charitable and political donations 
The Group paid £3,293 (2006: £5,950) to UK charities during the
year, principally to local charities serving the communities in which the
Group operates. There were no political donations made during the
year (2006: £nil).
Auditors
Under the Companies (Audit, Investigation and Community
Enterprise) Act 2004, auditors have the right to access all information
necessary for performance of their duties as auditor and the duties of
Directors in this regard are clarified.
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information
of which the auditors are unaware and the Directors have taken all
the steps which they ought to have taken as a Director to make
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance
with the provisions of section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985. 
Deloitte & Touche LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in
office as auditors. Accordingly, a resolution will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting of the Company to re-appoint Deloitte &
Touche LLP as auditors of the Company and to authorise the Directors
to determine their remuneration.
Annual General Meeting 
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at the
offices of Investec at 2 Gresham Street, London, EC2V 7QP at 11.00
am on 7 May 2008.
Resolutions dealing with the following special business will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting:
Resolution 7 will seek shareholder approval of the Remuneration
report.
Resolution 8 will seek approval to amend the Articles of Association
in accordance with the printed document produced to the Meeting
and initialled by the Chairman for the purposes of identification. The
changes are to reflect the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (“CA
2006”) and to remove any inconsistencies with current law.
Explanatory notes on the changes are set out in the Appendix to the
Notice of Meeting. The key changes can be summarised as follows:
■
References to extraordinary resolutions have been removed, as
these have not been retained under CA 2006. 
■
Amendments have been made to provisions relating to convening of
general meetings and the length of notice required. In particular the
notice required for a general meeting at which a special resolution is
to be considered has been reduced from 21 to 14 days.
■
The quorum for a general meeting has been amended to two
“qualifying persons”, which now includes a person authorised to act
as a representative of a corporation in relation to the meeting.
■
The Articles reflect enhanced rights of proxies provided by CA 2006
to speak at a meeting, and to be counted on a show of hands.
■
Provisions relating to the age of a director have been updated
following the implementation of the Employment Equality (Age)
Regulations 2006. 
■
Provisions of CA 2006 regarding directors’ interests are expected to
come into force in October 2008. The Articles will, from such time
as those provisions come into force, give the Directors authority to
approve conflicts of interest, subject to certain safeguards.
■
CA 2006 has widened the scope of the power of a company to
indemnify directors who are also directors of a company which is a
trustee of an occupational pension scheme against liability incurred
in connection with that company’s activities as a trustee of that
scheme. Amendments have been made to reflect this and also the
fact that the Company may grant indemnities to directors of
associated companies.
■
The Articles have also been amended as described in the note on
Resolution 9 below to allow for electronic communications as
permitted under CA 2006.

Resolution 9 will seek the approval of members to the Company
communicating with shareholders by sending or supplying documents
or information to members by making them available on its website,
following the changes to its Articles and implementation of sections of
the CA 2006 as noted in Resolution 8.
Provisions of CA 2006 enable companies to communicate with
members by electronic and/or website communications. The revised
Articles continue to allow communications to members in electronic
form and also permit the Company to use the new provisions relating
to website communications. 
Before the Company can communicate with a member by means of
website communication, the relevant member must be asked
individually by the Company to agree that the Company may send or
supply documents or information to him by means of a website, and
the Company must either have received a positive response, or, as
provided by CA 2006, if no response is received within the period of 28
days beginning with the date on which the request was sent, may
deem receipt of a positive response. The Company will notify the
member (either in writing, or by other permitted means) when a
relevant document or information is placed on the website. If required,
a member can request a hard copy version at any time.
Resolution 10 will seek shareholder approval to renew the Directors’
authority to allot relevant securities pursuant to section 80 of the
Companies Act 1985 (the “Section 80 authority”). The authority
contained in the resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal
amount of £89,110, representing approximately one third of the
Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital as at 5 March 2008. The
Company does not hold any treasury shares.
Resolution 11 will seek to renew the authority conferred on the
Board to allot equity securities of the Company for cash pursuant to
section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 (the “Section 95 Authority”)
which disapplies the pre-emption rights provided by section 89(1) of
the Companies Act 1985. It is limited to the allotment of equity
securities which have been offered pro rata to Ordinary Shareholders,
subject to any arrangements the Directors consider appropriate to
deal with fractions and overseas requirements, and otherwise in
relation to the allotment of equity securities up to a maximum
nominal value of £13,366, representing approximately 5 per cent of
the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital as at 5 March 2008,
which is in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the Company.
If approved, the Section 80 authority and the Section 95 authority will
expire at the conclusion of next year’s Annual General Meeting. The
Directors have no present intention of exercising the Section 80
authority or the Section 95 authority.
Resolution 12 will seek to renew the authority conferred on the
Company to purchase its own shares pursuant to section 166 of the
Companies Act 1985. This authority is limited to an aggregate
maximum number of 13,366,502 Ordinary Shares, representing
approximately 10 per cent of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share
capital as at 5 March 2008. This power will expire at the conclusion of
next year’s Annual General Meeting. The maximum price which may
be paid for an Ordinary Share will be an amount which is not more
than 5 per cent above the average of the mid-market quotations of
the Ordinary Shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily
Official List. The Directors have no present intention of exercising all or
any of the powers conferred by this resolution and will only exercise
their authority if it is in the interests of shareholders generally.
Recommendations
The Board believes that each of the resolutions to be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting is in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors unanimously
recommend that you vote in favour of all of the resolutions proposed,
as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.

Statement of compliance
The Company supports the principles of corporate governance contained
in the 2006 Combined Code on Corporate Governance which is
appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good
governance. The Company has complied with the provisions of
section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. The
statements below describe how the Company has applied the
principles identified in the Combined Code. 
The Board
The Board meets regularly during the year as well as on an ad-hoc
basis as required by time critical business needs. The Board is
responsible to shareholders for the effective and proper management
and control of the Company and has a formal schedule of matters
reserved for its decisions. Its primary roles are to determine and
review Company strategy and policy, consider acquisitions and
disposals, assess requests for major capital expenditure and give
consideration to all other significant financial matters. This process is
undertaken following discussions in conjunction with senior executive
management who in turn are responsible for day to day conduct of
the Group’s operations and for reporting to the Board on the progress
being made in meeting the objectives. There were nine scheduled
Board meetings held during the year, including five meetings
convened in order to consider corporate transactions and related
activities. The attendance of each of the Directors is shown on page 28. 
As at 31 December 2007, the Board comprised seven members
being the executive Chairman, Mr Christopher Miller, three other
executive Directors and three non-executive Directors. The four
executive Directors, Mr Christopher Miller, Chairman, Mr David Roper,
Chief Executive Officer, Mr Simon Peckham, Chief Operating Officer
and Mr Geoffrey Martin, Group Finance Director, and the three 
non-executive Directors, Mr Miles Templeman, Mr Perry Crosthwaite
and Mr John Grant, served throughout the year. The terms and
conditions of the non-executive Directors’ appointments and the
executive Directors’ service contracts are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office and the non-executive Directors’
appointment letters are available on the Company’s website
www.melroseplc.net. 
The Board believes the Directors possess diverse business 
experience in spheres complementary to the activities of Melrose PLC,
as well as other sectors. Biographies of the Directors are shown on
pages 18 to 19. These biographies identify any other appointments
held by the Directors. The only executive Director to hold non-
executive Director appointments elsewhere is Mr Christopher Miller
and he does not receive any income from his appointment with TMO
Renewables Limited.
In accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code,
consideration has been given to the independence of all the 
non-executive Directors. The Board considers all the non-executive
Directors to be independent. 
Mr Miles Templeman held 1,478 Convertible B Shares which he
purchased in 2003 at the time the Company was admitted to AIM.
These Convertible B Shares converted into 255,036 Ordinary Shares
on 14 August 2007 when members approved the proposal to
terminate the Company’s existing incentive share arrangements.
Details of the conversion into Ordinary Shares are shown on page 32.
The Board believes that, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph
A.3.1 of the Combined Code, Mr Templeman’s holding of Convertible
B Shares prior to the crystalisation of the Original Incentive Share
Scheme does not affect his independence as a non-executive Director
of the Company. On the same date the 2007 Incentive Share
Scheme was approved, based on the same principles as the Original
Incentive Share Scheme. The non-executive Directors are not entitled
to any shares under the new incentive arrangement.
A process of evaluating the performance of the Board and standing
Committees is in place. The Chairman has held meetings with the
Directors including the senior independent non-executive Director, 
Mr Miles Templeman, to discuss the performance of the executive
Directors and the Board as a whole. It was considered that the individual
Directors and the Board as a whole were operating effectively. In
addition, each of the Directors completed a questionnaire during the
year designed to identify any failures in performance of the Board and
each of its Committees in order to determine any training requirements.
The findings of these questionnaires were reviewed by the Company
Secretary and feedback was provided to the Board.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, one third (or
the number nearest to but not less than one third) of all Directors are
required to retire and submit themselves for re-election at each Annual
General Meeting of the Company. It is the policy of the Board that non-
executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years,
following which their appointment will be reviewed.
Certain Directors are proposed for re-election as set out in the Notice
of Annual General Meeting on page 87. The Board and Nomination
Committee have carefully considered the time commitments required
and the contribution made by each Director and both the Nomination
Committee and the Board are of the belief that the performance of
each executive and non-executive Director continues to be effective
and that each Director demonstrates commitment to their role.

08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  26/3/08  18:25  Page 26 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007  27
On appointment, all Directors receive a formal and tailored induction.
Directors are advised that they have access to the advice and services
of the Company Secretary and, in addition, that they are entitled to
seek independent professional advice in the furtherance of their
duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense. 
A pack of briefing papers and an agenda is provided for each Director
in advance of each scheduled meeting. The Directors are able to seek
further clarification and information on any matter from any other
Director or employee of the Group whenever necessary. Decisions
are taken by the Board in conjunction with the recommendations of
its Committees and advice from external consultants and executive
management.
Chairman and Chief Executive
The Board’s policy is that the roles of Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive of the Company should be split. 
The division of responsibilities of the Chairman and the Chief
Executive is set out in writing and has been approved by the Board.
The Board considers that the respective roles and responsibilities are
clearly understood by both individuals and by the Board as a whole
with the Chairman alone responsible for the leadership of the Board
and for ensuring effective communication with shareholders and the
Chief Executive being responsible for decisions involving the day-to-
day management of the Company.
Committees of the Board
In accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code, the Board has
three standing Committees; the Audit, Nomination and the
Remuneration Committee, each of which comprise the three
independent non-executive Directors. The duties of the Committees are
set out in formal terms of reference, which were updated during the
year. These are available from the Company Secretary and on the
Company’s website www.melroseplc.net. Membership of the
Committees is shown below. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary
to each of the Committees.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises the three
independent non-executive Directors, Mr Miles Templeman, 
Mr Perry Crosthwaite and Mr John Grant. Mr Perry Crosthwaite chairs
the Committee. 
The function of the Committee is to establish and review the terms
and conditions of employment of the executive Directors, and to
make recommendations to the Board on the overall framework and
broad policy for the remuneration of the Company’s Directors and
other senior executives within the Group.
The Committee met four times during the year. The attendance 
of its members is shown in the table on page 28. The report to
shareholders on how Directors are remunerated, together with details
of individual Directors’ remuneration are shown on pages 30 to 33.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee currently comprises Mr Christopher Miller
and the three independent non-executive Directors, Mr Miles
Templeman, Mr Perry Crosthwaite and Mr John Grant. Mr Miles
Templeman is the Chairman of the Nomination Committee. 
The Committee reviews the structure, size and composition of the
Board, particularly in relation to the balance of skills, experience and
knowledge and seeks to ensure that both executive and non-
executive Directors have the necessary skills and attributes for the
future success of the Company. The Committee reviews succession
plans for the Directors and makes recommendations to the Board on
membership of the Board and of its Committees. The Committee
retains external search consultants as appropriate.
The Committee is expected to meet not less than twice a year and
during 2007 the Committee met twice.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee currently comprises the three independent non-
executive Directors, Mr Miles Templeman, Mr Perry Crosthwaite and
Mr John Grant. Mr Miles Templeman is the Chairman of the Audit
Committee. Each member of the Committee brings relevant financial
experience from senior executive and non-executive positions as
described in their biographies on pages 18 to 19.
The Committee invites the Group Finance Director, the Head of
Financial Reporting and senior representatives of the external auditors
to attend meetings as appropriate to the business being considered.
In addition, the Committee has the right to invite any other
employees to attend meetings where this is considered appropriate. 
The Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the
Group’s internal control systems, accounting policies and practices,
risk management procedures and compliance controls as well as the
integrity of the Company’s financial statements. 
The Committee is responsible for the development, implementation
and monitoring of the Company’s policy on external audit and for
overseeing the objectivity and effectiveness of the auditors. The
Committee recommends the appointment and re-appointment of the
Company’s external auditors and considers the scope of their audit work
and the cost effectiveness of their work.

The Committee has a policy on the engagement of the external
auditor to supply non-audit services and the Committee is aware of
the audit and non-audit services (including taxation advice) which
have been provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP during 2007. A
significant proportion of the non-audit services related to non-
recurring work in connection with the sale of the McKechnie
Aerospace and PSM divisions. The provision of non-audit services
were considered to be appropriate, given the external auditor’s depth
of knowledge of the affairs and financial practices in the Group. The
Committee is satisfied that, notwithstanding non-audit work, Deloitte
& Touche LLP have retained objectivity and independence during the
year. The Committee will continue to monitor its policy in this regard.
The Chairman of the Committee will attend the Company’s Annual
General Meeting to respond to any shareholder questions that might
be raised concerning the Committee’s activities. 
The Committee is expected to meet not less than three times a year
and during 2007 the Committee met three times. The attendance of
its members, along with the Group Finance Director, is shown in the
table below.
Attendance at meetings
The table below shows the attendance of each of the Directors at the
scheduled and significant meetings of the Board and its standing
Committees held during the year. The quorum necessary for the
transaction of business by the Board and each of its standing
Committees is two. Decisions are taken by the Board, in conjunction,
where appropriate, with the recommendations of its Committees and
advice from external advisors and executive management. The
representations of any director who is unable to attend a scheduled
meeting of the Board or a standing Committee are duly considered by
those directors in attendance.

Internal Control and Risk Management
Philosophy and policy
The objective of the Directors and senior management is to safeguard
and increase the value of the business and assets of the Group.
Achievement of this objective requires the development of policies
and appropriate internal controls to ensure the Group’s resources are
managed properly and any risks are identified.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the system of internal control
and for reviewing its effectiveness. The systems and processes
established by the Board are designed to manage, rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and cannot
provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Audit Committee ensures the effectiveness and efficiency of the
internal control processes implemented by senior management. This
includes discussions with senior management of the Company. These
findings are in turn discussed by the full Board. The Board is
committed to satisfying the internal control guidance for directors set
out in the ICAEW Turnbull Report. Further, the Board is aware of the
major risks facing the Company and the steps taken by the Company
where possible to mitigate such risks.
Key risks
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies in
relation to the use of financial instruments are described in the
Finance Director’s review on pages 12 to 17. Other key risks which
could adversely affect the Group are described in the Chief
Executive’s review and Business review on pages 6 to 11.
Managing and controlling risk
A summary of the structures and processes in place to identify and
manage risks across the Group are set out below. Divisional
executives, plant managers and financial controllers are responsible
for managing the business risks within their business.
There is an ongoing process to identify and evaluate risks faced by the
Group, through the conduct of regular meetings and business reviews
with the Group’s senior management. The risk process is regularly
reviewed by the Board.
The Group has policies which address a number of key business risks,
including financial, treasury, health and safety and environmental. The
policies are made available to relevant employees through manuals
and also via specific employee briefings and other communications as
appropriate. Senior management assume responsibility for managing
risk in the businesses. Where appropriate, external advisers are
appointed in order to support this process.
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  25/3/08  14:20  Page 28 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007  29
The Group has a whistleblowing policy in place which enables
individuals to make protected disclosures to the divisional human
resources manager, Group Company Secretary or senior independent
non-executive Director if they have concerns about possible
improprieties in financial reporting or other malpractices within their
business.
Accountability and audit
The Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the
consolidated financial statements is set out on page 34.
Going concern
On the basis of current financial projections and facilities available, the
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis
in preparing the financial statements.
Internal financial controls
The Group has a comprehensive system for regular monitoring and
reporting of financial performance and assessing the efficiency of the
Group’s systems of internal controls. A detailed budget is prepared by
management and thereafter is reviewed and formally adopted by the
Board. The budget and other targets are regularly updated via a rolling
forecast process and regular business review meetings are also held
involving senior management, at which the Group’s overall
performance is assessed. The results of these reviews are in turn
reported to and discussed by the Board at each meeting.
The Audit Committee has considered whether there is a requirement
for an internal audit function and based on the Group’s strong
financial controls and management, the Committee is satisfied that an
internal audit function is not presently required. Instead, the audit of
internal financial controls forms part of the responsibilities of the
Group’s finance function. This matter will be kept under regular
review. During the year members of the head office finance team
conducted internal audits over financial controls in place at various
divisional locations.
The Board confirms that, from its review of the system of internal
control, it has not determined any significant failings or weaknesses
that it considers requires remedial action. The Board also confirms
that it has not been advised of any material weaknesses in the
internal control systems that relate to financial reporting.
Communications with shareholders
Principally via the executive Directors, the Company seeks to build on a
mutual understanding of objectives with its institutional shareholders
through regular meetings and presentations following announcements
of annual and interim results. The senior independent Director, Mr
Miles Templeman, is available to meet institutional shareholders should
there be unresolved matters they wish to bring to his attention. 
The views of key analysts and shareholders are communicated back
to the Board directly by individual Directors and via the Company’s
brokers ensuring all members of the Board develop an understanding
of the views of major shareholders.
Corporate information is also available on the Company’s website,
www.melroseplc.net.
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Board welcomes the attendance of shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting and the attendance of all Directors is required. 
The number of proxy votes cast for and against each of the
resolutions proposed is announced at the AGM and a summary will
be available shortly after the AGM on the Company’s website,
www.melroseplc.net.

Introduction and compliance
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on
behalf of the Board in accordance with the requirements of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report regulations of the Companies Act
1985 (as amended), the Combined Code and the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority. A resolution inviting shareholders to
approve the report will be put to the Annual General Meeting on 
7 May 2008. 
The Directors’ emoluments and Directors’ shareholdings have been
subject to audit. 
Biographies of the Directors are shown on pages 18 to 19. These
biographies identify any other significant appointments held by the
Directors. None of the executive Directors receives any income from
their appointment as non-executive Director elsewhere.
Unaudited information:
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which is
chaired by Mr Perry Crosthwaite, an independent non-executive
Director. Other members of the Committee are the other two
independent non-executive Directors, Mr Miles Templeman and 
Mr John Grant.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are posted
on the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website
www.melroseplc.net and are also available from the Company
Secretary. Page 27 of the Corporate Governance Report sets out the
function of the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration policy 
The remuneration policy is established by the Board on the
recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.
The policy for remuneration is that the package offered should be
sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior
executives of the quality required, but not more than is necessary for
this purpose. It is intended that performance related pay should
comprise a significant proportion of the total remuneration. 
Remuneration is reviewed annually, generally effective on 1 January.
The Remuneration Committee and its advisers use a number of
surveys of the employment market from which to obtain
remuneration data.
The remuneration package 
The remuneration package for all executive Directors comprises 
base salary and benefits, annual bonus, long term incentive
arrangements and pension contribution. Some senior employees 
of the Group are also remunerated using these arrangements, which
are described below. 
Base salary and benefits
Base salary takes into account the performance of the individual and
information from independent sources and consultants on market
levels. An executive Director’s basic salary is reviewed by the Committee
prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes
position or responsibility. Basic salaries were reviewed in December
2007 and it was agreed that all Directors’ base salaries would be frozen
and reviewed following the next substantial acquisition. The executive
Directors also receive a company car allowance, fuel allowance, private
medical insurance, life insurance and permanent health insurance
cover. Mr Martin also receives paid train travel to London and
accommodation costs paid whilst working in London.
Bonuses
Bonus scheme arrangements are in place for executive Directors and
senior employees. The executive Directors and senior employee bonus
arrangements are calculated based on improvement in headline
operating profit of the business over the previous year and is, where
appropriate, adjusted for operating cashflow changes. The maximum
bonus payable is 100% of an executive Director’s base salary, excluding
the Chairman who does not participate in the annual bonus scheme.
Long Term Incentives 
During 2007 Melrose PLC operated the following long term incentive
schemes:
■
Dynacast Long Term Incentive Scheme
■
Convertible B Shares (“Original Incentive Shares”) which were
approved by shareholders on 15 October 2003 and crystallised on
14 August 2007
■
2007 Incentive Share Scheme, approved by shareholders on 
14 August 2007
Dynacast Long Term Incentive Scheme
During 2006 the Dynacast Long Term Incentive Scheme was created
for the senior management of the Dynacast division. Payment in cash
will be made either upon the sale of Dynacast or in 2009. If the latter,
payment will be based upon the average financial performance of
Dynacast during 2007 and 2008. A non cash charge of £1.1 million
was made to the income statement during the year in respect of this
scheme. This charge represents an estimate of this year’s proportion
of the amortisation of the estimated future entitlement to the
members of the Scheme over its life.
Convertible B Shares (“Original Incentive Shares”) 
At the Extraordinary General Meeting on 14 August 2007 (the
“EGM”), the members approved the proposal to terminate the
existing share incentive arrangements by requiring holders of the
Original Incentive Shares and Original Incentive Share options to
convert into Ordinary Shares, crystallising the accrued value up to 
18 July 2007 attributable to the Original Incentive Shares. Details of
the conversion into Ordinary Shares are shown on page 32.
2007 Incentive Share Scheme
At the EGM, a new long term incentive plan (the “2007 Incentive
Share Scheme”) was approved together with an allocation of 2007
Incentive Shares to all the executive Directors and two senior
employees. The 2007 Incentive Share Scheme is based on the same
principles as the Original Incentive Share Scheme, whereby
participants are only rewarded if shareholder value is created, thereby
aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders. 
Remuneration report
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  27/3/08  11:49  Page 30 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007  31
Under these new incentive arrangements the participants hold 2007
Incentive Shares, which convert shortly after 31 May 2012 or, if earlier,
on the takeover of the Company, into Ordinary Shares with an
aggregate value at conversion equal to 10 per cent of the increase in
shareholder value. With the consent of the Remuneration Committee,
participants may convert early up to one-third of their holdings in 2010
and in 2011. The number of Ordinary Shares arising on conversion will
be determined by reference to the average market price of an Ordinary
Share for 40 business days prior to conversion, or the takeover offer
price (as the case may be).
The increase in shareholder value is calculated as the difference
between the market capitalisation at conversion (determined by
reference to the average market price of an Ordinary Share for 
40 business days prior to conversion, or the offer price (as the case
may be)), and the net invested capital in Melrose PLC, being the
aggregate of the amounts paid on the Ordinary Shares up to
conversion less all amounts paid by Melrose PLC by way of dividends
or other distributions in respect of those shares, and where each such
amount shall be adjusted in line with the movement in the RPI 
(plus 2 per cent per annum) from July 2007 up to the month prior to
the relevant trigger date.
As at 31 December 2007 the fair value attributable to the 2007
Incentive Shares (including those held by the Employee Benefit Trust)
was calculated as £3.1 million. £2.7 million of this amount was
attributable to the executive Directors. Details of the Directors’
beneficial interest in the 2007 Incentive Shares are shown in the table
of Directors’ shareholdings later in this report.
All options over Original Incentive Shares were exercised on 
14 August 2007 resulting in the 293 Original Incentive Shares held 
by the Employee Benefit Trust converting into 25,279 Ordinary Shares
after the share consolidation exercise. The Employee Benefit Trust
also holds 3,000 2007 Incentive Shares and in due course may grant
options over these shares to executive Directors and/or senior
employees. The period during which the options may be exercised is
as detailed above for the 2007 Incentive Shares. 
Pension
No Director is a member of any Group pension arrangement. The
executive Directors may elect to receive a Company contribution to
their individual pension arrangement, or a supplement to basic salary
in lieu of a pension arrangement. Company contributions are
calculated on base salary only.
Service contracts 
The Company’s policy on Directors’ service contracts is that, in line
with the best practice provisions of the Combined Code, they should
be terminable by the Company on one year’s notice, and Directors’
contracts do not provide for predetermined compensation in the
event of termination. Any payments made would be determined by
reference to normal contractual principles with mitigation being
applied as appropriate. 
The non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but have
letters of appointment for an initial period of three years, which may
be renewed by mutual agreement, normally for a maximum of two
further three year terms. The terms of appointment do not contain
any contractual provisions regarding a notice period or the right to
receive compensation in the event of early termination. 
Details of the Directors’ contracts and letters of appointment are as
set out below.

Total shareholder return 
The Ordinary Share capital of Melrose PLC was admitted to the
Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange on 
9 December 2005. 
The performance of the Company’s Ordinary Shares compared with
the FTSE All Share Index and the FTSE Industrial Engineering Index for
the year ended on 31 December 2007 is shown in the graph below.
The Total Shareholder Return graph shows the value as at December
2007 of £100 invested in Melrose PLC in December 2005 (the month
when the Company was admitted to the Official List of the London
Stock Exchange), compared with £100 invested in the FTSE All Share
Index and the Industrial Engineering Sector. The FTSE All Share Index
applies for the period being tracked and has been used for these
purposes. The shareholder return has been adjusted to reflect the
return of capital to shareholders and the one for two share
consolidation, both of which took place during August 2007.

Mr Simon Peckham at an exercise price of £1 per share. No further options over Original Incentive Shares were granted between 1 January 2007
and 14 August 2007 .
The Remuneration Committee recommended, in the context of the disposal of McKechnie Aerospace and the return of capital to shareholders,
that it was appropriate for all options over the Original Incentive Shares to be exercised during 2007. This was approved by shareholders at the
Extraordinary General Meeting held on 14 August 2007 and subsequently these options were exercised on 14 August 2007 at an exercise
price of £1. 
There were no options over 2007 Incentive Shares outstanding as at 31 December 2007.
Following the early exercise of options over Original Incentive Shares and early conversion of Original Incentive Shares into Ordinary Shares of
0.1p each (the “Incentive Share Conversion”), each of the Directors agreed to enter into a lock-in undertaking with the Company, whereby they
undertook not to sell, transfer or in any way dispose of the Ordinary Shares acquired as a result of the Incentive Share Conversion before 
31 May 2009, or if earlier, on the takeover of the Company. The share price on the date of conversion used in the above table was £1.69875 
and the share price as of 31 December 2007 was £1.58.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
Directors’ Remuneration report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements
for each financial year. The Directors are required by the International
Accounting Standard (IAS) Regulation to prepare the Group financial
statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
as adopted by the European Union. The Group financial statements
are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
IAS 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for each
financial year the Company’s financial position, financial performance
and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects
of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s
Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial
statement. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be
achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, Directors
are also required to:
■
properly select and apply accounting policies;
■
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and 
■
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law). The parent company financial statements are
required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors
are required to:
■
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
■
make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
■
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been
followed; and
■
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent
company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation
in other jurisdictions.

Independent auditors’ report  
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Melrose PLC
on the consolidated financial statements 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Melrose PLC for
the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the consolidated
income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash
flow statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and
expense and the related notes 1 to 30. These consolidated financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out
therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
Remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial
statements of Melrose PLC for the year ended 31 December 2007.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration report and the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the consolidated financial
statements give a true and fair view, whether the consolidated financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and whether
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report described as having been
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information
given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the consolidated financial
statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes that
specific information presented in the Business review, Chief Executive’s
review and Finance Director’s review that is cross referred from the
Business review section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all
risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as
described in the contents section and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
consolidated financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend
to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the
Directors in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the consolidated financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the consolidated financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
■
the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its
profit for the year then ended;
■
the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; 
■
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report described as having
been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985; and
■
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs
As explained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also complied with the
IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements give a true and
fair view, in accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the Group’s affairs
as at 31 December 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended.

1 Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Melrose PLC for the year
ended 31 December 2007 were authorised in accordance with a
resolution of the Directors of Melrose PLC on 5 March 2008.
Melrose PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under
the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered office is given
on page 86. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal
activities are set out in note 5.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because
that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the
Company is based. Foreign operations are included in accordance with
the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following
Standards and Interpretations are in issue but not yet effective:
Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of financial statement – a revised
presentation
Amendments to IAS 23: Borrowing costs
Amendments to IFRS 2: Vesting conditions and cancellations
Amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1: Instruments puttable at fair value
Revised IFRS 3: Business combinations
Revised IAS 27: Consolidated and separate financial statements
IFRS 8: Operating segments
IFRIC 12: Service concession arrangements
IFRIC 13: Customer loyalty programmes
IFRIC 11: IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions
IFRIC 14: IAS 19 – Limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding
requirements and their interaction
In the current year the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments:
Disclosures, which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2007 , and the consequential amendments to 
IFRS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. The effect of the adoption
of IFRS 7 is to expand the disclosures provided in the financial
statements of the Group’s financial instruments and management of
capital, as detailed in note 24. IFRS 8 Operating Segments, IFRIC 11,
IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions and IFRIC 12 Service
Concession Arrangements were in issue at the date of authorisation of
the financial statements but not yet effective. IFRS 8 affects only
disclosures and therefore has no material impact on the financial
statements of the Group. IFRIC 11 will have no impact on the Group’s
financial statements but will affect the accounting by the Company for
share options it grants to the employees of its subsidiaries. IFRIC 12
relates to the accounting for service concession arrangements. 
However, IFRIC 12 is not yet endorsed for use in the European Union.
The European Commission is currently preparing an effect study and 
an endorsement decision is expected by mid 2008. 
The comparative information has been restated to show more
appropriate allocation of results following the disposal of the Aerospace
OEM (“OEM”), the Aerospace Aftermarket (“Aftermarket”), part of the
PSM division and the US corporate centre and classification of these
divisions as discontinued operations.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) and UK law. The
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs
adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
a historical cost basis. The consolidated financial statements are
presented in pound sterling and accounting policies adopted are
consistent with prior year.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of the parent
undertaking and all its subsidiary undertakings. The results of
businesses acquired during the period are included from the effective
date of acquisition and of those sold during the period to the effective
date of disposal.
Where Group accounting policies are not adopted in the financial
statements of subsidiary undertakings, appropriate adjustments are
made in the Group financial statements.
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits
arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Business combinations and goodwill
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase
method. The cost of acquisition is measured as the cash paid, and the
fair value of other assets given, and liabilities incurred or assumed at
the date of exchange and equity instruments issued by the Group in
exchange for control of the acquiree, plus costs directly attributable to
the acquisition. The acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are
measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the
cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets
acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of
acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired
(ie. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the
period of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of
the cost of the business combination over the acquirer’s interest in the
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less
any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for
impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Notes to the accounts
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  27/3/08  13:37  Page 40 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007  41
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
continued
Business combinations and goodwill continued
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of
the cash-generating units acquired. Impairment is determined by
assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, to which
goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
When there is a disposal of a cash generating unit, goodwill relating to
the operation disposed of is taken into account in determining the gain
or loss on disposal of that operation. The amount of goodwill allocated
to a partial disposal is measured on the basis of the relative values of the
operation disposed of and the operation retained.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity which is not a subsidiary undertaking but in
which the interest of the Group is that of a partner in a joint venture
over which the Group exercises joint control. The results, assets and
liabilities of joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting.
Exceptional costs/income
Exceptional costs/income are those costs/income of a significant and
non-recurring nature or those associated with significant restructuring
programmes.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging exceptional costs, crediting
exceptional income, profit on disposal of businesses and after the share
of results of joint ventures but before finance income and finance costs.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of
ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and can be reliably
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs
duties and sales taxes.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or
production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a
substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are
added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are
substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income
earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending
their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing
costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the
period in which they are incurred.
Issue costs of loans
The finance cost recognised in the income statement in respect of
capital instruments is allocated to periods over the terms of the
instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting practice requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ
from those estimates.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any impairment in value.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction
cost, and any costs directly attributable to bring the asset into operation.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid
and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
The capitalised value of a finance lease is also included within property,
plant and equipment.
For property, the deemed cost as at the date of transition to IFRS was
the fair value at the date of the last valuation of these assets less
accumulated depreciation until the date of transition.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold land nil 
Freehold buildings and over expected economic life not
long leasehold property exceeding 50 years
Short leasehold property over the term of the lease
Plant and other equipment 3-12 years
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are
reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives
are accounted for prospectively.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and
where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount,
the assets are written down to their recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment is the greater of
net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that
does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable
amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset
belongs and allocated proportionately.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies
continued
Property, plant and equipment continued
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included
in the income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses.
On acquisition of businesses, separately identifiable intangible assets
are determined in relation to the specific circumstances of the business
acquired and are valued on an appropriate basis.
Access to the use of patented technology and trade names are valued
using a “relief from royalty” method which determines the net present
value of future additional cash flows arising from the use of the
intangible asset.
Customer relationships are valued on the basis of the net present value
of the future additional cash flows arising from customer relationships
with appropriate allowance for attrition of customers.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are:
Patented technology 5 years or less
Customer relationships 10 years or less
Trade names 20 years or less
Computer software is initially recorded at cost. Where these assets have
been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair
value allocated in the acquisition accounting. Where these have been
acquired other than through a business combination, the initial cost is
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other
consideration given to acquire the asset.
Computer software assets are amortised over their estimated useful
lives (up to five years) on a straight line basis.
As with property, plant and equipment, intangible assets are tested for
impairment annually or more frequently whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Impairment losses are measured on a similar basis to
property, plant and equipment. Useful lives are also examined on an
annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a
prospective basis.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Clearly defined and identifiable development projects in which the
technical degree of exploitation, adequacy of resources and potential
market or development possibility in the undertaking are recognisable,
and where it is the intention to produce, market or execute the project,
are capitalised when a correlation exists between the costs incurred
and future benefits and the costs can be measured reliably. Costs not
meeting such criteria are expensed as incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost includes all direct expenditure and appropriate production
overhead expenditure incurred in bringing goods to their current state
under normal operating conditions. Net realisable value is based on
estimated selling price less costs expected to be incurred to completion
and disposal. Provision has been made for obsolescence or other losses
where necessary.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice 
amount less an allowance for doubtful debts. An allowance is recorded
for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated
recoverable amount.
Cash and cash equivalent
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash in
hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less which are
subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and
cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair
value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with
the borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue
costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in net profit or loss when the liabilities
are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation
process.

Leases
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and
benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the
inception of the lease at the fair value of the lease or, if lower, at the
present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are
apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease
liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at
fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised
cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly
discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of
the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure
to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, arising from operating
and financing activities. The Group does not hold or issue derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes. Details of derivative financial
instruments are disclosed in note 24 of the financial statements.
Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are detailed in note 25.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value.
Their fair value is recalculated at each reporting date. The accounting
treatment for the resulting gain or loss will depend on whether the
derivative qualifies for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or
losses on the revaluation to fair value at the period end is recognised
immediately in the income statement. Where derivatives qualify for
hedge accounting, recognition of any resulting gain or loss on
revaluation depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the 
item being hedged.
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of less than one
year from the Balance Sheet date are classified as current in the
Balance Sheet. 
Hedge accounting
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to
document from inception the relationship between the item being
hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to
document and demonstrate the relationship between the hedged item
and the hedging instrument, showing that the hedge will be highly
effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is performed at
each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the
hedging relationship, the hedge instrument expires or is sold,
terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, as either fair 
value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in
foreign operations.
Fair value hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when
they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a
recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that
are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the
income statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair
value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
Cash flow hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when
they hedge the Group’s exposure to the variability in cash flows that are
either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or
liability, or a highly probable forecasted cash flow. 
The effective portion of any gain or loss from revaluing the derivative
financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. The gain or loss
relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the
income statement as part of other income or other expense. 
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled to the income statement in the
periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the
recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains
and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Derivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges
when they hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations.
The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from
revaluing the derivative at a reporting period end is recognised directly
in equity. Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the
income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recognised immediately in
the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount
of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to
be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the
reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the
reimbursement is virtually certain is the expense relating to any provision
presented in the income statement, net of any reimbursement. If the
effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that
reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and,
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is
used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is
recognised as a finance cost.
Environmental liabilities
Liabilities for environmental costs are recognised when environmental
assessments or clean-ups are probable and the associated costs can
be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these provisions
coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action. The amount
recognised is the best estimate of the expenditure required. Where the
liability will not be settled for a number of years, the amount recognised
is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
Employee Benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave
and sick leave are accrued in the year in which the associated services
are rendered by employees of the Group. The accounting policy for
pensions and other post-retirement benefits is described below.
The Group also operates divisional long term incentive plans (LTIPs) for
certain employees. The expected settlement costs of these plans are
expensed on a straight line basis over the life of the Plan.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes and defined
contribution schemes, which require contributions to be made to
administered funds separate from the Group. In some jurisdictions,
funds are not administered separately from the Group but appropriate
liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet.
For the defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans, plan
assets are measured at fair value and plan liabilities are measured on
an actuarial basis, using the projected unit credit method and
discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current rate of return on
a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the
Plan liabilities.
The service cost of providing pension and other post-retirement
benefits to employees for the period is charged to the income
statement. The cost of making improvements to pension and other
post-retirement benefits is recognised in the income statement on a
straight line basis over the period during which the increase in benefits
vests. To the extent that the improvement in benefits vests
immediately, the cost is recognised immediately. These costs are
recognised as an expense.
A charge representing the unwinding of the discount on the Plan
liabilities during the period is included within other finance costs.
A credit representing the expected return on the Plan assets during the
period is included within other finance costs. This credit is based on the
market value of the Plan assets, and expected rates of return, at the
beginning of the year.
Actuarial gains and losses may result from: differences between the
expected return and the actual return on plan assets; differences
between the actuarial assumptions underlying the Plan liabilities and
actual experience during the period; or changes in the actuarial
assumptions used in the valuation of the Plan liabilities. Actuarial gains
and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognised in the statement of
recognised income and expense.
For defined contribution plans, contributions payable for the year are
charged to the income statement as an operating expense.
Foreign currency translation
The individual financial statements of each Group company are
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the
consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of
each Group company are expressed in pound sterling, which is the
functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for
the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies,
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on
the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-
monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair
value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies
continued
Foreign currency translation continued
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on
the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement
for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-
monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement
for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-
monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised
directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component
of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the
Group enters into forward contracts and options (see above for details of
the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial
instruments).
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the
assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and
expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the
period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period,
in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and
transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in
which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity
and translated at the closing rate.
Taxation
Tax expense represents the sum of the tax paid or currently payable
and deferred tax.
The tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the period. Taxable
profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary
differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting
purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary
differences:
■
except where the deferred tax liability arises on goodwill that is not
tax deductible or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or
loss; and
■
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with
investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be
controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary
differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses,
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available
against which the deductible temporary differences, and carry-forward
of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised:
■
except where the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
■
in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with
investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures,
deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is
probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the
foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance
sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the
deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are
expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is
settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or
substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity
and not in the income statement.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of
sales tax except:
■
where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is
not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales
tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as
part of the expense item as applicable; and
■
receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax
included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the 
taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the
balance sheet.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies
continued
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based
Payments. The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant
date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of
non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model. The expected
life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and
behavioural considerations.
3 Critical accounting judgments
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as set out in note 2,
management has made critical accounting judgements in the
determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, the
quantification of provisions and the impairment of goodwill and
intangible assets. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making
assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes will differ from those
assumptions and estimates. An analysis of the key sources of estimation
uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year is provided below.
Provisions
The quantification of certain liabilities within provisions (for
environmental remediation obligations and for future legal costs in
relation to certain claims) have been estimated. However, such liabilities
depend on the actions of third parties and on the specific circumstances
pertaining to each obligation, neither of which is controlled by the Group.
Impairment of non-current assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be
impaired and at least annually. Such events and circumstances include
the effects of restructuring initiated by management. 
To determine whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the
value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been
allocated. The value in use calculation requires management to
estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-
generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present
value. The carrying amount of intangible assets at the balance sheet
date was £207 .4m (2006: £356.2m). At 31 December 2007 , the
Group recognised no impairment loss in respect of these assets but
impairment losses could arise if changes are necessary to the
assumptions underlying the estimates in future cash flows of cash
generating units or if there are changes in market interest rates which
affect the discount rates applied to the cash flow.
Retirement benefit obligations
In assessing the Group’s obligations relating to retirement benefits,
management made key assumptions relating to current and future
mortality, expected returns on plan assets, discount rates and inflation.
Intangible assets
The valuation of intangible assets in respect of customer relations
requires management to estimate the additional future cash flows
arising from those relationships after eliminating attrition factor
(“customer churn”) relevant to the customer relationship and to other
factors such as access to the workforce, which were appropriate to the
determination of the additional cash flows.
Fair values at acquisition
On the acquisitions of the two businesses in Canada, Dynacast
management have made assumptions regarding the fair value of assets
and liabilities acquired in conjunction with professional advisors and
have applied hindsight where appropriate to the circumstances of
particular assets/liabilities. Estimations were made, in particular, of
intangible assets, plant and equipment, deferred tax liabilities, inventory
and provisions.

5 Segment information
The Group’s primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary reporting format is geographical segments. The operating businesses
are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic
business unit that offers different products and serves different markets. All reported revenue is derived from one activity, the sale of goods.
During the period, the Group discontinued its operations in the OEM, Aftermarket, part of the PSM division and the US corporate centre segments.
The Dynacast segment is a supplier of die-cast parts and components to a range of industries. McKechnie Vehicle Components (“MVC”) supplies
exterior trim products to major vehicle manufacturers in the USA. McKechnie Plastic Components (“MPC”) is a UK supplier of plastic injection
moulded and extruded components to the automotive, consumer durable, IT and other industries. The McKechnie PSM (“PSM”) continuing
segment consists of the specialised Prelok and Canning Brett businesses and is now included in the MPC segment for reporting purposes.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The Group’s geographical segments are determined by the location of the Group’s assets and operations. Inter segment sales are not material and
have not been included in the analysis below.

The Dynacast restructuring costs in 2007 relate mainly to the acquisitions of Techmire and QZD in Canada. The Dynacast restructuring costs in
2006 related to the closure of the Spartanburg, South Carolina, USA manufacturing facility. 
During the year ended 31 December 2007 , the old plater was replaced at MVC and as a result an impairment against the carrying value of the asset
was made.
On 14 August 2007 , the Shareholders approved the early crystallisation of the Melrose Original Incentive Scheme resulting in an accelerated IFRS 2
charge and associated National Insurance charge. 
The MPC restructure costs related to the closure of the Northampton manufacturing facility in 2006. 
The pre-disposal costs in 2006 related to the sale of divisions which were completed in 2007 .

Following the disposal of the OEM division, all employees in this segment belonging to the McKechnie UK defined benefit pension plan became
deferred members. The curtailment gain associated with this was £1.1 million.
During the year ended 31 December 2006, land and buildings held in the MPC business segment were sold in a sale and leaseback transaction
resulting in a net profit of £0.7 million. 
Upon acquisition of the McKechnie Group in May 2005, an onerous contract was identified and appropriate provision was made based on the
circumstances prevailing at acquisition. During 2006, the terms of the contract were renegotiated and the improved terms of the contract were
reflected in the accounts resulting in a release to the income statement of £2.3 million.

Goodwill has been allocated to the business segments, each of which comprises several cash generating units as follows:

£m £m
Dynacast 164.5 157.8

MPC (including Prelok) 3.2 –
PSM – 20.4
183.5 307.8
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The goodwill recognised on the acquisition of the continuing McKechnie PSM (“PSM”) segment has been aggregated within the MPC cash
generating unit.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the cash generating units. The growth rates are based on a prudent estimate of industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct
costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash flows
based on estimated growth rates of between 2% and 2.5%. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The discount rate applied is between 9% and 12% depending on the risk elements associated with each division and the funding structure of each
division. MVC is currently loss making and the impairment test takes into account the profit improvement plan.

The adjustments to the carrying value on acquisitions above have been processed to represent the fair value of the assets acquired.
The businesses acquired above contributed £5.1 million revenue and £0.2 million headline operating profit during the period since acquisition.
Disclosure of the revenue and profit of the acquired businesses for the year, as though the acquisition date for both acquisitions had occurred at
the beginning of the year, is not practical to obtain as not all of the trade and assets were acquired.
The goodwill arising on the above acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the distribution of the Group’s products and the
anticipated future operating synergies in the combination.
A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership interest is given in 
note 3 to the Company’s separate financial statements.

Trade payables are non-interest bearing. Normal settlement terms vary by country, usually being between 30 and 90 days. Other payables are 
non-interest bearing and have an average term of approximately two months.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

The interest rate re-pricing profile of financial liabilities, after taking into account hedging interest rate derivatives, is described in note 24.
As described in note 25, the 9,053,594 Redeemable Preference C Shares will be redeemed on 30 June 2008 at a value of £7 .4 million. These
shares have been discounted at 6% to show the fair value as at 31 December 2007 of £7 .2 million and in accordance with the applicable
accounting standards the liability is not included in net debt as shown in the net debt reconciliation.
Maturity of Financial liabilities
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows including interest in relation to the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities, on an
undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:

The Group has a committed bank facility that provides a term loan and revolver facility. This facility expires in April 2010 and throughout the year the
Group complied with the covenants. The revolver facility is for £30 million and is available for general corporate purposes. At 31 December 2007 ,
the undrawn amount of the revolver facility was £25.0 million (2006: £18.7 million). The utilisations relate to the issue of bank guarantees and
letters of credit. The revolver facility incurs commitment fees and provides funding at floating rates.

The provision for onerous contracts relates to the losses on contracts acquired upon purchase of subsidiaries and to a property lease.
The provision for surplus leasehold property costs is the estimated net rentals payable over the period of the leases together with any dilapidation
costs discounted at 6% (2006: 6%). 
Environmental remediation provisions relate to the estimated clean up costs of pollution, soil contamination and legal costs at certain subsidiaries.
Factory closure costs relate to restructuring programmes around the group.
Included in the incentive scheme related provisions is £1.4m (2006: £0.3m) relating to long term incentive plans and £0.1m (2006: £1.2m)
relating to National Insurance on Incentive Shares.
The warranty provision has arisen as a result of the disposals during 2007 .
Other provisions relate mainly to the estimated legal costs arising from claims for which no other liability is expected to crystallise.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £167 million (2006: £204 million) available for offset against future profits. 
A deferred tax asset of £3.1 million (2006: £29.8 million) has been recognised. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the
remaining £164 million (2006: £146 million) due to the geographical split of future profit streams. These losses may be carried forward
indefinitely, subject to certain continuity of business requirements.
A significant part of the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Group accounts relates to the McKechnie Pension Plan. No deferred tax
asset has been recognised on this obligation due to the unpredictability of future profit streams in the United Kingdom. A small deferred tax asset 
of £0.9 million is recognised with respect to certain overseas pension schemes and is included within the tax losses and other assets category.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred
tax liabilities have not been recognised was £1.5 million (2006: £1.5 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences
because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
22 Share based payments
Original equity-settled share incentive scheme
The Company had 59,170 Convertible B Shares (“Original Incentive Shares”) held by Directors, employees and the Melrose Employee Benefit
Trust (the “EBT”) which were due to convert shortly after 31 May 2009, or earlier on a takeover of the Company, into Ordinary Shares with an
aggregate value on conversion equal to 10% of the increase in shareholder value. 50,000 of these shares were issued to Directors and employees
in 2003 and a further 9,170 shares were issued to the EBT in 2005. During 2006 options were granted over 8,877 of the 9,170 shares to Directors
and senior employees. All options over Original Incentive Shares were exercised on 14 August 2007 at an exercise price of £1.
On 14 August 2007 , at an Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM”), shareholders approved resolutions to crystallise the Original Incentive Share
Scheme, into 10,210,069 Ordinary Shares and 59,170 Deferred Incentive Shares, based on the increased market value accrued up to 18 July
2007 . As a consequence of crystallising the Original Incentive Share arrangements, in the second half of the year an exceptional charge of £1.1
million relating to the remaining IFRS 2 charge on the Original Incentive Shares and an exceptional charge of £0.8 million relating to the accelerated
National Insurance charge occurred. The 59,170 Deferred Incentive Shares were repurchased by the Company for an aggregate sum of one penny.
New 2007 Incentive Scheme
At the EGM, shareholders approved the increase of the Company’s authorised share capital by £50,000 in respect of the new 2007 Incentive
Share Scheme following the crystallisation of the Original Incentive Share Scheme. The conversion formula for the new 2007 Incentive Shares is
based upon principles identical to the conversion formula for the Original Incentive Shares and, broadly provides for the new 2007 Incentive
Shares to convert into Ordinary Shares equal to 10 per cent of the increase in shareholder value from 18 July 2007 (excluding the Return of
Capital). As with the Original Incentive Shares, the new 2007 Incentive Shares have early “trigger dates” upon which the Remuneration Committee
can permit up to one third of the new 2007 Incentive Shares held by a 2007 Incentive Shareholder to be converted into Ordinary Shares. The early
trigger dates for the new 2007 Incentive Shares will be on 31 May in each of the years 2010 and 2011. On 31 May 2012, the final trigger date, all
unconverted new 2007 Incentive Shares will convert into Ordinary Shares in accordance with the formula set out in the Company’s Articles. The
Articles do not permit holders of new 2007 Incentive Shares to convert more than two thirds of their holding of such shares before 31 May 2012.
The rights and restrictions of the new 2007 Incentive Shares are similar to the rights and restrictions of the Original Incentive Shares. 3,000 of the
new 2007 Incentive Shares are held by the EBT. 
The estimated fair value attributable to these new Incentive Shares using a Black Scholes option pricing model was £3.7 million.

including National Insurance charges. 
23 Retirement benefit obligations
Prior to the acquisition, McKechnie and Dynacast had established a number of pension schemes covering many of its employees and operating 
in several jurisdictions.
The most significant schemes are:
■
The UK McKechnie Pension Plan (the “Plan”) which provides defined benefit pensions for its members. The assets of the Plan are held in 
a fund administered by McKechnie Pension Trust Limited, an independent trustee company. An actuarial valuation of the Plan was carried out 
at 31 December 2005 by a qualified independent actuary. Plan assets are stated at their bid value at 31 December 2007 .
■
The Dynacast and MVC Pension Schemes in the US are funded schemes of a defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee
administered funds.
■
In Germany and Austria, unfunded defined benefit arrangements are operated by Dynacast.
■
There are also obligations to provide post retirement healthcare to former employees of MVC and to provide termination indemnities in Italy and
France to current Dynacast employees.

Mortality
The mortality assumption for the Plan has been strengthened during the year. At 31 December 2006, a position of halfway between the PA 92
base tables and the PA 92 medium cohort tables was adopted. The mortality assumptions at 31 December 2007 relate to the PA 92 medium
cohort tables with an age adjustment of two years and an improvement floor of 1%. This is considered appropriate given the Plan’s geographical
and industrial sector. This added £7 .6 million to the liabilities at 31 December 2007 .
The average life expectancy underlying the value of defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2007 , which have been determined by reference
to applicable mortality statistics are set out below:

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and short term deposits and trade and other receivables which represent the Group’s maximum
exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for
doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic
environment. Note 16 provides further details of the Group’s policies regarding recovery of trade receivables.
Fair values
The Directors consider that the financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values.
Foreign exchange contracts
As at 31 December 2007 , the Group held foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate expected exchange fluctuations on cashflows over the
next 12 months on sales to customers and purchases from suppliers. These instruments operate as cash flow hedges. The terms of the contracts
are as follows: 
31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December
2007 2007 2006 2006

The foreign exchange forward contracts all mature between January 2008 and December 2008.
The fair value of the contracts at 31 December 2007 was an asset of £0.4m (2006: £0.3 million).

Hedge of net investments in foreign entities
Included in interest bearing loans in 2006 were the following amounts which were designated as hedges of net investments in the Group’s
subsidiaries in Europe and USA and were being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risks. On 15 May 2007 following the disposal of
the OEM and Aftermarket divisions, these loans were repaid in full.
Borrowings in local currency:

US dollar – 111.8

Up to the date of repayment, gains on the retranslation of these borrowings of £0.3 million (2006: £16.9 million) have been transferred to equity
to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in subsidiaries.
Market risk
A one percentage point rise in market interest rates for all currencies would increase profit before tax by the following amounts:

£m £m
Sterling 0.1 0.1
US dollar 0.1 0.1
Euro 0.1 0.1
At 31 December 2007 , the Group had net cash of £32.4 million and as at 31 December 2006, the Group had net debt of £162.6 million which
comprised £190.4 million of bank term borrowings and net cash of £27 .8 million. At 31 December 2006, a one percentage point rise in market
interest rates only impacts the net cash balance due to the interest rate exposure on the bank term borrowings being fixed by the Group’s interest
rate instruments.
Interest rate swaps and caps
Prior to 15 May 2007 , the Group had bank term borrowings of US $219.3 million, 187 .3 million and £15.0 million. As a consequence of the sale of
the Aerospace division on 11 May 2007 and the majority of the PSM division on 18 May 2007 , the Group repaid the US dollar and euro term
borrowings and partly repaid the sterling borrowing leaving a balance of £11.0 million.
Prior to the disposals, the Group used interest rate derivatives to manage its exposure to floating interest rates on these bank term borrowings. 
The Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its US dollar bank borrowings by swapping from floating
to fixed interest rates. Two contracts with total nominal values of US $219.3 million had fixed interest rates at an average rate of 4.09 per cent for
periods up to July 2007 . Following the repayment of the US $219.3 million bank borrowing, the two interest rate swaps were sold back to the bank
counterparties generating a receipt of US $0.7 million which was credited to finance income. 
The Group also used interest rate caps to manage its exposure to movements in sterling and euro interest rates. Two caps with a total notional
principal amount of £20 million and a cap level of 5% were held to hedge exposure on the Group’s sterling borrowings up to July 2007 . Two caps
with a total notional principal amount of 187 .3 million and a cap level of 3% were held to hedge exposure on the Group’s euro borrowings up to
July 2007 . Following the repayment of the euro bank borrowing and the reduction of the sterling borrowing, with the remaining sterling borrowing
being rolled into July 2007 , the four interest rate caps were sold back to the bank counterparties generating a receipt of 10.2 million which was
credited to finance income.
All interest rate swaps and interest rate caps were designated as cash flow hedges. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s policy for managing foreign currency risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review.

On 14 August 2007 at an Extraordinary General Meeting, Shareholders approved resolutions to return capital of £220 million to Shareholders.
The Return of Capital took place by increasing the authorised share capital by £220 million by the issue of 267 ,330,058 Redeemable Preference C
Shares (“C Shares”) of 82.3 pence nominal value each and capitalising £214.6 million of the Share Premium Account and £5.0 million of the
Merger Reserve to pay up in full the C Shares. The C Shares were allotted on the basis of one C Share for each Ordinary Share of 0.1p each held on 
15 August 2007 . Shareholders had the option to receive the cash value inherent in the C Share by way of income or two capital options. As a result
of the choices made by Shareholders in respect of the Return of Capital:
■
187 ,786,984 C Shares were redeemed and subsequently cancelled with effect from 23 August 2007 . 
■
9,053,594 C Shares will be redeemed on 30 June 2008. 
■
70,489,480 C Shares were paid a dividend which was payable on 23 August 2007 and these C Shares converted into Deferred C Shares.
Both the remaining 9.1 million C Shares and 70.5 million Deferred C Shares carry no voting rights or rights to dividends.
With the conversion of the Original Incentive Shares on 14 August 2007 , the allotted Ordinary Share capital increased to 267 ,330,058. On 
15 August 2007 a 1 for 2 share consolidation process reduced the issued Ordinary Share capital to 133,665,029 shares of 0.2p each with 
the first day of trading being the 16 August 2007 .
Redemption of the Deferred C Shares on 30 June 2008 will result in a £58.0 million transfer from share capital into the Capital Redemption Reserve.
The rights of each class of share are described in the Directors’ report.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Melrose PLC
on the parent Company financial statements
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Melrose
PLC for the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the
balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 13. These parent Company
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein.
We have reported separately on the consolidated financial statements
of Melrose PLC for the year ended 31 December 2007 and on the
information in the Directors’ Remuneration report that is described as
having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have
formed.
Respective responsibilities of 
directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration report and the parent Company financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent
Company financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you
whether in our opinion the Directors’ Report is consistent with the
parent Company financial statements. The information given in the
Directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the
Business review and Finance Directors’ review that is cross referred
from the Business review section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as
described in the contents section and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited parent Company financial statements. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent
Company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the
amounts and disclosures in the parent Company financial statements.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the parent
Company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the parent Company financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the parent Company financial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
■
the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view,
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December
2007;
■
the parent Company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
■
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the
parent Company financial statements.

1 Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the company are presented as
required by the Companies Act 1985. They have been prepared under
the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”) and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all
been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year. 
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost
less provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration, including 
the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by
reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued. Any premium
is ignored.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised as interest payable in the income
statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Issue costs of loans
The finance cost recognised in the income statement in respect of
capital instruments is allocated to periods over the terms of the
instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any impairment in value.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction
cost, and any costs directly attributable to bring the asset into operation.
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid
and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
The capitalised value of a finance lease is also included within property,
plant and equipment.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold land nil
Freehold buildings and over expected economic life not
long leasehold property exceeding 50 years
Short leasehold property over the term of the lease
Plant and other equipment 3-12 years
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are
reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives
are accounted for prospectively.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and
where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount,
the assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment is
the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash
inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating
unit to which the asset belongs. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in
the income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash in
hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less which
are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
Notes to the company balance sheet
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  25/3/08  14:21  Page 78 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007  79
1 Significant accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance
sheet at cost and subsequently remeasured to their fair value. The
method of recognising the resulting gain or loss is dependent on
whether the derivative contract is designed to hedge a specific risk and
qualifies for hedge accounting. On the date a derivative contract is
entered into, the Group designates derivatives which qualify as hedges
for accounting purposes as either a) a hedge of the fair value of a
recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge), or b) a hedge of a
forecast transaction or firm commitment (cash flow hedge) or 
c) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives which are fair value hedges and
that are highly effective are recognised in the income statement, along
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is
attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the fair value of derivatives in
cash flow hedges are recognised in equity. Where the forecasted
transaction or firm commitment results in the recognition of an asset or
liability, the gains and losses previously included in equity are included
in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. Otherwise, amounts
recorded in equity are transferred to the income statement and
classified as revenue or expense in the same period in which the
forecasted transaction affects the income statement.
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for similarly
to cash flow hedges. The Group hedges certain net investments in
foreign entities with foreign currency borrowings. All foreign exchange
gains or losses arising on translation are recognised in equity and
included in cumulative translation differences.
Certain derivative instruments, while providing effective economic
hedges under the Group’s policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify
for cash flow hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the
income statement.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair
value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with
the borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue
costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in net profit or loss when the liabilities are
derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based
Payments. The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant
date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of
non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model. The expected
life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and
behavioural considerations.

2 Profit for the year
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.
Melrose PLC reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2007 of £233.3 million (2006: £16.0 million). The Company paid 
a dividend of £13.0 million during the year and in addition, the shareholders authorised a return of capital of £220 million of which £212.6 million
was paid during the year. Details are given in note 10 to the Group accounts.
The Company has unused tax losses of approximately £17 .3 million (2006: £nil) available to carry forward and offset against future profits. No
deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to uncertainty over future taxable profits arising in the foreseeable future. 
The estimated value of the deferred tax asset not recognised at 28% is £4.7 million. 
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £0.2 million (2006: £0.4 million).

8 Called-up share capital continued
On 14 August 2007 at an Extraordinary General Meeting, Shareholders approved resolutions to return capital of £220 million to Shareholders.
The Return of Capital took place by increasing the authorised share capital by £220 million by the creation of 267 ,330,058 Redeemable Preference
C Shares (“C Shares”) of 82.3 pence nominal value each and capitalising £214.6 million of the Share Premium Account and £5.0 million of the
Merger Reserve to pay up in full the C Shares. The C Shares were allotted on the basis of one C Share for each Ordinary Share of 0.1p each held on
15 August 2007 . Shareholders had the option to receive the cash value inherent in the C Share by way of income or two capital options.
As a result of the choices made by Shareholders in respect of the Return of Capital:
■
187 ,786,984 C Shares were redeemed and subsequently cancelled with effect from 23 August 2007 . 
■
9,053,594 C Shares will be redeemed on 30 June 2008. 
■
70,489,480 C Shares were paid a dividend which was payable on 23 August 2007 and these C Shares converted into Deferred C Shares.
Both the remaining 9.1 million C Shares and 70.5 million Deferred C Shares carry no voting rights or rights to dividends.
With the conversion of the Original Incentive Shares on 14 August 2007 , the allotted Ordinary Share capital increased to 267 ,330,058. 
On 15 August 2007 a 1 for 2 share consolidation process reduced the allotted Ordinary Share capital to 133,665,029 shares of 0.2p each with 
the first day of trading being the 16 August 2007 .
Redemption of the Deferred C Shares on 30 June 2008 will result in a £58.0 million transfer from share capital into the Capital Redemption Reserve.
The rights of each class of share are described in the Directors’ report.

8. That with effect from the conclusion of the meeting, the Company
adopt the new Articles of Association produced to the meeting

10. That, in substitution for all existing authorities the Directors be

80 of the Companies Act 1985 (the “Act”) to exercise all the
powers of the Company to allot relevant securities (within the
meaning of that section) up to an aggregate nominal amount of
£89,110. This authority will expire (unless previously renewed,

following the passing of this resolution, save that the Company

general authority conferred by resolution 10 as if section 89(1) of
the Act did not apply to the allotment, provided that the power

equity securities, open for acceptance for a period fixed by the
Directors, to holders of Ordinary Shares made in proportion (as

entitlements; and
b) to deal with legal or practical problems arising in any overseas

receipts, the requirements of any regulatory body or stock
exchange, or any matter whatsoever.
The power conferred on the Directors by this resolution shall also
apply to a sale of Treasury shares, which is an allotment of equity
securities by virtue of section 94(3A) of the Act but with the
omission of the words “pursuant to the general authority conferred
by resolution 10”.

Notes
These notes are important and require your immediate attention.
1. The holders of Ordinary Shares and 2007 Incentive Shares in the
Company are entitled to attend the Annual General Meeting, but
only holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to vote. A member
entitled to attend and vote may appoint a proxy to exercise all or
any of its rights to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting of
the Company. Such a member may appoint more than one proxy,
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights
attached to different shares. A proxy need not be a member of the
Company.
2. A form of proxy is enclosed with this notice. To be effective, a form
of proxy must be completed, signed and deposited, together with
any power of attorney or authority under which it is signed or a
certified copy of such power or authority, with the Company’s
registrars at the address specified on the form of proxy not less than
48 hours (excluding any part of a day that is not a working day)
before the time for holding the meeting. Depositing a completed
form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending the
meeting and voting in person.
3. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated
under section 146 of the CA 2006 to enjoy information rights (a
“Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him and
the shareholder by whom he was nominated, have a right to be
appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the
Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy
appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he may, under
any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the
shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
4. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities
Regulations 2001, to be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual
General Meeting (and for the purposes of the determination by the
Company of the number of votes they may cast), members must
be entered on the Company’s register of members by 6.00 pm on
5 May 2008. Changes to entries on the register of members after
this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any
person to attend or vote at the meeting.
5. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the
meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that
(i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the
meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote
on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other
corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting,
then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting
directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or
withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with
those directions; and
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  27/3/08  17:48  Page 88 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2007  89
(ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same
corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate
shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting 
as its corporate representative, a designated corporate
representative will be nominated, from those corporate
representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the
other corporate representatives will give voting directions to 
that designated corporate representative. 
Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and
corporate representatives – www.icsa.org.uk– for further details of this
procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of representation
letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.
6. As at 28 March 2008 (being the last business day prior to the
publication of this Notice) the Company’s issued share capital
consists of 133,665,029 Ordinary Shares, carrying one vote each.
Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at 28 March
2008 are 133,665,029.
7. Copies of the following documents will be available for inspection
at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours
(Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) from the date
of this notice until the date of the Annual General Meeting and at
the place of the Annual General Meeting for 15 minutes prior to
and during the meeting:
a) the register of Directors’ interests in shares of the Company;
b) copies of all service agreements under which directors of the
Company are employed by the Company or any subsidiaries; 
c) a copy of the terms of appointment of the non-executive
Directors of the Company; and
d) a copy of the proposed new Articles of Association to be
adopted pursuant to resolution 8.
Explanatory notes on principal changes to the Company’s
Articles of Association
1. Articles which duplicate statutory provisions 
Provisions in the current Articles which replicate provisions contained
in CA 2006 are in the main amended to bring them into line with it.
Certain examples of such provisions include provisions as to the form
of resolutions, the variation of class rights and provisions regarding the
period of notice required to convene general meetings. The main
changes made to reflect this approach are detailed below.
2. Form of resolution
The current Articles contain a provision that, where for any purpose an
ordinary resolution is required, a special or extraordinary resolution is
also effective and that, where an extraordinary resolution is required, a
special resolution is also effective. This provision is being amended as
the concept of extraordinary resolutions has not been retained under
CA 2006. 
Article 72 of the current Articles enables members to act by written
resolution. Under CA 2006 public companies can no longer pass
written resolutions. This provision has therefore been removed in the
proposed new Articles. 
3. Variation of class rights
The current Articles contain, in Article 73, provisions regarding the
variation of class rights. The proceedings and specific quorum
requirements for a meeting convened to vary class rights are contained
in CA 2006. The relevant provisions have therefore been amended in
the proposed new Articles. 
4. Convening general meetings
Article 48 in the current Articles, which deals with the convening of
general meetings and the length of notice required to convene general
meetings, is being amended to conform to new provisions in CA
2006. In particular a general meeting (other than an annual general
meeting) to consider a special resolution can be convened on 14
days’ notice whereas previously 21 days’ notice was required.
5. Votes of members
Under the CA 2006 proxies are entitled to vote on a show of hands
whereas under the current Articles proxies are only entitled to vote on
a poll. Multiple proxies may be appointed provided that each proxy is
appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share held by
the shareholder. Multiple corporate representatives may be appointed
in accordance with CA 2006. The proposed new Articles reflect all of
these new provisions. 
6. Age of directors on appointment
Article 85 of the current Articles require a director's age to be disclosed
if he has attained the age of 70 years or more in the notice convening
a meeting at which the Director is proposed to be elected or re-elected.
This provision has been amended in the proposed new Articles

7. Electronic and web communications
Provisions of CA 2006 enable companies to communicate with
members by electronic and/or website communications. The
proposed new Articles continue to allow communications to members
in electronic form and, in addition, permit the Company to take
advantage of the new provisions relating to website communications. 
Before the Company can communicate with a member by means of
website communication, the relevant member must be asked
individually by the Company to agree that the Company may send or
supply documents or information to him by means of a website, and
the Company must either have received a positive response, or, as
provided by CA 2006, if no response is received within the period of
28 days beginning with the date on which the request was sent, may
deem receipt of a positive response. The Company will notify the
member (either in writing, or by other permitted means) when a
relevant document or information is placed on the website. If required,
a member can request a hard copy version at any time. 
8. Conflicts of interest
CA 2006 sets out directors’ general duties which largely codify the
existing law but with some changes. Under CA 2006, from 1 October
2008 a Director must avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a
direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict with the
Company’s interests. The requirement is very broad and could apply,
for example, if a director becomes a director of another company or a
trustee of another organisation. CA 2006 allows directors of public
companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where
appropriate, where the Articles of Association contain a provision to
this effect. CA 2006 also allows the Articles of Association to contain
other provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid
a breach of duty. The proposed new Articles give the Directors
authority to approve such situations and to include other provisions to
allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a similar way to the
current position. 
There are safeguards which will apply when Directors decide whether
to authorise a conflict or potential conflict. Firstly, only Directors who
have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the
relevant decision, and secondly, in taking the decision the Directors
must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to
promote the Company’s success. The Directors will be able to impose
limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is
appropriate.
It is also proposed that the new Articles should contain provisions
relating to confidential information, attendance at Board meetings and
availability of Board papers to protect a Director being in breach of
duty if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest arises. These
provisions will only apply where the position giving rise to the potential
conflict has previously been authorised by the Directors.
The relevant new provisions are expressed to take effect from the date
on which the relevant CA 2006 provisions come into force. Until that
date, the existing provisions on conflicts of interests will remain
effective.
It is the Board’s intention to report annually on the Company’s
procedures for ensuring that the Board’s powers to authorise conflicts
are operated effectively.
9. Directors’ indemnities and loans to fund expenditure
CA 2006 has widened the scope of the powers of a company to
indemnify directors. In particular, a company that is a trustee of an
occupational pension scheme can now indemnify a director against
liability incurred in connection with that company’s activities as a
trustee of that scheme. A company may also grant indemnities to
directors of associated companies. In addition, the existing exemption
allowing a company to provide money for the purpose of funding a
director's defence in court proceedings now expressly covers
regulatory proceedings and applies to associated companies.

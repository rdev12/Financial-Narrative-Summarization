Our investment case
Our industry
The distribution of plumbing and 
heating and building materials 
principally to trade customers. 
The key characteristics of our 
industry are:
Our markets
Plumbing and heating and building 
materials distribution in the USA, 
Canada, UK, Nordics, France and 
Central Europe.
Beneﬁts of scale
Due to scale beneﬁts 
leaders can perform better 
through the economic cycle.
Clear need for  
distributors in  
the supply chain
Distributors bridge the gap 
between the large vendor 
base and the large and 
geographically dispersed 
professional customer base.
Highly fragmented 
industry with no 
market dominated 
by a single player
Our markets are typically 
highly fragmented, with few 
large players in the 
industry.
Growing markets
Demand for plumbing and heating and building materials 
is somewhat cyclical. Some key factors supporting 
long-term growth in the markets are as follows:
Large vendor base
The vendor base is large. 
Wolseley distributes the 
products of over 100,000 
vendors across the world.
Source: US Census Bureau Source: US Dept of Housing and  
Urban Development
Source: US Census Bureau Source: European Commission for 
Energy Efﬁcient Economy
Source: Euroconstruct
Customers’  
needs are local
Professional contractors 
typically operate within 
about 20 miles of a local 
branch and may visit it 
several times a week. 
Many customers
The customer base is very 
fragmented. Wolseley 
services approximately  
1 million customers 
across the Group.
Population  
growth
Large  
aftermarket
Sustainable 
development
Ageing of  
housing stock
Increased  
comfort levels  
in houses
The EU plans for all new 
public buildings to be 
‘nearly zero energy’ by 2019. 
Environmental concerns will drive 
demand for renovation of existing 
buildings. 
Growth of +1% a year in the 
USA in the next decade. 
Population is expected to grow  
in almost all the countries we 
operate in. 
The median age of homes 
in the USA is 36 years. 
As housing stock ages, there is 
a strong correlation to increased 
demand for repairs, maintenance 
and improvement work.
89% of new homes  
in the USA have two 
or more bathrooms. 
There is a trend for increasing 
comfort levels in homes. 
The size of the building repair 
market in 201 1 in Western 
Europe is €524 billion. 
There is a very large aftermarket 
with renovation spend often 
in excess of new construction 
spend.  05

Chairman’s statement
Results and strategy
I am pleased to report another year of 
progress for Wolseley in which we have 
delivered improved trading proﬁt and strong 
free cash ﬂow generation. We have achieved 
this against a tough economic backdrop, 
particularly in Continental Europe, and I am 
immensely proud of the hard work and 
commitment to achieving these goals shown 
by my colleagues around the Group. 
Our fundamental strategy is unchanged 
and our core focus remains on delivering 
shareholder value from our strength and 
the signiﬁcant growth opportunities in the 
distribution of plumbing and heating and 
building materials. Since Ian Meakins was 
appointed as Group Chief Executive three 
years ago, he and his Executive team have 
made excellent progress in refocusing 
Wolseley through top-down resource 
allocation on those businesses where we 
have or can create market leading positions. 
Our objective is to improve and expand 
our market leading businesses through 
execution of bottom-up business unit 
strategies to make sure we grow these 
businesses faster than the competition. 
A number of disposals of non-core 
businesses have been made, which 
allow us to focus all our resources on our 
strategically strong businesses. I am pleased 
to say that we are broadly at the end of the 
major disposal process and today 86 per 
cent of Wolseley revenue comes from 
businesses which are either number one 
or number two in their markets. We have 
also continued to place a great deal of 
emphasis on strong cash generation and 
our balance sheet remains one of the 
strongest in the industry. During the year we 
completed the deleveraging of the business 
with net cash of £45 million at 31 July 2012 
(31 July 2011: net debt of £523 million). 
Our ﬁnancial strength will stand us in 
good stead in these uncertain times.
An important theme of the past year has 
been the further work undertaken by the 
Executive and the Board in reﬁning our 
strategy and its execution. In particular, 
in each country we are now beginning to 
deﬁne more precisely the inherent strengths 
of our business models which drive 
competitive advantage in our local markets. 
Over the medium term we will progressively 
move our business units to a local service 
common process business model, with 
core processes being developed to 
achieve beneﬁts of scale, productivity and 
efﬁciencies. You can read more about our 
progress in Ian’s review on pages 8 to 11.
Dividend increase
Our commitment to creating shareholder 
value remains strong. This year, we rebased 
our dividend with an interim dividend 
increase of 33 per cent. The Board is now 
proposing a ﬁnal dividend of 40 pence 
(2010/11: 30 pence) for payment on 
30 November 2012. This brings the total 
dividend for 2012 to 60 pence (2010/11: 
45 pence) costing £172 million, which is 
a year on year increase of 33 per cent.
Special dividend
The Board is committed to a progressive 
dividend policy. 
During the year, cash proceeds from the sale 
of businesses and other assets amounted to 
£317 million. These proceeds are surplus to 
the reinvestment requirement of the Group 
and therefore, in line with the Company’s 
policy, we are proposing a special dividend 
Our strategy is 
unchanged and our 
core focus remains 
on delivering 
shareholder value.” 07

to shareholders of £350 million which is 
expected to be paid in December. The 
special dividend and associated share 
consolidation will be subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM on 29 November 2012.
Governance, Board 
composition and changes
Central to the effective management of the 
business and maintaining the conﬁdence 
of our shareholders are high standards of 
corporate governance. As Chairman, I seek 
to ensure that the Board is as effective as 
possible and I believe strongly that this is 
the case. An externally facilitated Board 
evaluation was conducted this year, in line 
with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. This year’s third party 
review indicated that the Board and its 
Committees are operating effectively to high 
standards of governance. It found that the 
Board had an open and transparent style 
of discussion, with good engagement and 
contribution from all members, particularly 
on strategic planning and risk management. 
A more detailed overview of the evaluation 
process, together with details of the 
outcomes and actions to be taken, 
are discussed further on page 72.
During the year, the Board and I (through 
the Nominations Committee) gave a great 
deal of attention to its future composition, 
with an emphasis both on executive and 
non-executive succession planning. This 
took into account the tenure of Andrew Duff, 
our Senior Independent Director and 
Remuneration Committee Chairman, which 
we expect will come to an end in 2013. 
We have identiﬁed the balance of skills, 
experience, capabilities, independence, 
diversity and knowledge required on the 
Board and its Committees against which 
future appointments will be made. 
The Board composition today provides 
a balance of operational expertise, deep 
knowledge of our principal end markets, 
and City and ﬁnancial experience. As 
mentioned last year, we welcomed the 
ﬁndings and recommendations of Lord 
Davies’ report, “Women on Boards”. 
At this time, we have one woman on the 
Board, Tessa Bamford, due to the recent 
departure of Karen Witts. In light of her 
recent appointment as Finance Director of 
Kingﬁsher plc, Karen stepped down from 
the Board in order to avoid any risk of a 
conﬂict of interest. We thank her for her 
contribution to the Board and wish her well 
in her new role.
As a result, there are likely to be further 
changes to the Board through 2012 and 
2013. We will continue to refresh the team 
to ensure it operates with a broad and 
diverse range of complementary skills and 
specialised knowledge to take the Company 
forward. We shall always consider the 
beneﬁts of greater diversity while ensuring 
that the best person is recruited to the 
relevant role.
People
It is important to thank all our employees 
whose tremendous hard work has been 
the driving force behind our performance. 
Wolseley is very much a people business 
and success is absolutely a team effort. 
As you will see in the following pages, the 
overall theme of this year’s annual report is 
‘Best customer service, every day’ and the 
strong service ethic of our people and their 
dedication to serving our customers well is 
central to the delivery of our strategy.
As we look to the future, concerns over 
the health of many of the world’s major 
economies continue. It is difﬁcult to predict 
how strong these economic headwinds 
could become, but we approach 2012/13 
with the conﬁdence that our clear strategy, 
focused set of market leading businesses 
and strong balance sheet will enable further 
progress. I believe that challenges will 
present opportunities and that Wolseley 
is well placed to make the most of them. 
Gareth Davis  
Chairman 08
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Chief Executive’s review
In summary…
Like-for-like revenue 
growth of 3.8 per cent. 
Further improvements 
in customer service. 
Trading margin 
increased from 4.6 per 
cent to 5.0 per cent. 
Reduction in net debt 
by £568 million in 
the year. 
In a year of slowing economic 
growth and considerable 
uncertainty in the Eurozone, 
I am pleased to report that 
201 1/12 was another decent year 
for Wolseley. Underpinning this 
were three main factors: better 
customer service by our 
business units; continued like-
for-like revenue growth trends 
particularly in the USA and 
Canada; and our ongoing 
focus on operational efﬁciency 
which has delivered further 
improvements in the trading 
margin of 40 basis points, 
despite challenging markets.
Results 
The Group delivered a good overall result 
against a backdrop of continued weak 
demand in Continental Europe and 
steady market conditions in the USA 
and Canada. The Group generated revenue 
in the ongoing businesses of £12,716 million 
(2010/11: £12,061 million), 3.8 per cent 
ahead of last year on a like-for-like basis. 
The ongoing gross margin was slightly lower 
principally due to commodity price deﬂation 
and a one-off supplier rebate settlement 
in the USA. Trading proﬁt of £665 million 
(2010/11: £622 million), which included 
£7 million (2010/11: £26 million) 
from businesses sold or held for sale, 
was 7 per cent higher than last year. 
During the year we continued to manage 
the balance sheet conservatively. Cash was 
tightly controlled enabling us to increase 
capital expenditure to £135 million (2010/11: 
£93 million) to ensure organic expansion of 
the business. We continue to place a great 
deal of emphasis on driving strong cash 
generation with a particular focus on working 
capital discipline. Operating cash ﬂow 
continued to be strong at £747 million 
(2010/11: £16 million). 
Group strategy and 
business model
Our strategy remains unchanged. We will 
continue to extend our position in plumbing 
and heating and building materials 
distribution. These are generally fragmented 
markets and the structural growth 
opportunity is signiﬁcant. Our process 
of top-down resource allocation to those 
businesses which have or can achieve 
market leadership will give us the best 
returns. In addition, through bottom-up 
detailed business unit strategies we want 
to make sure we grow our best businesses 
faster than the competition. This parallel 
path of resource allocation and performance 
management is outlined in our value creation 
model opposite.
Over the medium term we  
will progressively move our 
business to a local service 
common process model 
as we standardise core 
processes to achieve beneﬁts 
of scale and productivity.” 09

businesses where we do not see a path 
to market leadership, which included Build 
Center, Bathstore and Encon in the UK, 
Brossette in France, and our remaining 
minority holding in Stock in the USA. In 
addition, we announced in July our intention 
to review the strategic options for our 
remaining businesses in France. 
We want to drive proﬁtable growth in each 
business unit and during the monthly 
performance reviews we review like-for-like 
revenue growth, balancing this with a focus 
on protecting gross margin. Given the tough 
economic backdrop in many of our markets 
we are keeping a keen eye on operating 
costs to ensure that we convert revenue 
growth strongly into trading proﬁt. Finally, 
over the past three years we have 
deleveraged the balance sheet and this has 
been achieved through driving strong cash 
generation. You can see several examples 
of the progress we have made in driving 
proﬁtable growth in the operating reviews 
on pages 26 to 37.
While organic growth remains the key 
priority, over the last two years we have 
invested over £50 million in selected small 
bolt-on acquisitions. Our strong preference 
is to expand in this way in our existing 
geographies, so that we can integrate 
these acquisitions rapidly with our strong 
businesses and deliver attractive returns. 
This year we made nine small bolt-on 
acquisitions, including a Blended Branches 
business in Chicago, a Waterworks business 
in California, a PVF distributor in Louisiana 
and several single branch businesses in 
Denmark and Sweden. 
Implementing our strategy – 
driving productivity and growth 
Now that we have focused the portfolio 
on a strong set of business units, we are 
continuing to evolve our business unit 
strategies and in doing so we are 
increasingly reviewing the business models 
employed by each. Here our objective is 
always to have the most efﬁcient, lowest 
cost platform in the industry and to drive 
continuous improvement by better process 
management. Over the past three years, 
certain processes and activities (for example 
strategy review, people development, 
ﬁnance and IT) have already been mandated 
as common across all business units and 
we have beneﬁted greatly from this as a 
Group. In addition, we have ensured that 
every business unit, and in turn every 
branch, measures customer service – 
because we know that high customer 
service scores correlate to strong ﬁnancial 
performance.  10
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Chief Executive’s review continued
We are now evaluating the best core 
processes in our most successful business 
units to see how we can derive further 
beneﬁts from a more common approach 
across our business units. For example, 
we have developed a single platform for 
business to consumer (“B2C”) internet 
businesses based on our successful  
Build.com business in the USA. This year 
we have successfully deployed this model 
in the UK and are now evaluating other 
markets for suitability. In addition, we have 
now established in all business units a 
critical level of SKUs (“stock keeping units”) 
to be maintained in the branch with 100 per 
cent ﬁll rates – high levels of availability of 
a wide range of SKUs is critical to our 
customers’ businesses. While the top 
SKUs are therefore immediately available 
in branches, the remaining SKUs are readily 
available from hubs or distribution centres. 
Over the medium term we will progressively 
move to a local service common process 
business model as we standardise core 
processes to achieve beneﬁts of scale 
and productivity – but these will be executed 
at the right level and location in each 
business unit. 
Best customer service
The central theme of this year’s annual report 
is “Best customer service, every day”. It is a 
critical element of our value creation strategy 
since we deliver for our customers through 
our people every day – we want highly 
engaged employees at the front line and in 
the support functions, who work together 
to deliver excellent customer service. 
We are making progress in improving 
customer service in our businesses, 
which is something we measure 
systematically. The overall scores have 
continued to improve across the majority of 
our businesses and you can see our scores 
this year for our biggest business – Blended 
Branches in the USA – above. The elements 
of service that are valued by our customers 
are reasonably consistent throughout 
our business units and geographies. 
Clearly, we have some real strengths and 
the surveys we see show us that we deliver 
great service in many of our branches. 
However, they also show us areas for 
improvement down to speciﬁc branches and 
customers, which is data we can really act 
upon. The feedback has also reinforced the

Our values…
We act with integrity
We conduct all our 
activities with fairness, 
honesty and integrity.
We drive for results 
and improvement
We listen and respond  
to the needs of our 
customers, then exceed 
their expectations; we are 
not happy with the status 
quo, and constantly strive 
to improve.
We value our people
We understand, respect 
and value personal and 
cultural differences; we 
are open and honest  
in all our dealings with  
our people.
message that “price” as a choice factor 
continues to rank relatively low on many 
customers’ priorities behind product 
availability, staff knowledge, next day 
delivery and breadth of the product range – 
showing that some customers are willing to 
pay more for these beneﬁts. This gives me 
great conﬁdence that as we continue to 
improve service we can also incrementally 
improve gross margins. We have seen 
similar customer responses in many other 
markets. On pages 12 to 19, for each 
of the major elements of service, we have 
demonstrated how we are working across 
the Group to make improvements.
Corporate Responsibility
The Board and Executive Committee 
believes that the integration of Corporate 
Responsibility (“CR”) across the Group 
and the inclusion of broader social and 
environmental issues into our decision 
making will help Wolseley to achieve our 
business goals, act as a building block for 
growth in shareholder value and beneﬁt the 
communities in which we operate. We are 
now in our third year of measuring our 
progress and our drive for continuous 
improvement is set out on pages 48 to 61. 
The elements of our CR programme are 
really part of the way we do business. 
The new initiatives we have developed are 
intrinsically linked to improving productivity. 
For example, we have focused on 
improving health and safety performance, 
in part by reducing lost work days; we are 
delivering better customer service through 
a commitment to staff training and 
development; and for the ﬁrst time this 
year we are setting Group-wide targets 
to reduce energy and fuel consumption 
which in turn will reduce costs. 
Given the importance of people to our 
business, a major accomplishment over 
the past year was the creation of our ﬁrst 
People Strategy covering all Wolseley 
employees worldwide. Our analysis showed 
that we have high levels of engagement, 
strong values and behaviours compared 
with best in class companies. Equally as 
important though are areas where we know 
we can improve, such as diversity and 
workforce planning, and we have set up 
best practice teams in order to address 
these important issues. 
Priorities
As we look forward we remain optimistic 
about the opportunities to grow and develop 
the business. Whilst the current economic 
uncertainty is likely to put ongoing pressure 
on like-for-like sales volumes in parts of the 
business, the opportunities to grow the 
business remain very positive and Wolseley 
is well placed to take advantage of this given 
the strength of our balance sheet. Our 
ﬂexible cost base will enable us to respond 
quickly and effectively to any economic 
headwinds which we may face in the year 
ahead. We will also continue to drive our 
productivity initiatives to ensure that we 
operate the lowest cost platform in the 
industry underpinning our expectation of 
further improvement in the trading margin 
over the medium term. Strong cash ﬂows 
should enable us to continue to reward 
shareholders and invest in organic growth 
as well as value-creating bolt-on acquisitions.
Finally I would like to build on Gareth’s 
comments about our employees. It is an 
enormous privilege to lead this Company 
and I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank all our employees worldwide for their 
dedication and commitment. People are the 
lifeblood of our business – it is through them 
that we deliver the exceptional customer 
service I so often see in our branches.

T o measure the consistency 
of customer service, Ferguson 
implemented a secret shopper 
programme simulating customers 
shopping at selected showrooms 
across the country.
The programme was quickly expanded to include counters, 
which are secret shopped by experienced trade professionals. 
Each location is rated on all aspects of the visit, such as the 
entrance, interior, merchandising, sales process and overall 
experience. To date, in 201 1/12, Ferguson has completed 
1,700 showroom shops and 702 counter shops. 
The secret shopper programme is a valuable tool in 
benchmarking and consistently measuring customer service. 
It also identiﬁes areas for improvement as well as recognising 
employees who are providing world-class customer service.

Providing world-class customer 
service to customers when they visit 
a counter is a key part of Ferguson’s 
strategy.
In 2010/11, we introduced the one hour “Will Call” service 
to help counters provide better service to the customer, 
manage labour and therefore gain market share.
The “Will Call” service enables customers to phone in their 
orders and have them ready for pick up within one hour. 
The beneﬁts of “Will Call” are that customers spend less time 
waiting. It also frees up our branches and reduces overall 
wait times particularly at peak periods. 
Due to its success, “Will Call” has been rolled out across the 
Ferguson Blended Branches business and has grown to 
represent more than 20 per cent of total counter sales. 15

Getting what our customers want, 
when they want it is what sets 
us apart from our competition. 
Plumb Center in the UK recognises 
the importance of this and in 
October 201 1 introduced a new 
and improved trade price guide. 
The trade price guide is issued quarterly to all customers 
so that they always have up to date information about 
our product availability and pricing.
Our installers need to plan their working week and the new 
price guide indicates whether any of the 18,000 product lines 
are in branch that day, are available within 24 hours, 48 hours or 
for special orders advises them to check with their local branch. 
This is done through a simple colour coding system so that 
installers can easily ﬁnd out the availability of a product. 
This saves the customer time as they do not need to travel 
from branch to branch or make a phone call to ﬁnd out.
Plumb Center has improved branch product availability 
to over 99 per cent through making various supply chain 
improvements over the last two years.

Stark is the market leader for building 
materials distribution in Denmark. 
Having the best people is key to 
sustaining the number 1 market 
position.
This is achieved through measuring staff engagement 
on a regular basis and making improvements to working 
environments and training so that our front line employees 
are engaged and deliver the best possible service to our 
customers. In 2011/12, we achieved a very high average 
employee engagement score of 76 per cent for all 2,844 
Stark employees. This score was mainly due to more 
investment in online and on the job training and giving the 
branch managers more responsibility and autonomy to 
make decisions.

+3.3%
Deﬁnition
Different types of customer have 
different requirements, or different 
priorities in ranking their requirements. 
Each business unit needs to 
understand what these requirements 
are and how its service performance 
is perceived relative to the 
competition. Regular customer 
surveys have been introduced in all 
business units to establish a base 
point from which progress can 
be measured. 
Performance
Processes for tracking and reporting 
of customer service KPIs differ by 
geography and by business unit. 
An example is given for the USA, 
the largest region in the Group, 
where the net promoter score has 
improved through the year. 
Gain market share
Deﬁnition
The total increase or decrease in 
revenue for the year, excluding the 
effect of currency exchange, trading 
days, new acquisitions, disposals, 
branch openings or closures in the 
year, and the incremental effect of 
acquisitions, branch openings and 
branch closures in the prior year. 
The Group expects changes in 
like-for-like revenue in each of its 
markets to exceed that achieved 
by the remainder of the market.
Performance
Group like-for-like revenue growth 
was 3.8 per cent for the year, 
compared to 5.0 per cent in 
the previous year.

Performance
An example is given for the USA, the 
largest region in the Group, where 
periodically “pulse” surveys are sent 
to 3,000 employees at all levels 
of the company. In response to 
the question “how satisﬁed are you 
that Ferguson is a good company 
to work for?”, Ferguson’s rating 
improved by 4 per cent in the year.
Expand gross margins
Deﬁnition
The ratio of gross proﬁt, excluding 
exceptional items, to revenue in the 
ongoing businesses. Prior year 
numbers have been restated to 
reﬂect the ongoing businesses only.
Performance
Gross margin declined to 27 .5 per 
cent, of which 0.1 per cent was 
due to a one-off charge in the 
USA relating to a supplier rebate 
settlement. A continued focus on 
improving customer service and 
product mix has offset much of 
the pressure of competitive 
market conditions.

Supply chain
There are numerous supply chain initiatives around the Group. Some are 
monitored by ﬁnancial measures, such as annualised savings in transportation 
costs, and others by non-ﬁnancial measures such as inventory turns and, for 
the Group’s distribution centres, the ﬁll rate achieved. This is the proportion of 
orders that can be fulﬁlled from inventory on hand at the time of the order.

The Group has strong management teams 
in each region. Business units report on 
operational performance and strategic 
progress through regular performance 
review meetings with senior executives. 
The business model offers opportunities for 
synergies to be achieved by being part of 
the Group. These include:
• management synergies such as sharing 
best practice, management development 
and corporate ﬁnance; and 
• operating synergies in the areas of joint 
sourcing, own label development and the 
sharing of costs and infrastructure. 
Business unit strategies
Business unit strategies are aligned with 
strategy models as outlined on pages 8 to 11. 
Each business unit aims to grow proﬁtability 
faster than the competition through gaining 
a greater share of its existing customers’ 
business and through attracting new 
customers. To achieve this each business 
unit focuses on achieving:
• best customer service;
• best branch employees; and
• preferred vendor relationships.
Underlying this, Wolseley aims to operate 
the most efﬁcient operating model in the 
industry, ensuring its distribution activities 
beneﬁt from national scale and an efﬁcient 
supply chain.
The business units drive operational value 
through gaining market share, improving 
productivity, expanding gross margins and 
improving returns and cash.

Market overview
The markets for plumbing and heating and 
building materials are directly exposed to 
macroeconomic cycles. The Group delivered 
good overall ﬁnancial results against a 
backdrop of weak demand in Continental 
Europe and improved market conditions 
in USA and Canada. Further detail by 
geography is provided in the regional 
performance reviews on pages 26 to 37.
Although our markets are cyclical, the 
business model is strong and it is 
underpinned by demographic trends towards 
ageing populations and smaller households 
and by the ageing of housing stocks. 
Our businesses sell to customers ranging 
across the residential, commercial and 
industrial sectors. The exposure to each 
market differs by geography and by 
business unit.

We source a wide range 
of products efﬁciently and 
responsibly, bringing 
together the mix of 
products from different 
vendors that our 
customers need.
What differentiates Wolseley
• Over 100,000 trade vendors supplying a 
broad mix of products including own label 
ranges.
• Strong vendor relationships and use of 
preferred vendor programmes.
• Scale advantages in sourcing are a key 
competitive advantage.
• Commitment to responsible sourcing 
practices.
Vendor relationships
Our vendors need distributors who can give 
them access to many smaller customers 
cost effectively. Our relationships with these 
vendors are key to our success; we want to 
build strong relationships and grow our 
business with them. 
Key vendors are manufacturers with market 
leading brands, usually focused on the needs 
of local markets. We work in partnership with 
our key vendors to offer market breadth and 
penetration and to collaborate on promotions 
and incentive programmes. We aim to derive 
beneﬁt from national scale. Whilst the vendor 
base is predominantly based on national 
geographies, some international sourcing 
beneﬁts exist, for example across Europe 
and for the sourcing of private label 
products. The Group continues to work 
with low cost, high quality manufacturers 
to supply our private label product ranges. 
Products
The Group sources and supplies a broad 
range of products. The main product 
categories are as follows:
Plumbing, heating and air 
conditioning
• Baths, showers and accessories. 
• Sanitaryware. 
• Brassware. 
• Bathroom furniture. 
• Boilers and burners. 
• Radiators and valves.

Distribute
We distribute products 
efﬁciently to our branches 
and customers, allowing 
us to provide great product 
availability levels for our

What differentiates Wolseley
• Branch network of over 3,000 branches.
• Large scale network of distribution centres 
supporting the plumbing and heating 
businesses.
• Market leading levels of product availability 
across a broad range of products.
Distribution network
Distribution centres are a key competitive 
advantage for Wolseley, allowing the Group 
to purchase in bulk and better serve 
customers through reduced delivery times, 
broader product selection, increased ﬁll 
rates and improved product availability, 
as well as enabling the Group to better 
manage inventory.
The Group has a large network of 
distribution centres which serve branches 
for our plumbing and heating businesses. 
By contrast the majority of products in our 
building materials businesses are delivered 
directly to our branches or customers. 
Our objective is to operate the lowest cost, 
most efﬁcient operating model in our industry, 
ensuring that our distribution activities beneﬁt 
from national scale and an efﬁcient supply 
chain. The Group has invested signiﬁcantly in 
supply chain technology to manage inventory 
in our distribution centres and branches in 
order to maximise efﬁciency.
Product availability
The availability of a wide range of products 
to our customers is fundamental to the 
Wolseley business model. Our distribution 
network is key to allowing us to outperform 
the competition in this area. Each distribution 
centre aims to maximise the ﬁll rate that it 
achieves, which is the proportion of orders 
that can be fulﬁlled from inventory on hand 
at the time of order. The distribution centres 
operate with ﬁll rates that are substantially 
better than those we receive from our 
vendors, ﬁlling the gap between vendor 
ﬁll rates and ﬁll rates to our branches.
At a branch level, product ranges are 
focused on the fastest moving products, 
with the distribution centres able to 
quickly deliver a wide range of other 
products as required. A number of our 
businesses have introduced service 
guarantees whereby if a top selling product

Branches
With over 3,000 branches across 18 countries, 
Wolseley is an international business but 
also a local business, with the majority of 
the Group’s customers travelling less than 
20 miles to a branch. We rely on the strength 
of our brands in their local markets, and the 
local knowledge of our employees in the 
branches to meet our customers’ needs. 
Transport
The Group uses a range of transport 
solutions in each of its businesses including 
both owned and leased ﬂeet and third party 
delivery. The Group uses ﬂeet management 
systems and backhauling arrangements 
to maximise the efﬁciency of its transport 
network and minimise its environmental 
impact. Further detail on the environmental 
impact of our transport requirements and 
actions taken to minimise CO2 emissions is 
given in the Corporate Responsibility report 
on pages 56 to 58.

Sell
We sell through a variety 
of channels including 
branches, call centres and 
online, with a strong focus 
on providing excellent 
customer service.
What differentiates Wolseley
• Continued focus on customer service 
measured through regular customer 
surveys.
• Investment in employee training 
programmes and tools to allow our 
branch employees to deliver the 
best customer service.
• Investment in online sales channels 
to drive organic growth.
Channels
Sales to customers are made over the 
counter at our branches, through supply 
contracts which are managed centrally, 
or through orders that can be placed with 
branches, into call centres, or via the 
internet. In some regions we also operate 
a network of showrooms which enables 
us to showcase our product range. 
E-commerce is a rapidly growing sales 
channel for the Group and we continue to 
invest in our business-to-business (“B2B”) 
and B2C websites across the Group. 
For example, Wolseley UK has recently 
introduced www.tapoutlet.co.uk which is a 
B2C website based on our Build.com site 
in North America.
Customers
The Group has a wide range of customers 
operating in different industry sectors, 
ranging from individual plumbers and 
builders through to national contractor 
chains and house builders. Wolseley’s 
primary customer focus is on professional 
contractors, who constituted 88 per cent of 
the Group’s customer base during the year 
ended 31 July 2012.

Customer service
Wolseley is a relationship business and our 
focus is to meet our customers’ needs better 
than the competition, ensuring we deliver the 
right products, at the right price, at the right 
time, on every occasion they do business with 
us. We use regular customer surveys in all of 
our business units so that we can take actions 
to improve our performance, both nationally 
and within each branch operation. See pages 
10 and 1 1 to read more about how we 
measure customer service.
Branch employees
In order to achieve the best customer service 
in the industry we need to have the right talent 
with relevant training, skills and knowledge in 
our locations. Within each of the business units 
there is a strong focus on ensuring that training 
programmes and tools are available for our 
people so they are equipped to give the best 
service in the industry. Employee engagement 
is measured in each business unit at least 
annually and the results are used to make 
improvements in working practices and 
environments. 
E-commerce is a 
rapidly growing 
sales channel 
for the Group.” 26

Business unit portfolio 
and proﬁle
In the USA we operate six business units. 
Ferguson is the primary operating brand 
although a number of other brands have 
been retained to service speciﬁc markets. 
The business operates in all 50 states 
and is served by 10 distribution centres 
across the country that provide next day 
product availability, a key competitive 
advantage. Ferguson predominantly serves 
the RMI markets with relatively low exposure 
to the residential new construction market.
The Ferguson Blended Branches business 
sells to customers across the residential, 
commercial and industrial sectors for new 
construction and RMI projects through its 
national branch network. In smaller markets 
that may not justify a stand alone presence 
for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning 
(“HVAC”) and Waterworks, a blended 
location can also provide the products 
and services for these customers. 
The Waterworks business distributes pipes, 
valves, hydrants, ﬁttings and meters to 
residential, commercial and municipal 
contractors. The business has been 
diversifying its customer base into private 
water companies and treatment plants, and 
expanding its product range into new areas 
such as metering technologies. 
The HVAC business distributes heating, 
ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration 
equipment to specialist contractors, 
predominantly in the residential and 
commercial sectors. Branded dealerships 
of high quality equipment are an important 
feature of this market. Most revenue is 
generated by providing equipment and parts 
for the repair and replacement market. 
The Industrial business distributes pipes, 
valves and ﬁttings, including specialty 
high-density polyethylene pipes, to industrial 
customers across all sectors including oil 
and gas, mining and power generation. 
It is a project driven business that has 
historically performed strongly over the 
economic cycle. The Industrial business 
also offers maintenance, repair and 
operations services (“MRO”) and integrated 
services, off-site integrated supply with 
centralised procurement, storeroom and 
commodity management.

fast growing area of the US business.
Market position and

Ferguson is the market leading distributor of 
plumbing supplies in the USA. The market 
positions of the main business units are 
estimated as follows:
Market position
Blended Branches 1
Waterworks 2
HVAC 3
Industrial 4
Ferguson has no direct competitor that 
operates across all its markets, and each 
business unit has its own competitors. 
These range from large national players, 
including professional sales from the national 
home improvement chains, to single branch 
operations. The market remains fragmented 
with a large number of small and regional 
distributors making up the majority 
of the market. 
Ferguson has continued to gain market 
share in the year, growing sales signiﬁcantly 
ahead of the market.
Operating performance
Revenue in the USA was 8 per cent ahead 
of last year on a like-for-like basis. This 
includes the impact of price inﬂation which is 
estimated at about 2 per cent at the start of 
the year, though lower towards the year-end 
partly as a result of falling copper prices. 
The RMI segment remained resilient and the 
modest recovery in levels of new residential 
construction continued. The major business 
units of Blended Branches, Waterworks and 
Industrial continued to gain market share. 
Gross margins declined slightly as 
contracted business became increasingly 
competitive, copper prices fell and also as 
a result of the one-off supplier settlement 
of £11 million in the ﬁrst half. Operating 
expenses were 6 per cent higher in constant 
currency, including £15 million of costs to 
reinstate 401k pension contributions and 
share-based payment charges, principally 
in the ﬁrst half. Nevertheless trading proﬁt 
was 24 per cent ahead. 
Blended Branches continued to grow well. 
The business protected gross margins 
which contributed to good proﬁt ﬂow 
through. The Waterworks and Industrial 
businesses grew strongly though Industrial 
growth was restricted in the fourth quarter 
as demand weakened in the oil and gas 
sectors. The Heating, Ventilation and Air 
Conditioning business remained subdued 
due to the removal of government tax 
incentives last year. Build.com, our 
consumer internet business, continued to 
grow strongly and achieved a very good 
operating result. 
Four acquisitions were completed in the 
year, two in our Blended Branches business 
and one in each of the Waterworks and 
Industrial businesses, and acquisitions 
accounted for 1.3 per cent of revenue 
growth in the region. Since the end of the 
year we have completed the acquisition of 
Power Equipment Direct, an online retailer 
of generators and power equipment with 
revenue of £53 million in its last ﬁnancial year. 
We opened 29 new branches principally in 
the Waterworks and Industrial segments. 
Headcount at 31 July 2012 was 764 higher 
at 18,245, half from acquired businesses. 
The USA trading margin was 6.3 per cent 
(2010/11: 5.7 per cent). 
As at the date of this statement no signiﬁcant 
claims have arisen from the unintentional 
supply of mislabelled gaskets notiﬁed to 
customers in December 2011. 
The RMI segment 
remained resilient 
and the modest 
recovery in levels 
of new residential 
construction 
continued.”
Gain market  
share
In the Blended Branches 
business in the USA we 
have improved our market 
share in the majority of 
states this year. This has 
been driven by a strong 
focus on customer service 
and knowledgeable branch 
employees. High levels 
of product availability and 
high ﬁll rates have driven 
quality and share gains.

Wolseley Canada is a wholesale distributor 
of plumbing, heating, industrial and 
ventilation products, servicing residential, 
commercial and industrial sectors both

Synergies with the USA include non-facing 
customer activities, speciﬁcally supply 
chain and sourcing.
The Blended Branches business mainly 
supplies plumbing equipment to residential 
and commercial contractors, with the 
branch network being supported by the 
national distribution centre in Milton, Ontario.
The Waterworks business serves residential, 
commercial and municipal contractors. 
Its market leadership is based on strong 
relationships with core contractors and 
North American and international vendors.
The HVAC business supplies a wide range 
of heating, ventilation, air conditioning and 
refrigeration products and parts from leading 
manufacturers to both residential 
and commercial contractors. 
The Industrial business serves industrial

cash-to-cash days by 
10 days, through a 
combination of improving 
accounts receivable 
processes, managing 
supplier relationships more 
effectively and optimising 
the inventory supply chain.
Operating performance
In Canada revenue was 5 per cent ahead on 
a like-for-like basis including price inﬂation of 
approximately 1 per cent. New residential 
markets remained buoyant and infrastructure 
spending continued to grow.
Gross margins were ahead of last year with 
operating cost growth restricted to 1 per 
cent in constant currency and net staff 
numbers were reduced by 86 to 2,607. 
This led to strong ﬂow through to trading 
proﬁt of £49 million, which was £10 million 
higher than last year and included £1 million 
of one-off restructuring costs. 
Blended Branches grew modestly and 
improved proﬁtability. Industrial continued 
to grow strongly. Waterworks and HVAC 
traded slightly lower against very strong 
comparators due to reductions in 
government infrastructure investment.

Business unit portfolio 
and proﬁle
The UK is focused on its core, strong 
businesses with market leading positions 
in plumbing and heating and adjacent 
businesses. 
The majority of the UK’s revenue is 
generated from the RMI market, with the 
public sector accounting for around 35 per 
cent of revenue.
Plumb and Parts Center is a leading 
distributor of plumbing and heating 
products. The business operates through 
a national branch network and can deliver 
superior ﬁll rates and a wide range of 
products through its distribution centres. 
The business also supplies a wide range 
of spares and replacements. Efﬁciencies 
arise from purchasing volumes, from 
opportunities to cross-sell and from shared 
sites. The business has delivered a strong 
ﬁnancial performance in a tough trading 
environment and continues to look for 
opportunities to improve customer service 
and grow revenue.
Pipe and Climate Center distribute pipes, 
valves, ﬁttings, air conditioning and 
refrigeration products. The business has 
a sound track record of proﬁtability, and 
volumes are driven by non-residential new 
build projects.
Drain Center is a specialist in above and 
below ground drainage. Integrated Services 
offers outsourced inventory management 
and procurement services for maintenance 
activities on a long-term contract basis, 
mainly to public institutions such as 
housing associations.
During the year ended 31 July 2012, Build 
Center, Encon and Bathstore were disposed 
of in line with the Group’s strategy of focusing 
on businesses with signiﬁcant scale

There are a number of large national players 
and signiﬁcant competition is also provided 
by numerous small local businesses. 
Operating performance
Revenue in the ongoing UK business 
declined 1 per cent on a like-for-like basis. 
However, the business made excellent 
progress in replacing the volumes 
represented by the previously announced 
large contract loss in April 2011. Demand in 
the heating market declined throughout the 
year, although demand for other product 
categories performed better. There is no 
evidence yet of improving market conditions 
and therefore growth will only come from 
market share gains in the short term. 
Price inﬂation in the ongoing businesses 
was approximately 1 per cent. The major 
business units of Plumb and Parts Center, 
Pipe and Climate Center and Drain Center 
gained market share.
Despite strong competition and some copper 
price deﬂation, the ongoing gross margin 
was well ahead of last year due to favourable 
sales mix and a sharp focus on pricing and 
procurement. Operating expenses were 
3 per cent higher including £4 million of 
restructuring costs and staff costs were well 
controlled as headcount was reduced by 
321 to 5,913. Trading proﬁt for the ongoing 
business of £92 million was £3 million ahead 
of last year after restructuring charges. 
In addition, we invested £2 million in a new 
e-commerce platform.
Plumb and Parts Center achieved a good 
performance in lacklustre markets and 
increased gross margins despite strong 
competition. Pipe and Climate Center 
continued to perform well, generating good 
growth and higher trading proﬁts. Activity 
levels in Drain Center slowed in the second 
half and the business protected gross 
margins. On 1 August 2012 we launched 
our consumer internet business for the UK 
market – www.tapoutlet.co.uk using the 
infrastructure of our successful Build.com 
business in the USA. 
The trading margin for the ongoing 
UK business was 5.5 per cent (2010/11: 
5.3 per cent).

Wolseley’s Nordic segment operates in 
Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway. 
Stark is the leading distributor of heavy 
building materials, tools, hardware, timber 
and panels in Denmark. Stark’s customers 
include both professional contractors and 
DIY builders with around half of stores 
having a dedicated DIY section. Stark’s 
market leadership and its efﬁciencies 
of scale have historically delivered strong 
results. During the year we made two small 
acquisitions and Stark continued to focus 
on growing its market share.
Beijer is the leading distributor of building 
materials in Sweden. About half its revenue 
comes from local building contractors and 
another third from retail consumers. As the 
Swedish market is very fragmented, Beijer’s 
reach is valuable to vendors, and by 
maintaining efﬁciencies of scale and working 
capital management it delivers strong 
trading results.
Starkki is a Finnish chain of builders’ 
merchants with a format based on large 
stores and well-trained specialist staff. 
Whilst local building contractors are the 
largest single customer segment, 
consumers and small retail stores 
generate nearly 40 per cent of its revenue. 
Starkki has a strong record of excellent 
proﬁtability based on a very low cost base.
Silvan is a DIY and retail chain in Denmark, 
focused on serving customers with building 
materials for the RMI market. The majority 
of Silvan’s product range overlaps with 
other businesses in the Nordic region and 
therefore the business delivers signiﬁcant 
synergies by taking advantage of these 
economies of scale.
Smaller business units in the region include 
Neumann Bygg, a distributor of building 
materials in Norway, and Cheapy, a DIY 
chain in Sweden.

Electronic billing has been 
available at Stark for several 
years. However the number 
of customers using this 
service was low. In order to 
encourage more customers 
to move to electronic billing, 
some improvements to the 
service have been made 
and a fee was introduced 
to charge customers for 
paper invoices. Almost 
1.6 million invoices have 
been sent electronically 
since November 201 1, 
enabling cost savings to 
be passed to customers 
and substantial 
environmental beneﬁts.

Market position and 
competitive environment
The market positions of the main business 
units are estimated as follows:
Market position
Denmark (building materials) 1
Sweden (building materials) 1
Finland (building materials) 2
Denmark (DIY) 2
The Stark and Beijer brands are market 
leaders in Denmark and Sweden 
respectively, with Silvan the number two DIY 
retailer in Denmark and Starkki the second 
largest builders’ merchant in Finland.
Each country in the Nordic region is a 
distinct market with its own national, regional 
and local competition. However, there are 
several major competitors operating across 
the region in the building materials and DIY 
markets. The markets in the Nordics tend 
to be fragmented and there are signiﬁcant 
opportunities to consolidate our market 
positions across the region.
Operating performance
After a reasonable ﬁrst half construction 
markets in the Nordics deteriorated sharply 
with weak consumer conﬁdence also 
affecting RMI markets across most of the 
region. Like-for-like revenue growth was 
1 per cent in the year, principally due 
to price inﬂation. We believe the businesses 
in the Nordics performed in line with the 
market overall. 
During the second half gross margins 
declined as a result of competitive pressure, 
particularly in Denmark and cost control 
measures in the second half were not 
sufﬁcient to prevent proﬁts declining. During 
the year operating expenses increased by 
3 per cent in constant currency, of which 
£4 million was due to the impact of 
acquisitions and investment in nine new 
branches. Trading proﬁt for the ongoing 
business declined by £17 million to £96 million, 
including £1 million of restructuring costs. 
The building materials business in Denmark 
increased revenue although gross margins 
were lower as a result of pricing pressure 
and a higher level of lower margin direct 
business. The DIY business in Denmark 
performed better with tight cost control 
leading to an improved performance. 
Revenue was slightly lower in Finland and 
Sweden and despite tight control of costs 
trading proﬁt was lower. In Norway conditions 
were more stable with revenue and gross 
margins ahead although trading proﬁt was 
slightly lower due to investment. In light of 
current weak market conditions we are 
planning further cost reductions in the region. 
We completed ﬁve small acquisitions in 
the year including two bolt-on acquisitions 
in Denmark, two in Sweden and one 
in Norway. 
The trading margin for ongoing Nordic 
businesses was 4.6 per cent (2010/11: 
5.5 per cent).  34

Improve 
productivity
The import and wood 
solutions business in 
France has recently 
implemented Lean 
Management practices. 
Groups of between 12 
and 20 employees, led by 
a team manager, work 
together to complete 
required tasks and take 
individual responsibility 
for areas such as health 
and safety or quality 
management. Team 
managers are appointed 
through an assessment 
process and team workers 
receive training, coaching 
and support to transition 
to the Lean Management 
approach. This method 
has improved productivity 
and has engaged and 
empowered employees 
in the running of the 
business.

Wolseley France now operates two divisions; 
building materials and import and wood 
solutions. 
The building materials division comprises 
Réseau Pro, the number two integrated 
distributor in France, selling building 
materials, rooﬁng, insulation, timber and 
ﬂooring, and Panofrance, focused on timber, 
panels and interior design. These businesses 
have efﬁciencies in both sourcing and 
shared services.
The import and wood solutions division 
includes Softwood, the market leader in 
specialist sawn and processed woods, 
and the structural wood business 
which manufactures trusses and other 
carpentry systems. 
As announced in July 2012 the Group is 
currently reviewing the future strategic 
options for the business in France.

In addition to a number of large national 
distributors (including Wolseley France) 
there are also a number of buying groups 
that operate in France, accounting for 
a large proportion of the market.
Operating performance
Revenue in France declined by 1 per cent on 
a like-for-like basis, including approximately 
3 per cent inﬂation. New construction 
markets weakened substantially in the 
second half. Government incentives put in 
place in the last two years are ending and 
demand is expected to continue to decline 
in the current year. 
Réseau Pro, our building materials business, 
increased revenue whilst Wood Solutions 
was lower as activity slowed in the second 
half. Overall gross margins were slightly 
lower. 
Full year operating expenses in the ongoing 
businesses were 1 per cent higher at 
constant currency than last year, including 
£9 million of restructuring charges. 
Labour costs were lower as headcount 
was reduced by 128 to 5,293. Trading proﬁt 
for the ongoing business was £30 million 
(2010/11: £46 million) including restructuring 
charges. Given the continued weak market 
conditions in France we are evaluating ways 
to reduce the cost base further.
The trading margin in the ongoing

Wolseley operates in four countries in the 
region; Switzerland, Austria, Netherlands 
and Luxembourg.
In Switzerland, Tobler is a distributor of 
heating and plumbing products. It operates 
a national distribution centre and has 
invested signiﬁcantly in e-commerce, 
generating a signiﬁcant proportion of its 
sales online.
The Austrian business, ÖAG, sells plumbing, 
heating and sanitary products as well as 
pipes and valves to industrial and municipal 
customers.
In the Netherlands, Wasco is a distributor of 
heating, plumbing and ventilation equipment. 
Boilers and spares account for about half 
of its revenue, and the customer base 
is weighted towards large regional and 
national contractors.
In Luxembourg, CFM is a distributor of

Operating performance
In Central Europe like-for-like revenue was 
1 per cent ahead of last year. In Switzerland, 
price deﬂation as a result of the appreciation 
of the Swiss Franc was offset by volume 
growth. We generated decent growth in 
Austria, while revenue was slightly lower 
in the Netherlands as a result of exiting 
unproﬁtable business. Management focus 
remains on improving proﬁtability in Austria, 
including the reorganisation of distribution 
centre facilities, similar to the successful 
project in Switzerland two years ago. 
The gross margin in the period was ahead 
of last year. Operating cost growth of 
4 per cent in constant currency included 
investment in new sales staff and products 
which are expected to generate good 
growth in the future. Trading proﬁt in the 
ongoing businesses was £30 million 
(2010/11: £31 million) after £2 million of 
restructuring costs. 
The trading margin in the ongoing 
businesses was 4.2 per cent 
(2010/11: 4.3 per cent).

Overview Performance Governance Financials Information
Revenue and operating proﬁt
Group revenue was 1 per cent below last year as a result 
of disposals, but like-for-like revenue was ahead by 3.8 per 
cent, and the total revenue of the ongoing business was 
5.4 per cent ahead including acquisitions and new branches. 
Gross margins were lower than last year in aggregate. 
This reﬂected changes in business mix and copper price 
deﬂation earlier in the year, and the competitive pricing 
environment in the Nordic region along with a shift in volumes 
towards lower margin direct and large contract sales. 
Canada, UK and Central Europe continued to make good 
progress with their gross margin enhancement initiatives 
resulting in their gross margin being ahead of last year. 
Operating costs before exceptional items were £128 million 
below last year. Trading proﬁt of £665 million (2010/11: £622 
million) was 7 per cent ahead. This represents a trading 
margin of 5.0 per cent (2010/11: 4.6 per cent).
Disposals
Revenue of £705 million and trading proﬁt of £7 million arose 
from businesses which have been disposed of or are held 
for sale at 31 July 2012 (2010/11: £1,497 million of revenue 
and £26 million of trading proﬁt). The Group received 
£256 million from the disposal of businesses including 
Build Center, Encon and Bathstore in the UK and Brossette 
in France. An additional £61 million was received from 
other asset disposals.
Exceptional items
Exceptional charges of £40 million were incurred during the 
year (2010/11: £51 million). The disposal of Bathstore resulted 
in a loss of £33 million, and losses from the disposal, closure 
or revaluation of assets held for sale of other businesses 
were £7 million. In addition an exceptional gain of £16 million 
was realised on the disposal of the Group’s remaining 
holding in Stock Building Supply.
Amortisation and impairment 
of acquired intangibles
Amortisation of £60 million (2010/11: £75 million) represents 
the normal charge relating to the Group’s intangible assets. 
In addition, in accordance with accounting standards, the 
Group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangible assets and concluded that an impairment charge 
of £353 million is appropriate. £133 million of this charge 
relates to France and £220 million to the Nordic region, 
reﬂecting the continued difﬁcult trading conditions in 
these markets. 
Finance costs
Net ﬁnance charges in the year amounted to £30 million 
(2010/11: £66 million). £9 million of the charge relates to the 
unwind of discounts on pensions and provisions (2010/11: 
£18 million). The reduction in the remaining charge from 
£48 million to £21 million primarily reﬂects lower average 
levels of debt and reduced charges for arrangement fees.
Tax
The Group incurred a tax charge on proﬁt before discontinued 
operations of £138 million. Tax in relation to amortisation 
and impairment of acquired intangibles and exceptional items 
amounted to £20 million. After adjusting for these items the 
underlying tax rate was 24.9 per cent (2010/11: 27.3 per cent).

Underlying tax charge 158 152
Effective tax rate 24.9% 27 .3%
Discontinued operations
The loss of £3 million from discontinued operations (2010/11: 
loss of £10 million) results from movements in tax, provisions 
and other items arising from the disposal of Stock Building 
Supply in 2009.
Earnings per share
Headline earnings per share, which is earnings per share 
before exceptional items, the amortisation and impairment of 
acquired intangibles and non-recurring tax credits, amounted 
to 168.4 pence (2010/11: 142.9 pence). The increase reﬂects 
the increase in trading proﬁt, the reduction in ﬁnance 
charges, and a lower tax rate. Basic earnings per share from 
continuing operations was 21.2 pence (2010/11: 99.4 pence) 
after reﬂecting the impairment charge. 40
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Dividends
The Group paid an interim dividend of 20 pence per share 
(2010/11: 15 pence per share) amounting to £57 million in 
May 2012. A ﬁnal dividend of 40 pence per share, equivalent 
to £115 million, is proposed, 33 per cent ahead of last year. 
The total dividend for the year of 60 pence (2010/11: 45 pence) 
is covered 2.8 times by headline earnings per share. 
The Board expects to grow the dividend over time taking 
into account the signiﬁcant opportunities for investment in 
proﬁtable organic growth and selected bolt-on acquisitions.
Special dividend
Following receipts from disposals during the year the Board 
believes that the Group has cash balances which are surplus 
to its current investment needs. In line with the Group’s 
stated strategy the Board is proposing the return of 
£350 million to shareholders by way of a special dividend 
to be accompanied by a share consolidation to preserve 
the reference share price and earnings per share.
Liquidity
The Group maintains sufﬁcient borrowing facilities to ﬁnance 
all investment and capital expenditure included in its 
strategic plan, with an additional margin for contingencies. 
The maturity proﬁle of the Group’s borrowings and 
committed undrawn facilities at 31 July 2012 is as follows:

Net cash/(debt)
Net cash at 31 July 2012 was £45 million (2010/11: net debt 
of £523 million). 
The Group’s level of net cash or debt at 31 July is affected 
by the working capital cycle as well as cash conversion. 
Net debt at 31 July 2012 would have been approximately 
£100 million after having taken into account the timing 
of year-end supplier payment runs.

The Group continues to place a strong emphasis on

well controlled, net interest paid has reduced and the 
Group has increased the level of dividends paid.
Pensions
The Group’s net pension obligations under IAS 19 at 31 July 
2012 were £358 million (2010/11: £360 million). The Group 
made a one-off contribution of £60 million into the UK 
pension scheme following completion of the disposal of 
Build Center, which has compensated for actuarial losses 
due to lower discount rates. All of the Group’s companies 
are now reviewing their pension arrangements and this may 
lead to further cash contributions in the year ahead in the 
range of £100 million to £150 million.
Operating lease commitments
As at 31 July 2012 the Group had total operating leases 
commitments of £842 million (2010/11: £1,126 million). 
Management continues to believe that there is substantial 
capacity for revenue growth utilising the existing 
infrastructure and will remain cautious when considering 
new lease commitments in the foreseeable future.
Financial review continued 41
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Overview Performance Governance Financials Information
Other ﬁnancial matters
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to risks arising from the international 
nature of its operations and the ﬁnancial instruments which 
fund them. These instruments include cash, liquid 
investments and borrowings, and also items such as trade 
receivables and trade payables which arise directly from 
operations. The Group also enters into selective derivative 
transactions – principally interest rate swaps and forward 
foreign currency contracts – to reduce uncertainty about 
the amount of future committed or forecast cash ﬂows. 
The policies to manage these risks have been applied 
consistently throughout the year. It is Group policy not 
to undertake trading in ﬁnancial instruments or speculative 
transactions.
Capital structure
The Group’s sources of funding currently comprise cash 
ﬂows generated by operations, equity contributed by 
shareholders, and borrowings from banks and other ﬁnancial 
institutions. To assess whether the capital structure is 
appropriate for current and forecast trading, the Group’s 
principal measures are the appraisal of the Group’s credit 
rating by an appropriate independent credit assessment 
agency and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. The Group aims 
to operate with investment grade credit metrics and 
maximum net debt of 1x to 2x EBITDA.
Foreign currency
The Group has signiﬁcant overseas businesses whose 
revenue is mainly denominated in the currencies of the 
countries in which the operations are located. The Group 
does not normally hedge proﬁt translation exposure.
The Group’s policy is to adjust the currencies in which its 
debt is denominated to materially match the currencies 
in which its trading proﬁts are generated.
Interest rates
During the year the Group entered into interest rate 
contracts to swap private placement bonds with a par value 
of £424 million at 31 July 2012 from ﬂoating rates to a 
weighted average ﬁxed rate of 2.5 per cent until maturity. 
The Group’s portfolio of swap contracts had a fair value 
of £72 million at 31 July 2012, and any charges in fair value 
until maturity will be taken to proﬁt or loss. 
Other ﬁnancial risks
The nature of the Group’s business exposes it to risks which 
are partly ﬁnancial in nature. Counterparty risk is the risk that 
banks and other ﬁnancial institutions which are contractually 
committed to make payments to the Group may fail to do so. 
Convertibility risk is the risk that euro-denominated assets 
and contracts may be redesignated into an alternative 
currency, and that there may be restrictions on realisation 
of assets. Credit risk is the risk that customers who have 
made purchases on credit may fail to pay in full. Commodity 
risk is the risk that, in order to satisfy its service commitments 
to customers, the Group may purchase commodities which 
subsequently fall in value. 
The Group manages counterparty risk by setting credit and 
settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties, 
which are approved by the Treasury Committee and 
monitored regularly. The Group manages convertibility 
risk by limiting its overnight exposure to euro assets. 
The management of credit and commodity risk is considered 
to be the responsibility of operational management and, 
in respect of these risks, the Group does not prescribe 
a uniform approach across the Group.
Further information on risk management and internal control 
can be found on pages 42 to 47.
Financial reporting
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under IFRS. 
The Group’s accounting policies are set out on pages 137 to 
143. There have been no changes to the Group’s accounting 
policies during the year ended 31 July 2012.
Going concern
The Directors are conﬁdent, on the basis of current ﬁnancial 
projections and facilities available, and after considering 
sensitivities, that the Company and the Group has sufﬁcient 
resources for its operational needs and will enable the Group 
to remain in compliance with the ﬁnancial covenants in its 
bank facilities for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly the 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the ﬁnancial statements.

Risk management and internal control
Strategic clarity – a focus on the risks  
that matter
Wolseley’s strategy remains unchanged. Our process of 
top-down resource allocation to those businesses which are 
capable of market leadership will give us the best returns. 
Detailed business unit strategies, built from the bottom up, 
will help our best businesses to grow faster than the 
competition. We will focus on customer service, operational 
efﬁciency, developing employees, and our vendor 
relationships and expanding gross margins.
This top-down and bottom-up approach to strategy is 
mirrored in our risk management processes. We have a clear 
view at Board and Executive level of the principal risks facing 
the Group, combined with information from the business 
units on the most signiﬁcant risks affecting each region.
Our risk management  
framework – four levels of defence
The four levels of defence against which we review signiﬁcant 
risks are shown below:
Level 1
Front line business operations managing risk on 
a daily basis.
Level 2
Corporate oversight functions monitoring performance 
and risk.
Level 3
Independent assurance and testing that controls are 
working as planned, e.g. internal or external audit.
Level 4
Oversight and direction from the Board and its 
Committees.
What has this meant in practice this year?
The Board (Level 4) formally reviewed its strategic plans 
and objectives in May and subsequently approved Group 
company budgets and strategies in light of these. It regularly 
monitors the implementation of strategy and the ﬁnancial 
performance of the Group.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee reviews key 
risks and controls in March and September each year. 
This year, the Audit Committee added a further review of 
the Group’s risk management practices to its programme. 
The Committee receives frequent reports regarding the 
ﬁndings from internal audits. More information on the 
activities undertaken by the Board and its Committees, 
including the Audit Committee, are contained in the 
Governance section on page 62.
During the year under review, Internal Audit (Level 3) has 
reviewed and tested controls in a number of ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial risk areas. These include health and safety 
compliance and the robustness of health and safety data; 
the accuracy of aspects of monthly ﬁnancial reporting; 
compliance with the UK Bribery Act (in the UK), contract 
compliance and the governance and ﬁnancial control at 
the Company’s “captive” insurance company.
Corporate functions (Level 2) are continually improving their 
oversight of risk in several areas in support of our corporate 
goals. Examples in the year under review include:
• the use of monthly ﬁnancial reporting checklists by Finance 
teams to highlight areas of non-compliance to business 
unit Finance teams;
• a comprehensive survey of product integrity in all areas of 
the business was undertaken by the Group Legal team, 
quality assurance and sourcing experts; 
• health and safety performance is monitored quarterly 
by the Executive Committee and the Board.
Front line business operations (Level 1) take preventative 
action to mitigate operational risks on a daily basis 
throughout the year. Speciﬁc activities this year have 
included:
• self-assessments of health and safety in all branches;
• employee engagement surveys completed for a second 
year in all businesses;
• improvements made to physical infrastructure and 
properties following over 20 audits of key sites and 
locations around the Group; and
• testing and exercising of business continuity and IT 
disaster plans in the United States and the United 
Kingdom, including faster recovery times for key 
IT systems in the United States. 43

Risk Conference 2012 – bringing it all together
This year’s event was hosted by Ferguson at its 
headquarters in Virginia, and focused on product integrity, 
health and safety, treasury, bribery, corruption and 
property risks.
The UK business introduced its successful health and 
safety self-assessment system, known as “Go Green, 
Stay Green”. The Ferguson security team outlined 
improvements in their data mining capability, which has 
recovered a signiﬁcant amount of lost revenue in the ﬁrst 
few months of operation. Treasury teams from around the 
Group reviewed new practices in commodity and credit 
risk management. The business continuity and insurance 
teams at Ferguson provided real-life experiences of 
recovering from two tornados in 2011.
Board members and the Group CEO provided a 
top-down view on risk. Members of the Internal Audit team 
highlighted how their risk-based audits linked to the work 
undertaken by risk specialists attending the conference.
Signiﬁcant risks facing the business
The nature of the industry in which we operate and our 
chosen strategy expose the Company to a number of risks. 
There are areas of the Group’s business where it is 
necessary to take risks to achieve a satisfactory return for 
shareholders. The Board has considered the nature and 
extent of the signiﬁcant risks it is willing to take in achieving 
the Group’s strategic objectives. These key risks, their level 
and trend are summarised in the table below.

Risk is falling
The materialisation of these risks could have an adverse 
effect on the Group’s results or ﬁnancial condition. If more 
than one of these risks occur, the combined overall effect 
of such events may be compounded. Various mitigation 
strategies are employed to reduce these inherent risks 
to an acceptable level – these are summarised on the 
following pages. 
This year, “liquidity and funding” risks have been removed 
from the list of principal risks in light of the Group’s 
strengthened ﬁnancial performance, net debt levels and 
funding arrangements. “Capital expenditure and return on 
investment” risks have also been removed in light of lower 
risk levels and stronger controls.
Some risk factors remain beyond the direct control of the 
Company and the risk management programme can only 
provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that key risks 
are managed to an acceptable level. 
The Company faces many other risks which, although 
important and subject to regular review, have been assessed 
as less signiﬁcant and are not listed here. These include, 
for example, treasury or health and safety related risks. 
Further information on ﬁnancial risks and their management 
is contained on page 41. More information on health and 
safety can be found on page 53. 44

Market conditions
73
Inherent risk level 
– High
Trend – Stable
The Group’s results depend on the levels 
of activity in new construction and 
property repair and remodelling markets. 
In light of the debt levels in Europe and 
concerns about the USA recovery, 
there continues to be a risk that markets 
may ﬂuctuate rapidly or experience 
further downturns. Factors inﬂuencing 
this risk include:
• the general rate of GDP growth;
• consumer conﬁdence;
• the availability of credit to ﬁnance 
customer investment;
• mortgage and other interest rates;
• the level of government initiatives to 
stimulate economic activity;
• inﬂation; and
• unemployment.
These factors are out of the Group’s 
control and are difﬁcult to forecast.
Traditional processes for producing 
management information may need 
enhancing to enable the Company to 
respond to such rapidly-changing 
markets.
The Company believes it has effective measures in place 
to respond to market conditions. Our mitigation strategy 
is to reinforce existing measures in place. These include:
• resource allocation processes;
• planning, budgeting and forecasting processes;
• debt reduction and reﬁnancing;
• cost reduction, pricing and gross margin 
management initiatives, including a focus on 
customer service and productivity improvement;
• diversiﬁcation into the sectors, such as commercial 
and industrial, which have proved more robust; and
• improvements in monthly management information.
Measures introduced in the last 12 months include the 
disposal of businesses where the Company cannot 
establish a market leading position in attractive markets. 
Such operations included Bathstore and Build Center 
in the UK and Brossette in France. The Company has 
also announced its intention to explore strategic options 
for its other businesses in France.
The quality of monthly management information has 
been improved to enable businesses to better identify 
and respond to changes in the business environment.
Margin erosion
73
Inherent risk level 
– High
Trend – Stable
Market conditions continued to increase 
competition during the period under 
review, which, if not mitigated, could 
lead to downward pressure on sales 
prices and proﬁt margins.
There is a risk that such competitive 
pressures will continue and could be 
exacerbated by factors such as levels 
of economic activity, customer or supplier 
consolidation, manufacturers shipping 
directly to customers, other changes 
in the route to market, and changes 
in technology.
The Company continues to reinforce the mitigation 
actions in place. Gross margin improvement initiatives 
remain a priority for all businesses.
We believe that high levels of customer service and 
product availability play a fundamental role in maintaining 
competitive advantage. The Group has continued with 
its programme of work to improve levels of customer 
service and inventory.
A number of local initiatives have been undertaken by 
Wolseley businesses in the last 12 months, including:
• improved analysis of monthly margin performance 
at Group and business unit level;
• dedicated gross margin initiatives and expense 
reduction programmes in Canada;
• improved transparency on performance and 
incentives in the USA through the use of an innovative 
software tool;
• improved claims management in the UK businesses; 
and 
• improved supplier pricing terms in the Nordic region. 45

Litigation
73
Inherent risk level 
– Medium/high
Trend – Stable
The international nature of Wolseley’s 
operations exposes it to the potential for 
litigation from third parties, and such 
exposure is considered to be greater 
in the USA than in Europe. 
Wolseley’ s strengths include its employees, 
its products and the terms it negotiates 
with its suppliers. It is in these areas 
where the potential risk of litigation may 
be greatest.
Although the number of claims made 
against the Company has increased 
slightly during the year, there has been 
no material change in the level of exposure 
to the Group. For more information on 
speciﬁc litigation affecting the Company, 
see pages 104, 125, 136 and 157.
Levels of litigation are monitored by individual operating 
companies and by Group functions.
To reduce its exposure to product-related claims, the 
Company has this year launched a major “Product 
Integrity” programme. This included a refreshed policy 
and set of requirements to which all businesses must 
adhere, as well as a programme of risk assessments 
and KPIs for major product categories. Further 
information is provided on page 59.
The Company has been reviewing and improving 
its working practices especially in the United States 
and France in light of the more complex labour laws 
in those countries.
In the case of claims related to exposure to asbestos, 
Wolseley employs independent professional advisers 
to actuarially determine its potential gross liability. 
Wolseley has insurance which exceeds the current 
estimated liability relating to asbestos claims. 
This year the Company has also improved the general 
liability insurance cover it procures.
Employee motivation and retention
73
Inherent risk level 
– Medium
Trend – Stable
Wolseley’s ability to provide leadership 
and products and services to customers 
depends on retaining sufﬁciently qualiﬁed, 
experienced and motivated personnel.
In order to increase productivity, and be 
able to take growth opportunities when 
markets improve, Wolseley must maintain 
the skills and experience of its existing 
management and continue to develop 
the managers of the future.
While staff turnover rates are stable at 
present the current difﬁcult conditions 
experienced in certain markets, and 
the Group’s response to them, may 
demotivate remaining staff.
An updated, comprehensive People Strategy was 
approved by the Board in 2011. This sets out key 
principles and practices for people management, which 
operating companies will implement in their businesses. 
Speciﬁc examples of activity in business units includes:
• reviews of succession planning and improved 
interview processes in Canada; and 
• a new leadership skills programme in Wolseley UK.
Effective personal performance management underpins 
this strategy. The quality of individuals’ performance 
reviews is being monitored and improved in all areas 
of the business.
The Company monitors voluntary turnover rates 
and employee engagement scores. Further metrics 
will be put in place in the coming year.
Succession planning exercises are undertaken each 
year, along with a review of the Company’s most 
talented and promising individuals.
Career mobility has been increased, providing more 
staff with the opportunity to work in different areas 
of the Group.
The Group continues to invest in development 
programmes for senior leadership, managers 
and all other staff. 46

Systems and infrastructure capabilities and resilience
73
Inherent risk level 
– Medium
Trend – Stable
The Group can only carry on business as 
long as it has the information technology 
and the physical infrastructure to do so. 
The safe and continued operation of such 
systems and infrastructure is threatened 
by natural and man-made perils and is 
affected by the level of investment 
available to improve them. For example:
• some of the Company’s physical assets 
are located in areas exposed to natural 
catastrophe risks;
• we remain reliant on a number of 
different technology systems across 
the Group, some of which have been 
operating for many years; 
• to optimise costs and supply chain 
efﬁciency, some companies within the 
Wolseley Group have also centralised 
their distribution network and are 
therefore reliant on a smaller number 
of larger distribution centres; and
• the level and sophistication of IT security 
threats are increasing.
Core IT systems and data centres for the Nordics, 
USA and UK have documented disaster recovery plans 
which are tested annually. 
In the United States, signiﬁcant improvements have 
been made in the recovery times for core systems and 
our business there has been certiﬁed as Payment Card 
Industry compliant.
External reviews have been conducted of data centres 
in the UK and Denmark, and recommendations for 
improvement are being addressed.
The Company operates an IT governance framework 
including dedicated IT security policies. Speciﬁc 
operational controls for IT security include intrusion 
prevention and detection, penetration testing, wireless 
remediation of issues, log and conﬁguration 
management and in-ﬂight projects to reduce the 
likelihood of an incident. 
The Company has made initial investments in software 
to improve its ability to identify and recover data.
The loss of a physical site is naturally hedged by 
the diversiﬁed nature of our locations, customers 
and suppliers. 
The Company has formally documented and tested plans 
for those distribution centres, head ofﬁce buildings and 
data centres where the risk is deemed to be greatest. 
A comprehensive insurance programme is purchased, 
including coverage for “cyber” risks. 47

Governmental regulations
 
Inherent risk level 
– Medium/low
Trend – Rising
The Group’s operations are affected by 
various statutes, regulations and laws 
in the countries and markets in which it 
operates. The amount of such regulation 
and the penalties can change. 
While the Group is not engaged in a highly 
regulated industry, it is subject to the laws 
governing businesses generally, including 
laws relating to competition, international 
trade, corruption and fraud, land usage, 
zoning, the environment, health and safety, 
transportation, labour and employment 
practices (including pensions), data 
protection, payment terms and 
other matters. 
The Group’s compliance with laws to prevent 
anti-competitive behaviour and to combat 
bribery and corruption remain a priority.
Building codes or particular tax treatments 
may affect the products Wolseley’s 
customers are allowed to use and, 
consequently, changes in these may affect 
the saleability of some Wolseley products.
The Group monitors regulations across its markets 
to ensure that the effects of changes are minimised 
and that compliance with all applicable regulation 
is continually sought. 
During the course of the year, a number of initiatives 
were undertaken to respond to new or updated laws 
and regulations. These include, for instance, the 
continual review and improvement of anti-fraud 
and anti-bribery procedures. 
The Company has been monitoring the progress of the 
EU Late Payment Directive. Initial analysis has been 
completed and the Company is well prepared to adapt 
if necessary. 48

Overview
Early in the ﬁnancial year the CR programme was discussed 
and reviewed comprehensively with each business unit and 
with the Board. It was found to continue to provide a suitable 
framework and included the elements that were important 
for the improvement of the business and its competitiveness. 
During the year, greater emphasis has been given to 
improving the processes for the sourcing and testing of 
our products (“Product Integrity”) and to our increasing 
involvement in the supply chain for sustainable construction. 
The seven key themes are shown opposite. These were 
identiﬁed by business unit management as those which could 
make the greatest contribution to operational improvement. 
The essential principle with all programme components is 
that they are integral to the way we do business. 
Key developments in the year
“People Strategy” updated and approved by the Board.
All branches reassessed for health and safety 
performance.
Health and safety systems across the Group reviewed 
and improved.
Ethics programme and Code of Conduct further 
embedded into the business.
Controls relating to bribery, fraud, corruption and 
anti-trust further strengthened.
Environmental improvement targets set for all Wolseley 
businesses.
Greater accuracy in environmental data reporting with 
reduced reliance on estimates.
Product Integrity programme launched and Group-wide 
Product Integrity policy and operating framework adopted.
Ethical sourcing policies and practices strengthened.
Increased customer training in sustainable construction 
products.
Continued increase in Wolseley backhauling of product 
from suppliers, reducing supplier emissions.
Governance of Corporate Responsibility
Who has overall accountability and sets direction?
The overall programme is agreed by the Board and reviewed 
annually to ensure its ongoing relevance to business 
strategy, stakeholder expectations and broader national and 
international sustainability agendas. The Group’s Company 
Secretary and General Counsel is responsible to the Board 
for the overall corporate responsibility programme and for 
maintaining regular dialogue with business units to drive 
performance. Individual programme components receive 
more frequent review and input by the Board and the 
Executive Committee. 
Who implements the strategy set by the Board?
With direction from the Board, business units deﬁne and 
execute local action plans. Business unit plans differ 
according to their own particular level of development and 
the greatest opportunities for progress in line with strategy. 
Recognising the business beneﬁt of sustainable performance, 
a dedicated Group Risk and Sustainability Manager 
was recruited in February 2012 to oversee implementation. 
Are targets and objectives set? 
Objectives and, in some cases, quantiﬁed targets are set 
for all of our CR programme components. For some of our 
focus areas, Group-wide KPIs have been deﬁned. This is 
not the case for all elements of our programme as it is not 
always practical to bring distinct local practices and reporting 
methods under one uniﬁed metric. Improved performance 
is our primary goal. Uniﬁed processes and measures are 
implemented where there is beneﬁt in doing so. We will 
continue to review the potential for further Group-wide 
performance metrics for future reporting. 
How is performance monitored?
Performance is measured by different teams for each 
programme component but performance is monitored 
across all CR programme components by the Group Risk 
and Sustainability team, according to each component’s 
speciﬁc objectives and targets. This year our internal audit 
teams have tested compliance with policy and adherence 
to procedures for a number of our programme components, 
including our health and safety and ethics programmes. 
Where comparable data is available we benchmark our 
performance against industry standards.
How are risks assessed and mitigated?
Non-ﬁnancial as well as ﬁnancial risks are assessed as part 
of the Group’s wider risk management process. These 
include fraud, corruption, product quality, health and safety 
and environmental compliance. For further information on 
the Group’s risk management programme, see pages 42 
to 47. A dedicated corporate responsibility risk assessment 
will be conducted in 2012/13 to ensure that our efforts are 
appropriately focused. Wolseley’s climate-related risks are 
also thoroughly reviewed and documented each year as part 
of our submission to the Carbon Disclosure Project. 50

People  
Development
We value our people and are committed to 
train and develop all of our employees. 
We understand, respect and value personal 
and cultural differences.
The development and retention of our people 
will lead to increased productivity and 
motivation, improved quality of operations and 
customer service, and a lowered cost base.
Health and Safety We will provide a safe and healthy working 
environment and we will not compromise 
the health and safety of any individual.
Protecting the health and safety of our people 
helps us to gain and maintain their trust and 
loyalty. It also ensures that we protect the skills 
and experience that are used to serve our 
customers. In addition, maintaining our physical 
assets minimises the risk of injury, helps us to 
preserve the integrity of our operations, 
improves efﬁciency, lowers our costs and 
improves the quality of our customer service.
Ethics Programme  
and Legal Compliance
We are committed to observing both the spirit 
and the letter of the laws of all jurisdictions in 
which we operate, and to complying with our 
Code of Conduct.
Conducting business responsibly and with 
integrity minimises risks related to fraud and 
corruption and strengthens our reputation. It 
also makes our business more efﬁcient because 
we avoid costly disruptions. Compliance 
programmes strengthen our internal controls.
Environmental  
Performance
We will run efﬁcient operations that consume 
less energy and fuel, produce less waste and 
reduce any negative effect of our business 
activities on the environment. 
We will explore opportunities to reduce 
the environmental impacts of our suppliers 
and customers.
Measuring our environmental performance in 
chosen areas will enable us to become more 
efﬁcient, reduce operational costs and reduce 
our impact on the environment. 
Product  
Integrity
We will work with our suppliers to maintain 
excellent standards of product quality 
and safety.
We expect our vendors, contractors and agents 
to adhere to our Code of Conduct and to adopt 
similar standards.
Improving productivity and improving customer 
service. Compliance with our product integrity 
policy reduces risks of litigation, claims and 
disruption. 
Sustainable

We will be a positive link in the sustainable 
construction supply chain. 
Gain market share – by exploiting opportunities 
of this new market and by attracting and 
maintaining customers through new customer 
services. 
Community  
Engagement
We will be a responsible member of the 
communities in which we work.
Building closer relationships with the 
communities in which we operate helps us 
to promote our business, attract high quality 
recruits and gain a greater understanding 
of our customers, vendors and employees.

  People Development
How does “People Development” 
underpin our strategy?
It is a business imperative to nurture and develop employees. 
A skilled and engaged workforce delivers excellent 
customer service, develops strong vendor relationships, 
and maximises operational efﬁciencies. New and more 
productive ways of working can be identiﬁed by a motivated 
and creative workforce.
What does “People Development” entail?
Our “People Strategy” was developed during 2011/12 
and was approved by the Board. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
People development is fundamental to our People Strategy 
– four of the six key components of the strategy relate 
directly to it and are described in more detail below.
Leadership
This includes running leadership and management 
development programmes, succession and promotion 
from within, modelling the right values and behaviours, 
and leadership in health and safety.
Performance management
This includes embedding basic people management skills, 
performance review and appraisal, coaching and 
mentoring, honest feedback and increasing productivity.
Training and development
This includes the provision of training skills for front-line 
employees, focusing on sales force productivity, branch 
manager development, functional standards and skills 
development, and induction.
Talent management
This includes the development of a pipeline of talent, 
succession planning, development plans and career 
pathing, targeted recruitment, objective assessment, 
movement of talent through international assignments 
and improving workforce diversity.
What did we achieve in 2011/12?
We provided skills training for front-line employees.
This has remained a strategic priority for the Group. 
Training programmes have been executed in all businesses. 
Wolseley Canada launched “Sales Effectiveness” training 
and “Driving a Culture of Customer Service Excellence” 
training, completed by over 400 employees. Ferguson 
provides speciﬁc sales training each month via a web-based 
FastTrain module on its intranet. Wolseley UK has launched 
an online training academy as part of a customer service 
and employee development drive, offering a broad range of 
modules. Around 1,000 courses are completed each month. 
All employees received a detailed performance review 
and feedback from their manager.
The results of these reviews inform their individual 
development plans and objectives for the next year.
We offered people development training to managers.
This is to ensure that high quality performance reviews and 
development discussions are held with all of our employees.
For the second consecutive year, we conducted 
engagement surveys in all of our business units.
We are pleased to report that scores have increased in all 
businesses compared to the previous year and remain very 
high when compared to industry averages in all countries 
of operation. At Ferguson, we are conducting quarterly 
Pulse Surveys on employee job satisfaction. This allows 
Ferguson leaders and the HR team to react quickly to 
current employee concerns.
We continued to manage an in-depth talent review and 
succession planning process for our senior leaders.
This took place with the Executive Committee and the 
Board. We have upgraded our succession planning process 
by making objective assessment an integral part of any 
senior internal appointment or external recruitment.

Ferguson focus on customer service
This year some of Ferguson’s well-established customer 
service training programmes were targeted to speciﬁc 
high-impact roles, such as counter sales associates. 
The counter training programme focuses on several areas 
including the inventory mix, stock levels, merchandise 
displays, the ﬂoor plan and layout, building customer 
relationships, and sales training. Feedback and ﬁndings 
from the secret shopper programme were integrated into 
the training and used as a teaching tool, to recognise 
outstanding associate behaviour and to identify 
opportunities for improvement. 
  Health and Safety
How does “Health and Safety” underpin 
our strategy?
A robust health and safety programme and a positive health 
and safety culture improve productivity by reducing the 
number of days lost to injury. It helps to protect proﬁtability 
by reducing our liabilities and helps to gain market share 
where contracts require strong health and safety credentials.
What does “Health and Safety” entail?
Our businesses are continuously improving the systems in 
place to manage the health and safety of our employees, 
customers and others with whom we come into contact. 
These systems include policies stating our approach and 
intent, and tools such as risk assessments, documented 
safe working practices and self-assessments. At a Group 
level we measure and report injury rates, lost workday rates 
and collision rates. For many of our businesses, additional 
business or country speciﬁc measures are in place.
What did we achieve in 2011/12?
We improved performance against our three health 
and safety metrics.
Our performance metrics are injury rate, lost workday rate 
and ﬂeet collision rate. These are shown on page 54.
We assessed the maturity of our health and safety 
management systems.
Business units scored themselves on a maturity matrix 
in the following categories: culture and values; policies 
and standards; governance and director competence; 
organisational structures, roles and responsibilities; 
management systems; performance management; and 
monitoring and audit. The results were benchmarked 
against publicly available information on our competitors and 
other companies regarded as leaders in health and safety 
management. Whilst there were areas of very good practice, 
we found some aspects of our processes to be below the 
standards we aspire to and we have worked hard to improve 
our performance over the last year (see the table overleaf). 
We repeated the self-assessment in August 2012 to gauge 
our progress and to identify key areas for improvement in the 
coming year. Our aim remains to demonstrate good practice 
in all categories and in all parts of the Group.
Health and safety has more prominence on Executive 
Committee and Board agendas.
The Executive Committee and the Board conduct quarterly 
reviews of health and safety performance.
A comprehensive Board review of health and safety 
performance and programmes takes place once a year.
Operational branch audits were completed in all 
major businesses by December 2011.
Self-assessments for the UK, USA, Denmark, Sweden, 
Finland, Austria, Switzerland, France and Canada are 
complete. Action plans are being implemented to deliver 
against the audit recommendations. 54
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Corporate responsibility continued
Internal audits have been conducted in a number 
of our businesses to assess health and safety 
compliance and the accuracy of reported data.
Internal audits of health and safety compliance have been 
completed in the USA, France, the UK, Canada, and most 
Nordic and Central European businesses.
Internal audits of the KPI reporting process have been 
completed in each region.
Employee surveys on health and safety were 
completed in most business units.
Where possible, speciﬁc health and safety questions were 
integrated into the employee engagement survey process. 
Also, Ferguson dedicated one of their quarterly employee 
surveys to health and safety, gaining input on attitudes 
from over 1,000 employees. The UK business integrated 
health and safety questions into its “Have your say” 
engagement survey.
Health and safety specialists across the Group 
regularly share best practice.
Health and safety specialists from each region participate 
in a quarterly best-practice call.
Health and safety specialists met at the Wolseley Risk 
Conference in April 2012 where they had dedicated 
workshops on performance improvement.

We are pleased to report a reduction in our collision rate 
(17% improvement) and lost work day rate (7% improvement) 
across the Group. Our injury rate has increased (5% 
deterioration) attributable to improved data and an increase 
in the number of new employees. Each business unit has 
improvement targets in place for the coming year. 
The charts that follow show our performance over the past 
three years. Following a review of the three Group KPIs, 
we decided to report injuries per 100,000 hours worked 
instead of per 100 employees. We have done this in order 
to move our reporting metrics more in line with industry 
standard reporting practices to allow us to benchmark 
our performance more effectively. The injury rate per 100

Reducing injuries in Canada
Wolseley Canada has reduced work-related injuries by over 
40 per cent and lost workdays by over 67 per cent in the 
last ﬁve years as a result of the ongoing implementation of 
the Occupational Health and Safety Management System 
(OHSMS) 18001. The process involved a detailed gap 
analysis, new policy development, best-practice sharing 
initiatives, job hazard analysis and a commitment to 
ownership by branch management. A bi-annual health 
and safety Facility Self-Assessment was initiated in the last 
ﬁnancial year to continuously self-evaluate branch safety 
performance. A ﬁnancial reward is given to those branches 
that achieve 90 per cent conformance to the OHSMS 18001 
Assessment. To date, over 80 per cent of the branches 
in the programme have a score of 90 per cent or better.  55

  Ethics Programme and 
Legal Compliance
How does the “Ethics Programme and Legal 
Compliance” underpin our strategy?
Compliance with the letter and the spirit of the law and a 
commitment to high ethical standards protects our business 
from unforeseen liabilities and strengthens our reputation 
with stakeholders; it nurtures trust across our customer 
and supplier base; it gives reassurance to our shareholders; 
and it instils conﬁdence in our workforce.
What does the “Ethics Programme and Legal 
Compliance” entail?
Our Ethics Programme and Code of Conduct aim to 
strengthen our core values (see page 11) by setting out 
in clear terms the standards and behaviour expected of 
our employees and, in some cases, our business partners. 
It sets out the high ethical standards which Wolseley expects 
from its employees and others carrying out its business, 
focusing on compliance with the law, in particular avoiding 
bribery, corruption and fraud, maintenance of gifts and 
hospitality registers, preservation of conﬁdential information, 
managing conﬂicts of interest, treating customers and 
vendors fairly, engaging in fair competition, maintaining high 
standards of corporate governance, providing a safe and 
healthy working environment, running efﬁcient operations, 
minimising waste and limiting our environmental impact, 
and developing our employees and valuing diversity.
What did we achieve in 2011/12?
Our Code of Conduct was further embedded into 
the business following its introduction in the last 
ﬁnancial year.
All new joiners are required to complete training on our Code 
of Conduct, competition law and anti-bribery and corruption, 
tailored to their role and seniority.
Our controls for the prevention of bribery, fraud and 
corruption were strengthened over the year.
Employees most at risk were identiﬁed and a programme 
of training is in place. Internal audits were carried out in the 
UK and further audits are planned for the next ﬁnancial year. 
Areas for improvement have been identiﬁed and action 
plans developed. Businesses are also planning to assess 
their suppliers to review their compliance with bribery and 
corruption policies, and are conducting risk assessments 
of bribery and corruption risks.
An online competition law refresher course is 
in the process of being introduced throughout 
our businesses. 
This supplements the full online training course that is 
provided every two to three years. Advanced face-to-face 
competition law training is being developed and will be 
provided to relevant employees during 2012/13.
We continue to encourage our employees to 
report any incidences of non-compliance through 
our Group-wide conﬁdential reporting system, 
“Speak Up!”.
Employees can disclose information in any language, 
conﬁdentially and anonymously via an international hotline, 
voicemail or web message. The conﬁdential reports are 
investigated and, where necessary, actions are taken to 
rectify any weakness in our systems that may have been 
identiﬁed. These actions, and the overall integrity of the 
reporting system, are subject to regular scrutiny by the 
Audit Committee.

  Environmental 
Performance
How does “Environmental Performance” 
underpin our strategy?
The reduced consumption of energy, fuel and water and 
production of waste lessens our environmental impact whilst 
reducing cost, improving our operational efﬁciencies and 
expanding our gross margins. Responsible environmental 
management helps to protect our reputation, as increasingly 
customers assess our environmental credentials through 
pre-qualiﬁcation questionnaires.
What does “Environmental Performance” entail?
Environmental performance concerns the management 
and reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions, our waste 
and our water consumption. Where possible, we work 
with our suppliers to reduce their environmental impacts. 
For example, we reduce supplier transport emissions by 
“backhauling” product from their factories when our trucks 
would otherwise return empty to our distribution centres. 
This reduces the mileage and related CO2 emissions of our 
suppliers whilst also reducing Wolseley’s costs and number 
of “empty miles” on the road. 
What did we achieve in 2011/12?
We reduced our absolute greenhouse gas 
emissions (12% improvement), waste production 
(6% improvement) and water consumption 
(6% improvement).
We reduced the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions 
and waste production (per £million of revenue). 
Water consumption (per employee) increased slightly.

Our performance statistics and examples of how our 
businesses have improved their environmental performance 
are detailed in the greenhouse gas emissions, in the waste 
and water sections that follow, with further examples 
available on our website www.wolseley.com.
All of our businesses now have environmental targets 
in place.
The environmental impacts that are most material to Wolseley 
are vehicle fuel consumption, electricity consumption and 
waste production. All businesses now have reduction 
targets in place for their two biggest carbon contributors 
(i.e, fuel and energy) and waste to landﬁll. Local targets 
differ according to local business objectives, ensuring 
that performance targets are owned by and remain the 
responsibility of each business unit. The Group-level targets 
are an aggregation of the targets set by each of our 
businesses.
We have improved the reliability of our 
environmental data.
Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to gain visibility of actual 
consumption data and to rely less on estimates. The level of 
data derived from estimates has dropped from 60 per cent 
to 36 per cent in our greenhouse gas reporting, from 74 per 
cent to 23 per cent in our waste reporting and from 83 per 
cent to 25 per cent in our water reporting. Future years will 
see the estimation level drop further as we challenge old 
processes and work with our suppliers and branches to 
improve data accuracy and completeness. 
The valuable knowledge of our environmental experts 
is now shared across the Group.
Knowledge sharing sessions have been run to develop best 
practices and facilitate achievement of targets.
The following pages describe our future targets and 
historical performance. Future targets have been set 
against a relative measure, e.g. per £million revenue. 
Historical performance shown in the charts on pages  
57 and 58 show absolute ﬁgures. 57

Performance ﬁgures are based on precise data rather than 
the rounded data shown in the charts. Where environmental 
data has not been included due to business disposals, 
the relative measures (revenue and employees) have been 
recalculated to ensure a like-for-like comparison. 
The Group has lowered its relative impact for both greenhouse 
gas emissions and waste production. Absolute ﬁgures 
reduced across all three metrics. Improved data accuracy 
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced these ﬁgures as businesses reported 
more actual data and relied less on estimations. Additionally, 
new data has been captured that was not included in 
previous years’ reporting.

Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as tonnes of CO2 equivalent 
(abbreviated as tCO2e), based on the Global Warming Potential (“GWP”) 
of each of the “basket of six” greenhouse gases, as deﬁned by the Kyoto 
Protocol. The GWP of CO2 is 1 (1 tonne CO2 = 1 tonne CO2e). For other 
greenhouse gases in the “basket of six”, including refrigerants, the GWP 
is relative to the CO2 over a 100-year time horizon (e.g. one tonne of the 
refrigerant R407C is equivalent to 1,526 tonnes of CO2 in terms of its potential 
impact on climate change).
As a Group, our biggest contributors to carbon emissions 
are vehicle fuel (64.4 per cent of total tCO2e, including both 
commercial and company car ﬂeets), and electricity (25.7 per 
cent). Fuel consumption for operations (i.e, gas, oil and 
district heating consumption) represents 8.2 per cent of our 
carbon footprint. Refrigerant leakage and business travel 
account for 0.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively. As in 
previous years, tCO2e emissions have been reported in 
accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (“GHG 
Protocol”). Wolseley reports on its Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions, as deﬁned by the GHG Protocol, and aims to 
report on its Scope 3 emissions wherever possible. The 
chart in the previous column therefore includes selected 
Scope 3 emissions (those arising from business travel).
Local initiatives that have driven reductions in our tCO2e 
emissions from our commercial vehicle ﬂeet include the 
phased switch towards higher-efﬁciency vehicles, the 
monitoring of idling time for trucks, and route optimisation 
programmes. Company car ﬂeets are increasingly low-carbon 
as businesses transition their ﬂeets to more fuel-efﬁcient 
vehicles. Regarding fuel use for operations, solutions have 
included the installation of building-management systems, 
heating system upgrades and fuel-switching (i.e, oil to gas 
heating) where possible. Reductions in electricity consumption 
have been achieved through the use of energy-efﬁcient lighting, 
data centre consolidation and various behavioural initiatives. 
More detailed case studies are available on our website.
Greening of Ferguson
Ferguson has established standards to quantify its 
environmental impact, and created a dashboard to track 
progress. The company’s six initial areas of focus are: 
recycling; fuel usage; utilities; landﬁll; water consumption; 
and distribution centre transportation (or reducing “empty 
miles”). A recent pilot programme to retroﬁt lighting in 
Ferguson’s distribution centres has delivered signiﬁcant 
savings, while also reducing carbon emissions by 3,383 
tCO2e per annum. The new ﬁxtures utilise motion sensors 
to provide on-demand lighting and are much brighter, 
creating a better work environment. In addition to lighting 
upgrades, the company is raising awareness and exploring 
many options to reduce its environmental impacts through 
activities such as replacing aerators on faucets, installing 
low-ﬂush toilets, and advancing recycling efforts.  58
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Corporate responsibility continued
Additionally, we reduced our suppliers’ emissions 
through “backhauling”. 
Wolseley UK estimates that it saved at least 1,512,245 
supplier kms in 2011/12, equating to 1,376 tonnes of avoided 
supplier transport emissions. In the USA, Ferguson also 
carries out backhauling for suppliers through its carrier, UPS. 
Ferguson ﬁlled 38 per cent of its distribution centre backhaul 
“empty miles” in 2011/12, versus 35 per cent for the 2010/11.
2. Waste management
Wolseley moves large volumes of product through its supply 
chain, generating non-hazardous packaging waste and some 
damaged or obsolete stock. The Group’s businesses also create 
smaller quantities of hazardous waste. Deﬁnitions vary from 
country to country: hazardous waste may include items such as 
batteries, paint and electronic equipment; non-hazardous waste 
typically includes materials such as paper, plastic and metal.

In 2011/12, 10 per cent of hazardous waste and 22 per cent 
of non-hazardous waste was recycled. This compares with 
7 per cent and 27 per cent respectively for the previous year. 
The remaining waste was sent to landﬁll or incinerated. 
Whilst total waste tonnage decreased by 6 per cent, 
non-hazardous waste sent to landﬁll increased by 8 per cent. 
This is largely due to improved data accuracy, not worsening 
performance. Our business units strive to increase the 
proportion of total waste that is recycled, and reduction 
targets for waste to landﬁll will help in achieving this.
Wolseley UK’s Leamington Spa site, comprising the Wolseley 
Center, the National Distribution Center (NDC) and the 
Sustainable Building Center now sends zero waste to direct 
landﬁll, after the three buildings all reached industry-leading 
waste targets. Following a complete change in the way waste 
is handled, 99.8 per cent of waste at the NDC and 97.5 per 
cent of waste from the Wolseley Center is now recyclable, 
meaning that just 2.7 per cent of the site’s entire waste is 
compacted and sent for incineration to generate electricity. 
80 per cent less waste sent to landﬁll 
at Beijer Byggmaterial
Beijer Byggmaterial in Sweden is ISO14001 certiﬁed at all 
65 branches and waste management is a core part of the 
environmental management system. Over the past ten 
years Beijer has reduced the level of waste sent to landﬁll 
from 100 per cent to less than 20 per cent of total waste 
produced. Beijer started by setting up recycling stations 
at branches and signing agreements with local waste 
contractors. Since work began in 2001, the legal 
requirements in Sweden have tightened and waste 
management has improved even further. Efforts to improve 
waste management are continuous, and Beijer target an 
additional 25 per cent reduction on waste to landﬁll over 
the next two years. The cost of sending waste to landﬁll is 
high and efforts to reduce the impact of waste produced 
also serves to protect the bottom line.
3. Water use
The majority of the Group’s water consumption is related 
to normal operational and sanitary use. Although water 
consumption is not as material a factor in our operations as it 
would be for a manufacturer, we have continued to measure 
water consumption throughout the Group in an effort to 
monitor our water consumption and identify opportunities to 
increase our water efﬁciency. Some of our local businesses 
have targets in place for reduced water consumption but 
targets are not required for all businesses and a Group-level 
target has not been set.

  Product Integrity
How does “Product Integrity” underpin our 
strategy?
At Wolseley, product integrity means ensuring that we 
source and supply safe products that are of suitable quality 
as efﬁciently as possible. In doing so we improve the 
efﬁciency of our processes, aim to improve our margins, 
avoid liability arising from defective products and maintain or 
grow market share through enhanced customer satisfaction 
and conﬁdence.
What does “Product Integrity” entail?
Product integrity includes:
• ensuring that our products are reliable and robust, and 
safe when used for their intended purpose; and
• understanding our business partners, the quality of their 
systems and how they conduct their business and provide 
their services; and
• ensuring compliance with legal standards.
What did we achieve in 2011/12?
We issued a Group-wide Product Integrity policy.
This is supported by a standard operating framework, 
to improve the integrity of the products we source.
Business units have begun to implement more 
structured procedures for the evaluation of suppliers 
and products.
Some already conduct more systematic risk assessments in 
accordance with the new policy. This activity will continue 
through the next ﬁnancial year.
We continued to strengthen our timber sourcing 
policies and procedures.
In March 2013, the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) will come 
into effect. The regulation introduces obligations for conﬁrming 
the integrity and source of products on the operator and/or 
importer of the timber products. Operators must implement 
a due diligence process which enables them to trace timber 
products at every stage in the chain of custody and to 
conﬁrm their legality at the place of harvest. Wolseley has 
already been assessing its timber products for a number 
of years and, working with a specialist business partner, 
has developed a system which we expect will meet the 
requirements of the EUTR.
Efforts to improve our commitment to product integrity 
are continuous. In addition to the introduction of greater 
consistency in our processes, there is now closer 
collaboration amongst our sourcing and quality assurance 
and quality control specialists within the Group to ensure 
that best practices are shared more effectively.
What are our objectives, how did we perform in 
2011/12 and what are our objectives for 2012/13?
Metrics 2012/13 objectives
Product integrity metrics 
will begin to be reported 
during 2012/13. These will

  Sustainable 
Construction
How does engagement in the “Sustainable 
Construction” supply chain underpin our strategy?
The requirement for sustainable construction is growing 
at differing rates in our markets and, where the market 
opportunity exists, we can gain market share by stocking 
sustainable construction products and by offering training 
and advice to our traditional customer base.
What does engagement in the “Sustainable 
Construction” supply chain entail?
There is no standard deﬁnition of what “Sustainable 
Construction” products are. In general terms they include 
products that:
• improve the thermal efﬁciency of a building (i.e, insulation 
products, draft-prooﬁng); or
• increase the efﬁciency of a building’s systems (i.e, heating 
controls, energy-efﬁcient lighting, water-efﬁcient showers); 
or
• generate clean energy (i.e, solar thermal or ground-source 
heat pumps).
The sustainability of a product also refers to its impact over its 
life-cycle and takes into account the scarcity of the materials 
that go into its fabrication, the environmental impact arising 
from its production, and the waste impact at end of use.
Each of our businesses develops their product and service 
offerings according to local market conditions. Engagement in 
the supply chain for these products can include the stocking 
and promoting of relevant products, and offering training 
and advice to both customers and our own employees.
What did we achieve in 2011/12?
We worked to engage our customers in sustainable 
construction
We recognise the need for traditional plumbing and heating 
engineers to be familiar with new renewable products 
and solutions, and have developed facilities that allow 
customers to experience the products ﬁrst hand. In 2008, 
Wolseley UK opened the Sustainable Building Center, the 
UK’s ﬁrst commercial showcase for sustainable building 
products and construction methods. It has since opened 
a number of renewables showrooms around the UK. 
Wasco in the Netherlands and ÖAG in Austria have also 
opened specialist energy showrooms to showcase the 
latest energy-efﬁcient or sustainable products.
Training is a key element of the customer proposition 
in this sector, with some Wolseley businesses developing 
comprehensive training courses and opening training 
centres to encourage the industry to get on board. 
Equipping our own employees with the necessary expertise 
to sell into this market is equally important. France launched 
its “Eco Chantiers” renewables model in 2010, training over 
300 of their employees to be energy-efﬁciency and 
renovation experts. 
We publish tailored sustainable-product guides in a number 
of markets to assist customers in identifying better products. 
Beijer, in Sweden, has developed a product label called 
“Green Choice” which helps its customers to select 
products that enable improved energy-efﬁciency and 
reduced carbon emissions.
Where relevant our businesses are engaging with policy 
makers with regard to building regulations and retroﬁt energy 
efﬁciency policy. In particular, Wolseley UK has actively 
participated in government consultation processes for the 
“Green Deal”, the UK’s ﬂagship energy efﬁciency policy due 
for launch in autumn 2012. In addition, individuals contribute 
their time and expertise in the development of brieﬁng 
documents and in otherwise contributing to consultations 
and legislative proposals.
What are our objectives, how did we perform in 
2011/12 and what are our targets for 2012/13?
The Board reviewed our approach to the market opportunity 
for sustainable construction products during 2011/12. 
The Company will not set prescriptive actions or targets in 
this area at a Group level due to varying levels of market 
development and differing business strategies. Business 
units will continue to regularly monitor the market opportunity 
for these products and will share expertise and best practice 
across the Group to facilitate market entry or increased 
market share.
Wolseley UK engages with the “Green Deal” 
Plumb Center, in the UK, is developing its plans to engage 
in the “Green Deal” from autumn 2012. The Green Deal is 
the UK Government’s policy to achieve carbon savings 
from existing buildings. The basis of the Green Deal is to 
provide capital to allow building owners to carry out energy 
efﬁciency work and then repay the cost of the work over 
an extended period through their electricity bills. Plumb 
Center, together with training partners Sevenoaks Energy 
Academy, is providing certiﬁed training and qualiﬁcations 
for customers wanting to become Green Deal Advisors 
and Installers. The ﬁrst of Plumb Center’s Green Deal 
Workshops took place on 14 June and was attended 
and endorsed by the Energy and Climate Change Minister, 
Greg Barker. Plumb Center is positioning itself as a key link 
in the Green Deal supply chain by providing their customers 
with the products, skills and tools required to deliver 
Green Deal measures.

  Community Engagement
How does “Community Engagement” underpin 
our strategy?
By engaging with the communities in which we operate 
we promote our business, attract high quality recruits and 
gain a greater understanding of our customers, vendors 
and employees. Community or charitable events serve to 
enhance employee skills and increase employee engagement.
What does “Community Engagement” entail?
Our businesses seek to be contributing members to the 
communities in which they operate. We also support a 
number of charitable organisations both at a Group and a 
business unit level. Our principal areas for charitable support 
continue to be the alleviation of homelessness, the provision 
of training for the homeless or marginalised in order to allow 
them to return to work, and the improvement of the quality of 
the built environment. Our businesses have also supported 
numerous other charitable causes, including support for 
neglected and vulnerable children and provision of care for 
sufferers of cancer or other illnesses.
Who is responsible?
Community engagement is, by its very nature, a local activity 
and our corporate head ofﬁces and individual businesses 
manage their own activities in this area to suit their own 
preferences and locations. We encourage all of our 
employees to engage in charitable or community activities 
outside the workplace and we recognise the value that this 
brings to communities and the personal reward and new 
skills it can bring to our employees.
What did we achieve in 2011/12?
Our employees engaged in a great number of 
community and charity events. 
For examples of the events and schemes our employees 
and businesses have supported over the last year please 
visit our website www.wolseley.com.
We are in the third year of our partnership with 
Impetus Trust.
Impetus works to break the cycle of poverty by investing in 
ambitious charities and social enterprises that ﬁght economic 
disadvantage through helping people to gain education, 
skills and jobs. It uses a highly effective venture philanthropy 
model, consisting of management support from the Impetus 
investment team, pro bono specialist expertise and strategic 
funding, to accelerate the growth of those organisations. 
This has led to impressive growth rates in charities Impetus 
has supported, on average increasing their annual income 
by 31 to 40 per cent. Included in the Impetus portfolio is 
Blue Sky Development and Regeneration – see our website 
for more details.
In the UK, we are a member of the Corporate 
Partnerships Programme of the Prince’s Foundation 
for Building Community.
During the year, the Prince’s Foundation for the Built 
Environment re-oriented its strategy towards the improvement 
of communities. With its new name – the Prince’s Foundation 
for Building Community – it focuses on the impact that 
community building can have on people’s lives. This year 
Wolseley enhanced its support by joining the Corporate 
Partnerships Programme. 
Ferguson helps the homeless
Ferguson associates at their headquarters in Newport 
News, Virginia, recently participated in the Peninsula 50 
campaign to identify and secure housing for the most 
vulnerable homeless individuals and families in its 
community. The local campaign is part of state and 
nationwide efforts to ﬁnd permanent homes for 100,000 
of the country’s most vulnerable homeless persons by 
July 2014. Associates from Ferguson’s headquarters 
volunteered their time from 4 to 7am for three days, logging 
names, phone numbers, health information and housing 
history, to identify those most vulnerable to premature 
death because of homelessness. In addition to volunteer 
services, Ferguson has also given ﬁnancial support to the 
Greater Virginia Peninsula Homelessness Consortium 
which brings together numerous non-proﬁt organisations 
working to secure housing and services for the area’s 
homeless population.

Governance
Dear Shareholder
At Wolseley we are always committed to high standards 
of corporate governance. Your Board provides strong 
leadership to the Company and has effective and 
constructive relationships with the management team 
and shareholders.
Your Board
The relationships within the Board have developed well 
during this ﬁnancial year and the culture in the Wolseley 
boardroom is one where all Directors are invited to speak 
freely and raise difﬁcult questions. I believe that this results 
in a collaborative and conscientious Board. I encourage 
contribution from all Directors and we conduct our meetings 
in an environment where ideas can be both questioned 
and developed. This results in better quality decisions, 
made the right way.
Your Non Executive Directors all continue to be independent 
and objective and play an essential role in the composition 
of our Board due to the skills and expertise they bring.
An externally-facilitated Board evaluation was conducted 
this year in line with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The evaluation indicated that the Board 
and its Committees are operating effectively and to high 
standards of governance, and that the skills of the Board 
are balanced. The evaluation process, together with the 
conclusions and the recommendations for improvement, 
are discussed further on page 72.
Remuneration
Remuneration has been a signiﬁcant issue for shareholders 
of many UK companies during the last year. Although 
Wolseley is a Jersey incorporated company, we continue 
to consider it appropriate to provide you with the safeguards 
you would expect to apply to a UK registered company. 
We have monitored and contributed to consultations during 
the year and we will adapt our remuneration policy and 
practices to meet the standards of any new legislation 
that is introduced.
The Remuneration Committee and Board are fully aware of 
the current climate and commend the Board (both Executive 
and Non Executive Directors) and the Executive Committee 
who will all take a salary pay freeze in the next ﬁnancial year. 
We are also fully informed of our shareholders’ views on all 
aspects of remuneration and all correspondence is given 
proper consideration. I believe that the work of the 
Remuneration Committee and the Board shows us to have 
been responsive and responsible in our approach.
Further response to the Davies Report
As mentioned last year, we welcomed the ﬁndings and 
recommendations of Lord Davies’ report, “Women on Boards” 
(the “Report”). As at the date of this annual report, we have 
one woman on the Board, Tessa Bamford, due to the 
departure of Karen Witts during the year. Karen stepped 
down from the Board in light of her appointment as Finance 
Director of Kingﬁsher plc, in order to avoid any risk of a conﬂict 
of interest. In her short tenure at Wolseley, Karen made a 
valuable contribution to the Board and its Committees. 
Nevertheless, we still expect the diversity of the Board to 
meet the recommendations set out in the Report by 2015.
Through my leadership, I support the work which the 
Nominations Committee, the Board and the Company 
as a whole are currently undertaking in relation to diversity 
and succession planning. The Report has given us an 
opportunity to consider a drive for change. The terms 
of reference for the Nominations Committee have been 
amended ahead of the proposed changes to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code to include speciﬁc reference 
for the Board to consider diversity when selecting candidates 
for Board and senior management positions. 
Refreshment of the Board and succession 
planning in the Company
I have worked with the Nominations Committee to consider 
our aspirations in relation to diversity and review the evolution 
of the composition of the Board and its Committees. 
We have also anticipated that the tenure of Andrew Duff 
(our Senior Independent Director and Remuneration 
Committee Chairman) will come to an end in 2013. We have 
identiﬁed the balance of skills, experience, capabilities, 
independence, diversity and knowledge of the Company 
required on the Board and its Committees against which 
future appointments will be made.
As noted by Ian in his Chief Executive’s review, there are 
areas where we know we can improve, including diversity 
and workforce planning. The Board and senior management 
place great importance on the way we develop the talent 
of our employees and we recognise this as an area that we 
can continue to improve. We already have high quality 
development plans which provide solid career path 
opportunities that can ultimately lead to progression to senior 
management and Board positions. We recognise that there 
is an opportunity for more women to hold senior roles (both 
operational and functional) in Wolseley. We are conscious 
that for the Company as a whole, much more needs to be 
done to improve the diversity of our workforce. The beneﬁts 
that diversity brings are well recognised and our recruitment 
and development policies take into account the need to 
consider a variety of factors, not only the gender of the 
candidate or employee. Diversity of background, outlook 
and experience are all important to us, and at any level – 
the Board included – the principal criterion has to be 
and remains that of excellence.
During the next ﬁnancial year, we will prioritise workforce 
diversity at all levels of the organisation. In addition, we will 
assess our senior leadership development programmes and 
redesign them as appropriate to ensure that they align with 
our business strategy and leadership proﬁle. Your Board will 
continue to monitor this across the Group on a regular basis 
and it is part of our ongoing HR strategy.
I look forward to leading the Board through this period of 
development and overseeing the changes ahead to further 
strengthen your Board.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Overview Performance Governance Financials Information
Corporate and governance structure of the Group
Where does Wolseley plc carry on 
business and which rules apply to it?
Wolseley plc is a public company limited by shares and 
incorporated in Jersey with registered number 106605. 
It is tax resident in Switzerland. The Company has a 
premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, and is 
therefore subject to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority. The Company complies with the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
and relevant institutional shareholder guidelines.
It was a decision at the time of redomiciliation in November 
2010 that, although the Company (being Jersey incorporated) 
is not subject to the UK Companies Act, the Board wished 
to retain its existing standards of governance and corporate 
responsibility. It therefore continues to provide shareholder 
safeguards which are similar to those that apply to a UK 
registered company.
Under Wolseley plc, the Wolseley Group carries on its 
businesses across 18 countries through a number of 
operating companies. The Group is made up of six 
geographic regions led by four Chief Executives for: USA 
and Canada, UK, France, and Nordics and Central Europe. 
They are Executive Committee Members and report directly 
to Ian Meakins. 
What is Wolseley’s governance structure?
See page 63 for a diagram of the governance structure. 
The Major Announcements Committee is also a Committee 
of the Board. By its nature and as anticipated by its terms 
of reference, it would usually meet only in exceptional 
circumstances where information has come to light which 
is of an unexpected, non-routine, and material nature. 
There were no meetings in the year.
How do we ensure good governance 
throughout the Group?
Wolseley’s Group-wide policies and procedures provide a 
framework for governance and are underpinned by the 
Group’s core values and Code of Conduct. Through the 
Group’s core values we expect and ensure that:
• We act with integrity
• We value our people
• We drive for results and improvement
The role and activities during the year of the Board and its 
Committees are set out on the following pages.
Remuneration Committee
Chaired by Andrew Duff
Number of meetings in the year: 5
Role of the Committee
The Committee review and recommends to the Board 
the framework and policy for the remuneration of the 
Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Executive 
Committee. The remuneration of the Non Executive 
Directors is determined by the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors. The Committee takes into account 
the business strategy of the Group and how remuneration 
policy should reﬂect and support that strategy.
 
  For more information on the Remuneration Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee Report

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Who is on our Board?
As at 31 July 2012, the Board was made up of eight members 
consisting of the Chairman, three Executive Directors and 
four Non Executive Directors. Biographical details for each of 
the Directors in ofﬁce as at 31 July 2012 are shown on pages 
64 to 65. Karen Witts was appointed as a Non Executive 
Director during the ﬁnancial year, but stepped down from the 
Board on 2 July following her appointment as Group Finance 
Director of Kingﬁsher plc.
The Chairman and Non Executive Directors are each 
considered by the Board to be independent and free of any 
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise 
of their independent judgement.
When and where does the Board meet?
The Board met regularly during the year, with Board and 
Committee meetings scheduled over two-day periods. 
There were six scheduled meetings and details of 
attendance are shown in the table below.

1  Due to personal circumstances, Mr Davis was unable to attend the March 
Board meeting.
2  Karen Witts was appointed 1 November 2011 and stepped down on 2 July 
2012. She attended all meetings which she was eligible to attend.
In addition to the scheduled meetings, two unscheduled 
meetings were convened at short notice to deal with urgent 
issues that needed to be considered before the next 
scheduled meeting. Some of the Directors were unable 
to attend these unscheduled meetings due to prior 
commitments which could not be rearranged. In each case 
the matters decided at those unscheduled meetings had 
already been discussed in detail by the full Board at previous 
meetings. Of those two unscheduled meetings, the ﬁrst was 
attended by Messrs Davis, Meakins and Roach and the 
second by Messrs Davis, Martin and Meakins.
As noted on page 67 , the Company is Jersey registered 
and remains tax resident in Switzerland. During the year all 
meetings of the Board and Committees of the Board were 
held in Switzerland and all other meetings requiring decisions 
of a strategic or substantive nature were also held outside 
the United Kingdom. 
In order to provide the Board with greater visibility of the 
Group’s operations and exposure to senior management, 
the Board intends to visit at least one of the Group’s 
business unit locations each year. Such visits allow the 
Board to gain a deeper understanding of local market 
dynamics and they are able to assess management 
performance and potential. 
In January 2012, the Board and Committee meetings were 
held near Zurich and provided an opportunity for executives 
from Tobler to meet the Board and discuss the business in 
Switzerland in more detail. This was followed by a tour of 
Tobler’s distribution centre at Däniken in central Switzerland. 
In addition, members of the Board periodically visit business 
units and management around the Group. 
Who attends Board meetings?
Each Director is required to attend all meetings of the Board 
or Committees of which they are a member. In addition, 
senior management from across the Group and advisers 
attend some of the meetings for the discussion of speciﬁc 
items in greater depth.
This exposure to the members of senior management from 
across the business has been of vital importance to the 
Board this year. It has further enhanced their understanding 
of the business, the implementation of strategy and the 
changing dynamics of the market in which the business 
units operate.

What has our Board done during the year?
The Board had an agenda programme which ensured that 
items relating to strategy, ﬁnance, operations, corporate 
governance and compliance were covered in its meetings.
Having identiﬁed the areas which the Board focused on 
during the year, set out below are some highlights of its 
activities. This is not an exhaustive list but provides some 
key highlights.
Strategy
The Board continued its discussion of the evolution of the 
Company’s strategy and business models at each meeting. 
In addition, a full strategy review was undertaken through a 
dedicated Board Strategy Day in May 2012. Management 
from all Clusters presented their proposals for the strategic 
development of their businesses and there was detailed 
analysis of some speciﬁc future initiatives. More information 
on our strategy can be found on pages 8 to 11.
Operations
At least once in each year, the Board will review in detail 
the operational performance of each region.
Every Board meeting features a discussion of a speciﬁc 
operational example of best practice that has been 
developed and shared amongst the businesses. 
These examples are chosen from matters discussed by 
senior management representatives on regular webinars, 
led by Ian Meakins. Items covered during the year included 
employment practices, pricing strategies, gross margin 
improvements and best use of technology. All information 
is readily available to senior managers across the Group 
through a centrally maintained portal.
People
There was continued focus on the composition and 
succession of the Board, Executive Committee and senior 
management team. In March 2012, the Board reviewed the 
leadership roles across the Group with the Group HR 
Director as part of its regular review process. The Board 
believes the talent and succession planning processes to be 
of a high standard and are familiar with the plans across the 
leadership team. As noted in the Chairman’s foreword on 
page 62, there is further work to be done in this area during 
the coming year.
Finance
The Board regularly monitored the Group’s ﬁnancial 
performance. All ﬁnancial statements to the market were 
discussed and reviewed. The 2012/13 budget was reviewed 
and approved at the July 2012 meeting.  70

Why should you vote to re-elect 
your Board?
The Board contains a broad range of experience and skills 
from a variety of industries and advisory roles, which fully 
complement each other and will be strengthened through 
further appointments over the next year. 
As noted on page 71, all the Directors including the 
Chairman continue to allocate sufﬁcient time to discharge 
their duties and are fully committed to their roles. 
In accordance with Provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all Directors will stand for re-election at 
the 2012 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). Full biographies 
for the Directors can be found on pages 64 and 65 and in 
the Notice of AGM.
Accountability
How does the Board approach risk 
management?
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and 
extent of the signiﬁcant risks it is willing to take in achieving 
its strategic objectives and for maintaining sound risk 
management and internal control systems. They also review 
the effectiveness of these systems through the work of the 
Audit Committee. 
There is Group-wide standard framework in place which 
supports the Group’s risk management programme and 
allows the Board to manage risk through its strategic 
planning and performance monitoring processes.
The key risks which the Board has focused on this year are 
set out in the Risk management and internal control section 
of this report on pages 42 to 47. 71

Effectiveness
How do we maintain an effective Board?
Board relationships
The effective working of the Board, through strong and open 
working relationships between the Directors, Group Chief 
Executive and Senior Independent Director, is crucial to the 
long-term prospects and strategic aims of the Company. 
The roles of the Chairman, Group Chief Executive and Senior 
Independent Director are agreed and set out in writing. 
A short summary of their roles and division of responsibilities 
is set out below.
Roles and division of responsibilities
Chairman
• Responsible for overall leadership and governance of 
the Board (including induction, development and 
performance evaluation)
• Ensures that the Directors have an understanding of the 
views of the Company’s major shareholders
• Ensures a healthy culture of challenge and debate at 
Board and Committee meetings
Group Chief Executive
• Responsible for the effective leadership of the Company
• Strong and focused management and development  
of the Group
• Implementation of the Company’s objectives and 
strategy agreed by the Board
• Maintaining good relationships and communications 
with investors
• Working closely with the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer to 
ensure prudent ﬁnancial controls
• Developing and implementing policies relating to Health 
and Safety and Corporate Responsibility
Senior Independent Director
• Available for approach by or representations from 
investors and shareholders, where communications 
through the Chairman or Executive Directors may not 
seem appropriate
• A sounding board for the Chairman and an intermediary 
for the other Directors when necessary
• Available to chair the Board in the absence of the 
Chairman
• Conducts consultations with shareholders on 
remuneration matters
The Chairman regularly discusses the way the Board 
functions, and broad governance matters, with the Senior 
Independent Director and Group Company Secretary and 
General Counsel. The Senior Independent Director has 
chaired a meeting of the Board in Gareth Davis’ absence, 
and separately has also held informal discussions with 
the Non Executive Directors, with and without the presence 
of the Chairman. He has also led consultations with 
shareholders on remuneration matters.
There was detailed planning throughout the year, with the 
assistance of the Group Company Secretary and General 
Counsel, to consider and review the Board’s 12-month rolling 
agenda programme. This ensured that all matters reserved 
for the Board and other strategic issues were discussed at 
the appropriate time.
Refreshment and development of the Board
As noted on page 68, Karen Witts was appointed as a 
Non Executive Director during the year with effect from 
1 November 2011. As a new Director, Karen was provided 
with a comprehensive induction programme which we 
implement for all new Directors, details of which are 
summarised below. The Directors receive regular updates 
on governance, legal and regulatory matters, as well as 
opportunities for further development and training following 
their induction. During the year, the Chairman discussed a 
development plan with each Director.
At Board meetings and over dinner, the Board also receive 
detailed brieﬁngs from advisers on a variety of topics, which 
are then discussed in the context of the Group and its 
strategy. The annual formal review of governance provides 
the Board with an opportunity to assess the effectiveness 
of their role as Directors.
The Board believes that there are signiﬁcant beneﬁts for both 
the Board and an individual if an Executive Director holds 
an external non executive directorship on the board of a 
non-competitor company. Ian Meakins continues to hold his 
non executive position at Centrica plc; details of payments 
received in respect of this appointment are set out on page 
92. No other Executive Directors hold any external 
appointments.
Induction programme
When appointed, a new Director is provided with a 
tailored induction programme based on their experience 
as a director of a listed company and knowledge of the 
industry sector. The programme includes:
• Provision of relevant current and historical information 
about the Company and the Group;
• Speciﬁc details about the duties of Directors and the 
Company’s rules of residence (in light of its registration 
in Jersey and tax residence in Switzerland);
• Meetings with major shareholders and advisers;
• Visits to operations around the Group; and
• One-to-one meetings with members of the Executive 
Committee and other senior executives in the 
businesses and in corporate functions.
Time commitment
All Directors are aware, from the time of appointment, of the 
need to allocate sufﬁcient time to the Company to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively. The Board monitors the 
extent of interests and any conﬂicts on a continuing basis as 
detailed on page 80. During the year, it was announced that 
Gareth Davis had become the chairman of DS Smith Plc. 
As this was to be Gareth’s third chairmanship, the 
implications of this appointment were considered carefully 
by the Board, the Group Company Secretary and General  72
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Effectiveness continued
Counsel and the Company’s advisers. It was a role which 
Gareth had already been fulﬁlling on a temporary basis and 
he had shown that his commitments were well managed 
and that he was able to dedicate the necessary time and 
attention to Wolseley. Since his formal appointment to that 
role, Gareth Davis’ commitment and availability have not 
been affected.
Board support
The Board and its Committees are provided with sufﬁcient 
resources to undertake their duties. The Group Company 
Secretary and General Counsel, Richard Shoylekov, was 
Secretary to the Board and its Committees during the year. 
Prior to each set of meetings, he ensured that the papers 
and other information were delivered sufﬁciently in advance 
of the meeting date so that all Directors were provided 
with necessary time and resources to fulﬁl their duties. 
This information is published in advance via a secure web 
portal, allowing remote access by Directors using an iPad. 
As well as meeting support, support was also provided 
by the Company Secretariat department and other Group 
functions in relation to induction, training and development 
of the Directors.
In addition to regular brieﬁngs throughout the year on 
consultations, governance, legal and regulatory matters, 
a reading room was added to the software on the iPad 
which provided access for all Directors to a library of 
relevant information about the Company, the Group and 
Board procedures. 
The Board has an established procedure for Directors, if 
deemed necessary, to take independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense in furtherance of their duties. 
This is in addition to the direct access that every Director 
has to the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel 
for his advice and services.
How is the performance of the Board  
and the Directors evaluated?
The Board undertakes a formal review of its performance 
and that of its Committees each year, with an external 
evaluation every three years.
How did we review effectiveness this year?
An externally facilitated review was conducted this year in 
accordance with the Code. The review was conducted by 
Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review. Neither Dr Long nor 
Boardroom Review has any connection with the Company. 
Dr Long attended the March 2012 Board and Committee 
meetings and conducted in-depth conﬁdential interviews 
with each of the Directors and the Group Company 
Secretary and General Counsel. The review considered the 
way in which the Board deﬁnes its role and approaches its 
work (strategy, risk and control, performance management, 
and communication); and the way in which the Board works 
together (culture and dynamics), and whether it optimises 
its use of time and its contribution to the Company.
The Board review undertaken by Dr Long included a review 
of the effectiveness of each of the Committees and of each 
Director and the Company Secretary and the ﬁndings were 
presented to the Chairman. Each was found to perform 
effectively and no material concerns were raised. 
Also, during the year, the Non Executive Directors, led by 
the Senior Independent Director, undertook the performance 
evaluation of the Chairman for which they are responsible. 
Such evaluation took into account the views of the 
Executive Directors.
What were the key ﬁndings 
and improvement actions?
The review concluded that the Board was highly effective 
and focused on the clariﬁcation of Wolseley’s strategy and 
its implementation. Dr Long praised the quality of ﬁnancial 
information provided to the Board, noting that it had improved 
and that a strong Audit Committee was increasing the 
attention given to risk management and internal controls. 
It was noted that the size and composition of the Board 
encouraged open and robust debate. The Chairman was 
commended for his experienced and supportive approach; 
and the Group Chief Executive was commended for providing 
strong operational leadership. The culture and contribution of 
the Board to the Company’s development were recognised 
as strengths. No critical issues were identiﬁed but a number 
of areas were identiﬁed for further improvement which are 
summarised below. As at the date of this report, the Board 
has already begun to implement a number of these action 
points into its processes and procedures.
Action Responsibility
Greater focus on 
competitive benchmarking, 
monitoring customer 
trends and strengthening 
supply chain
Board
Enhance Board oversight 
of risk by way of 
further improvements 
to the Internal Audit 
function and all Directors 
to participate in Audit 
Committee deliberations 
where risk is discussed
Audit Committee and 
Internal Audit
Further improvement of the 
talent development process 
in addition to the scheduled  
six-monthly review
HR
Address future gaps in the 
composition of the Board
Board and 
Nominations Committee
Maximise the use of the 
Board’s time together, 
with more management

Communication with shareholders
We are fully committed to engaging with all shareholders, 
including employee shareholders, and this is reﬂected in our 
annual investor relations programme. In our interactions with 
shareholders, we ensure that we act professionally, provide 
accurate data, are timely with our disclosure of information 
to the market and are at all times accessible.
Our Group Communications and Investor Relations Director 
is the senior executive who has day-to-day responsibility 
for all investor relations matters and for contact with 
shareholders (institutional and private), as well as with 
ﬁnancial analysts and the media. He reports to 
the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Group Chief Executive.
All investor communication is governed by written guidelines 
to ensure the appropriate governance of the processes 
for engaging with shareholders and ﬁnancial analysts is 
maintained. In addition, these guidelines govern the prompt 
disclosure of inside information which could affect the 
Company’s share price.
Who are our major shareholders?
As at 31 July 2012, the Company had received notiﬁcation 
of the following material shareholdings pursuant to the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (“DTRs”) of the UK 
Listing Authority.

How do we engage with all of our 
shareholders?
During the year, an extensive communications programme 
was followed. We maintained regular dialogue with 
institutional shareholders and ﬁnancial analysts. Many of 
these meetings and conversations closely involved the 
Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. We 
released quarterly updates of the ﬁnancial performance of 
the Group incorporating revenue, proﬁtability by region, net 
debt and appropriate commentary on key business trends.
We also ensured that contact was maintained, when 
appropriate, with shareholders to discuss overall 
remuneration plans and policies. In June 2012, the Company 
consulted with its major shareholders and proxy advisory 
voting services on the proposals to introduce replacement 
new long-term incentive plans for senior executives. The 
plans will be subject to shareholder approval at the 2012 
AGM. Further details can be found in the Notice of AGM.
As our shareholder base is mainly institutional, it is difﬁcult 
to engage with our private shareholders using the same 
direct engagement model. We hold periodic meetings 
with the UK Shareholders Association and respond to all 
communications with individual shareholders. In an effort to 
ensure that all shareholders have equal access to information 
we make all documents presented at investor events 
available on the Wolseley plc website. There is also a 
shareholder information section on the Wolseley plc website 
at www.wolseley.com and at the end of this report on 
page 163.

Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Who did we meet during the year?
Through our investor relations programme, many different 
events take place each year. 
The allocation of time spent in UK, Continental Europe 
and North America is reﬂective of the distribution of our 
shareholders as highlighted on page 73.
During the year ended 31 July 2012, there were a total of 
227 meetings. Ian Meakins and John Martin (together with 
the Group Communications and Investor Relations Director)
attended 109 meetings collectively. Frank Roach and the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, North America collectively attended 
24 meetings. In addition, the investor relations function met 
with institutions compromising of a further 94 meetings, 
conferences and site visits. 
The Chairman often meets with the larger institutional 
shareholders and attended Full Year and Half Year results 
presentations. He also ensures that the Board as a whole 
maintains an appropriate dialogue with shareholders. 
The Group Communications and Investor Relations Director 
gives an annual presentation to the Board on Investor 
Relations strategy and the Board is regularly apprised of 
shareholder views and key issues. The Non Executive 
Directors are encouraged to attend presentations of the 
Full Year and Half Year results.
What are our plans for engagement 
in 2012/13?
A similar Investor Relations programme will be run during the 
next ﬁnancial year. We will also be holding an Investors Day 
in October 2012 in Washington, D.C. to focus on the 
progress and opportunities in our US business. This will 
include branch visits and a tour of the Front Royal distribution 
centre in Virginia. In addition, the Investor Relations team will 
be meeting with the UK Shareholders Association prior to 
the AGM in November 2012.
AGM
The 2011 AGM was held on 29 November 2011 at Parkhotel 
in Zug, Switzerland with an audio-visual link to The Lincoln 
Centre, London, UK. The link allowed active two-way 
participation by persons physically present in both 
Switzerland and the UK. The Board is collectively committed 
to the constructive use of the AGM to meet with 
shareholders, hear their views and answer their questions.

Dear Shareholder
It has been a busy year for the Audit Committee and much 
has been reviewed and reported from across the Group. 
We have kept abreast of the current EU consultations 
relating to audit reform and the FRC’s proposals to update 
Section C of the Code and the Guidance on Audit 
Committees. We welcome the FRC’s proposals and have 
reviewed and updated the Committee’s terms of reference 
in detail in order to reﬂect some of their proposals in advance 
of these becoming mandatory.
The EU proposals on audit reform have also been considered 
and we are monitoring the outcome of that process. We will 
give further thought to these proposals and prepare for any 
consequent changes and the other developments that are 
being considered.
Each member of the Committee brings relevant experience 
at a senior executive level. In addition, I was International 
Chief Executive of KPMG until I retired in September 2009 
and now also chair the Audit Committee of two other FTSE 
companies. This provides the Board with further assurance 
that the Audit Committee has the appropriate skills and 
experience and that it meets the Code requirements that 
at least one member of the Committee has signiﬁcant, 
recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. The expertise 
and experience of each member of the Committee are 
summarised on pages 64 and 65.
At the 2012 AGM, I shall be available to respond to any 
questions shareholders may raise on this report or any of 
the Committee’s activities.
What has the Committee done during  
the year?
The Committee met four times during the ﬁnancial year. 
In addition to the members of the Committee, the Chairman, 
the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, the 
Group Financial Controller, the Head of Internal Audit and 
the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel, 
together with senior representatives of the Company’s 
external auditors, attended and received papers for 
each meeting. Other senior executives were also invited 
to certain meetings to present and discuss speciﬁc items. 
The Committee periodically meets separately with the 
Head of Internal Audit and the external auditors without 
the presence of executive management and also separately 
with the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer.
Key issues covered by the Committee are reported to the 
subsequent meeting of the Board and the Board also 
receives copies of the minutes of each meeting.
As usual, our activities included reviews of external and 
internal audits, internal controls, ﬁnancial reporting, risk  76

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Audit Committee continued
management systems, and issues relating to fraud and 
whistleblowing. Set out below is a review of our work in 
relation to each of these areas.
External audit and external auditors
During the year, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) 
undertook both external audit and certain non-audit work. 
The Lead Audit Partner and other senior members of the 
audit team from PwC attended as representatives of the 
external auditors at each Audit Committee meeting and at the 
AGM. They provided the Committee with relevant reports on 
the ﬁnancial statements and controls, reviews, information 
and advice.
In November 2011, the Committee reviewed and approved 
the terms, areas of responsibility and scope of the 2012 
audit as set out in the external auditors’ engagement letter. 
During the year, PwC provided audit-related services such as 
regulatory and statutory reporting. During the year, PwC are 
expected to report to the Committee any material departures 
from Group accounting policies and procedures that they 
identify during the course of their audit work. None were 
found or reported in the ﬁnancial year.
PwC’s 2012 Year End External Audit Plan was approved 
in March 2012 and has been successfully completed at the 
date of this report.
Financial Reporting and signiﬁcant 
ﬁnancial judgements
The Committee reviews whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted, whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements and also seeks 
support from the external auditors to assess them. 
The main issues reviewed in the year ended 31 July 2012 
are set out below:
• The Committee reviewed the carrying amount of goodwill 
and intangible assets throughout 2011/12. The Committee 
agreed with management’s assessment that impairment 
charges had arisen and further details can be found in 
note 12 of the ﬁnancial statements.
• The Committee monitored the various businesses around 
the Group which were disposed of or held for sale and were 
satisﬁed that these were correctly classiﬁed at the time 
of reporting.
• The Committee reviewed the provisions held and 
settlements made relating to litigation disputes and potential 
product liability and considered the judgements made by 
management. It was satisﬁed that these were reasonable 
and appropriate, and that the disclosures made 
were appropriate.
• The Committee reviewed the carrying value of working 
capital, including trade receivables, inventory and rebates 
receivable from vendors and were satisﬁed that provisions 
for impairment recorded were reasonable and appropriate.
PwC’s audit and non-audit fees
The total fees paid to PwC in the year ended 31 July 2012 
(together with a comparison of fees paid in the year ended 
31 July 2011) are set out in the following table. Further 
disclosure of the non-audit fees paid during the year ended 
31 July 2012 can be found in note 3 to the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements on page 109.

of the non-audit fees related to other services.
2  £1 million of the non-audit fees were pursuant to work required in relation 
to the Group’s proposed change in corporate structure and domicile.
During the year, PwC provided non-audit services to the 
Company. Compared to previous years the fees for such 
work are much lower and we expect this level to be 
maintained or to decrease. The non-audit services related 
mainly to assistance on tax matters and certain due diligence 
reviews. These services were provided within the constraints 
of the APB Ethical Standards on Auditing and were assessed 
on a case-by-case basis so that the best placed adviser was 
retained. Under our policy, the external auditors cannot be 
engaged to perform any of the following services:
• book-keeping services related to accounting records or 
ﬁnancial statements;
• design and implementation of ﬁnancial information systems;
• appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions and 
contributions in kind reports;
• actuarial services;
• internal audit outsourcing services;
• management functions including human resources;
• broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking 
services; or
• legal and other expert services unrelated to audit work.
In relation to the non-audit services provides by PwC during 
the year, the Committee reviews and approves management’s 
reasons for selecting PwC as the best placed adviser on a 
case by case basis. This decision was typically based on the 
existing knowledge of the Company which PwC had and its 
importance in relation to the advice sought on each relevant 
transaction. This added value and saved fees in the process. 
At each Committee meeting the Committee considered all 
requests for, and engagements of, non-audit work to be 
performed by PwC for the Company. The Committee follows 
its agreed policy regarding such services to ensure that the 
objectivity or independence of the external auditors is not 
impaired. In accordance with this policy, any non-audit work 
which would exceed a level (set by the Committee) required 
prior approval of the Committee.
Independence and effectiveness of the auditors
Although PwC have been the Company’s auditors for a 
number of years, the Committee continues to be satisﬁed 
with their independence. The policies and procedures in 
place ensure that independence and objectivity is not 
impaired. In addition the Committee monitors PwC to ensure 
that they adhere to a rotation policy based on best practice 
and ethical standards, in accordance with UK regulations. 
As a new lead audit partner was appointed in 2010, there are 
currently no matters of concern. 77
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Overview Performance Governance Financials Information
In November 2011, the Committee undertook its annual 
review of the effectiveness of the external auditors. 
A questionnaire was sent to the Finance Directors of each 
operating company, which provided us with an overall view 
across the Group. From this questionnaire and further 
discussions in the meeting, the Committee is satisﬁed that 
PwC continues to provide an effective audit service.
Based on the details above, this year the Committee did not 
consider it necessary to conduct a tender process for the 
appointment of the Company’s auditors, although as noted 
above, we continue to keep this under review and are 
monitoring the current debate and proposals from the FRC 
and EU.
Internal audit
During the year, prior to each of the four scheduled 
Committee meetings the Chairman of the Committee met 
with the Head of Internal Audit. He attended each Committee 
meeting where he presented an internal audit report which 
was fully reviewed and discussed.
At each Committee meeting, the Committee considered the 
results of the audits undertaken by the Group’s Internal Audit 
function and considered the adequacy of management’s 
response to matters raised, including the time taken to 
resolve any such matters. In March 2012, the Committee 
undertook the annual review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s Internal Audit function, including its terms of 
reference, its audit plans, its general performance and its 
relationship with the external auditors. This review was 
undertaken using guidance issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the 
Institute of Internal Auditors – UK.
Risk management and internal controls
Risk management reports, prepared by the Group Head 
of Risk, were submitted to the Committee in March and 
September 2012. These reports summarise submissions 
from all areas of the business which the Executive Committee 
and senior management have reviewed. They identify the 
signiﬁcant risks to the Group and highlight the tolerance levels 
that the Executive Committee is prepared to accept.
During the year the Committee monitored and reviewed 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems, 
accounting policies and practices, standards of risk 
management and risk management procedures and 
compliance controls, as well as the Company’s statements 
on internal controls, before they were agreed by the Board 
for this Annual Report.
The Group’s internal control systems are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate business risk. They provide 
reasonable but not absolute assurance against material 
mis-statement or loss. 
As management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal control over ﬁnancial reporting 
for the Group including the consolidation process, we 
received regular updates at each meeting on the work 
undertaken by the Advanced Control Environment (“ACE”) 
team, whose focus is on internal controls to ensure the 
accuracy of ﬁnancial reporting. The Committee agrees that 
the Company has a well-designed system of internal control. 
Such a system is necessary to safeguard shareholders’ 
investment and the Company’s assets and depends on 
regular evaluation of the extent of the risks to which the 
Company is exposed. The way in which the processes of 
external audit, internal audit and internal controls overlaps 
and complement each other was reviewed in May 2012.
The Committee is assured that the Company’s systems 
comply with the guidance set out in the Turnbull Report 
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code”. At each meeting, the Committee has in-depth 
discussions about the internal controls with the managers 
responsible for their implementation. The Committee can 
conﬁrm that the Company’s systems and their effectiveness 
have been in place for the full ﬁnancial year and up to the 
date on which the ﬁnancial statements were approved, 
and are regularly reviewed by the Board.
The Chairman of the Committee reported any matters to the 
Board which arose from the Committee’s review of the way 
in which the risk management and internal control processes 
were applied and on any breakdowns in, or exceptions to, 
these processes. There were no signiﬁcant failings or 
weaknesses identiﬁed. These processes have been in place 
throughout the year ended 31 July 2012 and have continued 
to the date of this report.
Full details of how the business implements its risk management 
and controls on a Group-wide basis are set out in Risk 
management and internal control section on pages 42 to 47.
Whistleblowing and fraud
The Committee received reports at each Committee meeting 
providing details of matters reported to the Group’s 
international conﬁdential telephone reporting lines and secure 
website reporting facility, which are operated on its behalf by 
an independent third party. All matters reported are 
investigated by the relevant operating company and, where 
appropriate, reported to the Committee, together with details 
of any corrective action taken.
The Committee also received reports at each Committee 
meeting providing details of fraud losses in each quarter.
The Wolseley Group’s whistleblowing policy, which supports 
the Group-wide Code of Conduct, is also monitored by the 
Committee.
What are the priorities for 2012/13?
• Continue to progress the efforts of the Committee’s total 
assurance efforts, including Internal Audit, External Audit 
and ACE, over the Company’s key risks and controls.
• Continued vigilance over the effects of the economic 
downturn on the Company and on its ﬁnancial position.
• Prepare for the implementation of the ﬁnal requirements 
arising from the current FRC and EU debate on audit rotation 
and other governance matters, once these are known.

Responsibilities
• Review the structure, size and composition of the Board 
and its Committees;
• Make recommendations with regard to any changes that 
are considered necessary, both in the identiﬁcation and 
nomination of new Directors and the continuation of 
existing Directors in ofﬁce;
• Evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
on the Board and its diversity, including gender, and, 
in light of that evaluation, prepare the description of 
the relevant role and capabilities required of prospective 
candidates;
• Make its recommendations to the Board, after a rigorous 
interview process for shortlisted candidates;
• Retain external search consultants for appointments to 
the Board; and
• Advise the Board on succession planning for Board 
appointments, although the Board itself has overall 
responsibility for succession generally.
Dear Shareholder
What has the Committee done during the year?
The Committee has continued to review the composition 
and experience of the Board, mindful of the potential need 
to refresh its membership in the next 12 to 18 months.
In particular, we ﬁnalised the appointment of Karen Witts 
as a Non Executive Director who was appointed as of 
1 November 2011. Following the departure of Karen 
(as detailed on page 68), the Committee is considering 
the appointment of a replacement Non Executive Director 
to the Board. 
In accordance with our procedure for selecting and recruiting 
Directors, the Committee retained an external search agency 
which has no connection to the Company to assist in the 
process of identifying potential candidates for nomination 
to the Board.
During the year, the Committee (in recognising the impact of 
the Davies Report) ensured that skills, experience, potential 
and overall balance of the Board – as well as diversity 
including gender – were, and will be, fully considered in 
relation to recent and future appointments.
The Committee can conﬁrm that, in accordance with the 
Code, any Non Executive Director with a term beyond six 
years has been subject to a particularly rigorous review. As 
noted here and on page 62, it is expected that Andrew Duff, 
the Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, will step down in 2013 as his 
tenure draws to an end. This will provide an opportunity 
to refresh the Board, and the Committee is already in the 
process of a search for suitable additional Non Executive 
Directors.
At the 2012 AGM, I shall be available to respond to any 
questions shareholders may raise on this report or any of the 
Committee’s activities.
What are the priorities for 2012/13?
• Continue the search for at least one new Non Executive 
Director;
• Review the balance, experience and skills of the Board, 
recognising the expected departure of the Senior 
Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee; and
• Monitor the Company’s progress in developing its 
diversity policies.

Other disclosures
Authority to allot shares
At the Annual General Meeting held in November 2011, 
authority was given to the Directors to allot new 10 pence 
ordinary shares up to a nominal value of £18,994,968. 
The Directors intend to propose at the Annual General 
Meeting in November 2012 to seek authority to allot and 
grant rights to subscribe for or to convert securities into 
shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £19,087 ,512, 
representing approximately two-thirds of the Company’s 
issued share capital as at the date of this report, but of that 
amount, £9,543,756 may only be allotted pursuant to a fully 
pre-emptive rights issue. If approved, this authority will 
expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting 
to be held in December 2013.
Subject to the terms of the authority noted above, the 
Directors will also recommend that they be empowered to 
allot equity securities for cash other than pro rata to existing 
shareholders, until the Annual General Meeting to be held 
in December 2013. This authority shall be limited to the 
allotment of equity securities for cash up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £1,431,563 being 5 per cent of the 
ordinary share capital issued at the date of this report. 
The Directors currently have no intention to issue ordinary 
shares, other than pursuant to the Company’s employee 
share schemes and any share dividend alternatives.
Authority to purchase shares
In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the 
Company to purchase its own ordinary shares and a special 
resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
in November 2012 to renew the Directors’ limited authority, 
last granted in November 2011, to purchase the Company’s 
ordinary shares in the market. The authority will be limited 
to a maximum of 28,630,755 ordinary shares (being 
approximately 10 per cent of the Company’s issued share 
capital at the date of this report) and sets the minimum 
and maximum prices which may be paid. The Directors 
will use this authority to purchase shares only after careful 
consideration, taking into account market conditions, other 
investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and 
the overall ﬁnancial position of the Company. The authority 
will enable the Directors to continue to be able to respond 
promptly should circumstances arise in which they consider 
that such a purchase would result in an increase in earnings 
per share and would be in the best interests of the Company. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles the Company is 
allowed to hold shares purchased by it to be held as treasury 
shares that may be cancelled, sold for cash or used for the 
purpose of employee share schemes. As at the date of 
this report, the Company holds no shares in treasury but 
the Directors currently intend that any shares which are 
purchased will be held in treasury. The authorities to be 
sought by each of the resolutions noted above are intended 
to apply equally to shares to be held by the Company 
as treasury shares and to the sale of treasury shares. 
The Directors consider it desirable for these general 
authorities to be available to provide ﬂexibility in the 
management of the Company’s capital resources.
Change of control (signiﬁcant agreements)
The Company is not party to any signiﬁcant agreements 
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
control following a takeover except for the €750,000,000 
multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement dated 
18 July 2011 and US$270,000,000 revolving credit facility 
agreement dated 21 July 2011, which could become 
repayable following a relevant change of control. 
There are no agreements between the Company and 
any Director that would provide compensation for loss 
of ofﬁce or employment resulting from a change of control 
following a takeover bid, except that provisions of the 
Company’s share schemes may cause options and awards 
granted under such schemes to vest in those circumstances. 
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions 
relating to a change of control. Outstanding options and 
awards would normally vest and become exercisable for a 
limited period of time upon a change of control following a 
takeover, reconstruction or winding up of the Company (not 
being an internal reorganisation), subject at that time to rules 
concerning the satisfaction of any performance conditions.
Charitable donations
The Group’s charitable donations in 2012 totalled £1,389,000 
(2011: £1,457 ,000). Donations to charitable organisations 
from the businesses across the Group range from small to 
substantial amounts. The charitable organisations which 
received donations of more than £10,000 per annum from 
Wolseley and other details of charitable donations made in 
the year are referred to in the Corporate responsibility report.
Conﬂicts of interest
Processes and procedures are in place which require 
Directors to identify and declare actual or potential 
conﬂicts of interest, whether matter-speciﬁc or situational. 
These notiﬁcations are made by a Director prior to or 
at a Board meeting, or in writing. All Directors have a 
continuing duty to update any changes. 
The Board may authorise potential conﬂicts which can be 
limited in scope, in accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association. These authorisations are regularly reviewed. 
During the year, all conﬂict management procedures were 
adhered to and operated efﬁciently.
Creditor payment policy
All Group companies are responsible for establishing terms 
and conditions of trading with their vendors. It is the 
Company’s policy that payments to vendors are made within 
agreed terms and are, where applicable, consistent with 
The Prompt Payment Code, which is sponsored by the UK 
Department for Business Innovation & Skills (“BIS”). Copies 
of this Code can be obtained from BIS. At 31 July 2012, 
the Company had no trade creditors (2011: nil). The amount 
of trade creditors for the Group as at 31 July 2012 was 
equivalent to 63 days (2011: 64 days) of trade purchases. 81

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. The Directors have prepared the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report as if the Company were required 
to do so in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006.
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires the Directors to 
prepare Group ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. 
Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. The Directors are also responsible 
for preparing parent company ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
and for being satisﬁed that the Group and parent company 
ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and the Company and of the proﬁt or 
loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing 
these ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Group and parent company ﬁnancial 
statements respectively;
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the Group 
ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website. Jersey legislation and 
United Kingdom regulation, governing the preparation 
and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements, may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are 
listed on pages 64 and 65, conﬁrm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
• the Group ﬁnancial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position 
and proﬁt of the Group; and
• the Performance review contained in the report of the 
directors includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.
Employees
The Group actively encourages employee involvement 
and places particular importance on keeping employees 
regularly informed on the Company’s activities and ﬁnancial 
performance and on matters affecting them individually 
and the business generally. This can be through informal 
bulletins, in-house publications and brieﬁngs, as well as via 
the Company’s intranet sites. The Group operates on a 
largely decentralised basis with a rigorous control framework 
exercised by a small team at the Group Services Ofﬁce. 
This allows for greater autonomy and accountability at a local 
level and provides encouragement for the development of 
entrepreneurial ﬂair. Local management is responsible for 
maintaining high standards of health and safety and for 
ensuring that there is appropriate employee involvement 
in decision-making.
A European Works Council (“EWC”) has been operating 
since 1996 to provide a forum for informing and consulting 
employees in Europe on such matters as signiﬁcant 
developments in the Group’s operations, management’s 
plans and expectations, organisational changes within the 
Group and also for employee representatives to consult 
Group management about concerns over any aspect of 
the Group’s operations. At the date of this report, there 
were 18 EWC representatives of which 12 were employee 
representatives and six were management representatives. 
Employee representatives are appointed from each 
European country in which Wolseley operates. All employees 
are offered a range of beneﬁts depending on their local 
environment. Where possible, they are also encouraged to 
build a stake in the Company through the ownership of 
shares through participation in the Company’s employee 
share schemes.
Employment policies
Our employment policies aim to attract the very best people 
and we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture is a key 
factor in being a successful business. The Group remains 
committed to equality of opportunity in all of its employment 
practices. It is the Group’s policy that the selection of 
employees for appointment, career development and 
promotion be determined solely on the skills and attributes 
which are relevant to the job and which are in accordance 
with the laws of the country concerned, and it will 
progressively promote diversity. Ongoing training of 
employees and the continued development of their skills is of 
prime importance to the Group. These policies also cover the 
continuation of employment and appropriate retraining for 
employees who become disabled during their employment. 82

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Indemnities and insurance
The Company indemniﬁes the Directors in respect of 
liabilities incurred as a result of their ofﬁce in accordance with 
Articles of Association and to the maximum extent permitted 
by Jersey law. Qualifying third party indemnity provisions (to 
the maximum extent permitted by English law) were granted 
to all Directors in ofﬁce and to the Group Company Secretary 
by Wolseley plc (now known as Wolseley Limited) and these 
remain in force as at the date of this report. When Wolseley 
plc (a Jersey registered company) became the new holding 
company, additional third party indemnity provisions were 
granted by the Company and have been granted to all 
Directors appointed since November 2010 in accordance 
with Jersey law. 
There is appropriate insurance coverage in respect of legal 
action against the Directors and ofﬁcers. Neither the 
Company’s indemnities nor insurance would provide any 
coverage to the extent that a Director is proved to have acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly.
Independent Auditors 
and audit information
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) are willing to continue 
as auditors of the Company and resolutions concerning their 
reappointment and the determination of their remuneration 
will be proposed at the next Annual General Meeting. 
The Directors in ofﬁce at the date of this report conﬁrm that, 
so far as they are each aware, in respect of the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 July 2012, 
there is no relevant audit information of which PwC are 
unaware and each Director has taken all the steps that ought 
to have been taken as a Director to be aware, in respect of 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁnancial year 
ended 31 July 2012, of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that PwC are aware of that information.
Political donations
At each of the Annual General Meetings held since 2002, 
shareholders have passed a resolution, as a precaution, 
to approve donations to political organisations and to incur 
political expenditure (as such terms are now deﬁned in 
sections 362 to 379 of the Companies Act 2006). Each 
year, the Board has conﬁrmed that it operates a policy of 
not giving any cash contribution to any political party in the 
ordinary meaning of those words and that it has no intention 
of changing that policy. In previous years this resolution 
related to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company has ensured that, although Jersey registered, 
it will continue to apply the same standards and has such 
provisions incorporated into its Articles of Association. 
The Directors propose to seek, once more, authority for 
the Group to make political donations and/or incur political 
expenditure for amounts not exceeding £125,000 in a total 
aggregate, which they might otherwise be prohibited from 
making or incurring under the provisions of Article 12 of the 
Company’s Articles of Association and which would not 
amount to “donations” in the ordinary sense of the word. 
This authority would last until the Company’s next Annual 
General Meeting. 
Restrictions on transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the voting rights attached to the 
Company’s ordinary shares or on the transfer of securities in 
the Company. No person holds securities in the Company 
carrying special rights with regard to control of the Company. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights. The Company’s 
Articles of Association may be amended by a special 
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Share capital and voting rights
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together 
with any movements in the issued share capital during the 
year, are shown at note 26 of the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements. As at 31 July 2012 there were 286,281,635 fully 
paid ordinary shares of 10 pence each in issue and listed 
on the London Stock Exchange. 
Subject to the provisions of Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 
and without prejudice to any rights attached to any existing 
shares or class of shares, any share may be issued with 
such rights and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary 
resolution determine or as the Board shall determine. 
Copies of the Company’s Articles of Association, can be 
obtained from Companies Registry, Jersey or by writing to 
the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel.
The Company also has a Level 1 American Depositary 
Receipt (“ADR”) programme in the US for which Deutsche 
Bank Trust Company Americas acts as Depositary. 
The American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) which are 
evidenced by ADRs are traded on the US over-the-counter 
market, where each ADS represents one-tenth of a Wolseley 
plc ordinary share.
Share options
During the ﬁnancial year ended 31 July 2012, options were 
exercised pursuant to the company’s share option schemes 
resulting in the allotment of 1,370,676 ordinary 10 pence 
shares. A further 29,859 ordinary 10 pence shares have 
been allotted under these schemes since the end of the 
ﬁnancial year to the date of this report. Details of shares 
issued during the year are set out in note 26 to the 
ﬁnancial statements.

UK pension schemes
Wolseley currently has two pension schemes in respect of 
UK employees:
(1) Deﬁned Beneﬁt Scheme – the Wolseley Group Retirement 
Beneﬁts Plan is a trust-based deﬁned beneﬁts scheme. 
It consists of two sections: the Wolseley Section and the 
William Wilson Section. Both sections have been closed to 
new entrants since 31 May 2009. The two sections are as a 
result of two pension schemes merging on 1 January 2010. 
The Wolseley section contains all members in the Wolseley 
Group Retirement Beneﬁts Plan as at 31 December 2009 
and the William Wilson Section contains all members in the 
William Wilson Group Pension Scheme as at 31 December 
2009. There are three trustees consisting of an independent 
trustee, a member-nominated trustee and a corporate 
trustee. The corporate trustee consists of six trustee 
directors and, save for Mr David Illingworth (chairman of the 
trustees) and Ian Percy, CBE, all of the other trustee directors 
are employees of the Group.
(2) Deﬁned Contribution Scheme – the Wolseley Group 
Deﬁned Contribution Plan is a trust-based deﬁned 
contribution pension scheme with three Company 
nominated trustees, one of whom is an independent 
trustee and two who are UK-based employees of the 
Group. In addition, up to three member-nominated 
trustees may be appointed. Following an election process 
in January 2012, there are no member nominated trustees. 
There was one member-nominated trustee in the year, 
but as he was an Encon employee he resigned after the 
Encon business was sold out of the Group in October 2011. 
The chairman of the trustees is Wayne Phelan of 
PS Independent Trustees Limited.

Remuneration report
For the year ended 31 July 2012
This report sets out the remuneration policy for the Directors 
of Wolseley plc and discloses the amounts paid to them for 
the year ending 31 July 2012. 
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for Wolseley plc.
Although the ﬁnancial year 2011/12 was a demanding year 
for the sector, especially within Europe, the Company 
maintained its good performance, broadly achieving the 
challenging ﬁnancial objectives set in the business plan 
agreed by the Board for the year. This performance has 
resulted in bonus payments for the Executives being broadly 
in line with targets.
I am very aware of the increased focus on executive pay over 
the last 12 months and the Committee has been monitoring 
the Government’s proposals for change to the reporting and 
decision making process in respect of executive remuneration. 
The Committee has carefully considered and responded to 
all of the proposals set out in the consultation paper from the 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. We have 
endeavoured to anticipate some of these changes and will 
continue to respond to further developments. Our aim is 
always to provide clear and transparent reporting regarding 
our pay policy and we will continue to do this. 
During the year, we reviewed the operation of the Company’s 
two long-term incentive plans since their introduction nearly 
10 years ago. Share awards and options have delivered 
value to executives when the Company has achieved high 
performance and not rewarded in years of poor 
performance. During the last three and ﬁve years the 
Executive Share Option Plan (“ESOP”) and the Long Term 
Incentive Scheme (“LTIS”) respectively did not meet the 
performance conditions and the awards subsequently 
lapsed. However, due to the stronger performance more 
recently under new management the ESOP and LTIS awards 
granted in 2009 are expected to vest at least in part later this 
year. With continued performance in line with our business 
expectations, vesting of share awards over the next few 
years is expected to increase share ownership among the 
Executive leadership to the levels sought by the Committee, 
reinforcing alignment with shareholders.
Under the ESOP rules the Committee has discretion to set 
tougher performance conditions as it sees ﬁt, and it has 
used this discretion in recent years, especially when setting 
EPS targets under the ESOP . 
I mentioned last year that the Company’s long-term incentive 
plans would expire later this year. We have concluded our 
consultation with shareholders regarding replacement plans, 
which we propose will be in substantially the same form as 
the current plans. They will also take account of new 
developments in market practice, for example by including 
a provision to allow for the “clawback” of awards in certain 
circumstances. Further details regarding the new plans are 
set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). 
As part of this consultation we also took the opportunity 
to meet with investors and shareholder representative bodies 
to discuss the business and executive remuneration more 
widely. The Committee’s aim is to have an ongoing and open 
dialogue with investors.
As with last year, during 2011/12 there were very few 
changes to the compensation of senior executives in 
the Company. The senior leadership team salary increases 
were below inﬂation, and were consistent with pay discipline 
throughout the Company during the year. Further, as a result 
of the continuing tough trading conditions, the senior 
leadership team will be accepting a pay freeze for the 
forthcoming year.
We believe that this Remuneration Report provides helpful 
context and explanation of our policies and practical 
considerations that inﬂuence our decisions. We hope 
to receive your support at our AGM to be held on 
29 November 2012.
Andrew Duff
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Introduction
This report, approved by the Board, has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority. Although it is not a requirement 
of Jersey company law to have the Directors’ remuneration 
report approved by shareholders, the Board believes that as 
a Company whose shares are listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, it is good corporate governance for it to do so. 
Accordingly, a resolution to approve this report will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM. Furthermore, the Board 
has also applied the principles of good governance relating 
to Directors’ remuneration contained within the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) which came into effect in 
June 2010. Those parts of the report which have been 
subject to audit are clearly marked.
Remuneration Committee
Responsibilities
The Committee reviews and recommends to the Board 
the framework and policy for the remuneration of the 
Chief Executive, the Chairman, the Executive Directors 
and members of the Executive Committee, while taking 
into account the business strategy of the Group and how 
the Company’s remuneration policy reﬂects and supports 
that business strategy over the short and medium term. 
The objective of the policy is to ensure that individuals 
are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage 
enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible 
manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the 
success of the Company. The full terms of reference for  85

the Committee can be found on the Wolseley plc website at 
www.wolseley.com.
Key responsibilities of the Committee are:
• to determine the speciﬁc remuneration packages for each 
of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and the Group 
Company Secretary and General Counsel;
• to determine the remuneration, based on proposals from 
the Group Chief Executive, of the members of the 
Executive Committee;
• to review, design and implement share incentive plans for 
all levels of employees;
• to review the overall remuneration policy for employees 
below executive level;
• to determine the service agreements for the Executive 
Directors and the scope of pensions arrangements and 
other beneﬁts, and to review and approve the terms of any 
termination payments and mitigation thereof;
• to ensure that contractual terms on termination, and the 
payments made, are fair and that failure is not rewarded;
• to oversee major changes in employee beneﬁts structures 
throughout the Group.
The Chairman and the Executive Directors determine the 
remuneration of the Non Executive Directors.
To reach informed decisions on executive remuneration, 
the Committee obtains detailed external research on market 
data and trends from experienced independent consultants. 
The Committee takes external advice from New Bridge 
Street, now part of Aon plc. Whilst the Aon group itself 
provides other services to the Company (pensions advice 
and insurance services) these other services are not 
provided by New Bridge Street, which only provides services 
to the Company in relation to remuneration activities. 
Who are the Committee members?
The table below lists the independent Non Executive 
Directors who were members of the Committee during 
2011/12 and shows their attendance at meetings during the 
year. Karen Witts attended all meetings between the date 
of her appointment to the Committee and her resignation 
on 2 July 2012.

The Company’s remuneration policy
In considering its policy and the levels of remuneration of 
the senior executives, the Committee takes account of the 
market, the wider economic environment, pay policy of the 
workforce generally, good corporate governance practices 
and its responsibilities to its shareholders. The Company’s 
policy is to provide remuneration to its senior executives 
reﬂecting their contribution to the business, the performance 
of the Group, the size and complexity of the Group’s 
operations and the need to attract, keep, treat fairly and 
incentivise executives of the highest quality.
The Committee seeks to provide remuneration packages 
which are simple, clear and transparent. The Committee 
recognises that remuneration needs to be easily understood 
by both executives and shareholders. 86
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Remuneration report continued
The Committee seeks to align the interests of its senior executives with those of shareholders in developing the long-term 
growth of the business through the variable pay components of their packages and its choice of performance measures. 
In setting targets for the variable elements of the executives’ packages the Committee strives to align the interest of the 
executives with those of the Company’s shareholders. The Committee sets appropriate and demanding targets in the context 
of the Company’s trading environment and strategic objectives. 
The Committee aims to maintain an appropriate balance between ﬁxed and variable pay, rewarding high performance while 
taking into account the importance of good risk management. None of the variable elements of remuneration are pensionable.

Policy
Base salaries for individual Directors are reviewed annually 
and take effect from 1 August. The Committee considers 
that base salary reﬂects the level of responsibility of the 
Director, the relevant market in which he or she operates, 
and individual performance. Independent external advice 
is taken to benchmark salaries with market data, derived 
from a group of companies selected on the basis of 
comparable size, geographic spread and business focus. 
It is the Committee’s objective to set base salaries at or 
around the market median, with the opportunity to go 
above this level in the event of sustained individual high 
performance. In accordance with the core principles of the 
Code, consideration has also been given to general pay and 
employment conditions across the Group. The Committee 
continues to assess these and other matters, such as 
prevailing market conditions, when determining levels of 
remuneration for Executive Directors and members of the 
Executive Committee. For new appointments, in particular 
internal promotions, the policy is for base salary to progress 
towards the median once expertise and performance has 
been proven and sustained. The payment of salaries at this 
level is considered appropriate for motivation and retention 
of the calibre of executive required to ensure the successful 
management of the Company in the challenging international 
business environment in which it operates.

Salaries for 2012/13 
The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Executive 
Directors and agreed that there would be no change for 
2012/13. However, market data suggests that the Executive 
Directors’ base salaries are beginning to fall behind 
competitive levels and therefore their pay will be formally 
reviewed next year. Current annual salaries for Executive 
Directors are shown in the Appointments and Contracts 
table on page 92. 
Annual Bonus Scheme
Policy
Annual bonus arrangements for the Executive Directors are 
designed to encourage individual performance and generate 
operating efﬁciencies and proﬁtable growth. Stretching 
targets, determined by the Committee, are set for each 
element of the bonus. The Committee also determines 
the level of vesting at threshold, target and maximum 
performance. The annual bonus awards are based on a mix 
of demanding ﬁnancial targets, derived from the Company’s 
long-term strategic business plan and annual budget, as well 
as market expectations. 
Target and maximum levels of remuneration for 2012/13 
The following charts show the total remuneration (base salary, bonus, long term incentive awards and executive share options) 
for the Executive Directors for 2012/13 at target and maximum performance. 88

Remuneration report continued
2011/12 targets and bonus outturn
For the ﬁnancial year 2011/12, 85 per cent of potential bonus 
was driven by ﬁnancial performance. The balance depended 
on speciﬁc strategic personal objectives which were set for 
each Executive Director and members of the Executive 
Committee. As part of the continued drive to improve the 
business, the performance measures at Group level were 
weighted as follows, giving an increased emphasis on 
trading proﬁt:

Cash-to-

2011/12 Annual bonus scheme
Challenging targets for trading proﬁt and balance sheet 
improvement were set for each geographical region and at 
Group level. Ian Meakins and John Martin were eligible to 
receive a bonus of up to 100 per cent and 70 per cent of 
salary respectively for on target performance, with Frank 
Roach eligible for up to 110 per cent of salary.
Ongoing trading proﬁt for the year was 10.4 per cent ahead 
of the prior year. After adjusting for foreign exchange 
movements and restructuring costs, trading proﬁt was at 
target resulting in bonus levels at target for the Group element 
of performance. Good Group cash management delivered 
performance that exceeded the cash-to-cash days target 
but fell short of the maximum target. Proﬁt performance in 
North America exceeded the target set at the start of the 
year but did not reach the stretch (maximum) level, whereas 
the cash-to-cash performance exceeded threshold 
(minimum) performance but fell short of target. No Director 
fully achieved the stretch levels for their personal objectives 
in the year. Bonus payments for each Director are set out 
in the table on page 94.
2012/13 bonus awards 
For 2012/13, the threshold for bonus payments on trading 
proﬁt will be set above the outturn for 2011/12 on a constant 
currency basis. The year end result will again be adjusted for 
restructuring and foreign exchange movements. Although 
market conditions remain challenging, the Company 
continues to gain market share and drive proﬁtable growth. 
To reﬂect this, proﬁt targets for bonus awards will be set at 
a higher level than for 2011/12. In recognition of the difﬁcult 
trading conditions and the importance of focusing on trading 
proﬁt, the proportion of the bonus determined by trading 
proﬁt will be increased for 2012/13 to 60 per cent and the 
cash-to-cash days element reduced to 20 per cent. Speciﬁc 
strategic personal objectives will determine 20 per cent of 
the bonus as illustrated in the following chart.

(with the percentages increasing on a linear basis for 
achievement between each level):

Pensions 
Frank Roach, who is a US citizen, participated in the deﬁned 
contribution pension arrangements of Ferguson Enterprises, 
Inc., receiving contributions at the level of 23 per cent of his 
base salary. Bonus payments are not included in the 
calculation of Company pension contributions. 
The cost of the Group’s contributions during the ﬁnancial 
year for Frank Roach was £148,000 ($233,700). For the year 
ended 31 July 2011 the cost was £138,100 ($226,900). 
The exchange rate used to convert the dollar to sterling over 
the year to 31 July 2012 is $1.5792: £1 (2010/11: $1.6426: £1).
Brossette, a French subsidiary undertaking, was sold during 
ﬁnancial year 2011/12 and as part of the disposal the 
Company was released from its commitment as guarantor 
to a pension entitlement of a former director of Brossette. 
Beneﬁts in kind
Beneﬁts in kind include the provision of healthcare insurance, 
a car and driver at the Company’s expense and/or a car 
allowance. Both Ian Meakins and John Martin are provided 
with the beneﬁt of a car and driver. Frank Roach receives 
the beneﬁt of a company provided car. 
In addition, to ensure that executives are not disadvantaged 
as a result of paying personal tax in more than one 
jurisdiction arising from the discharge of their duties, the

Long term incentives
Policy
With effect from November 201 1 the Committee’s policy is that 
only members of the Executive Committee (consisting of nine 
individuals) are eligible to receive grants under the Company’s 
LTIS and the ESOP . The Wolseley Group Long Term Incentive 
Scheme 2010 and the Wolseley Group Executive Share Option 
Plan 2010 were approved upon the creation of the new 
Wolseley plc holding company and were in effect extensions 
of the existing plans that were approved in 2002 and 2003 
respectively. They will therefore expire in December 2012 and 
November 2013 respectively. The Company has consulted 
with shareholders and intends to renew both plans in 
substantially the same form. The Company will take the 
opportunity to make changes to align the rules of the new 
plans with market developments and accepted best practice 
(for example through the addition of a “clawback” mechanism). 
The new plans are subject to shareholder approval at the AGM 
in November 2012 and a summary of their terms will be 
included in the Notice of the AGM.
The next levels of senior management are now eligible for 
awards under the Wolseley Group Ordinary Share Plan 2011 
(the “OSP”) which was introduced in November 2011. The 
grant of an award under the OSP is based upon individual 
criteria. Vesting of awards under the OSP typically happens 
after three years. Awards under the OSP are subject to 
continued employment with the Company. They are designed 
to act as a retention incentive whilst also encouraging 
participants to hold equity in the Company, thereby creating 
a better alignment with the interests of shareholders.
Long Term Incentive Scheme (the “LTIS”)
The purpose of the LTIS is to incentivise executives to deliver 
superior long-term performance and reward for relative 
outperformance of the Company against a deﬁned list of 
comparator companies. The LTIS provides for awards of 
ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, subject to the 
Company meeting TSR targets over separate three year 
periods. Awards are made to members of the Executive 
Committee and are subject to the achievement of 
performance conditions. TSR has been selected as the 
appropriate performance measure to ensure that the interests 
of the Executive Committee are closely aligned with those 
of the Company’s shareholders over the long term. 
Calculations of TSR are independently carried out and 
veriﬁed before being approved by the Committee.
Performance conditions
The following performance conditions apply for awards 
made under the LTIS:
Wolseley’ s TSR position in the comparator group
Percentage 
of award which 
will vest
Top decile 100%
Between median and top decile 25%–100%
At median 25%
Below median 0%
Awards vest on a straight-line basis between 25 per cent 
and 100 per cent.
The list of comparator companies for awards made under 
the LTIS in 2009 was based upon the constituent members 
of the FTSE 100 as at the date of grant, excluding banks, 
telecommunications, IT and utility companies but including 
CRH plc and Travis Perkins plc, which compete in the same 
sector as the Company. The list of comparator companies 
for awards made under the LTIS from 2010 is based upon 
the full constituent members of the FTSE 100 at the 
respective date of grant, with no additions or exclusions. 
The LTIS is discretionary and it is the Committee’s current 
policy to make annual awards to Executive Directors and 
other members of the Executive Committee. Awards are 
made in shares unless there are material securities or tax 
law constraints that would require awards in cash to be 
considered. A total of 226,910 shares were conditionally 
granted under the LTIS in November 2011 to nine employees 
(December 2010: 436,150 shares to 88 employees).
The maximum amount that can be granted under the 
LTIS for each award remains at 200 per cent of base salary 
per annum. Each year the Committee continues to assess 
the relevant proportion of awards arising from both share 
options and long-term incentive awards. Existing awards are 
subject to the achievement of performance conditions and 
vesting is only determined at the end of the performance 
period. In 2011/12, the highest award under the LTIS was 
150 per cent, and only in exceptional circumstances 
would the maximum be awarded. 
Awards made and vesting as at 31 July 2012 
The table on page 94 sets out the number of shares 
awarded to Executive Directors during the year under the 
LTIS and unvested as at 31 July 2012.
The following table sets out the percentage of each 
award which has vested and the percentage of each 
outstanding award that would vest based on performance 
as at 31 July 2012:
Year of award
Year of  
vesting
Percentage vested on maturity or  
indicative vesting percentage based on 
performance as at 31 July 2012

2010 2013 100% (performance at 24 months)
2011 2014 94.2% (performance at 12 months) 90

Remuneration report continued
Executive share options (the “ESOP”)
The purpose of the ESOP is to reward executives for 
absolute EPS growth of the Company above UK inﬂation. 
Only members of the Executive Committee are now eligible 
to receive grants under the ESOP . Participants continue to 
be selected by the Committee at its discretion and upon 
the recommendation of the Group Chief Executive. The 
Committee considers annually the size of each grant, 
determined by individual performance, the ability of 
each individual to contribute to the achievement of the 
performance conditions, and market levels of remuneration. 
Under the existing plan, awards may not exceed an amount 
equal to ﬁve times salary for US based executives and three 
times salary for European based executives, although the 
Committee may, if it so determines, also use the ﬁve times 
salary limit in exceptional circumstances. Under the new 
plan, a three times salary limit is proposed for all Executives. 
In accordance with the rules of the plan, options may not 
be granted more than 10 years after the date on which the 
plan was ﬁrst approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
In 2011/12, no award to any executive under the 2010 
Option Plan exceeded 250 per cent of salary and awards 
signiﬁcantly higher than this percentage would only be made 
in exceptional circumstances. 
Performance conditions
The extent to which options will be capable of exercise 
depends on the satisfaction of a performance condition 
based on achieving growth in the Company’s EPS above UK 
inﬂation. The performance of the Company is measured over 
three ﬁnancial years, starting with the ﬁnancial year in which 
the grant takes place. For grants made since 2009 in the 
event that the performance conditions are not fully met 
on the third anniversary of the date of grant, the unvested 
options will lapse. Provided the performance condition has 
been satisﬁed, an option may be exercised at any time until it 
lapses, which is 10 years from the date of grant. No amount 
is payable on the grant of an option. The EPS performance 
conditions apply to the grants made in 2011/12, and the 
same performance condition is contained in the new 
replacement plan that is subject to shareholder approval 
at the AGM in November 2012.
Under the plan rules, the Committee has the discretion 
to set more challenging EPS targets for option awards. 
This discretion has been utilised for awards made since 
2009, and the Committee has set the tougher EPS targets 
as detailed below.
Performance 
conditions detailed 
in plan rules
Performance 
conditions applied 
to awards since

Second 100% of salary 12% 15%
Next 50% of salary 15% 21%
Greater than 250% of salary 15%–21% 21%
Subject to shareholder approval, under the new ESOP rules 
it is proposed that the EPS performance conditions are set 
at a level which enables the delivery of higher rewards for 
higher EPS growth. The proposed criteria for achieving this 
higher performance are set out below.
Proposed performance conditions for awards to be made 
in 2012/13
Value of shares under option  
as a multiple of salary
T otal margin of growth over UK 
inﬂation after three years (RPI)
First 50% of salary 9%
Next 150% of salary 12%
Next 50% of salary 15%
Greater than 200% of salary 15%–21%
The Committee can also vary the terms of options to take 
account of any technical changes including, for example, 
changes in accounting standards, provided that any amended 
target would be materially no less challenging as a result of 
any change. The Committee continues to believe that the 
EPS condition is appropriate for share options since it 
requires substantial improvement in the Company’s 
underlying ﬁnancial performance and complements the 
inherent requirement for share price growth for an option 
to have value.
In November 2011, 365,359 options were granted under the 
2010 ESOP to nine employees (December 2010: 2,690,478 
options to 934 employees) at an option price of 1879 pence. 
Awards granted in 2011/12
The table on page 95 sets out the number of share options 
granted to Executive Directors during the year under the 
2010 ESOP and outstanding as at 31 July 2012.
Dilution
In accordance with the recommendations of the Association 
of British Insurers (“ABI”), the number of new shares that 
may be issued to satisfy options granted under all of the 
Company’s employee share schemes is restricted to 10 per 
cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
over any rolling 10-year period. Further, as set out in the ABI 
principles and guidelines, the number of new shares that 
may be issued to satisfy executive options granted under 
the Company’s discretionary share schemes is restricted 
to 5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company over any rolling 10-year period. The Company 
adheres to these requirements and continually monitors 
the effect that awards made under the various employee 
and discretionary share plans have on these dilution limits. 
At 31 July 2012, awards had been granted resulting in 
shares being issued or capable of being issued during the 
preceding 10 years under all of the Company’s employee 
share plans representing 4.78 per cent of the issued ordinary 
share capital at that date and 1.26 per cent of the issued 
ordinary share capital under the Company’s executive share 
plans. Options may be satisﬁed by either the issue of new 
shares or by shares purchased in the market. Awards under 
the OSP cannot be satisﬁed by new issue shares and 
therefore do not count towards the dilution limits.  91

Business review
In 2011/12 the Company achieved good growth in the USA 
and Canada although this was partly offset by the difﬁcult 
trading conditions in Europe. Underlying gross margins have 
been under pressure and have declined slightly, though costs 
have been kept under strong control to generate a trading 
proﬁt growth in the ongoing business of 10.4 per cent.
The Committee believes that the Executive Directors’ variable 
remuneration is structured to deliver and reward the senior 
management team for business performance which in turn 
delivers returns to shareholders. The ﬁnancial results for this 
year and the reward delivered to the executives support this.
The Company’s trading proﬁt growth has resulted in annual 
bonus payments at target, rewarding the executives for their 
performance in a challenging year. With increased emphasis 
needed on trading proﬁt, the Committee has increased for 
2012/13 that part of the annual bonus which is linked to 
trading proﬁt targets.
The long-term incentive awards granted in 2009 were 
measured against EPS and TSR. EPS growth was the 
performance measurement for the ESOP and this condition 
has been met and the award will vest in full. TSR was used 
to measure the performance of the LTIS award and Wolseley 
achieved a ranking of 17th position against the comparator 
group resulting in three quarters of the award vesting. 
Achievement against these performance conditions 
demonstrates the strong alignment between corporate 
performance, executive reward and shareholder return.
The management team will continue to pursue operating 
efﬁciencies and remain focused on customer service, 
gaining market share and protecting gross margins. 
Given the uncertain economic outlook in Europe the 
Company will maintain strong discipline over its cost 
base while continuing to pursue growth initiatives in its 
more robust markets.
The Committee will continue to structure the Executives’ 
remuneration to incentivise and reward them for further 
delivery of strong corporate performance.

Board appointments and contracts
Executive Directors’ service agreements
All Executive Directors have service contracts that can be 
terminated by the Company giving 12 months’ notice and by 
the employee giving six months’ notice, which reﬂects 
current market practice. 
Termination of the contract of employment by the Company 
in accordance with the terms of the service agreement 
would result in a payment of a sum equal to the contractual 
notice entitlement of 12 months’ salary, pension contributions 
made and speciﬁed beneﬁts. The Company would seek to 
ensure that any termination payment is mitigated were the 
Executive to ﬁnd alternative employment during his or her 
notice period. 
It remains the case that no additional remuneration has 
become payable to Executive Directors as a consequence 
of the Company’s tax residence in Switzerland. 92
Wolseley plc

Remuneration report continued
Non Executive Directors
The Non Executive Directors have letters of appointment 
rather than service agreements. Non Executive Directors 
do not participate in any incentive plan, nor is any pension 
payable in respect of their services as Non Executive 
Director. It remains the Board’s policy that Non Executive 
Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years, 
which is then reviewed and, if appropriate, extended for a 
further three year period. Appointments may be terminated 
upon six months’ notice by either party. There are no 
provisions for compensation in the event of termination. 
The remuneration of Non Executive Directors consists 
of a basic fee plus an additional fee where a Non Executive 
Director acts as chairman of either the Audit Committee or 
Remuneration Committee or acts as Senior Independent 
Director. Details of all Non Executives Directors’ fees as 
well as dates of appointment are shown in the Board 
Appointments and Contracts table shown below. The fees 
are reviewed from time to time by the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors of the Board and were last increased in 
July 2011. The Chairman is paid an annual fee, which has 
remained unchanged since his appointment. The Board and 
the Committee have agreed that for the next ﬁnancial year 
the Non Executive Directors and the Chairman shall not 
receive any increase in the fees.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the Non 
Executive Directors are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered ofﬁce in Jersey during normal 
business hours, the corporate head ofﬁce and at the AGM. 
Details of each of the Non Executive Directors can be found 
on pages 64 and 65. 
Board changes
Karen Witts who was appointed as a Non Executive Director 
on 1 November 2011 and stepped down from the Board with 
effect from 2 July 2012. 
External directorships
Executive Directors are permitted to take on external non 
executive directorships. In order to avoid any conﬂicts of 
interest, however, all such appointments are subject to the 
approval of the Nominations Committee. The Committee 
believes that taking up external non executive appointments 
helps bring a wider perspective to the Company and also 
assists in the development of business skills and experience.
Ian Meakins is a non executive director of Centrica plc 
and receives a fee of £65,000 per annum for his services 
(2010/11: £65,000). The Company allowed Mr Meakins to 
retain this fee for such external appointment.

Directors’ share interests
Director share ownership
A share ownership programme was introduced with effect 
from 1 August 2004 and is designed to encourage all 
Directors and Executive Committee members to build up 
a shareholding in value equivalent to the levels in the table 
below. The levels of share ownership have been reviewed 
and the shareholding requirement for Executive Directors 
has been increased to 1.5 times base salary for Executive 
Directors and to 2 times base salary for the Group Chief 
Executive for next year.
The table below shows each Director’s shareholding targets, 
and the extent to which they had reached those targets, 
at 31 July 2012. The increased shareholding targets apply 
from the new ﬁnancial year starting 1 August 2012.

For Executive Directors and Executive Committee members, 
share ownership may be achieved by retaining shares 
received as a result of participating in a Company share plan, 
after taking into account any shares sold to ﬁnance option 
exercises or to pay an income tax or National Insurance 
liability or overseas equivalent. These levels of shareholding 
are usually expected to be achieved within three to ﬁve years 
from the date on which the individual is included in the 
programme. The Committee reviews and notes progress 
made towards meeting these targets during the year. 
Directors’ current interests in shares are set out on page 96.
Other senior executives
The members of the Executive Committee, who are not on 
the Board, are senior executives in the business who are 
considered to be able to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the ability of 
the Group to meet its strategic objectives. The Committee 
determines the level of remuneration for this group of 
individuals, based on proposals from the Group Chief 
Executive. Their total remuneration including salary and 
beneﬁts, actual bonus, and the fair value of long-term 
incentives granted or awarded during the year ended 
31 July 2012 is summarised below:

1 Options lapsed on 1 November 2011 as the 2008 grant did not meet the relevant EPS performance conditions.
2  Under the ESPP, a total of 166 options were granted in March 2011. However, the exchange rate increased between the date of grant and the date of 
maturity in May 2012, which led to a lower number of options equating to total contributions being exercised. Accordingly the balance of options lapsed. 
The Company’s share price on the date of exercise was 2255 pence.
Vesting of options is conditional on earnings per share growth targets over a three year period. 
The highest mid-market price of the Company’s ordinary 10 pence shares during the year was 2558 pence and the lowest 
was 1404 pence. The price of the Company’s ordinary 10 pence shares on 31 July 2012 was 2303 pence. 96

Employee Beneﬁt Trusts
The Wolseley plc 2004 Overseas Employee Beneﬁt Trust, 
the Wolseley plc 2004 Employee Beneﬁt Trust and the 
Wolseley plc 2004 Directors’ Beneﬁt Trust were established 
in October 2004 in connection with the Wolseley Share 
Option Plan 2003 and the Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term 
Incentive Scheme, as well as the Wolseley Group Long Term 
Incentive Scheme 2010 and the Wolseley Group Share 
Option Plan 2010.
The settlor of these trusts was Wolseley Limited, which was 
the old Wolseley plc. Upon incorporation of the new holding 
company it was therefore necessary for the new Wolseley 
plc to establish a new trust, the Wolseley Employee Trust 
2011 (the “New Trust”). The assets of the old trusts were 
subsequently transferred into the New Trust, which then 
assumed the obligations of the old trusts to satisfy historical 
share awards, and the old trusts have been wound up.
The trustees of each of the Trusts have waived their rights 
to receive dividends on any shares held by them. At the 
date of this report, the New Trust holds 1,901,753 ordinary 
shares of 10 pence each and £570,801 in cash.
Savings related share option schemes
The UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
(“UK Sharesave”) was renewed in November 2011 
and incorporated as an appendix to the Wolseley Group 
International Sharesave Plan 2011 (the “ISP”). The rules 
are HMRC approved. The international section remains 
appropriate to our European employees.
The UK-based Executive Directors may participate in the ISP 
and the US-based Executive Director may participate in the 
ESPP . Under the ISP, participants can enter into a savings 
contract for three, ﬁve or seven years, up to a maximum level 
of £250 per month (over all contracts) and are granted 
options to subscribe for shares in the Company. Under the 
ESPP, a US Code 423 Plan which was also renewed in 
November 2011, US participants may enter into a one-year 
savings contract to a maximum level of no more than 
$400 per month. The Board may determine that the options 
granted under these schemes may be awarded at a discount. 
The maximum discount, which was applied to the 2012 
awards, was 20 per cent for the ISP and 15 per cent for the 
ESPP . A total of 231,595 options were granted in April 2012 
to 3,500 employees in the United States and Canada under 
the ESPP at an option price of 2003 pence. In the UK, a total 
of 193,437 options were granted at an option price of 1956 
pence per share to 1,320 employees. The table on page 95 
sets out the number of share options granted to each 
Executive Director during the ﬁnancial year 2011/12 under 
the ISP and ESPP .
The Remuneration Report has been received and adopted 
by shareholders at each of the Annual General Meetings 
held since 2003. Shareholders will again be invited to 
receive and adopt this report at the forthcoming AGM 
on 29 November 2012.
This report has been approved by the Board and is signed on 
its behalf by the chairman of the Remuneration Committee.

Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
1. Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union, including interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(“IASB”) and its committees.  
The Company is incorporated in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and is headquartered in Switzerland. 
Accounting developments and changes 
There have been no changes to Group accounting policies during the year ended 31 July 2012. A summary of the principal 
accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set out in note 37 on 
pages 137 to 143. 
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretation that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 
1 August 2012 that are expected to have a material impact on the Group.  
An amended standard on employee benefits, IAS 19, which will be mandatory for the Group for the financial year beginning 
1 August 2013, requires the net funding cost of retirement benefits obligations to be calculated using the discount rate used to 
measure the defined benefit obligation. If the Group had adopted this amended standard in the year ended 31 July 2012 its 
financing costs would have been increased by approximately £10 million.  
There are no other new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards that have been published that 
would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.  
Choices permitted by IFRS 
The Group has elected to apply hedge accounting to some of its financial instruments, and to recognise its liability for retirement 
benefit obligations in full. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
Many of the Group’s accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported 
amounts. The following areas are most sensitive to the accuracy of such estimates. 
Impairment of trade receivables 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made when management estimates that the expected present value of future 
cash flows recoverable in respect of these receivables is less than the carrying amount. Determining the amount of such 
provision requires estimating the amount and timing of such future cash flows, giving consideration to the financial condition 
of the debtor and the probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation. The actual amounts of cash 
recovered may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provision is based. 
The amount relating to continuing operations charged to the income statement in 2012 in respect of impaired receivables 
represented 0.25 per cent of revenue (2011: 0.35 per cent). Wolseley held a provision for impairment of receivables at 
31 July 2012 amounting to £46 million (2011: £47 million). 
Valuation of inventories 
Provisions are made against slow-moving, obsolete and damaged inventories for which the net realisable value is estimated to 
be less than the cost. Inventories which are damaged or obsolete are written down as identified. The risk of obsolescence of 
slow-moving inventory is assessed by comparing the level of inventory held to future sales projected on the basis of historical 
experience. The actual realisable value of inventory may differ materially from the estimated value on which the provision 
is based.  
The Group held allowances in respect of inventory balances at 31 July 2012 amounting to £116 million (2011: £126 million).

Wolseley plc

Overview Performance Governance Financials Information
1. Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements continued 
Impairment of assets 
The Group reviews assets that have an indefinite useful life at least annually to assess whether their recoverable amount 
exceeds their carrying value. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, 
which in turn is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill and acquired intangible assets is assessed on the basis of the value in use of the cash 
generating unit or group of cash generating units (“CGU”) to which they are attributed. The estimate of value in use, and hence 
the outcome of the impairment test, is sensitive to the assumptions made about the revenue growth, trading margin and the 
level of working capital required to support trading over the next five years, the long-term growth rate of their market, and the 
discount rate considered appropriate to reflect the time value of money and any risks specific to the CGU that are not reflected 
in the cash flows. 
As disclosed in notes 12 and 13, the Group has charged £353 million in respect of the impairment of goodwill and acquired 
intangibles assets at 31 July 2012 (2011: £42 million) after preparing value in use calculations on the basis of assumptions set 
out on page 140. A £220 million impairment has been incurred in the Nordic region and a £133 million impairment has been 
incurred in France. 
Following this impairment charge the Group’s two Danish businesses, Stark and Silvan, have goodwill and acquired intangible 
assets with a carrying value at 31 July 2012 of £142 million and £32 million respectively. There are no goodwill and acquired 
intangible assets remaining in France at 31 July 2012. If the long-term prospects for the Danish market or the competitive 
positions of Stark and Silvan are weaker than assumed in calculating their underlying value in use, then further impairment 
charges may be required against the carrying value of these assets. The estimated value in use of these businesses is most 
sensitive to the trading profit assumed in the final year of the cash flow forecast which reflects the latest estimate of the mid 
point in the business cycle. A reduction in trading profit of approximately 5 per cent would result in a further impairment of 
£25 million. 
Rebates receivable from vendors 
The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors that provide for rebates of the cost of inventory purchased. 
Many of these agreements apply to purchases in a calendar rather than financial year, and under certain agreements the 
rebate rises as a proportion of purchases as higher quantities or values of purchases are made. The Group adjusts the cost 
of inventory purchased to reflect estimated rebates receivable, which can depend on the projected volume, value and mix 
of purchases from a vendor through to the end of the qualifying period. Actual rebates receivable from vendors may differ 
materially from the estimates on which the cost of inventory is based. 
Provisions for self-insured risks 
The Group retains layers of certain of its insurable risks, principally US casualty and global property damage, which are 
managed by a captive insurance company, Wolseley Insurance Limited. Certain of the retained risks are subject to an annual 
actuarial assessment. The provision for self-insured risks represents an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate 
cost of settling outstanding claims and claims incurred but not reported. The actual cost of settling these liabilities may differ 
materially from the estimated amounts on which the provision is based. At 31 July 2012, the provision for claims arising from 
this insurance was £46 million (2011: £57 million).  104

Provisions for legal, environmental and related exposures and contingent liabilities 
The Group makes provisions for known and potential legal claims and environmental and other matters, including asbestos 
related litigation and product liability claims, where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate may 
be made of the likely outcome of the dispute or matter. In establishing such provisions the Group takes into account 
the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and considers the advice of its legal and other professional advisers. 
The ultimate liability for potential legal claims and other matters may be dependent upon the discovery of facts that are currently 
uncertain, the outcome of litigation proceedings and possible settlement negotiations, and the actual cost of settlement may 
differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provisions are based. At 31 July 2012 legal, environmental and other 
provisions amounted to £149 million (2011: £164 million). Where the Group has insurance cover that it is virtually certain will 
settle a provision then it recognises an equivalent asset in trade and other receivables.  
The Group may also become involved in legal proceedings or commercial disputes in respect of which it is not possible to make 
a reliable estimate of the financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings or disputes. In these 
cases, where material, appropriate disclosure would be included in the financial statements but no provision would be made 
and no contingent liability can be quantified.  
Provisions for onerous leases 
When the present value of the future cash flows receivable from the operation of leased assets is less than the present value 
of the rental payments to which the Group is committed, the Group applies the shortfall firstly against the carrying amount 
of the assets (in the case of finance leases) and then provides for any further onerous element of the contract (for all leases). 
Determining the amount of such a provision requires estimating the future net cash flows receivable in respect of these assets, 
and in the particular case where the leased properties are vacant this requires assessing the likely period for which the 
property will remain vacant, the cost of any works required to enhance its marketability and the rental income receivable 
when the property is sublet. Actual cash flows paid and received may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which 
the provisions are based. At 31 July 2012, the provision for onerous leases was £39 million (2011: £54 million). 
Taxation 
Accruals for current tax are based on management’s interpretation of country-specific tax law, and require judgements about 
the likelihood that tax positions taken will be sustained. Where management considers it probable that the tax position will be 
sustained, each material tax benefit is reviewed to assess whether it should be recognised in full, or whether provision should 
be made for a potential settlement through negotiation. All such provisions are included in current liabilities. Any estimated 
exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations that are 
accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial 
statements. These actuarial assumptions include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates, 
and are disclosed in note 25. 
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would 
affect the balance sheet and income statement. The Group considers that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount 
rate and life expectancy. The Group has estimated that a decrease of 0.5 per cent in the discount rate would increase the 
liability by £141 million, an increase of 0.5 per cent would decrease the liability by £125 million. Increasing the estimate of life 
expectancy by one year would increase the liability by £36 million.

2. Segmental analysis 
Wolseley’s reportable segments are the operating businesses overseen by distinct divisional management teams responsible for 
their performance. All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution of plumbing and 
heating products and building materials. 
The Group’s business is not highly seasonal half on half. The Group’s customer base is highly diversified, with no individually 
significant customer. 
Revenue by reportable segment is as follows:

4. Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those material items which, by virtue of their size or incidence, are presented separately in the income 
statement to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. If provisions have been made for exceptional 
items in previous years, then any write-back of those provisions is shown as exceptional. 
Exceptional items included in operating profit from continuing operations are analysed by purpose as follows:

Exceptional profit on disposal of associate: On 17 November 2011 the Group disposed of its remaining minority stake in 
its associate, Saturn Acquisition Holdings LLC (the holding company of Stock Building Supply), for a cash consideration of 
£16 million. The associate was held at nil carrying value at 31 July 2011 and as a result an exceptional profit on disposal 
of associate of £16 million was generated.

9. Non-GAAP performance measures 
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles. 
It is a non-GAAP measure. As explained on page 150, the Group considers that trading profit, and other performance 
measures based on it, including EBITDA before exceptional items, present valuable additional information to users of the 
financial statements.

The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by Employee Benefit Trusts, 
was 283.3 million (2011: 282.6 million). The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to 
increase the weighted average number of shares in issue to 286.2 million (2011: 285.0 million).

As explained on page 140, impairment tests were performed for all of the Group’s cash generating units or groups of cash

As highlighted in the Group’s announcement in July 2012, the businesses in Denmark have continued to experience challenging 
market conditions and this has been reflected in reduced expectations of future profitability in the value in use calculations for 
Stark and Silvan. The carrying value of the remaining goodwill and other acquired intangible assets relating to Stark, Silvan and 
Neumann was £142 million, £32 million and £27 million respectively at 31 July 2012. 
Market conditions have also been more challenging than expected in France and the outlook has become increasingly 
uncertain. As a result, expectations of profitability for PBM have been reduced resulting in the impairment of all its goodwill and 
acquired intangible assets.  
Pre-tax discount rates of between 11–12 per cent (2011: 10–12 per cent) and long-term growth rates of between 1.5-2.0 per 
cent have been used in the value in use models for the Nordic and France segments.

Deferred tax assets in the USA and UK have been recognised on the basis that both territories are forecast to have sufficient 
taxable profits in the future to enable these to be utilised. 
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling £23 million (2011: £15 million) that have not been 
recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain. The losses are in the UK, relating to capital disposals, 
and Sweden and do not expire.  
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries. 
However, tax may arise on £176 million (2011: £379 million) of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control 
the timing of their reversal and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Provisions for impairment of receivables are made locally, and have two components comprising a provision for amounts that 
have been individually determined not to be collectible in full, because of known financial difficulties of the debtor or evidence of 
default or delinquency in payment, amounting to £37 million at 31 July 2012 (2011: £39 million); and a provision based on 
historic experience of non-collectability of receivables, amounting to £9 million at 31 July 2012 (2011: £8 million).

Other receivables includes an insurance receivable of £52 million (2011: £44 million) relating to asbestos claims (note 24) which 
has been discounted at a rate of 2.2 per cent (2011: 3.8 per cent) due to the long-term nature of the receivable. The fair value of 
the remaining balances in trade and other receivables approximates to book value.  120

£203 million of the bank loans are secured against the Group’s freehold property (2011: £223 million). At 31 July 2011 
£123 million was secured against trade receivables.

Total 681 739
Until 30 November 2011, certain tranches of the senior unsecured loan notes were hedged with interest rate swaps, such 
that the Group was effectively paying floating rate interest instead of a weighted average fixed interest rate of 5.1 per cent. 
At 30 November 2011 the notes were stated at an amount of £551 million, comprising a par value of £474 million and a fair 
value adjustment of £77 million, which was offset by the carrying value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges 
of £79 million (2011: £513 million, £453 million, £60 million and £64 million respectively). During November 2011 the Group 
entered into a series of receive floating, pay fixed interest rate swaps over the remaining duration of the notes, such that 
the Group is now effectively paying a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.5 per cent on the par value of the notes. 
This transaction is not eligible for hedge accounting, and accordingly the Group has de-designated the hedge relationship. 
The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the notes is being released to the income statement on an amortised 
cost basis over the period to maturity of the notes. At 31 July 2012 the carrying amount of the notes of £542 million comprised 
a par value of £475 million and a fair value adjustment of £67 million.

22. Financial instruments and financial risk management 
There have been no significant changes during the year to the Group’s policies on accounting for, valuing and managing the risk 
of financial instruments. These policies are summarised on pages 142 to 149. 
Capital structure 
To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure to current and forecast trading, the Group’s principal measure of financial 
gearing is the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items. The Group aims to operate with investment grade credit 
metrics and ensure this ratio does not exceed 1 to 2 times. The Group’s main borrowing facilities contain a financial covenant 
limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items to 3.5:1.  
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may pay a special dividend, return capital to shareholders, issue 
new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling 
outstanding claims and claims incurred but not reported on certain risks retained by the Group (principally US casualty 
and global property damage).  
The environmental and legal provision includes £52 million (2011: £44 million) for the estimated liability for asbestos litigation 
on a discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 2.2 per cent (2011: 3.8 per cent). This amount has been actuarially 
determined as at 31 July 2012 based on advice from independent professional advisers. The Group has insurance that it 
currently believes is sufficient to cover the estimated liability and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been 
recorded in other receivables. Based on current estimates, the amount of performing insurance cover available significantly 
exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the 
foreseeable future. There were 155 claims outstanding at 31 July 2012 (31 July 2011: 160). 
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs and future lease rentals on closed branches. 
In determining the provision for onerous leases, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate 
government bond rates. The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately five years. 
Other provisions include the Group’s best estimate of the cost of potential product and service warranty claims arising in Stock 
Building Supply before its disposal on 6 May 2009, and other warranty and separation costs relating to businesses disposed. 
Other provisions also include rental commitments on vacant properties other than those arising from restructuring actions, 
dilapidations on leased properties and warranties. The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately 
three years.

25. Retirement benefit obligations 
(i) Long-term benefit plans provided by the Group 
The Group has a defined benefit pension plan for certain of its UK employees. The Group operates a number of smaller 
schemes in other jurisdictions, providing pensions or other long-term benefits such as long service or termination awards. 
More information about the schemes operated by the Group is set out on pages 150 and 151. There have been no significant 
changes during the financial year. 
The Group currently expects to contribute £44 million to the UK defined benefit schemes and £12 million to the non-UK defined 
benefit schemes in the year ending 31 July 2013. All of the Group’s companies are now reviewing their pension arrangements 
and this may lead to further cash contributions in the range of £100 million to £150 million.

The expected long-term rates of return for equities are long-term assumptions and were set after taking actuarial advice. 
The expected equity returns can be considered as a risk free rate of return (determined by reference to government bond 
rates in the countries in which the plans are based) plus a risk premium to reflect the additional risks associated with equities. 
For the UK scheme the expected return implies a premium of 3.9 per cent per year as at 31 July 2012 (2011: 3.1 per cent) over 
the expected return from government bonds. For the principal overseas schemes in the USA, Canada and Switzerland a similar 
approach has been adopted with returns set by reference to long-term bond rates after taking actuarial advice.

On 23 November 2010 pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006 between Old 
Wolseley (the former holding company of the Group) and the Old Wolseley shareholders, and as sanctioned by the High Court, 
all the issued 10 pence ordinary shares in Old Wolseley were cancelled and the same number of new shares were issued to the 
Company in consideration for the allotment to shareholders of one ordinary 10 pence share in the Company for each ordinary 
10 pence share in Old Wolseley held at the scheme record date of 19 November 2010. 
The Old Wolseley deferred shares had no voting rights, no entitlement to a dividend and could not be traded. On 24 November 
2010 the Old Wolseley deferred shares were transferred from their current holders to the Company for no consideration and 
were then repurchased and cancelled by Old Wolseley.  130

On 28 September 2011 the Remuneration Committee approved the Wolseley Group Ordinary Share Plan 2011 (the “Ordinary 
Share Plan”). Under the Ordinary Share Plan, employees can be granted a variable number of awards in any form or combination 
of options, restricted share awards, conditional share awards or phantom share awards up to a maximum of 100 per cent of 
their current salary. The vesting period is three years and there are no performance measures other than retained employment. 
The first awards were granted on 15 November 2011. There have been no other significant changes to the Group’s share-based 
payment plans, which are summarised on page 152. 
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the 
growth in headline earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail 
Price Index over the same period by at least 9 per cent. When management expect that there is no realistic probability that 
this condition for a particular award to vest will be attained, amounts charged in previous periods in respect of that award are 
credited to the income statement. No such credit has been recorded in 2012. In 2011 £13 million was credited to the income 
statement in respect of the 2008 award. 
The number of outstanding and number of exercisable share options and share awards are detailed below.

operating lease arrangements have renewal options and rental escalation clauses, though the effect of these is not material. 
No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. 
The commitments shown above include commitments for onerous leases which have already been provided for. 
At 31 July 2012 provisions include an amount of £39 million (2011: £54 million) in respect of minimum lease payments for such 
onerous leases net of sublease payments expected to be received. The total minimum sublease payments expected to be 
received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 July 2012 is £36 million (2011: £19 million). 
35. Contingent liabilities 
Group companies are, from time to time, subject to certain claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business in 
relation to, among other things, the suitability of products, contract and commercial disputes and disputes with employees. 
Provision is made if, on the basis of current information and professional advice, liabilities are considered likely to arise. In the 
case of unfavourable outcomes the Group may benefit from applicable insurance recoveries. Certain claims arise as a result of 
the unintentional supply of defective products and these claims are usually the responsibility of the manufacturer, though 
defence and other costs may also be incurred by the Group. 
Mislabelled gaskets 
In December 2011 the Group’s US business wrote to a number of customers in the USA and Canada in relation to the 
unintentional supply of gaskets which were mislabelled by a former supplier, Lortech Rubber Inc. of Canada, as being non-
asbestos. A number of customers had found asbestos in gaskets above the level at which they can be classified as non-
asbestos. Independent expert advice confirmed that there was no health or safety risk arising from the handling, installation 
and use of the gaskets. Well-established protocols are maintained by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
to ensure the safe removal of all types of gaskets. The performance of the gaskets is not affected and the expert advice is 
to leave the gaskets in place until the end of their lives. The supply of these products in the USA and Canada is legal. 
No significant product liability claims have arisen from this matter to date. 
Warranties and guarantees in relation to business disposals 
Following a review of the appropriate allocation of the Group’s resources in 2009 the Group has disposed of a number of 
non-core businesses and various Group companies have provided certain standard warranties and guarantees to acquirers 
and other third parties, including warranties regarding financial statements and taxation. Provision is made where the Group 
considers that a liability is likely to crystallise, though it is possible that claims in respect of which no provisions has been made 
could be received in the future. Group companies have also guaranteed certain property and other obligations which could be 
called in an event of default. As at the date of this report there are no significant outstanding claims in relation to business 
disposals. 
Outcome 
The outcome of claims and litigation to which Group companies are party cannot readily be foreseen as, in some cases, 
the facts are unclear, further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case, or they are part of continuing legal 
proceedings. However, based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an 
unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position 
of the Group. 
36. Post balance sheet events 
On 21 August 2012, the Group completed the disposal of the Woodcote Group for proceeds of £3.4 million.  
On 25 September 2012, the Group completed the acquisition of Power Equipment Direct, an online retailer of generators and 
power equipment, for a maximum consideration of £41 million. It had revenue of £53 million in its last financial year.

Group accounting policies 
A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
is set out below. 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation 
of available-for-sale investments and financial assets and liabilities held for trading. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those material items which, by virtue of their size or incidence, are presented separately in the income 
statement to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. These exclude impairments of acquired 
intangibles which are also presented separately in the income statement. Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items 
include restructurings of business activities and gains or losses on the disposal of businesses. 
Consolidation 
The consolidated financial information includes the results of the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 
31 July 2012. 
The trading results of businesses other than discontinued operations acquired or sold during the year are included in profit on 
ordinary activities from continuing operations from the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale. 
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated 
on consolidation. 
Discontinued operations 
When the Group has disposed of or intends to dispose of a business component that represents a separate major line of 
business or geographical area of operations it classifies such operations as discontinued. The post-tax profit or loss of the 
discontinued operations is shown as a single line on the face of the income statement, separate from the other results of 
the Group. 
Foreign currencies 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency of 
the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary undertaking operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency 
of the parent company. 
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling 
during the relevant financial period. 
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the 
period end. Exchange differences arising between the translation into sterling of the net assets of these subsidiary undertakings 
at rates ruling at the beginning and end of the year are recognised in the currency translation reserve as are exchange 
differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign 
currency net assets. 
Changes in the fair value and the final settlement value of derivative financial instruments, entered into to hedge foreign currency 
net assets and that satisfy the hedging conditions of IAS 39, are recognised in the currency translation reserve (see the separate 
accounting policy on derivative financial instruments). 
In the event that an overseas subsidiary undertaking is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement 
is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the subsidiary 
undertaking concerned. 
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the 
dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All currency translation differences are taken to the income statement with the 
exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against 
foreign currency net assets as detailed above.   138

Business combinations 
The introduction of a new holding company in 2011 constituted a group reconstruction and was accounted for using merger 
accounting principles. In all other cases the Group has applied the purchase method in its accounting for the acquisition of 
subsidiaries. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or 
assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. 
Acquisition related costs are expensed. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded 
as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, 
the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. 
Revenue 
Revenue is the amount receivable for the provision of goods and services falling within the Group’s ordinary activities, excluding 
intra-group sales, estimated and actual sales returns, trade and early settlement discounts, value added tax and similar sales 
taxes. 
Revenue from the provision of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of goods have been transferred to 
the customer. The risks and rewards of ownership of goods are deemed to have been transferred when the goods are shipped 
to, or are picked up, by the customer. 
Revenue from services is recognised when the service provided to the customer has been completed. 
Customer loyalty credits are accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in which they are granted. 
A portion of the fair value of the consideration received is allocated to the loyalty credits and recognised over the period that 
loyalty credits are redeemed. 
Revenue from the provision of goods and services is only recognised when the amounts to be recognised are fixed or 
determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. 
Cost of sales 
Cost of sales includes purchased goods, the cost of bringing inventory to its present location and condition, and labour and 
overheads attributable to assembly and construction services. 
Vendor rebates 
The Group enters into arrangements with certain vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates. These purchase rebates are 
accrued as earned and are recorded initially as a reduction in inventory with a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the 
related product is sold. 
Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets 
of the acquired subsidiary undertaking at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings is included 
in intangible assets. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 
All goodwill has arisen from business combinations. On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK 
GAAP was allocated to cash-generating units and groups of cash-generating units (“CGUs”). These are independent sources of 
income streams, and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management 
purposes, which may be at country, divisional, brand or regional level. Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 
2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination. No CGUs are larger than 
the reporting segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”.

Other intangible assets 
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can 
be measured reliably. The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable or when it arises from contractual or other 
legal rights. 
Intangible assets, primarily brands, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of a business combination are 
capitalised separately from goodwill and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortisation is calculated using the reducing balance method for customer relationships and the straight-line method for other 
intangible assets. The cost of the intangible assets is amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows: 
Customer relationships 4 – 25 years 
Trade names and brands 1 – 15 years 
Other   1 – 4 years 
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible 
asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs include software 
licences, consulting costs attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software and internal 
costs directly attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software. Costs in respect of training 
and data conversion are expensed as incurred. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method so as to charge the 
cost of the computer software to the income statement over its estimated useful life as follows: 
Software   3 – 5 years 
Software assets are generally either purchases from third parties or internally generated. Other intangible assets arise on 
business combinations. 
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) 
PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, except for land and assets in the 
course of construction, which are not depreciated and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. In addition, subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. 
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over 
its estimated useful life, as follows: 
Freehold buildings and long leaseholds 35 – 50 years 
Operating leasehold improvements  over the period of the lease 
Plant and machinery   7 – 10 years 
Computer hardware   3 – 5 years 
Fixtures and fittings   5 – 7 years 
Motor vehicles    4 years 
The residual values and useful lives of PPE are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date. 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the long-term construction or production of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost 
of the asset. 
Leased assets 
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have 
transferred to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful 
lives. The asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception 
of the lease. The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases are included in liabilities in the balance sheet and 
analysed between current and non-current amounts. The interest elements of future obligations under finance leases are 
charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital 
repayments outstanding in accordance with the effective interest rate method. 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. The cost 
of operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the periods of the leases.  140

Group accounting policies continued 
Assets and disposal groups held for sale  
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the 
business. Where a group of assets and their directly associated liabilities are to be disposed of in a single transaction, such 
disposal groups are also classified as held for sale. For this to be the case, the asset or disposal group must be available for 
immediate sale in its present condition, and management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset or 
disposal group which, when initiated, was expected to result in a completed sale within 12 months. Assets that are classified 
as held for sale are not depreciated. Assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.  
Impairment of assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation or depreciation and are tested 
annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation and assets under construction are tested for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The value in use is in most cases based on the discounted 
present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates, or from the 
individual asset or asset group.  
The value in use calculations in respect of CGUs use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts approved by 
management. The key assumptions for these forecasts are those regarding revenue growth, trading margin and the level of 
working capital required to support trading, which management estimates based on past experience, reflecting the cyclicality 
of earnings, and expectations of future changes in the market. To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are 
extrapolated after the five year period at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate for each market (ranging from 
1.0 per cent to 2.5 per cent), and discounted back to present value. The discount rate assumptions use an estimate of the 
Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.3 per cent, based on the five year historic volatility of Wolseley shares 
and on benchmark interest rates. The pre-tax discount rate which ranges from 11 per cent to 14 per cent (2011: 10 per cent to 
13 per cent) has been applied to the risk adjusted cash flows of each CGU. The carrying amounts of goodwill and acquired 
intangibles for CGUs which have a significant proportion of the Group’s total are: Blended Branches (USA) £243 million, Beijer 
(Nordic) £152 million, Stark (Nordic) £142 million, Waterworks (USA) £105 million and Starkki (Nordic) £97 million. 
Inventories 
Inventories, which all comprise goods purchased for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method or the average cost method as appropriate to the nature of the 
transactions in those items of inventory. The cost of goods purchased for resale includes import and custom duties, transport 
and handling costs, freight and packing costs and other attributable costs less trade discounts, rebates and other subsidies. 
It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable 
variable selling expenses. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Examples of such evidence include significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy 
or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments. The amount of the provision is the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. Trade receivables are written off against the provision when 
recoverability is assessed as being remote. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the 
income statement. 
Provisions 
Provisions for environmental restoration, restructuring costs, product and service warranties and legal claims are recognised 
when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Such provisions are measured 
at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. 
Provisions for insurance represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding 
claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date on certain risks retained by the Group.

Retirement benefit obligations 
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other post-retirement benefits are charged to the income statement 
as incurred. 
For defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits, the cost is calculated annually using the projected unit credit 
method and is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating employees, in accordance with 
the recommendations of independent qualified actuaries. The current service cost of defined benefit plans is recorded within 
operating profit. The total expected return from pension scheme assets less the total interest on pension scheme liabilities is 
recorded within finance revenue if a gain and finance costs if an expense. Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits 
are recorded within operating profit and recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the benefits 
have vested. Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan 
assets and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income 
in the period in which they occur. The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total 
for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less any past service costs not yet 
recognised, less the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date. Where a plan is in surplus, the asset 
recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount which the 
Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.  
Taxation 
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable) on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into account any adjustments arising from prior years. 
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
Share capital 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the 
proceeds, net of tax. 
Where any group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including 
any directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until 
the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration 
received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders.  142

Group accounting policies continued 
Share-based payments 
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s executive share option, long-term incentive, employee 
share purchase and ordinary share plan schemes. The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes 
that is based on the fair value of the awards, measured using Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. 
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant (including the impact of any non-vesting conditions 
such as a requirement for employees to save) and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award 
was granted are modified. For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is re-measured at 
each balance sheet date until the liability is settled.  
The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated by the binomial methodology for all 
schemes except the long term incentive scheme, for which a Monte Carlo simulation was used. The fair value of shares granted 
under the Ordinary Share Plan and Restricted Share Plan was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant 
reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period. 
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were: 
 Executive Share Options  Employee Share Options  
Long Term Incentive 
Schemes 
 2012 2011  2012 2011  2012 2011 
Risk free interest rate 1.4% 2.55% 0.65% 1.57%  1.4% 1.31%
Expected dividend yield 3.8% 1.84% 3.22% 1.80%  3.8% 1.93%
Expected volatility 44.51% 42.14% 43.73% 44.04%  41% 53.2%
Expected life 5.7 years 5.7 years 1–7 years 1–7 years  3 years 3 years
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term, excluding the effect of 
extraordinary volatility due to the Group’s capital reorganisation and rights issue in 2009. Expected life has been estimated 
on the basis of historical data on the exercise pattern. 
The principal assumptions for the Ordinary Share Plan are expected dividend yield of 3.8 per cent and expected life of 
three years. 
Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to 
reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market 
performance conditions. 
Dividends payable 
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends 
are approved by the shareholders of the Company (generally in the case of the final dividend) or paid (in the case 
of interim dividends). 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments 
with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities on the balance sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset and no practice of net settlement with cash balances. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps and currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks 
arising from the business activities of the Group and the financing of those activities. There is no trading activity in derivative 
financial instruments. 
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use of derivative financial instruments, the Group documents 
the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk management objective and the 
strategy underlying the proposed transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging 
relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values 
or cash flows of the hedged items. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. 
Where derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39, changes in their fair 
values are recognised in the income statement.

37. Additional information continued 
Group accounting policies continued 
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net 
investment hedges. Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset 
or liability is adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair 
value of the hedging instrument. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying 
amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is 
effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised directly in equity 
rather than in the income statement. When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains 
and losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial 
asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a 
hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains 
in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred 
to the income statement. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings 
are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest 
method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Financial instruments by measurement basis 
Financial instruments in the categories “derivatives used for hedging”, “fair value through profit or loss” and “available-for-sale” 
are all measured in the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value measurements can be classified in the following hierarchy: 
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1); 
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly 
(level 2); 
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). 
The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 July 2012 and 31 July 2011:

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) is determined 
by using valuation techniques. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future 
cash flows based on observable yield curves. The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out 
the contracts using market prices at the balance sheet date. 
The Group’s other financial instruments are measured on bases other than fair value. Other receivables include an amount of 
£52 million (2011: £44 million) which has been discounted at a rate of 2.2 per cent (2011: 3.8 per cent) due to the long-term 
nature of the receivable. Because other current assets and liabilities are either of short maturity or bear floating rate interest, their 
fair values approximate to book values. The book values and fair values of categories including non-current assets and liabilities 
can be compared as follows:

Financial instruments: risk management policies 
The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations, and the financial instruments which fund them. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group has well defined policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty 
exposures, which have been consistently applied during the financial years ended 31 July 2011 and 31 July 2012. By the 
nature of its business the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated 
to operating businesses. There has been no change since the year end in the major financial risks faced by the Group. 
Policies for managing each of these risks are regularly reviewed and are summarised below. When the Group enters into 
derivative transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts), the purpose of such transactions 
is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. It is, and has 
been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions 
be undertaken.  146

Capital risk management 
The Group’s sources of funding currently comprise cash flows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders and 
borrowings from banks and other financial institutions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may pay a 
special dividend, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and capital expenditure 
included in its strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin.  
The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outflows including interest payable in respect of its trade and other 
payables and bank borrowings on an undiscounted basis. The principal assumptions are that floating rate interest is calculated 
using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date, and cash flows in foreign currency are translated using spot rates 
at the balance sheet date. These cash flows can be analysed by maturity as follows:

Foreign currency risk 
The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in 
which the operations are located. Approximately 46 per cent of the Group’s revenue is in US dollars and 19 per cent in Euros. 
The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposures. However, those that do arise may be 
hedged with either forward contracts or currency options. The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since 
such hedges have only temporary effect. 
The Group’s policy is to adjust the currencies in which its debt is denominated to materially match the currencies in which its 
trading profit is generated. Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end 
exchange rates used in the translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in 
the Five year summary on page 160. The net effect of currency translation was to reduce revenue by £47 million (0.3 per cent) 
(2011: decrease of £70 million, or 0.5 per cent) and to have no impact on trading profit (2011: decrease of £1 million, or 0.2 per 
cent). These currency effects reflect a movement of the average sterling exchange rate against US dollars, Euros and Canadian 
dollars as follows: 
 
2012 
Strengthening/ 
(weakening) 
of sterling 
2011
Strengthening/

The Group has financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies which have been designated as hedges of the net 
investment in its overseas subsidiaries. The principal value of these financial instruments at the balance sheet date was 
£452 million (2011: £852 million). The gain on translation of these financial instruments into sterling of £7 million (2011: gain of 
£12 million) has been taken to the translation reserve. 
At 31 July 2012 the Group had the following short-term currency swaps and forward contracts which were designated and 
effective as hedges of overseas operations.

Interest rate risk 
To manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Group’s policy is normally that between 0 per cent and 
50 per cent of projected borrowings required during the next two years should be at fixed rates. However, this percentage is 
regularly reviewed by the Board and 72 per cent of loans were at fixed rates at 31 July 2012. The Group borrows in the desired 
currencies principally at rates determined by reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or 
market, such as LIBOR. Rates which reset at least every 12 months are regarded as floating rates, and the Group then uses 
interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile. 
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at Treasury Committee and Board meetings. The Treasury Committee 
gives prior approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements. 
Interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest payable on notional principal of €100 million were held at fair value 
through profit and loss at 31 July 2011 and expired on 13 August 2011. These swap contracts were designated as cash flow 
hedges until 31 January 2010. As the cash flows which were the subject of the hedge relationship were still forecast to occur, 
valuation losses deferred in equity were recycled over the duration of the previous hedge relationship. 
During November 2011 the Group entered into interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest payable on $664 million 
of notional principal. The contracts expire between November 2015 and November 2020 and the fixed interest rates range 
between 1.51 per cent and 2.94 per cent. These contracts have been held since inception at fair value through profit or loss. 
With effect from 1 December 2011 interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest receivable on notional principal of 
$729 million have been classified as held at fair value through profit or loss. The contracts expire between November 2012 
and November 2020 and the fixed interest rates range between 4.93 per cent and 5.32 per cent (2011: 4.93 per cent 
and 5.32 per cent).

The Group’s private placement borrowings are at fixed rates. At 31 July 2011 interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed 
interest receivable on notional principal of $729 million were designated as hedges of the fair values of these borrowings. 
The movement in fair value of these interest rate swaps between 1 August 2011 and 30 November 2011 was analysed into 
a proportion that was effective as a hedge, and a proportion that was ineffective; both portions were charged to the income 
statement with the effective portion offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged borrowings (see note 5). With effect from 
1 December 2011 the contracts were held at fair value through profit or loss.

Credit risk 
Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers. There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to 
pay outstanding loan balances. At 31 July 2012 the maximum exposure to credit risk was £1,846 million (2011: £1,872 million) 
of which £6 million (2011: £33 million) is secured against properties under construction or completed properties awaiting sale. 
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables. Significant 
outstanding and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis. 
In some cases protection is provided through credit insurance arrangements. All of the major businesses use professional, 
dedicated credit teams, in some cases field-based. Appropriate provisions are made for debts that may be impaired on a timely 
basis. Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. 
Accordingly, management consider that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision 
for impairment.  
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with financial institutions, and enters into certain contracts (such as 
interest rate swaps) which entitle the Group to receive future cash flows from financial institutions. These transactions give rise 
to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties with a maximum exposure of £888 million (2011: £470 million). This risk 
is managed by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties. The limits are approved by the 
Treasury Committee and ratings are monitored regularly. 
Market price risk 
The Group monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing the effect on financial instruments over various periods 
of a range of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates. The Group does not consider it has a material exposure 
to changes in interest rates. The Group has estimated that a weakening of sterling by ten per cent against all the currencies in 
which the Group does business would result in a charge to equity of £14 million (2011: £66 million), arising from the translation 
of borrowings denominated in foreign currency, and a credit of £8 million to the income statement, arising from the retranslation 
of interest rate swaps held at fair value through profit or loss (2011: no material effect). 
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit 
risk or commodity price risk, and does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying the Group’s exposure to any of the 
macro-economic variables that might affect the collectability of receivables or the prices of commodities.  150

Additional information about non-GAAP measures of performance 
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangibles. It is a non-GAAP measure. Exceptional items are those material items which by virtue of their size or incidence are 
presented separately and are excluded from trading profit to enable a clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s financial 
performance. In addition, the current businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through 
acquisition. Operating profit includes only the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles arising on those businesses 
that have been acquired subsequent to 31 July 2004 and as such does not reflect equally the performance of businesses 
acquired prior to 31 July 2004 (where no amortisation or impairment of acquired intangibles was recognised), businesses that 
have developed organically (where no intangibles are attributed) and those businesses more recently acquired (where 
amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is charged).  
The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing 
the Group’s performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly 
able to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group. The Group uses trading profit and certain key performance 
indicators, calculated by reference to trading profit, for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for its internal 
assessment of the operating performance of individual businesses within the Group. 
Additional information about pensions and other long-term employee benefits 
Description of plans 
The principal scheme operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits 
based on final or the average of the last five years of pensionable salaries. The assets are held in separate trustee administered 
funds. The scheme’s retirement benefits are funded by a salary sacrifice arrangement from employees with the balance being 
paid by Group companies. Employees’ salary sacrifice is either 5 per cent or 8 per cent of earnings depending on the level of 
benefits accruing. The Group contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent 
consulting actuary. This scheme was closed to new entrants in 2009. A defined contribution scheme is also operated. 
The principal schemes operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance 
with US 401k rules. Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans. The Group also 
operates two defined benefit schemes in the United States which are closed to new entrants. One of the schemes is funded 
and the majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies. The closed plans 
now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution scheme. The contribution rate is 
calculated on the Projected Unit (credit) Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.  
In Canada defined benefit schemes and a defined contribution scheme are operated. Most of the Canadian defined benefit 
schemes are funded. The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit (credit) Method as agreed with independent 
consulting actuaries. 
In Europe both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated. Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes 
are calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.

Investment policy 
The Group’s investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally and, if relevant, by the trustees of the 
plan, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements. The Group’s objective for the investment strategy is to achieve 
a target rate of return in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative 
to the liabilities. 
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term 
to deliver the target rate of return. Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this 
will result in the ongoing cost to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term and within acceptable 
boundaries of risk. 
For the UK scheme, the policy is to invest approximately 75 per cent of the assets in equities and 25 per cent in other asset 
classes, principally bonds. The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the 
Group. For the overseas schemes the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities 
with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.

Additional information about share-based payment plans 
The Group operates eight share option plans of which four are discretionary plans (collectively, the “Executive Option Schemes”) 
and four are all employee sharesave plans (collectively the “Employee Saving Option Schemes”). Four plans were adopted as 
part of the Company’s redomiciliation after approval by shareholders in November 2010. 
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless 
the growth in headline earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail 
Price Index over the same period by at least 9 per cent and consequently vest over a period of three years. Awards granted 
under the Employee Savings Option Schemes vest over periods ranging from three to seven years, except for awards granted 
under the US sharesave plan, which vest over a one-year period. 
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Scheme (“LTIS”) and the Wolseley Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) for senior 
executives. Under the LTIS, executives are awarded a variable number of shares depending on the level of total shareholder 
return over the next three years relative to that of a number of comparator companies. The vesting period is three years. 
The maximum award under the LTIS is determined at grant date and then adjusted at vesting date in accordance with the 
market performance condition. Under the RSP, executives are granted free shares. The vesting period is three years and there 
are no performance measures other than retained employment. 
Since 28 September 2011 the Group has operated the Wolseley Group Ordinary Share Plan 2011 (the “Ordinary Share Plan”) 
for employees, not key management personnel, of the Group. Under the Ordinary Share Plan, employees can be granted a 
variable number of awards in any form or combination of options, restricted share awards, conditional share awards or phantom 
share awards up to a maximum of 100% of their current salary. The vesting period is three years and there are no performance 
measures other than retained employment. 
Additional information about employee benefit trusts 
Three Employee Benefit Trusts were established in October 2004 in connection with the Company’s discretionary share option 
plans and long term incentive plans. Upon its redomiciliation, the Company changed the trustees to Bedell Trust Company 
Limited (also registered in Jersey). No shares were purchased by the trusts during the year. The market value of the 1,934,869 
shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts at 31 July 2012 (2011: 1,947,259), which have a nominal value of £0.2 million, was 
£45 million (2011: £35 million). Dividends due on shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts are waived in accordance with the 
provisions of the trust deeds.  
Additional information about the parent company of the Group 
The Company is incorporated in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and is headquartered in Switzerland. 
It operates as the ultimate parent company of the Wolseley Group. Its registered office is 26 New Street, St Helier, Jersey, 
JE2 3RA, Channel Islands.

We have audited the Group Financial Statements of Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2012 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Cash Flow 
Statement, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.  
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 81, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the Group Financial Statements:  
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 July 2012 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;  
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and  
• have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and Article 4 of the 
lAS Regulation.  
Opinion on other matters  
In our opinion: 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group Financial Statements are prepared is 
consistent with the group financial statements; and 
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement with respect to internal control and risk management systems 
and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the UK Listing Rules we are required to review:  
• the Directors’ statement, set out in the Directors’ Report, in relation to going concern;  
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and 
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration.

Overview Performance Governance Financials Information
1. Corporate information 
Wolseley plc (the “Company”) was incorporated and registered in Jersey on 28 September 2010 under the Jersey Companies 
Law as a public company limited by shares under the name Wolseley plc with registered number 106605. The principal 
legislation under which the Company operates is the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, and regulations made 
thereunder. The address of its registered office is 26 New Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3RA, Channel Islands. It is 
headquartered in Switzerland. 
The principal activity of the Company is to act as the ultimate holding company of the Wolseley Group of companies. 
2. Company accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented in compliance with the requirements for companies whose 
shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange’s main market. They have been prepared on a going concern basis and 
under the historical cost convention, and in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”). They are presented in pounds sterling as that is the functional currency 
of the Company. 
Note 8 (Dividends) on page 111, note 26 (Share capital) on page 129 and note 27 (Share-based payments) on page 130 of 
the Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements form part of these financial statements. 
Foreign currencies 
The cost of the Company’s investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings is translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the 
date of investment. 
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the 
dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All currency translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are recorded at cost less provision for impairment. The Company assesses at each balance sheet 
date whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired. 
Cash at bank and in hand 
Cash at bank and in hand includes cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks. Bank overdrafts are shown within 
borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset and intention to net settle with 
cash balances. 
Share capital 
The Company has one class of shares, ordinary shares, which are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable 
to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax. 
Where the Company or the Company’s trust purchases the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including 
any directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders 
until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration 
received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders. 
Share-based payments 
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Company’s executive share option, long-term incentive and share 
purchase and ordinary share plan schemes. The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that 
is based on the fair value of the awards, measured using Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. 
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the 
conditions on which the award was granted are modified. For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of 
grant and is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled. Generally, the compensation cost is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the 
vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions or achieve non-market performance conditions. 
Dividends payable 
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends 
are approved by the shareholders of the Company (generally in the case of the final dividend) or paid (in the case of 
interim dividends).

11. Contingent liabilities 
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims and legal actions in progress. The Company takes legal 
advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on 
that advice that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made. 
In addition the Company has given certain banks authority to transfer at any time any sum outstanding to its credit against or 
towards satisfaction of its liability to those banks of certain subsidiary undertakings. The Company has also given indemnities 
and warranties to the purchasers of businesses from the Company and certain Group companies in respect of which no 
material liabilities are expected to arise. 
12. Employees, employee costs and auditors’ remuneration 
The average number of employees of the Company in the year ended 31 July 2012 was one (2011: one). Other employees of 
Group companies were seconded or assigned to the Company in the period, in order to fulfil their duties or to carry out the 
work of the Company. Each of the Non Executive Directors of the Company has an appointment letter with the Company, and 
the Executive Directors and certain other senior managers of the Group have assignment letters in place with the Company. 
Total employment costs of the Company for the period, including Non Executive Directors and seconded employees, 
were £1 million (2011: £1 million). 
Fees payable to the auditors for the audit of the Company’s financial statements are set out in note 3, on page 109, to the 
Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements. 
13. Dividends 
Details of the Company’s dividends are set out in note 8, on page 111, to the Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements.

requirement to disclose transactions with fellow subsidiaries, all of whose voting rights are held within the Group, and which are 
included in the consolidated financial statements of Wolseley plc.  158
Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
We have audited the Parent Company Financial Statements of Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2012 which comprise 
the Company Profit and Loss Account, the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is United Kingdom Accounting Standards. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 81 the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Parent Company Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
the terms of our engagement and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.  
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Parent Company Financial Statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 July 2012; and 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards. 
Opinion on other matters 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Parent Company Financial 
Statements are prepared is consistent with the Parent Company Financial Statements.  
At the request of the Directors, we have also audited the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited. In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group Financial Statements of Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2012.

Dividend payment methods
   1. Direct payment to your bank: You can choose to receive your dividend in a number of ways. You are 
encouraged to receive your dividends directly to your bank or building society account. This is more convenient and 
helps reduce the risk of cheques becoming lost or delayed in the post. The associated tax voucher will still be sent 
direct to your registered address. To switch to this method of payment you can download a dividend mandate form 
from the Shareview website (www.sharview.co.uk). Alternatively, you can contact Equiniti by telephone who will also be 
able to assist with any questions you may have.
   2. Overseas payment service: If you live overseas, Equiniti offers an Overseas Payment Service which is available 
in certain countries. This may make it possible to receive dividends direct into your bank account in your local 
currency*. Further information can be found on the Wolseley plc website, Shareview website or you can contact 
Equiniti by telephone. 
   3. Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP): The Company offers a DRIP which gives shareholders the opportunity to 
use their dividend to purchase further Wolseley shares. Instead of receiving cash, shareholders receive as many whole 
shares as can be bought with their dividend, taking into account related purchase costs. Any residual cash will be 
carried forward and added to their next dividend. 
   If you wish to join the DRIP, you can download copies of the DRIP terms and conditions and the DRIP mandate form 
from the Shareview website. Simply complete the DRIP mandate form and return it to Equiniti. Should you have any 
questions on the DRIP or wish for a paper mandate form to be sent to you, please contact Equiniti on 0871 384 2934**. 
Please note that if you wish to join the DRIP in time for the 2012 ﬁnal dividend, our Registrars, Equiniti, must have 
received the instruction by 9 November 2012. Instructions received by Equiniti after this date will be applied to 
the next dividend.
* Please note that a payment charge would be deducted from each individual payment before conversion into your local currency.
**  Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, each business day. Calls to this number are charged at 8p per minute from a BT landline. Other telephony provider 
costs may vary. 165

Forward-looking statements
Certain information included in this Annual Report and 
Accounts is forward-looking and involves risks, assumptions 
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those expressed or implied by forward-
looking statements. Forward-looking statements cover all 
matters which are not historical facts and include, without 
limitation, projections relating to results of operations and 
ﬁnancial conditions and the Company’s plans and objectives 
for future operations, including, without limitation, 
discussions of expected future revenues, ﬁnancing plans, 
expected expenditures and divestments, risks associated 
with changes in market conditions and pressures on 
margins, changes in the level of litigation, employee 
motivation, the performance and resilience of the Company’s 
systems and infrastructure, the level of government 
regulation and ﬁnancial risks (such as ﬂuctuations in 
exchange and interest rates).
Forward-looking statements can be identiﬁed by the use 
of forward-looking terminology, including terms such as 
“believes”, “estimates”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “forecasts”, 
“intends”, “plans”, “projects”, “goal”, “target”, “aim”, “may”, 
“will”, “would”, “could” or “should” or, in each case, their 
negative or other variations or comparable terminology. 
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future 
performance. All forward-looking statements in this Annual 
Report and Accounts are based upon information known 
to the Company on the date of this Annual Report and 
Accounts. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any 
particular expectation will be met and readers are cautioned 
not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, 
which speak only at their respective dates.
Additionally, forward-looking statements regarding past 
trends or activities should not be taken as a representation 
that such trends or activities will continue in the future. 
Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory 
obligations (including under the UK Listing Rules and the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority), the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly 
update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether 
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

The greenhouse gas emissions from the production 
and distribution of this Annual Report and Accounts 
have been neutralised through The Gold Standard 
Basa Magogo offsetting project in South Africa. 
The ﬁrst Gold Standard project of its kind in the 
world, this innovative behaviour-change programme 
teaches local communities in South Africa to burn 
coal differently in order to be more fuel efﬁcient, 
thereby reducing carbon emissions. The technique, 
called Basa Magogo, means “Light it up! 
Grandmother” in Zulu. In addition to the emission 
reductions, the Basa Magogo technique also 
improves visibility and reduces health risks by 
producing less smoke. Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

 What science can do
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Welcome to the AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014.
At AstraZeneca, each and every one of us is bold  
in the belief that science should be at the centre  
of everything we do.   
Science compels us to push the boundaries of what is 
possible. We trust in the potential of ideas and pursue 
them, alone and with others, until we have transformed  
the treatment of disease.
AstraZeneca. What science can do.
See what science can do…
The future of treatment for many of today’s diseases lies in uncovering mechanisms that are newly emerging or 
are still to be discovered. We believe the best way to help patients is to focus on breakthrough science to discover 
these mechanisms and develop novel, targeted therapies that interact with them.
This is at the heart of our business and our purpose as a company: to push the boundaries of science to deliver 
life-changing medicines.
…make hearts  
healthier
…help people  
breathe easier

Strategic Report Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
Dear shareholder
As 2014 finished, it brought to a close  
an exceptional year for AstraZeneca.  
We ended it fully focused on the  
delivery of our strategy as an 
independent company. This means 
turning our attractive growth prospects 
and a rapidly progressing pipeline  
into life-changing medicines and  
value for shareholders.
In his Review on the following pages,  
your Chief Executive Officer outlines the 
progress we made during the year in 
delivering our strategic priorities. I would  
like to concentrate on the context in  
which that progress was made and the 
implications for you, our owners.
Clear decisions, responsibly made
When Pfizer approached AstraZeneca 
during 2014, our responsibilities as Directors 
were clear: to act in a way that promoted 
the success of the Company for the benefit 
of its shareholders. In addition to assessing 
the value and deliverability of Pfizer’s 
proposals, we had to have regard  
to the long-term consequences of our 
decisions, the interests of employees, 
relationships with customers, our impact  
on the wider community, including patients, 
and the reputation of the Company. At each 
stage of the process, it was my duty as 
Chairman to ensure we carried out our 
deliberations responsibly, with those duties 
in mind. After extensive review and 
discussions, your Board rejected Pfizer’s 
various proposals. We did so because
 > the proposals fell short of AstraZeneca’s 
value as an independent, science-led 
company
 > AstraZeneca had excellent momentum in 
the delivery of our clearly defined strategy, 
underpinning the Board’s confidence in 
our long-term revenue targets and 
profitability
 > Pfizer’s proposals brought uncertainty 
and risks for AstraZeneca shareholders.
In the wake of that decision, I believe  
we have taken full advantage of the 
opportunity to galvanise employees and 
build on our demonstrable progress as  
an independent company. 
A responsible business
Of course, acting responsibly is not 
restricted to the AstraZeneca boardroom. 
It applies to all our activities. External 
recognition is particularly helpful in providing 
independent validation of our performance. 
I was therefore pleased that we were once 
again listed in the Dow Jones Sustainability 
World Index in 2014. We also retained our 
listing on the European Index for the seventh 
year running.
In the biennial Access to Medicines Index, 
we were disappointed to find ourselves in 
15th position. We remain determined to find 
new ways to improve access to healthcare. 
I am confident that our Healthy Heart Africa 
programme, which aims to improve the lives 
of hypertensive patients across Africa 
through increased education, screening, 
diagnosis and treatment, will make an 
important contribution.
Improved access matters because our 
innovative medicines can make a global 
contribution to better health. They help 
increase survival rates and improve quality 
of life for patients in important areas of 
medical need.
$3.2bn
 
Net cash shareholder distributions 
increased by 9% (Actual growth) to  
$3,242 million (2013: $2,979 million;  
2012: $5,871 million)
4 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Revenue … was in line 
with our upgraded 
guidance and reflected the 
fact that the accelerating 
performance of our 
growth platforms more 
than offset the impact of 
loss of exclusivity.”
Loss of exclusivity
The loss of exclusivity referred to above, and 
its timing, has had, and continues to have, 
an impact on AstraZeneca. Over the coming 
years, this trend will continue as medicines 
such as Nexium and Crestor continue to 
lose exclusivity in key markets, including the 
US and Europe.
Of course, loss of exclusivity is a normal 
part of an innovative medicine’s life-cycle. 
It comes at the end of the period when a 
new medicine is safeguarded from being 
copied so that we can generate returns 
on the investment we have made. A 
well-functioning intellectual property system 
of this type, which rewards innovation, is 
the principal economic safeguard in our 
industry. It is why we commit significant 
resources to establishing and defending 
our patent protections. 
The challenging environment 
continues
More generally, we continue to face 
challenging market conditions. While the 
world pharmaceutical market is growing 
and underlying demographic trends remain 
favourable to long-term growth, many of the 
drivers of demand and supply in the sector 
are under pressure.
On the demand side, we face increased 
competition from generic drugs as some 
of the world’s most successful medicines 
come off patent. In addition, securing an 
appropriate level of reward for our medicines 
is becoming more difficult in the face of 
intense pricing pressures, particularly in 
Financial performance in 2014
Revenue was up 3% to $26,095 million, 
which was in line with our upgraded 
guidance. On an actual basis, revenue  
was up 1% as a result of the negative 
impact of exchange rate movements.  
Core operating profit in 2014 was down 
13% to $6,937 million while Core EPS  
were $4.28, down 8%.
Our performance reflected the delayed 
launch of generic Nexium (esomeprazole)  
in the US as well as the accelerating 
performance of our growth platforms, which 
now contribute over half of our revenues. 
Taken together, they more than offset the 
impact of loss of exclusivity. Our strong 
performance in Emerging Markets was a 
particular highlight, with China becoming 
our second largest market.
Established Markets facing rising healthcare 
costs. On the supply side, the industry faces 
an ongoing R&D productivity challenge. 
Costs have risen significantly and, while in 
2014 the FDA approved the highest number 
of new medicines for 18 years, there is still 
some way to go in improving the probability 
of success of our projects.
Return to shareholders
Consistent with our progressive dividend 
policy to maintain or grow the dividend 
each year, the Board has recommended 
a second interim dividend of $1.90 per 
Ordinary Share. This brings the dividend for 
the full year to $2.80 per Ordinary Share.
The Board regularly reviews its distribution 
policy and its overall financial strategy to 
strike a balance between the interests 
of the business, financial creditors and 
shareholders. We continue to target a 
strong, investment grade credit rating. 
Outlook
As we look to the future, we expect sales 
revenue to decline by mid single-digit 
percent at CER in 2015. Consistent with  
our business model, we will continue to 
seek externalisation revenue from 
collaborations and licensing select products 
and technologies. Core EPS is expected  
to increase by low single-digit percent at 
CER. This expectation involves a number of 
assumptions, including the imminent launch 
of a Nexium generic in the US market.
Appreciation
Before closing, and on behalf of the  
Board, I want to thank the employees  
of AstraZeneca. Their outstanding efforts 
helped us achieve so much in 2014  
towards leading in science and returning to 
growth. In particular, I want to express my 
appreciation to Pascal and all the members 
of the Senior Executive Team for showing 
such inspirational leadership throughout  
a challenging year.
Finally, I would like to thank all my fellow 
Directors for the quality of their contributions 
and conscientiousness they brought to our 
discussions throughout an exceptionally 
busy 2014.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Respiratory, Inflammation and 
Autoimmunity
The American College of Rheumatology 
annual meeting in Boston, MA  
accepted more than 15 abstracts of 
AstraZeneca work.
We are making significant progress in the 
RIA therapy area. Eight projects are in 
Phase III or registration. In particular, we are 
leveraging biologics in severe asthma and 
COPD, and developing several promising 
assets in inflammation and autoimmune 
disease areas. These include dermatology, 
gout, systemic lupus and rheumatoid 
arthritis. In November, we strengthened our 
own capabilities by acquiring the rights to 
Almirall’s respiratory business, and inhalation 
device subsidiary, which will help us develop 
the next generation of devices that meet 
patient needs. We further strengthened our 
respiratory portfolio through our agreement 
– announced in February 2015 – to acquire 
the rights to Actavis’s branded respiratory 
business in the US and Canada.*
Phase III studies began in 2014 for 
tralokinumab for the treatment of severe, 
inadequately controlled asthma. 
Furthermore, we decided to progress 
benralizumab to Phase III in COPD based 
on the finding that patients with elevated 
eosinophils seem to benefit from the drug.
Highlighting the potential of our inflammation 
and autoimmunity biologics portfolio, two 
Phase IIb studies for mavrilimumab and 
sifalimumab both met their primary 
endpoints. Results from Phase III trials for 
brodalumab also met all primary endpoints 
treatment of women with BRCA-mutated 
(BRCAm) ovarian cancer who have had  
very limited treatment options to date.  
The story of Lynparza shows what 
AstraZeneca can achieve by following  
the science. Less than three years ago, 
Lynparza development was discontinued 
following Phase II study results. These 
indicated that the progression-free survival 
(PFS) benefit seen in the overall ovarian 
cancer population was unlikely to translate 
into an overall survival benefit. Attempts to 
identify a suitable dose of the new tablet 
formulation also proved challenging. 
Our teams were undeterred. They saw  
an opportunity to explore why the data 
showed better efficacy in patients with 
BRCAm ovarian cancer and sought to 
re-analyse the Phase II data. This included 
obtaining the BRCAm status for almost  
all patients – itself a great achievement. 
Looking at the data again made it clear that 
the team was right – Lynparza significantly 
prolonged PFS compared with placebo in 
patients with BRCAm ovarian cancer. In 
parallel, the team also identified a suitable 
dose and tablet formulation.
This really does exemplify our values in 
action and demonstrates our determination 
to push the boundaries of science to deliver 
life-changing medicines. We continue to 
explore the potential of this exciting new 
medicine, and additional late-stage clinical 
studies are underway to explore Lynparza’s 
benefit for a variety of other cancers.
AstraZeneca has completed the first phase 
in its strategic journey. We have rebuilt 
strong foundations for sustainable delivery 
and are on track to return to growth by 2017 . 
Fuelled by an exciting portfolio, oncology 
has become AstraZeneca’s sixth growth 
platform and will deliver life-changing 
medicines to patients and long-term growth. 
Achieve scientific leadership
The changes we have made in the last  
two years have transformed AstraZeneca’s 
pipeline and accelerated clinical 
programmes. For example, we have already 
achieved our 2016 target for the number of 
potential medicines in Phase III – three years 
ahead of schedule. The changes have also 
helped towards our goal of achieving 
scientific leadership in our three main 
therapy areas: Respiratory, Inflammation 
and Autoimmunity (RIA); Cardiovascular and 
Metabolic diseases (CVMD); and Oncology.
We achieved a record 12 approvals in 2014 
and, while we must expect occasional 
setbacks, such as the discontinuation of  
a few early-stage projects, we have every 
reason to be confident in our pipeline. In 
addition to launching new medicines, such 
as Lynparza and Movantik/Moventig, by the 
end of 2016, we anticipate
 > 12 to 16 Phase II starts
 > 14 to 16 NME and major line extension 
regulatory submissions
 > 8 to 10 NME and major line extension 
approvals.
A highlight of the year came in December 
when Lynparza was approved in the US  
and EU as the first PARP inhibitor for the 
Dear shareholder
2014 was a remarkable year that shows 
what AstraZeneca can achieve by 
following the science.
We strengthened and accelerated our 
pipeline, and increased the momentum 
behind our growth platforms. Our efforts 
are creating significant value for patients 
and shareholders.

psoriasis, with two of these trials showing 
superior efficacy compared to the current 
standard of care. Following top-line results 
from the Phase III programme for lesinurad 
in combination with xanthine oxidase 
inhibitors in gout patients, our regulatory 
filing in the EU has been accepted.
Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases
The 74th Scientific Sessions of the 
American Diabetes Association in San 
Francisco, CA accepted for presentation 
43 abstracts reporting results of our R&D 
in diabetes. The Annual Meeting of the 
European Association for the Study of 
Diabetes in Vienna, Austria accepted 29 
abstracts for presentation. 
A record total of six major market approvals 
in 2014 for medicines that treat Type 2 
diabetes further demonstrates how we are 
achieving scientific leadership. We also had 
positive results from a Phase III study of 
saxagliptin/dapagliflozin combination in 
patients with Type 2 diabetes and are 
progressing a regulatory filing in the US.
The acquisition in February 2014 of BMS’s 
share of the diabetes alliance was a 
significant event for AstraZeneca and we 
now have one of the broadest non-insulin 
anti-diabetic portfolios in the industry. Our 
diabetes strategy is to shift the treatment 
paradigm towards early use of combination 
therapies, help accelerate the achievement 
of patients’ treatment goals and potentially 
delay disease progression.
2014 was a strong year for our growth 
platform, Brilinta/Brilique, both in terms of 
revenue growth and news flow. The US

Chief Executive Officer’s Review continued
Focus on…personalised 
healthcare
By developing diagnostic-led, targeted 
therapies, personalised healthcare 
improves our ability to identify patients 
most likely to benefit from our 
medicines. In 2014, we entered into 
collaborations with diagnostic and 
biomarker companies, including 
Illumina Inc., Qiagen and Roche,  
to support the development of 
companion diagnostics for our 
investigational oncology medicines. 
We also acquired Definiens, a pioneer 
of a technology that improves the 
identification of biomarkers in tumour 
tissue. Through these transactions, 
we hope to reduce clinical trial time 
and cost, and improve response rates 
and the delivery of the right medicines 
to the right patients.
investigational non-small cell lung  
cancer (NSCLC) compound, AZD9291. 
AZD9291 is a highly selective, irreversible 
inhibitor of both the activating sensitising 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
mutation and the resistance mutation 
T790M. The FDA has granted it 
breakthrough therapy designation as  
well as orphan drug and fast track status.  
This will allow us to speed the medicine’s 
development and we are planning to file  
for approval in the US in the second  
quarter of 2015. At just over two years  
after the compound entered clinical  
testing, this would represent a tremendous 
achievement.
In a development that enhances its value to 
patients and demonstrates our commitment 
to personalised healthcare, Iressa now 
includes blood-based diagnostic testing in 
its European label for patients unable to 
provide a suitable tumour sample. In the US, 
the FDA has accepted a filing for Iressa as  
a targeted monotherapy for the 1st line 
treatment of patients with advanced or 
metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.
Immuno-oncology has the potential to 
transform the way cancer patients are 
treated by harnessing the body’s own 
immune system. Our broad portfolio 
includes almost 30 combination trials, either 
underway or planned. In a crowded field,  
we are particularly well positioned to explore 
synergistic combinations of immunotherapies, 
both with each other and with our own 
highly targeted small molecules. In 2014,  
we initiated a Phase III immunotherapy study 
for MEDI4736 in patients with NSCLC. 
Collaborations, such as those made in 2014 
with Incyte, Advaxis, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, 
Department of Justice’s closure of its 
investigation into the PLATO clinical trial  
in August reaffirmed our confidence in 
Brilinta/Brilique and the PLATO trial. In 
September, new data indicated that the 
profile of Brilinta/Brilique was comparable 
whether administered pre-hospital or 
in-hospital in ST segment elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients.  
Most recently, in January 2015, we 
announced that the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 
study, a large-scale outcomes trial involving 
over 21,000 patients, had met its primary 
endpoint in both 60mg and 90mg doses. 
The study demonstrated that, when taken  
in combination with aspirin, Brilinta/Brilique 
reduced more major cardiovascular 
thrombotic events in patients with a history 
of heart attack than using aspirin alone.
Oncology
We presented over 40 scientific abstracts 
related to our investigational medicines to 
the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
meeting in Chicago, IL and the European 
Society of Medical Oncology 2014 
Congress in Madrid, Spain. 
AstraZeneca has a deep-rooted heritage  
in oncology. Our vision is to help patients  
by redefining the cancer treatment 
paradigm. Our broad pipeline of next-
generation medicines is focused on four 
main disease areas: breast, ovarian, lung 
and haematological cancers. For these, we  
are targeting immunotherapy; the genetic 
drivers of cancer and resistance; DNA 
damage repair; and antibody-drug 
conjugates (ADCs).
The potential of our oncology pipeline is 
highlighted by our small molecule, 
 Research and Development from  
page 52
Focus on…our pipeline
At 31 December 2014, our pipeline 
comprised 133 projects, including 1 18 in 
clinical development and 16 approved or 
launched. Our late-stage pipeline has 
transformed faster than we anticipated, with 
13 NMEs in Phase III/pivotal Phase II, or 
under regulatory review compared with the 
original target of eight set in March 2013. 
Our early-stage pipeline has also grown 
rapidly through a sharp focus on novel 
science and technologies, providing a 
sustainable discovery engine behind our 
main therapy areas.

Definiens further strengthened our 
immuno-oncology capabilities, as described 
in the panel on the left. 
Return to growth
The steps we took to achieve scientific 
leadership in 2014 were complemented by 
our progress towards returning to growth. 
We are doing this through maximising the 
potential of our existing medicines, 
leveraging our global scale and investing in 
our growth platforms and key geographies.
Our commercial expertise and global scale, 
including a strong presence in Emerging 
Markets, helped maximise the value of our 
marketed brands in our main therapy areas, 
which delivered over two-thirds of total 
revenues in 2014.
Our five growth platforms – Brilinta/Brilique, 
diabetes, respiratory, Emerging Markets and 
Japan – are sustaining near-term growth  
as we progress towards our long-term 
ambitions. These platforms accounted for 
more than half our revenues in 2014. We will 
continue to focus on driving growth in these 
areas, with the addition of oncology as a 
growth platform in 2015 as we navigate a 
period that will see some of our established 
products losing their exclusivity.
As already indicated, targeted business 
development reinforces our main therapy 
areas. A focus on early-stage academic  
and biotech alliances supports our 
long-term pipeline aspirations. At the same 
time, strategic transactions, such as those 
with BMS and Almirall, support the 
late-stage and marketed portfolio.
In parallel with the pipeline transformation, 
and leveraging our global scale and 
commercial expertise, our business shape 
is changing to become more sustainable, 
durable and profitable. Biologics now 
account for nearly half our pipeline.  
This increases the probability of success  
of our projects and potentially enhances  
the longevity of our assets. A greater focus 
on innovative delivery devices can offer 
choice to patients while also ensuring  
the durability of our products. Overall,  
we believe the growing proportion of 
specialty care products in our portfolio  
will boost profitability.
Great place to work
We continue to drive our cultural 
transformation and operational simplification 
to support our strategic goals. Our efforts to 
nurture an enhanced culture of innovation 
and enterprise are having a positive impact 
across the organisation. Results from our 
2014 employee survey reflect the progress 
we have made. Employee understanding  
of our strategy was up 14 percentage points 
to 88% over the 2012 survey, and belief in 
our direction was up 18 points to 86%. A 
simpler management structure is helping 
sharpen our focus and remove barriers, 
further accelerating decision making and 
increasing productivity.
Our activities in Cambridge, shown on the 
right, highlight the benefit of co-locating our 
R&D around three strategic bioscience 
clusters in the US, Sweden and the UK. 
These moves are making it easier for our 
researchers to collaborate with external 
partners – and with each other – to leverage 
our small and large molecule capabilities, 
and our innovative technology to maintain 
the pace of pipeline development.
Appreciation
The year 2014 was remarkable for 
AstraZeneca. A period that might easily 
have distracted us with external events 
instead proved to be a time that 
strengthened the case for our future as an 
independent company. All of this was due  
to the achievements of our employees, 
partners and collaborators. I would like to 
pay tribute to every one of them. In doing 
so, I would particularly like to welcome all 
those who have joined AstraZeneca and 
share our passion for working in a company 
that follows the science. That welcome 
includes Fiona Cicconi and Luke Miels, who 
both joined in 2014 and became members 
of the Senior Executive Team.
All of us should be proud of what 
AstraZeneca achieved in 2014. Together,  
we can be confident that, by leading in 
science, we will transform the lives of 
patients around the world. In doing so,  
we will return to growth and deliver value  
to our shareholders.
Pascal Soriot 
Chief Executive Officer
Focus on…value creation
To ensure the full potential of our 
science-led strategy is realised, our 
business model is evolving to include 
value creation through collaboration, 
out-licensing and divestments. In 2014, 
we established an alliance with Lilly to 
co-develop and commercialise our 
BACE inhibitor, AZD3293, for 
Alzheimer’s disease. As part of the 
European Commission’s Innovative 
Medicines Initiative, we also secured 
partial funding for MEDI4893, a 
potential infection medicine. In January 
2015, we completed the divestment of 
the rare-disease drug Myalept to 
Aegerion. This provides another 
example of additional value creation.
 Business model from page 10
Focus on…Cambridge
In 2014, we shared proposed  
designs for our Global R&D Centre 
and Corporate Headquarters in 
Cambridge, UK as part of our plan to 
increase our proximity to world-class 
bioscience clusters. We also 
strengthened our partnership with  
the University of Cambridge with four 
new collaborations and announced a 
collaboration with Cancer Research 
UK to establish a joint laboratory in the 
city focused on novel, biologic cancer 
treatments. Of two collaborations with 
the UK Medical Research Council,  
one will create a joint facility for early 
drug discovery in our new R&D 
Centre, and the second will fund 
projects aimed at better understanding 
the biology of disease.

Why AstraZeneca is different
10 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Purpose and values
We push the boundaries of science  
to deliver life-changing medicines
Our purpose underpins everything we  
do. It gives us a reason to come to work 
every day. It reminds us why we exist as  
a company. It helps us deliver benefits to 
patients and create value for shareholders. 
It also sets the context for our employees’ 
activities and the roles of our teams, 
partners and other collaborators.
We follow the science. We put patients 
first. We play to win. We do the right thing. 
We are entrepreneurial.
These values determine how we work 
together and the behaviours that are integral 
to our drive for success. Our values guide 
our decision making, define our beliefs  
and foster a strong AstraZeneca culture.
Inputs
Demographic trends are favourable to our 
industry’s long-term growth and innovative 
scientific research continues to deliver  
new ways of fulfilling unmet medical need.  
As the Marketplace section from page 14 
demonstrates, however, the economic, 
social and political environment presents  
not only significant opportunities but 
challenges as well.
To achieve our purpose, we seek to 
maximise the value of our resources, 
including our employees, IP , partners  
and collaborators. 
 Resources Review from page 62
We believe that few pharmaceutical 
companies, if any, can match our 
capabilities in small molecules, biologics, 
immunotherapies, protein engineering  
and devices. These distinctive capabilities 
allow us to produce combination therapies 
(such as antibody-drug conjugates) and 
customisable molecules targeted to specific 
patient populations. We have further 
strengthened our portfolio, pipeline and 
capabilities by investing in R&D and 
pursuing licensing, acquisition and 
collaboration opportunities. 
We also have strong commercial franchises 
that focus on Cardiovascular and Metabolic 
diseases, Oncology, and Respiratory, 
Inflammation and Autoimmunity, and have 
combined a broad portfolio of primary care 
and specialty care medicines with a global 
reach. We believe our capabilities, pipeline 
and portfolio will enable us to build on our 
leading position in Established Markets and 
achieve further growth in Emerging Markets. 
 Business Review from page 52
Strategic priorities
Our strategic priorities reflect how we aim  
to achieve our purpose. They are to 
1. Achieve scientific leadership
2. Return to growth
3. Be a great place to work.
These priorities reflect the choices we have 
made to focus our R&D and commercial 
investments, prioritise and accelerate 
promising assets and business development, 
and transform our innovation model and the 
way we work. 
 Strategic priorities from page 18
Life-cycle of a medicine
For each of our therapy areas, our activities 
span the entire life-cycle of a medicine,  
from Research and Development to 
Manufacturing and Supply, and the global 
Sales and Marketing of primary care and 
specialty care medicines.
 Life-cycle of a medicine overleaf 
We operate according to what we believe  
is a disciplined value-creation framework. 
This framework supports investment in our 
portfolio, pipeline and growth platforms, 
which generates cash flows that we return 
to investors and reinvest into the business 
and business development. Our business 
development activities include alliances, 
collaborations, in-licensing arrangements 
and acquisitions, such as our acquisition of 
BMS’s interest in the diabetes alliance and 
the strategic transaction with Almirall to 
acquire its respiratory franchise and 
inhalation devices subsidiary.
Growth platforms
 > Brilinta/Brilique
 > Diabetes
 > Emerging Markets
 > Respiratory
 > Japan
 Strategic priorities from page 18
Our business model also includes value 
creation through out-licensing and 
divestments. In 2014, for example, we 
established an alliance with Lilly to 
co-develop and commercialise our BACE 
inhibitor, AZD3293, for Alzheimer’s disease. 
In January 2015, we divested Myalept to 
Aegerion and our US rights to Zestril and 
Tenormin to Alvogen. These transactions 
allow us to leverage the capabilities and 
expertise of others, focus our resources  
and deliver the greatest benefit to patients 
and shareholders. 
The success of our business model 
depends on the creation and protection  
of our IP rights. Developing a new medicine 
is risky, costly and time consuming and 
requires significant investment over many 
years, with no guarantee of success. For 
investments to be viable for our business 
and shareholders, we must protect new 
medicines from being copied for a 
reasonable period of time. 
The loss of key product patents has affected 
sales significantly in recent years and will 
continue to do so. As such, one of our main 
goals is to sustain the cycle of innovation 
and continually refresh our portfolio of 
patented products.
Outputs
Returns to shareholders
Revenue from the sale of our medicines 
generates cash flow, which helps us  
fund business investment. It also enables  
us to follow our progressive dividend policy 
and meet our debt service obligations.  
This involves balancing the interests of  
our business, financial creditors and 
shareholders. 
 Financial Review from page 70
Improved health
Continuous scientific innovation is vital  
to achieving sustainable healthcare and 
creating value. Innovation creates value, 
for example, by
 > improving health outcomes and 
transforming patients’ lives
 > enabling healthcare systems to reduce 
costs and increase efficiency
 > improving access to healthcare and 
healthcare infrastructure
 > helping develop the communities in  
which we operate through local 
employment and partnering.

benefit and safety, and 
establish pricing and/or 
reimbursement
Conduct studies, 
typically in large patient 
groups, designed to 
confirm the efficacy of, 
and gather additional 
safety information for, the 
medicine and evaluate 
the overall risk/benefit 
profile in the specific 
disease and proposed 
patient segments against 
the profile and goals
Create appropriate 
branding for the launch  
of the new medicine
Seek approval from regulatory 
authorities to manufacture, market  
and sell the medicine
Submit clinical data package that 
demonstrates the medicine’s safety 
profile and efficacy to regulatory 
authorities
Regulatory authorities decide  
whether to grant approval based on  
the medicine’s safety profile, efficacy 
and quality. In some countries, a  
pricing decision must also be made 
comparing the new medicine to 
existing alternative therapies
If there are gaps in understanding 
about the medicine at the time  
of approval, regulatory authorities  
may request further data collection, 
increasingly in real-world clinical 
settings
Raise awareness of patient benefit 
and appropriate use, and market  
and sell the medicine
Clinicians begin to prescribe medicine 
and patients begin to benefit 
Continuously monitor, record and 
analyse reported side effects. 
Determine whether to update the 
side effect warnings to help ensure 
patient safety
Assess real-world effectiveness and 
opportunities to support patients and 
prescribers to achieve maximum 
benefit from the medicine
Conduct studies to further 
understand the benefit/risk profile 
of the medicine in larger and/or 
additional patient populations
Conduct life-cycle management 
activities to realise the medicine’s  
full potential and work to identify 
additional diseases or aspects of 
disease that may be treated by the 
medicine or better administration 
methods. Submit data packages with 
requests for life-cycle management  
to regulatory authorities for review  
and approval
Typically, when patents and  
other exclusivities protecting the 
medicine expire, generic versions 
of the medicine enter the market

Continuing recovery 
The global economy continues to  
recover from the 2008/2009 financial crisis. 
Risks remain, however, and geopolitical 
developments could threaten more 
balanced, sustainable growth.
As shown in the table opposite, global 
pharmaceutical sales grew by 8.3% in 2014. 
Established Markets saw average revenue 
growth of 7 .3% while Emerging Markets’ 
revenue growth was 58% higher at 1 1.6%. 
The US, Japan, China, Germany and France 
are the world’s top five pharmaceutical 
markets. In 2014, the US had 40.4% of 
global sales (2013: 39. 1%; 2012: 40.2%). 
While demand for healthcare continues to 
increase – a favourable trend for long-term 
industry growth – challenges remain.  
Such challenges include expiring patents, 
competition from and growing use of 
generic medicines, obtaining regulatory 
approval, securing reimbursement for new 
medicines, improving R&D productivity  
and attaining pricing and sales sufficient  
to generate revenue and sustain the cycle  
of innovation. 
Competition
Our industry remains highly competitive.  
It includes large, research-based 
pharmaceutical companies (such as 
AstraZeneca) that discover, develop  
and sell innovative, patent-protected 
prescription medicines and vaccines, 
smaller biotechnology and vaccine 
businesses, and companies that produce 
generic medicines. While many of our peers 
face similar challenges, they tackle them  
in different ways. Some companies have 
pursued a strategy focused on branded 
prescription pharmaceuticals while others 
have diversified by acquiring or building 
branded generics businesses or consumer 
portfolios. A number of companies are 
focused on improving R&D productivity  
and operational efficiency, while others  
have expanded geographically, especially in 
Emerging Markets and Japan. Throughout 
the industry, business development, 
including licensing and collaborations,  
and competition for business development 
opportunities, increased in 2014.
The industry shift away from developing 
primary care medicines continued, with  
an increased emphasis on oncology and 
other specialty care diseases with high 
unmet medical need. In 2014, primary care 
medicines only accounted for approximately 
one-quarter of new FDA-approved NMEs.
Growth drivers
Expanding patient populations 
The world’s population is expected to rise 
from some seven billion today to nine billion 
by 2050. Also increasing is the number of 
people accessing healthcare and healthcare 
spending, particularly by the elderly. In the 
five years to 2018, the number of people 
over the age of 65 will rise by some 
83 million, constituting almost 30% of  
the world’s population growth.
As the diagram overleaf shows, we  
expect developing markets to continue to 
spearhead pharmaceutical growth. Sales 
are expected to rise at double-digit rates 
across much of Asia, Latin America and 
Africa. Sales in the US grew in 2014 for  
the first time in two years.
Despite global economic, political and 
social challenges, the pharmaceutical 
industry is expected to enjoy long-
term growth due to favourable 
demographic trends and significant 
unmet medical need.

14 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Technological breakthroughs in the design 
and testing of novel compounds present 
fresh opportunities for using small 
molecules as the basis for new medicines. 
The use of large molecules, or biologics,  
has also become an important source of 
innovation. Biologics are among the most 
commercially successful new products. By 
2020, biologics are expected to account for 
more than half of the world’s top 100 
pharmaceutical products. In 2013, the figure 
was 45%, having risen from 21% in 2006. 
As such, most pharmaceutical companies 
now pursue R&D in both small molecules 
and biologics.
The challenges 
R&D productivity
Improving R&D productivity is a critical 
challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. 
Global R&D investment reached an 
estimated $141 billion in 2014, a 31% 
increase from $108 billion in 2006. While  
the growth rate of R&D spend has slowed  
in recent years, pharmaceutical companies 
continue to deliver new medicines. In 2014, 
the FDA approved 41 NMEs – the highest 
number in 18 years (2013: 27).
To ensure sustainable returns on R&D 
investment, the industry is working to 
increase its success rate in developing 
commercially viable new drugs while 
achieving a lower, more flexible cost base. 
Regulators and payers, however, are 
demanding greater evidence of comparative 
effectiveness of medicines, which increases 
development times and costs. 
Fortunately, innovative technology is helping 
accelerate product approvals. A greater 
emphasis on Proof of Concept is also 
helping improve productivity and reduce 
costs by showing the potential efficacy of 
drugs earlier in the development process.
Unmet medical need 
The prevalence of non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs), such as cancer and 
cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory 
diseases, is increasing worldwide.  
NCDs are often associated with ageing 
populations and lifestyle choices, including 
smoking, diet and lack of exercise – and 
many require long-term management. In 
2012, NCDs accounted for 68% of deaths 
globally; nearly three-quarters of these 
deaths were in low- and middle-income 
countries. By 2030, deaths from 
cardiovascular diseases are likely to rise  
to 23.3 million annually. Annual cancer 
cases are forecast to increase from 
14 million in 2012 to 22 million worldwide 
over the next 20 years.
Advances in science and technology 
Innovation is critical to addressing unmet 
medical need. The delivery of new 
medicines will rely on a more advanced 
understanding of disease and the use of 
new technology and approaches, such  
as personalised healthcare (PHC) and 
predictive science. 
The global economy 
continues to recover

Regulatory requirements
A highly regulated industry reflects public 
demand for safe, effective and high-quality 
medicines. Delivering such medicines 
requires responsible testing, manufacturing 
and marketing, as well as maintaining 
important relationships worldwide with 
regulatory authorities. Such authorities 
include the FDA in the US, the EMA in  
the EU, the PMDA in Japan and the CFDA  
in China. 
There is a global trend towards greater 
transparency of, and public access to, the 
regulatory submissions that support the 
approvals of new medicines. A recent 
example is the new EMA policy on 
publication of clinical data for medicinal 
products for human use, which provides  
for the publication of clinical reports that 
underpin the EMA’s decision making.
In 2014, several regulatory authorities 
introduced regulatory frameworks for the 
registration of biosimilar products. In most 
countries, these frameworks impose robust 
standards to ensure product safety, efficacy 
and quality. For more information about 
biosimilars, please see Patent expiries and 
genericisation opposite.
Increasingly, regulation and policy are  
aimed at fostering innovation. In the US, for 
example, the 21st Century Cures initiative,  
a bipartisan effort driven by the Energy and 
Commerce Committee of the US House of 
Representatives, is focused on accelerating 
the discovery, development and delivery of 
promising new treatments for patients. Draft 
legislation is expected to be introduced 
in 2015. 
In Japan, the SAKIGAKE strategy is 
fostering a more favourable environment 
for drug development and accelerating 
the availability of currently unapproved 
medicines for serious and life-threatening 
diseases. The EU is currently piloting  
a programme to implement ‘adaptive 
licensing’ approaches, or ‘staggered 
approval’, to improve timely patient access 
to new medicines. In contrast, recent 
changes in China’s regulatory review 
process are lengthening new medicine 
approval periods to as long as five years, 
challenging the ability of pharmaceutical 
companies to deliver life-changing 
medicines and treat unmet medical need 
in China. However, proposed revisions to 
China’s Drug Administration Law, which  
are currently under review, may address 
this issue.
Despite efforts to harmonise regulations 
and achieve global convergence, regulations 
and their impact are increasing worldwide. 
Clinical trials that support product 
registration in a regulated jurisdiction must 
be relevant to the population and many 
countries require the inclusion of local 
patients in multinational studies. This can 
increase development complexity and 
costs. Also, regulatory authorities continue 
to implement new requirements and 
processes for patient safety data pre- 
and post-approval and to demand risk 
management plans and tailored post-
approval commitments.
The growing complexity and globalisation of 
clinical studies, combined with pressure on 
industry and healthcare budgets, have led to 
an increase in public-private consortia. Such 
consortia, which include industry, academia

innovation, streamline regulatory processes 
and define and clarify approval requirements 
for new technology and approaches.
Pricing pressure 
Pricing and reimbursement remain 
challenging in many markets. Most 
pharmaceutical sales are generated in 
highly regulated markets where 
governments, insurers and other private 
payers exert various controls on pricing  
and reimbursement, such as limitations on 
pharmaceutical spending and readmission 
costs. Austerity programmes are further 
constraining healthcare providers, while 
difficult economic conditions burden 
patients who pay out-of-pocket for 
medicines. Pharmaceutical companies 
must now expend significant resources 
to demonstrate the economic as well as 
therapeutic value of their medicines.
In the US, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has 
had a direct impact on healthcare activities. 
It continues to reshape the market through 
various provisions designed to reduce  
cost and improve healthcare and patient 
outcomes. The ACA’s financial requirements 
include increased and expanded Medicaid 
mandatory rebates, the branded 
prescription drug fee, and efforts to close 
the coverage gap in the Medicare Part D 
prescription drug programme. We, along 
with other pharmaceutical companies, are 
working with policymakers and regulators  
to help contain costs, improve outcomes 
and promote an environment that fosters 
medical and scientific innovation.
Due to the US congressional failure to  
reach an agreement on raising the federal 
debt ceiling, ‘sequestration’ took effect  
in March 2013. Sequestration, which will 
remain in place until 2024, has resulted  
in broad federal spending cuts, including  
a 2% reduction in Medicare payments to 
healthcare providers. This reduction affects 
Medicare reimbursement rates for 
physician-administered products, which,  
in turn, places additional pricing pressure  
on our industry. 
In Europe, governments continue to 
implement drug price control measures, 
including mandatory discounts, clawbacks 
and referencing rules. These measures are 
decreasing drug prices, particularly in the 
distressed economies of Spain, Romania 
and Greece. In France, price negotiations 
are particularly challenging due to budget 
pressures. In Germany, Europe’s largest 
pharmaceutical market, manufacturers  
must now prove the added benefit of their 
drug over existing alternatives. If no added 
benefit is shown, the drug is relegated to  
the German reference pricing system,  
which provides a single reimbursement  
level (or reference) for each drug group.
In China, pricing practices remain a priority 
for regulators. The triennial maximum retail 
drug price review continued in 2013, and,  
in 2014, authorities proposed plans to 
deregulate existing pricing controls and 
increasingly focus on setting and controlling 
reimbursement prices of drugs on the 
Regional and National Drug List. In India,  
the government imposed price controls  
on approximately 100 cardiovascular and 
diabetes drugs, including Crestor . In  
Japan, mandated biennial cuts are likely  
to continue. In Latin America, pricing is 
increasingly controlled by governments  
as, for example, in Colombia.

and reductions and US healthcare reform, please

in our major markets, please see Geographical 
Review from page 220
Patent expiries and genericisation 
Patent protection for pharmaceutical 
products is finite. Patents are expiring  
on some of the biggest-selling drugs ever 
produced and payers, physicians and 
patients have greater access to generic 
alternatives (both substitutable and 
analogue) in many important drug classes. 
These generic alternatives are primarily 
lower priced because generic manufacturers 
are largely spared the costs of R&D and 
market development. As a result, demand 
for generics is high. For prescriptions 
dispensed in the US in 2014, generics 
constituted 83.3% of the market by volume 
(2013: 82.2%). 
Generic competition can also result 
from patent disputes or challenges before 
expiry. Increasingly, generics companies 
are launching products ‘at risk’, for example, 
before resolution of the relevant patent 
litigation. This trend, which is likely to 
continue, creates significant market 
presence for the generic version while the 
litigation remains unresolved. Given the 
unpredictable nature of patent litigation, 
some companies have settled such 
challenges on terms acceptable to the 
innovator and generic manufacturer. 
While competition authorities generally 
accept such agreements as a legitimate 
way to settle these disputes, they have 
questioned some settlements as being 
potentially problematic. 
Biologics typically sustain longer periods 
of exclusivity than traditional small molecule 
pharmaceuticals, with less generic 
competition. With limited experience to date, 
the substitution of biosimilars for the original 
branded product has not followed the same 
pattern as generic substitution in small 
molecule products and, as a result, erosion 
of branded market share has not been as 
rapid. This is due to biologics’ complex 
manufacturing processes and the inherent 
difficulties in producing a biosimilar, which 
could require additional clinical trials. 
However, with regulatory authorities in 
Europe and the US continuing to implement 
abbreviated approval pathways for biosimilar 
versions, innovative biologics are likely to 
face increased competition.
Building trust
The pharmaceutical industry faces 
challenges in building and maintaining  
trust, particularly with governments and 
regulators. This reflects the past decade’s 
legal disputes between pharmaceutical 
companies and governmental and 
regulatory authorities. To address this 
challenge, companies are embedding a 
culture of ethics and integrity, adopting 
higher governance standards and improving 
relationships with employees, shareholders 
and other stakeholders.
Numerous companies, including those  
in the pharmaceutical industry, have been 
investigated by the China Public Security 
Bureau following allegations of bribery, and 
criminal and financial penalties have been 
imposed. Investigations by the DOJ and 
SEC under the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act are also continuing.

Risk overview
What may challenge the delivery of our strategic priorities
We face a diverse range of risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect any one or more parts of our business and the delivery  
of our strategic priorities. Our approach to risk management is designed to encourage clear decision making on which risks we take  
as a business and how we manage risk, informed by an understanding of the potential commercial, financial, compliance, legal and 
reputational implications. We outline below the principal risks that could have a material adverse effect on the business or results of 
operations. We also outline how these risks link to our strategic priorities and some of the risk management actions taken in response. 
 Risk from page 203
Context Specific risks we face Possible impacts Risk management actions Link to strategic priority
Risk: Product pipeline
The development of any pharmaceutical 
product candidate is a complex, risky  
and lengthy process involving significant 
financial, R&D and other resources 
Each project may fail or be delayed at  
any stage of the process due to a number 
of factors
 > Failure to meet development targets
 > Difficulties obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new products 
 > Failure to obtain and enforce effective IP protection 
 > Delay to new product launches 
 > Acquisitions and strategic alliances, including licensing and collaborations, may be unsuccessful
 > Reduced 
long-term growth, 
revenue and profit

Governance and Remuneration
We seek to create sustainable growth in shareholder value by developing 
and executing a remuneration strategy that supports the successful 
implementation of our business strategy.
The progress and success of our business strategy will be measured 
against three key areas: Achieve scientific leadership; Return to growth; and 
Achieve Group financial targets. During 2014, the Remuneration Committee 
reviewed the Group’s short- and long-term performance incentive plans  
for the Executive Directors and senior management to ensure that they 
supported the delivery of these goals.
The key components of our remuneration strategy for Executive Directors 
are set out here. 
Governance
Remuneration 
The Board
Chairman: Leif Johansson  
Senior independent Non-Executive Director: John Varley
Directors are collectively responsible for the success of 
AstraZeneca. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors are 
responsible for exercising independent and objective judgement 
and for scrutinising and challenging management.
The Board is responsible for setting our strategy and policies, 
oversight of risk and corporate governance and monitoring 
progress towards meeting our annual plans. It is accountable to  
our shareholders for the proper conduct of the business and our 
long-term success and represents the interests of all stakeholders.
The Board has delegated some of its powers to four principal 
committees and the CEO.
Members of the Board and their biographies are shown on the 
pages overleaf.
Nomination and 
Governance Committee
Chairman: Leif Johansson
Talented people are critical to  
the delivery of the Group’s 
strategy. The Nomination and 
Governance Committee’s role  
is to recommend new Board 
appointments to the Board and 
to consider, more broadly, 
succession planning to senior 
executive management and 
Board positions. The Nomination 
and Governance Committee 
also advises the Board on 
significant developments in 
corporate governance.
Audit Committee
Chairman: Rudy Markham
To deliver the Group’s strategy, 
we must have sound financial 
and non-financial controls. The 
Audit Committee is responsible 
for reviewing our financial 
reporting, internal controls, 
compliance with laws and our 
relationship with our external 
auditor, as well as risk 
management.
Good governance is crucial to ensuring we are well managed and can deliver our strategic priorities

Remuneration Committee
Chairman: John Varley
We seek to attract, retain and 
develop the highest-calibre 
talent while paying no more than 
is necessary. The Group’s 
short- and long-term incentive 
plans are closely linked to our 
strategic and financial goals,  
and the delivery of sustainable 
shareholder value. The 
Remuneration Committee  
is responsible for the Group’s 
remuneration policy, which 
supports the delivery of  
our strategy.
Science Committee
Chairman: Nancy Rothwell
Achieving scientific leadership  
is key to our strategic success. 
The Science Committee 
provides assurance to the  
Board regarding the Group’s 
R&D activities by reviewing  
and assessing our approaches 
in our chosen therapy areas;  
the scientific technology and 
R&D capabilities we deploy;  
the quality and development  
of our scientists; and our 
decision making.
CEO: Pascal Soriot
The Senior Executive Team

The SET is the body through 
which the CEO exercises the 
authority delegated to him by  
the Board. It considers major 
business issues and makes 
recommendations to the CEO, 
and typically reviews matters that 
are to be submitted to the Board 
for its consideration. The CEO is

Strategic Report Strategic Report > Therapy Area Review
Therapy Area Overview
Our business model describes how we create and sustain value over the life-cycle of a 
medicine across our therapy areas. In this section, we review our therapy areas, including 
our portfolio of marketed products, pipeline projects, strategic priorities, capabilities, 
resources and business development activities. 
As outlined in Strategic priorities from  
page 18, a key element of our drive  
to achieve scientific leadership is our  
focus on innovative science in three main 
therapy areas: Cardiovascular and 
Metabolic diseases (CVMD); Oncology;  
and Respiratory, Inflammation and 
Autoimmunity (RIA). We apply our distinctive 
capabilities to biologics, small molecules, 
immunotherapies, protein engineering 
technologies and delivery devices across 
our therapy areas to deliver life-changing 
medicines to patients and create value for 
shareholders. Our approach to Infection, 
Neuroscience and Gastrointestinal (ING)  
is opportunity-driven.
Our therapy area activities are led by our 
Global Product and Portfolio Strategy  
group (GPPS), which serves as the bridge 
between our R&D and Commercial 
functions. GPPS works to provide strategic 
direction from early-stage research to 
commercialisation, and to integrate our 
corporate, portfolio, therapy area and 
product strategies to drive scientific 
innovation, prioritise investment, support  
the growth of our therapy areas, and 
accelerate business development. GPPS 
also works closely with healthcare providers, 
regulatory authorities and payers to ensure 
our medicines help fulfil unmet medical 
need and provide economic as well as 
therapeutic benefits. 
Development pipeline
The Pipeline overview on the left 
summarises our development pipeline  
as at 31 December 2014.
During 2014, we progressed numerous 
projects into clinical and late-stage 
development. Across the portfolio, 50 
projects successfully progressed to their 
next phase in 2014. This includes 14 NME 
clinical progressions, and four first approvals 
and two first launches in the EU, China, 
Japan and/or the US. Five NMEs 
commenced Phase III/pivotal Phase II 
studies as a result of the acceleration of 
select R&D programmes. Twenty one 
projects (inclusive of combination trials) 
entered Phase I. The Pipeline progressions 
table opposite summarises our key pipeline 
progressions in 2014. Further information  
is in the Development pipeline table from 
page 197 .
Nine projects were discontinued in 2014 – 
eight projects for poorer than anticipated 
safety or efficacy results and one for 
economic reasons.
Progress against targets
We continued to strengthen our late-stage 
pipeline in 2014 through R&D, collaborations, 
acquisitions and licensing. We also made 
significant progress against the pipeline 
targets we set in March 2013. Since March 
2013, we have initiated nine Phase III/pivotal 
Phase II NME starts against a target of  
five to seven. We now have 13 NMEs in  
Phase III/pivotal Phase II studies or under 
regulatory review, which exceeds our target 
of nine to ten NMEs in Phase III/pivotal 
Phase II studies or under regulatory review 
by 2016. 
Having strengthened our late-stage pipeline, 
we are now focused on securing regulatory 
approvals for these NMEs and delivering our 
medicines to patients. We are also focused 
on strengthening our early-stage pipeline.  
To reflect our focus, as communicated at 
our Investor Day in November 2014, we 
have set the following targets for the end of 
2016: 12 to 16 Phase II starts; 14 to 16 NME 
and line extension regulatory submissions; 
and 8 to 10 NME and line extension 
regulatory approvals.

development, please see Risk from page 203
Biologics and specialty care medicines
Nearly 50% of our pipeline is comprised  
of biologics, including more than 30 
molecules in clinical development. As 
detailed in Infrastructure on page 69, the 
expansion of our Frederick, Maryland 
US facility will help us keep pace with an 
increasing demand for the development 
and use of biologics and support the 
progression of drug candidates across our 
main therapy areas. Much of our biologics 
work focuses on specifically defined or

32 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 biologically targeted populations, 
determined by the scientific pathway of  
the disease and mode of action of the 
molecule. Our pipeline also contains a 
number of specialty care medicines.  
An increasing number of specialty care 
medicines require a diagnostic test for 
patient eligibility or to achieve the best 
outcomes. Specialty care medicines 
generally treat more severe diseases, with 
the patient population concentrated under 
the care of a subset of healthcare providers 
and in specialty healthcare facilities. 
Specialty care medicines also generally 
command higher prices and, as such,  
must deliver greater value. To make them 
available to the right patients, we must 
tightly co-ordinate our commercial,  
medical and supply chain teams.

Our strategic priorities
We are a leader in the treatment of CVMD, 
focused on bringing life-changing medicines 
to patients for thrombosis (blood clotting), 
atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), 
dyslipidaemia, hypertension and metabolic 
diseases, including diabetes and related 
complications.
Despite improvements in the diagnosis and 
treatment of CVMD, unmet medical need 
remains high. Also, the prevalence of these 
diseases and associated complications is 
increasing worldwide. 
Our strategy in CVMD focuses on 
maximising and maintaining patient benefit 
from our portfolio of medicines, ensuring 
access to Brilinta/Brilique and accelerating 
clinical programmes and potential new 
therapies through innovative science  
and collaboration.
We are also investing heavily in clinical 
development and life-cycle management. 
Nearly 60,000 patients participate in  
our R&D-led CV trials at more than  
5,700 sites worldwide. We are also  
focusing on diabetes research, which 
includes more than 50 clinical studies 
worldwide in which nearly 40,000 patients 
are expected to be enrolled. 
We are expanding our core capabilities and 
research programmes into new modalities 
and regenerative medicine to provide new 
treatment paradigms for heart failure, 
diabetes and chronic kidney disease. 
To help achieve scientific leadership, we  
are engaging in collaborations that focus  
on scientific innovation in CV, metabolic and 
renal diseases. For example, during 2014, 
we entered into collaborations with 
 > Max Planck Institute of Molecular 
Physiology to create a satellite unit to 
study areas of new modality chemistry

Cardiovascular disease 
Hypertension (high blood pressure) and 
dyslipidaemia (abnormal levels of blood 
lipids) damage the arterial wall, which leads 
to atherosclerosis. Lipid-modifying therapy, 
primarily statins, is the primary treatment for 
atherosclerosis.
Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) is an 
umbrella term for sudden chest pain and 
other symptoms due to insufficient blood 
supply (ischaemia) to the heart. ACS is 
associated with considerable mortality and 
morbidity and a significant need exists to 
improve patient outcomes and reduce 
treatment costs.
We are a leader in the treatment  
of CVMD focused on bringing life- 
changing medicines to patients
Our 2014 focus
Brilinta/Brilique, one of our growth platforms, 
is an oral antiplatelet treatment for ACS in a 
new chemical class called cyclo-pentyl-
triazolo-pyrimidines, which are selective 
Lastly, in January 2015, we announced  
that the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 study, a large- 
scale outcomes trial involving over 21,000 
patients under the PARTHENON 
programme, successfully met its primary 
efficacy endpoint. The study investigated 
two doses of Brilinta/Brilique on  
a background of low-dose aspirin versus 
placebo plus low-dose aspirin, in patients 
aged 50 and older with a history of heart 
attack and one additional CV risk factor.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was a 
composite of CV death, MI or stroke.  
While full evaluation of the data is ongoing, 
preliminary analysis did not reveal any 
unexpected safety issues. The results build 
on our understanding of the benefits of 
Brilinta/Brilique for patients with ACS and 
offer important clinical insights into its 
potential role for the longer-term prevention 
of CV events.
Crestor is approved in 109 countries  
for the treatment of dyslipidaemia and 
hypercholesterolaemia. In some markets,  
it is also indicated to slow the progression  
of atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of  
first CV events. Crestor has been shown  
to more effectively lower low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL -C) (so-called ‘bad 
cholesterol’) and achieve LDL -C goals than 
other statins, and to increase high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C) (so-called 
‘good cholesterol’) and reduce 
atherosclerotic plaque. Crestor , however, 
faces competition from atorvastatin (Lipitor) 
and other generic products, and patents 
protecting Crestor have been challenged in 
various jurisdictions. Details of these matters 
are included in Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements, from page 182.
adenosine diphospate (ADP) receptor 
antagonists that act on the P2Y12 
ADP-receptor. Brilinta/Brilique is approved  
in over 100 countries, including the US, 
Canada and Brazil under the trade name 
Brilinta, and in the EU, Iceland and Norway 
under the trade name Brilique. It is currently 
under regulatory review in three additional 
countries. Brilinta/Brilique is the first P2Y12 
receptor antagonist that also increases local 
endogenous adenosine levels by inhibiting 
ENT-1. Since launch, more than one million 
patients have been treated with Brilinta/
Brilique, and it has been included in 13 
major ACS treatment guidelines globally. 
There were several important developments 
for Brilinta/Brilique in 2014. In July, the EMA 
updated the EU Summary of Product 
Characteristics providing further regulatory 
validation that Brilinta/Brilique differs from 
thienopyridines in its mode of action and  
by offering flexible oral administration. In 
August, the DOJ confirmed that it was 
closing its investigation into PLATO, a 
Brilinta/Brilique clinical trial. The closure of 
the investigation, which related to a 2013 
civil investigative demand, reaffirms our 
confidence in Brilinta/Brilique and the 
integrity of the PLATO trial, and allows us  
to focus on delivering the full potential of 
Brilinta/Brilique to patients. In September, 
results from the Phase IV ATLANTIC study 
indicated that the profile of Brilinta/Brilique  
is comparable whether administered in a 
pre-hospital or in-hospital setting to ST 
segment elevation myocardial infarction 
(STEMI) patients. These results allow us to 
better understand the role of Brilinta/Brilique 
in treating STEMI patients and indicate that 
Brilinta/Brilique may be initiated in STEMI 
patients pre-hospital or in-hospital with no 
adverse impact on bleeding. In addition,  
in September 2014, the American Heart 
Association (AHA) and the American 
College of Cardiology (ACC) updated  
their guidelines for the management of 
non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome 
(NSTE-ACS) patients to support Brilinta  
as the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor for the 
management of NSTE-ACS patients who 
undergo an early invasive or ischaemia-
guided strategy, or those who receive a 
coronary stent. This is the first time the  
AHA and ACC have recommended one  
oral antiplatelet over another in the treatment 
of ACS.

Despite generic competition, Atacand 
remains an important treatment for 
hypertension and symptomatic heart  
failure. It is approved for hypertension in 
more than 100 countries and symptomatic 
heart failure in more than 80 countries. 
Atacand Plus (candesartan cilexetil/
hydrochlorothiazide), which is approved  
in more than 100 countries, is an FDC of 
Atacand and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide 
for the treatment of hypertension in  
patients who require more than one 
anti-hypertensive therapy.
In May 2014, the FDA approved Epanova 
(omega-3-carboxylic acids) as an adjunct  
to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in  
adults with severe hypertriglyceridaemia 
(triglyceride levels greater than or equal  
to 500mg/dL). Epanova is the first FDA- 
approved prescription omega-3 in free fatty 
acid form and the first prescription omega-3 
in the US to have a dosing option as few  
as two capsules once a day. 
Clinical studies 
In addition to the PEGASUS trial described 
above, Brilinta/Brilique is being studied  
in four other clinical trials under the 
PARTHENON programme. PARTHENON  
is AstraZeneca’s largest ever CV outcomes 
programme, involving nearly 80,000 patients 
at high risk of CV events (MI, stroke and/or 
CV death) due to their underlying disease.  
It includes five key studies covering broad 
patient populations across varying 
timescales and aims to support four new 
indications for Brilinta/Brilique over the  
next four years. 
  PARTHENON programme case study  
on page 51 
Also in 2014, we initiated the STRENGTH 
trial, a large, long-term outcomes trial 
involving 13,000 patients to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of Epanova on CV 
outcomes in combination with statin therapy 
in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia who 
are at increased risk of CV disease. As the 
largest CV outcomes trial of any prescription 
omega-3, STRENGTH may provide 
important insights into the impact of 
lowering triglycerides with Epanova. 
Metabolic and renal diseases
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic 
progressive disease that accounts for  
more than 90% of diabetes cases 
worldwide. Disease prevalence continues  
to grow, particularly among those at a 
younger age, and many patients require 
multiple medications.
Various oral generic and branded 
treatments, such as biguanides and 
sulfonylureas, exist. Newer classes of 
treatments, such as DPP-4 inhibitors, 
SGLT-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like  
peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, however,  
are successfully entering the market.  
The CV safety of these new classes has 
been the subject of recent regulatory 
reviews and guidance documents.
Our 2014 focus
In February 2014, we completed the 
acquisition of the entirety of BMS’s interest 
in our joint diabetes alliance. By obtaining 
the IP and global rights for the development, 
manufacture and commercialisation of  
the diabetes business, which includes 
Onglyza, Kombiglyze XR, Komboglyze, 
Farxiga/Forxiga, Xigduo, Xigduo XR,  
Byetta, Bydureon, Myalept and Symlin, we 
enhanced our primary care and specialty 
care portfolio and geographical reach.  
We now have one of the broadest 
non-insulin anti-diabetic portfolios with 
products in three growing classes of 
diabetes treatments (DPP-4, SGLT-2 and 
GLP-1). For more information about this 
acquisition, please see Note 24 to the 
Financial Statements from page 170.
Also in 2014, we entered into an agreement 
with Aegerion to divest Myalept, an orphan 
product indicated to treat complications of 
leptin deficiency in patients with generalised 
lipodystrophy. Under the terms of the 
agreement, Aegerion will pay AstraZeneca 
$325 million to acquire the global rights to 
develop, manufacture and commercialise 
Myalept, subject to an existing distributor 
licence with Shionogi covering Japan,  
South Korea and Taiwan. Our divestment  
of Myalept reinforces our focus on our 
strategic priorities and enables us to 
concentrate our resources on disease areas 
where we can provide the greatest benefit 
to patients.
Farxiga/Forxiga (dapagliflozin) is a 
first-in-class SGLT-2 inhibitor indicated as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise in combination 
with other glucose-lowering medicinal 
products, including insulin, or as a 
monotherapy for the treatment of Type 2 
diabetes mellitus. In 2014, we secured 
approval for dapagliflozin in the US (where  
it is called Farxiga) and Japan (where it is 
called Forxiga). Starting with the EU in  
2012 (where it is called Forxiga), it is now 
approved in over 50 countries. It is under 
regulatory review in 20 additional countries. 
Xigduo (dapagliflozin and metformin 
hydrochloride) was approved in January 
2014 in the EU as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise to improve glycaemic control in 
347 million people worldwide have diabetes; 
WHO projects that diabetes will be the 
seventh leading cause of death in 2030.

diabetes mellitus who are inadequately 
controlled on their current metformin-based 
treatment regimen or are being treated  
with dapagliflozin and metformin separately. 
Xigduo is approved in 33 countries, 
including the US with Xigduo XR (November 
2014) – the first and only once daily  
SGLT-2 inhibitor and extended release 
metformin FDC.
In the pipeline 
We are developing an FDC of saxagliptin 
and dapagliflozin, which combines two 
complementary mechanisms designed to 
help more patients reach their treatment 
goals. In May 2014, we reported results of 
the first clinical trial of this novel combination, 
which demonstrated powerful glucose 
lowering and allowed more than twice as 
many patients to reach the recognised 
glucose goal than either agent alone. We 
submitted an NDA to the FDA in December 
2014 and expect to submit a regulatory filing 
in the EU in 2015.
In 2014, we continued to develop delivery 
systems for Bydureon and secured approval 
for the Bydureon Pen in the US and EU. The 
Bydureon Pen is a pre-filled, single-use pen 
injector that eliminates the need to transfer 
the medication between a vial and syringe 
during the self-injection process. It was 
successfully launched in the US in 
September 2014 and is expected to 
launch in the EU in early 2015. We are also 
developing a once weekly suspension of 
Bydureon to be used in an autoinjector 
device. The Phase III programme for this 
asset continues to progress and the first 
data was presented in 2014.
Through our strategic collaboration  
with FibroGen, we continue to develop 
roxadustat, a first-in-class oral compound 
for the treatment of anaemia associated  
with chronic kidney disease (CKD)  
and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  
In Phase II clinical studies in the US, 
roxadustat met its primary objectives  
and an extensive roxadustat Phase III 
development programme is currently 
underway. Phase III trials are planned  
in China, and we expect to submit 
regulatory filings in China in 2016 and  
in the US in 2018.
We are also developing tenapanor, a 
first-in-class inhibitor of NHE-3, a sodium 
transporter in the gut, with Ardelyx, Inc.  
for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia  
and CKD. If development is successful, 
tenapanor may fulfil a significant unmet 
medical need for patients with CKD by 
delaying the progression of CKD to ESRD, 
and reducing mortality and morbidity. 
Tenapanor is also being studied as a 
treatment for irritable bowel syndrome  
with constipation.
Clinical studies 
The CV outcome study SAVOR-TIMI 53 
(Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular 
Outcomes Recorded in Patients with  
Type 2 diabetes mellitus) was completed in 
September 2013, making Onglyza one of 
the most extensively studied anti-diabetic 
medications. The trial involved 16,500 adult 
patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus with a 
history of established CV disease or multiple 
risk factors. The trial also fulfilled an FDA 
post-marketing requirement. In this study, 
Onglyza met the primary safety objective of 
non-inferiority but did not meet the primary 
efficacy objective of superiority. In July 2014, 
the EMA updated the EU label to include 
these study results. Other regulatory 
authorities are currently reviewing the data. 
DECLARE, a large CV outcomes trial to 
assess the impact of Farxiga/Forxiga on  
CV risk/benefit, continued in 2014. This trial 
evaluates whether Farxiga/Forxiga (10mg), 
when added to a patient’s current 
anti-diabetes therapy, reduces CV events 
such as MI, ischaemic stroke and 
CV-related death, compared with placebo. 
The trial will enrol approximately 17 ,000 adult 
patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and  
is expected to be completed in 2019. 
Results from the Phase II study of Farxiga/
Forxiga as compared with placebo in 
patients with Type 1 diabetes were 
published in September 2014. These  
results demonstrated reductions in 24-hour 
average glucose levels and glycaemic 
variability, as well as a pharmacokinetic 
profile similar to that of patients with Type 2 
diabetes mellitus. In November 2014, we 
commenced a Phase III trial for Farxiga/
Forxiga in patients with Type 1 diabetes.
The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular 
Event Lowering (EXSCEL) study also

What science can do
Circulating tumour DNA
We have pioneered the use of 
circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in 
the diagnosis of cancer. Pieces of 
DNA break off from a tumour and 
circulate in the bloodstream. Highly 
advanced methods are used to 
interrogate these tiny quantities of 
DNA so that doctors gain information 
specific to a patient’s tumour to 
determine the most appropriate 
treatment through a non-invasive 
blood test.
40 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Strategic Report > Therapy Area Review
Oncology
 > Nolvadex (tamoxifen citrate) is a widely used breast 
cancer treatment outside the US.
 > Lynparza (olaparib) is an oral poly ADP-ribose 
polymerase (PARP) inhibitor approved in the EU for 
the treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive 
relapsed BRCA-mutated (germline and/or somatic) 
high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube  
or primary peritoneal cancer. It is approved in the  
US for the treatment of patients with germline 
BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer who  
have been treated with three or more prior lines  
of chemotherapy. 
 > Zoladex (goserelin acetate implant), in one and  
three month subcutaneous or intra-muscular 
injections, is a luteinising hormone-releasing 
hormone (LHRH) agonist used to treat prostate 
cancer, breast cancer and certain benign 
gynaecological disorders. It has been shown to 
improve overall survival, both when used in addition 
to radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy and  
offers proven survival benefits for breast cancer 
patients with a favourable tolerability profile. It is 
approved in more than 130 countries.
Our strategic priorities
For more than 40 years, we have developed 
cancer drugs, many of which have increased 
survival rates for patients around the world. 
Today, we offer various hormone-based  
and targeted cancer therapies and are 
developing novel personalised and 
combination treatments to create significant 
value for patients and shareholders. 
Significant unmet medical need remains 
however, for therapies that increase survival, 
cure rates and time to recurrence. Our vision 
is to help meet this need by redefining the 
cancer treatment paradigm through 
scientific innovation, accelerated clinical 
programmes and collaboration. In January 
2015, oncology became our sixth growth 
platform with several potential submissions 
in 2015 and 2016. We aim to deliver six  
new cancer therapies by 2020, and 15 new 
NMEs and 20 new line extensions by 2023. 
Our broad pipeline of next-generation 
medicines targets four main disease areas 
– breast, ovarian, lung and haematological 
cancers – through four key platforms: 
immunotherapy, tumour drivers and 
resistance mechanisms, DNA damage 
repair and antibody-drug conjugates. 
Our marketed products
 > Arimidex (anastrozole) is an aromatase inhibitor 
used to treat breast cancer and has been shown to 
be significantly superior to tamoxifen at preventing 
breast cancer recurrence during and beyond the 
five-year treatment course. 
 > Caprelsa (vandetanib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated 
to treat aggressive and symptomatic medullary 
thyroid cancer (MTC) in patients with unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic disease.
 > Casodex (bicalutamide) is an anti-androgen therapy 
used to treat prostate cancer. It is used as a 50mg 
tablet for advanced prostate cancer and as a 150mg 
tablet for locally advanced prostate cancer. 
 > Faslodex (fulvestrant) is an injectable estrogen 
receptor antagonist used to treat hormone  
receptor positive metastatic breast cancer in 
post-menopausal women with disease progression 
following anti-estrogen therapy.
 > Iressa (gefitinib) is an epidermal growth factor 
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that acts 
to block signals for cancer cell growth and survival  
in EGFR mutation-positive (EGFR M+) advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
We have a deep-rooted heritage in oncology, which became our sixth 
growth platform in January 2015. Our vision is to help patients by redefining 
the cancer treatment paradigm.

Strategic Report Strategic Report > Therapy Area Review
Oncology continued
In 2014, we strengthened our portfolio  
and accelerated clinical programmes 
through acquisitions and collaborations.  
We acquired Definiens, a pioneer in  
imaging and data analysis technology that 
significantly improves the identification  
of biomarkers in tumour tissue. Using 
biomarkers to select patients for clinical  
trials may shorten clinical timelines, increase 
response rates and help advance the most 
promising combination therapies in our 
pipeline. For more information about this 
acquisition, please see Note 24 to the 
Financial Statements from page 170. 
We also entered into numerous 
collaborations with biotechnology and 
diagnostic companies and scientific 
institutions to strengthen our research and 
technology capabilities, achieve scientific 
leadership and deliver life-changing 
medicines. 
Our 2014 focus
Our marketed oncology products  
generated sales of more than $3 billion 
worldwide in 2014 and we continue to 
explore ways to maximise the benefit  
of our medicines for patients.
Iressa was the first EGFR-TKI to be 
approved in advanced NSCLC and is  
now approved in 90 countries. Iressa  
is the leading EGFR-TKI for patients with 
advanced EGFR M+ NSCLC in Europe  
and Asia and is currently under review in  
the US. In September 2014, Iressa became  
the first EGFR-TKI to include blood-based 
diagnostic testing where a suitable tumour 
sample is not available in its European label. 
The technology that uses circulating tumour 
DNA obtained from a blood sample for the 
assessment of EGFR mutation status will 
also be used to develop AZD9291.
Faslodex 500mg is approved in more  
than 80 countries, including the EU, the  
US and Japan. We are currently exploring 
the efficacy and safety of Faslodex 500mg 
compared with Arimidex in the 1st line 
advanced breast cancer setting (hormone-
naïve patients) in the Phase III FALCON trial.
Lynparza is an oral PARP inhibitor approved 
in the EU for the treatment of adult patients 
with platinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA-
mutated (germline and/or somatic) 
high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. 
The EC granted Marketing Authorisation for 
Lynparza in December 2014. It is the first 
 > Immunotherapy Our ambition is to be  
a scientific leader in immunotherapy,  
a promising therapeutic approach that 
harnesses the patient’s own immune 
system to help fight cancer. We are 
working to understand how cancer 
evades the immune system and to identify 
approaches that enhance the immune 
system’s ability to fight cancer.
 > Tumour drivers and resistance 
mechanisms Potent inhibition of genetic 
disease drivers is a clinically validated 
approach to shrink tumours and improve 
progression-free survival. Tumours, 
however, eventually develop resistance  
to these therapies. Our programmes  
seek to develop therapies that target the 
mutations that cause cancer cells to 
proliferate, and resistance mechanisms. 
 > DNA damage repair Exploiting 
mechanisms that selectively damage 
tumour cell DNA is another clinically 
validated approach to shrink tumours  
and improve progression-free survival. 
Our programmes focus on identifying  
and exploiting vulnerabilities unique to 
tumour cells to kill the tumour cells  
while minimising toxicity to the patient.
 > Antibody-drug conjugates The  
use of antibody-drug conjugates is a 
clinically validated, highly potent approach 
that selectively targets cancer cells.  
We seek to combine innovative antibody 
engineering capabilities with cytotoxic 
drug warheads to attack and kill  
the tumour while minimising toxicity  
to the patient. 
We are also focused on identifying and 
developing combination therapies. Our 
immuno-oncology portfolio, which we 
believe is one of the most comprehensive  
in our industry, enables us to explore and 
exploit scientific and biological synergies  
to pursue combinations that improve 
outcomes and maximise patient benefit. 
PARP inhibitor to be approved for patients 
with platinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA-
mutated ovarian cancer. 
Lynparza was approved in the US in 
December 2014 for the treatment of adult 
patients with germline BRCA-mutated 
advanced ovarian cancer who have been 
treated with three or more prior lines of 
chemotherapy. It was approved under the 
FDA’s Accelerated Approval programme 
based on existing objective response  
rate and duration of response data. 
Continued approval for this indication  
in the US is contingent upon verification  
of clinical benefit in ongoing confirmatory 
Phase III trials.
In the pipeline 
Our oncology pipeline strengthened 
significantly in 2014, with six NMEs now in 
late-stage development and another 20 
NMEs in Phases I and II. We also expanded 
several of our projects to incorporate novel 
combinations and various types of cancer.
Tumour drivers and resistance 
mechanisms
 > AZD9291 is a highly selective, irreversible 
inhibitor of the activating sensitising EGFR 
mutation and the resistance mutation 
T790M being investigated for NSCLC.  
In 2014, the FDA granted AZD9291 
breakthrough therapy designation, 
orphan drug and fast track status. The 
breakthrough designation will allow us to 
expedite the development of AZD9291.
 > Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, is being 
investigated in differentiated thyroid 
cancer, NSCLC and KRAS-mutated 
NSCLC. A registration trial in metastatic 
uveal melanoma has begun.
 > AZD4547 , a Fibroblast Growth Factor 
Receptor (FGFR) TKI in Phase II 
development, is being investigated for  
the treatment of bladder cancer.
DNA damage repair
 > Lynparza (olaparib) has commenced 
Phase III trials for adjuvant and metastatic 
BRCA-mutated breast cancers, 
BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer and  
in 2nd line gastric cancer.
 > AZD1775, a WEE1 inhibitor in Phase II 
development, is being investigated in 
ovarian and lung cancers.

immunoconjugate, is being investigated  
in a Phase III study for adult patients  
with hairy cell leukaemia who have not 
responded to, or relapsed after, standard 
therapy.
Immunotherapies
 > MEDI4736, an anti-programmed 
death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) antibody, 
demonstrated durable clinical activity  
and acceptable safety in a Phase I study. 
The results of this study, coupled with  
the pre-clinical data and validation of  
the target, supported the accelerated 
development of MEDI4736 into Phase III 
clinical trials. The late-stage clinical 
programme will evaluate the compound  
in NSCLC and head and neck cancer  
as monotherapy and in combination. 
 > There are almost 30 immuno-oncology 
combination trials underway or planned. 
Of these, MEDI4736 is being studied  
in 12 combination trials, including in 
collaboration with Incyte Corporation  
in a Phase I/II study to evaluate efficacy 
and safety in combination with Incyte 
Corporation’s oral indoleamine

Biologics in the treatment 
of asthma 
 
We are working to improve asthma 
outcomes through the development of 
biologics. Eosinophils are thought to 
be responsible for inflammation and 
asthma attacks in some asthma 
patients. We are developing a biologic 
that binds to a receptor on the surface 
of eosinophils and then recruits 
effector cells to remove eosinophils 
from circulation.

Asthma and COPD 
Asthma is a common and chronic condition 
that affects the lung’s airways. Inflammation 
and narrowing of the airways may cause 
wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness 
and coughing, and asthma is a major cause

asthma has increased over the last 20 years 
and asthma that is not well controlled by 
existing treatments remains a significant 
unmet medical need.
We have made significant progress across the pipeline. We are leveraging

Pulmicort is a leading ICS therapy for 
asthma. It is available for oral inhalation as 
Pulmicort Turbuhaler/Pulmicort Flexhaler, 
and as a nebuliser suspension for children 
or where a pressurised inhaler or dry 
powder formulation is inappropriate as 
Pulmicort Respules. Teva has had an 
exclusive licence to sell a generic version of 
Pulmicort Respules in the US since 2009. 
Pulmicort Respules continues to face 
challenges from generic products. More 
information about litigation relating to 
Pulmicort Respules can be found in Note 27 
to the Financial Statements from page 182.
Through our acquisition of Pearl 
Therapeutics in 2013, we obtained a Phase 
IIb LAMA/LABA combination (PT003) and 
technology that may help develop our 
Phase II triple FDC (PT010) in one device. 
Through our strategic transaction with 
Almirall in November 2014, we acquired 
rights to the on-market product Eklira 
Genuair (a LAMA) and to Duaklir Genuair (a 
combination of aclidinium bromide, a LAMA 
and formoterol fumarate, a LABA), which 
was approved in the EU in November 2014. 
We also acquired Almirall Sofotech GmbH, 
an Almirall subsidiary focused on the 
development of innovative inhalation 
devices. For more information regarding the 
strategic transaction with Almirall, please 
see Note 24 to the Financial Statements 
from page 170. In February 2015, we 
announced an agreement with Actavis  
to acquire the rights to Actavis’s branded 
respiratory business in the US and Canada, 
including the rights to develop and 
commercialise on-market products Tudorza 
Pressair and Daliresp for COPD. We will also 
acquire development rights in the US and 
Canada for the combination of a fixed dose 
of aclidinium with formoterol in dry powder 
inhaler (approved in the EU as Duaklir 
Genuair)

. These transactions have 
strengthened our pipeline, portfolio and 
device capabilities and will help deliver  
new therapies to patients.

Transaction subject to competition law clearances as well

In the pipeline 
We are developing PT003 as a twice daily 
FDC of two components already approved 
and marketed in various formulations in 
many countries – the LAMA glycopyrronium 
and LABA formoterol (a component of 
Symbicort). It is the only LAMA/LABA being 
developed in a pressurised metered-dose 
inhaler (pMDI). Phase III results for PT003 are 
expected in 2015. We are also developing 
PT010 as a twice daily triple combination 
Currently, FDCs of an inhaled corticosteroid 
(ICS) with a long-acting beta 2-agonist 
(LABA) (for example, Symbicort) help treat 
moderate to severe asthma. Our focus is on 
developing targeted therapies for specific 
patient groups, including more severe, 
refractory patients who experience severe  
or frequent exacerbations and a reduced 
quality of life. We are also focused on better 
understanding patient subtypes to tailor 
therapies to various phenotypes and are 
exploring the use of Symbicort dosed ‘as 
needed’ in mild asthma patients.
COPD is a progressive and chronic disease 
that includes various lung conditions, 
including chronic bronchitis, emphysema 
and chronic obstructive airways disease. 
Medication has only a small impact on the 
course of the disease and the prognosis  
for patients remains poor.
COPD treatments aim to slow disease 
progression and control symptoms. 
Deterioration of lung function over time 
usually requires more aggressive treatment, 
including the use of additional treatments to 
manage symptoms. A class of FDCs of a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) 
and a long-acting beta 2-agonist (LABA), 
known as LAMA/LABAs, is being 
developed and likely to be a 1st line therapy 
for symptomatic mild to moderate COPD 
patients who need bronchodilatation and 
are at lower risk of exacerbations.
Our 2014 focus in Respiratory
Our Symbicort products improve the health 
of COPD and asthma patients by providing 
rapid relief of symptoms and long-term 
anti-inflammatory control. We continue to 
invest in this brand and are exploring a new 
indication in mild asthma through the SYGMA 
trial programme, enhancing our inhaled 
devices and patient support programmes, 
and seeking to expand our COPD indications. 
In 2014, two Symbicort analogues were 
approved in Europe. These analogues 
contain the same APIs as Symbicort 
Turbuhaler but differ in terms of device, 
approved countries, dosing regimen, age 
range and strengths. While these analogues 
attained only a small share of the European 
market by the end of 2014, we expect them 
to gain a larger market share in 2015 and 
adversely affect Symbicort Turbuhaler sales. 
For more information on the impact of 
analogues, please see Patent expiries  
and genericisation in Marketplace on  
page 17 and the Geographical Review  
from page 220.
LAMA/LABA/ICS (composed of 
glycopyrronium, formoterol and budesonide, 
a key component of Symbicort) in a pMDI 
device for severe COPD. It is currently in 
Phase II and may be one of the first products 
to deliver the three therapeutic entities  
via one inhaler.
We are also developing benralizumab, 
which depletes eosinophils in the blood  
and airways via a unique mechanism of 
action. Unlike approaches that target the 
interleukin-5 (IL -5) cytokine itself (IL -5 
promotes the accumulation and activation  
of eosinophils), benralizumab binds to the 
alpha subunit of the IL -5 receptor on 
eosinophils, triggering rapid and efficient cell 
death through a process known as antibody 
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In 
2014, we reported that the primary endpoint 
of the Phase II study in COPD had not been 
met. However, based on the identification of 
a subpopulation of patients with elevated 
blood eosinophils in which a benefit was 
indicated, we advanced benralizumab into 
Phase III in COPD. The Phase III programme 
includes two Phase III/pivotal Phase II 
studies, which assess benralizumab in 
patients with moderate to very severe COPD 
with high exacerbation risk. Phase III trials 
for severe asthma are also underway. 
Tralokinumab is an investigational MAb  
that binds to IL -13. Phase II data from 
tralokinumab suggest that IL -13 
neutralisation can improve lung function  
and reduce asthma exacerbation rate in  
a subpopulation of moderate to severe 
asthma patients who are uncontrolled  
with standard of care therapy. In August 
2014, we initiated a Phase III programme  
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
tralokinumab in reducing asthma 
exacerbations in adults and adolescents 
with severe, inadequately controlled asthma.
Other therapies in development include
 > MEDI9929, a first-in-class, Phase IIb  
MAb being developed with Amgen for 
uncontrolled severe asthma. MEDI9929 
binds to thymic stromal lymphopoietin 
(TSLP), an upstream mediator of Th2 
cytokine-induced inflammation, and has 
the potential to treat non-Th2-mediated 
asthma, decrease the Th2/Th1 ratio in 
patients with mild to moderate asthma 
and reprogramme the allergic phenotype

medical need remains. Most emerging 
biologics are likely to be used in combination 
with standard therapies, including 
corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.
Rheumatoid arthritis is currently treated with 
generic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
agents and, where appropriate, biologics. 
Novel treatments are needed, however, as 
only about a third of patients treated with 
biologics achieve their treatment goals. 
Although tumour necrosis factor (TNF) 
alpha-blockers are currently the primary 
treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, use of 
other biologic approaches is expected  
to increase. Novel oral drugs targeting 
intra-cellular signalling pathways may 
provide anti-TNF-like levels of efficacy  
and potentially more convenient dosing, 
especially in patients who do not use 
injectable biologics.
In the pipeline 
In 2014, we focused on strengthening our 
pipeline and improving treatment options 
and clinical outcomes for patients with I&A 
disorders. Completion of two Phase IIb trials 
(sifalimumab and mavrilimumab) and two 
Phase III trials (brodalumab and lesinurad), 
along with the initiation of various Phase II 
trials, demonstrates the success of our R&D 
efforts to deliver new medicines quickly.
In August 2014, we announced positive 
results from the main Phase III trials in gout 
patients for lesinurad, a selective uric acid 
re-absorption inhibitor (SURI) that inhibits  
the URAT1 transporter, increasing uric acid 
excretion and thereby lowering serum  
uric acid (sUA). These trials investigated 
lesinurad in combination with allopurinol  
in gout patients not reaching target sUA 
levels on allopurinol alone (CLEAR1 and 
CLEAR2), and as a combination therapy 
with febuxostat in patients with tophaceous 
gout (CRYSTAL). Lesinurad’s mechanism  
of action provides an opportunity to 
fundamentally change the way gout is 
treated through a combination therapy 
approach with the current standard of care 
(xanthine oxidase inhibitors). Results of the 
CLEAR1/CLEAR2 studies were presented 
at the American College of Rheumatology 
Annual Meeting in November 2014 and 
regulatory filings were submitted in the US 
and EU in December 2014. In January 2015, 
the EMA accepted the MAA for lesinurad 
200mg tablets for review. We expect to 
present full results of CRYSTAL at a 
scientific meeting in 2015.
RDEA3170 is a SURI and our leading gout 
molecule in Asia where we have begun work 
to support its submission as a monotherapy. 
In pre-clinical and Phase I clinical studies, 
RDEA3170 showed attributes similar to those 
of lesinurad but with significantly greater 
potency against the URAT1 transporter.  
It is being investigated as a potentially 
differentiated molecule that could be used 
earlier in the treatment of gout and 
asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. Phase I 
studies in Japan are complete and in early 
2014, we initiated a Phase II monotherapy 
study. RDEA3170 will also be studied  
globally as a chronic treatment for gout in 
combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. 
Phase II studies are underway in Asia and the 
US to assess safety and efficacy.
In November 2014, we and Amgen 
announced Phase III results for brodalumab 
in moderate to severe psoriasis. Brodalumab 
is a human MAb that targets the 
interleukin-17 (IL -17) receptor to treat 
moderate to severe psoriasis. The Phase III 
programme included three studies evaluating 
treatment with brodalumab, two of which 
compared brodalumab with ustekinumab 
and/or placebo. Results from all three clinical 
trials showed that all primary and secondary 
endpoints were met, with brodalumab 
showing superiority to ustekinumab in both 
comparative studies. Global regulatory filings 
are expected in 2015. Brodalumab is also 
being investigated in Phase III studies for 
psoriatic arthritis, and is in Phase II for 
asthma. Brodalumab is one of five MAbs  
that AstraZeneca and Amgen have agreed 
to jointly develop and commercialise. 
We also invested in several novel, 
multi-functional MAbs in I&A conditions. 
Sifalimumab, which is being investigated for 
moderate to severe SLE, met the primary 
endpoint for reducing SLE disease activity 
and demonstrated improvements in skin, 
joints and patient-reported outcomes in  
a Phase II study completed in May 2014. 
Anifrolumab, which targets the Type I 
interferon receptor, also continued 
development with a Phase IIb study in SLE 
patients. Mavrilimumab, an investigational 
MAb that inhibits a key pathway in the 
development of rheumatoid arthritis, 
achieved its primary endpoints in a Phase 
IIb study. Results, which were announced  
in May 2014, showed that mavrilimumab 
improved signs and symptoms of 
rheumatoid arthritis, measures of disability 
and patient-reported outcomes.
 > Brodalumab, an anti-IL -17RA MAb being 
developed with Amgen for psoriasis and 
psoriatic arthritis and in Phase IIb for 
uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma 
with a high degree of airway reversibility 
 > AZD7624, an inhaled p38 inhibitor in 
Phase IIa development for COPD
 > AZD1419, an inhaled oligonucleotide 
TLR9 agonist, has completed Phase I  
for mild asthma and, in 2015, will move  
to a Phase IIa safety and efficacy trial in 
asthma patients.
Inflammation and Autoimmunity
Gout is the most common form of 
inflammatory arthritis. It occurs when high 
levels of uric acid in the blood, known as 
hyperuricaemia, lead to the deposition of 
needle-like crystals in joints and soft tissues 
throughout the body, causing inflammation. 
Hyperuricaemia results when the kidneys  
do not efficiently remove enough uric acid, 
or when the body produces too much. In 
2013, there were an estimated 15.3 million 
diagnosed cases of gout in major markets. 
This number is expected to rise to 
17 .7 million cases in 2021. 
Psoriasis is a chronic disease in which the 
immune system causes skin cells to grow 
rapidly. Instead of being shed, the skin cells 
pile up, causing painful and itchy, red, scaly 
patches that can bleed. Approximately 
125 million people worldwide suffer from 
psoriasis. Despite treatment options for 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, many 
patients do not experience a resolution  
of underlying inflammation, clearing of 
symptoms or an improved quality of life. 
Current treatment of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) focuses on suppressing 
symptoms and controlling disease flares and, 
in the case of lupus nephritis, preventing renal 
failure. Although a biologic medicine was 
launched for SLE in 201 1, most therapies 
used are off-label and significant unmet

We have a long history in the fields of 
infection, neuroscience, and gastrointestinal 
(ING) diseases, which represent a significant 
area of unmet medical need for patients 
around the world. We group these fields  
into one therapy area to help support 
existing medicines, develop and 
commercialise new therapies, prioritise 
resources, enable effective and efficient 
investment and maximise value for patients 
and shareholders. 
Our strategic priorities
Our focus in infection is on respiratory 
viruses and serious bacterial infections.  
Our differentiated and leading on-market 
portfolio and pipeline experienced 
significant activity in 2014.
Influenza virus
Clinical data from FluMist/Fluenz has 
demonstrated superiority to traditional 
inactivated influenza vaccines in children. 
This has led governments in the UK and 
elsewhere to recommend the use of 
FluMist/Fluenz in children. In 2014, the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices recommended the use of FluMist/
Fluenz for healthy children of two to eight 
years of age, with no contraindications or 
precautions. We are engaging in 
discussions with other governments to help 
protect children against influenza, the most 
common vaccine-preventable disease in  
the developed world.
Respiratory syncytial virus
Since its approval in 1998, Synagis has 
helped protect more than 2.8 million babies 
globally against respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV). RSV affects approximately half of all 
infants worldwide in their first year of life  
and is the leading cause of hospitalisations 
and admissions to paediatric intensive care  
units. Synagis is approved in more than 80 
countries and is the global standard of care 
for RSV prevention. We continue to work 
with our worldwide partner, AbbVie, to 
protect additional vulnerable infants. In July 
2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics 
Committee on Infectious Disease issued 
guidelines restricting patients eligible for 
preventive therapy with Synagis. While these 
guideline changes are inconsistent with  
our approved label, they may significantly 
adversely affect Synagis sales in the US. 
We strengthened our leadership position in 
RSV in 2014 with the initiation of Phase I 
studies for MEDI8897 , a MAb that requires 
dosing only once per RSV season – a 
potential breakthrough in RSV prophylaxis.
Our opportunity-driven strategy seeks to maximise the value of our pipeline and 
portfolio through focused R&D, licensing and collaboration. In 2014, we progressed 
various assets in development, obtained approval for Movantik/Moventig in the US  
and EU, and entered into an alliance with Lilly for our BACE inhibitor, AZD3293,  
as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.

Our strategic priorities
We have a long history in anaesthesia  
and analgesia, and a sizeable business  
in psychiatry rooted in Seroquel IR and 
Seroquel XR. The substance patent 
protecting the active ingredient in Seroquel 
IR and Seroquel XR, quetiapine, expired 
worldwide in 2012. However, in most 
European countries, the formulation patent 
covering Seroquel XR does not expire until 
2017 . As such, Seroquel XR remains a  
key product, and we are committed to 
vigorously defending the patent protecting 
Seroquel XR. The patent, however, has 
been subject to various challenges and 
revocations. Details of litigation relating  
to Seroquel XR are included in Note 27  
to the Financial Statements from page 182. 
In Neuroscience, we are focused on 
developing new medicines, primarily for 
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases  
and pain control. In September 2014, we 
entered into an important agreement with 
Lilly to jointly develop and commercialise  
a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s.  
Also in 2014, we secured approval for 
Movantik (naloxegol) in the US and  
Moventig in the EU for the treatment  
of opioid-induced constipation. 
Movantik/Moventig approval
Movantik/Moventig, which was approved  
in the US in September 2014 and in the  
EU in December 2014, is the first orally 
administered, once daily peripherally-acting 
mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA)  
to be approved for the treatment of opioid 
induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients 
who have had an inadequate response to 
laxatives. OIC is the most common side 
effect of chronic use of opioid pain 
medicines, which are taken by over 
69 million people worldwide, and affects 
nearly 90% of opioid patients. Of these 
patients, only 40 to 50% achieve desired 
treatment outcomes with current options, 
such as OTC and prescription laxatives, 
which treat general constipation symptoms. 
Movantik/Moventig acts directly on the 
mu-opioid receptors in the gut, which cause 
OIC when opioids are used, and constitutes 
an important and novel option for opioid 
users. Movantik/Moventig was developed 
using Nektar Therapeutics’ oral small 
molecule polymer conjugate technology  
as part of a 2009 licence agreement with 
Nektar Therapeutics. 
Serious bacterial infections
Governments increasingly recognise 
antibiotic or anti-microbial resistance as  
a key health concern. We have a broad  
and innovative portfolio of medicines for 
serious Gram-positive and Gram-negative 
bacterial infections, and are working to 
develop additional medicines to fight these 
infections. These infections are difficult  
to treat and drive dangerous evolutions  
of resistance.
Some of our 2014 developments include 
 > positive results from a Phase III 
comparator trial, which demonstrated  
a favourable efficacy for Zinforo 600mg

Pain control
Our anaesthesia portfolio consists  
of various compounds, including an 
intravenous general anaesthetic/sedative 
and local anaesthetics available in different 
formulations, including injectables, creams, 
gels, sprays and suppositories. Although 
these compounds were developed 20 to 65 
years ago and most no longer benefit from 
patent protection, they are important 
medicines for patients. 
Biologics are an emerging treatment  
for pain control and we are exploring 
treatments in focused pain areas where 
patients can be selected based on 
symptomatic characteristics. We are 
currently developing AZD5213, a Phase II 
histamine-3 receptor antagonist for 
neuropathic pain. 
Gastrointestinal
Our marketed products
> Entocort (budesonide) is a locally-acting 
corticosteroid used to treat inflammatory  
bowel disease.
> Losec/Prilosec (omeprazole) is used  
for the short- and long-term treatment of 
acid-related diseases.
> Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium)  
is a proton pump inhibitor used to treat  
acid-related diseases.
Our strategic priorities
Nexium remains one of the most used 
therapies in the world and in 2014, its  
use grew in some markets, such as China  
and Japan. Demand for Nexium in China  
is expected to grow significantly and will 
complement its position in Japan as the 
top-selling medicine in its class.
Nexium is generally subject to generic 
competition in Europe. In the US, we 
expected the first generic entry in 2014 but 
that did not occur. In January 2015, Teva 
received approval from the FDA to market  
a generic version of Nexium. As such, we 
now expect generic entry in 2015 and a 
decline in US Nexium sales in 2015. Nexium 
is also subject to generic competition in 
Australia, where the first generic entry 
occurred in August 2014. Patents protecting 
Nexium have been subject to a number  
BACE partnership
In September 2014, we signed an 
agreement with Lilly for the joint 
development and commercialisation of 
AZD3293, our oral beta secretase cleaving 
enzyme (BACE) inhibitor being developed  
as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s 
disease. Pursuant to the agreement, we  
are eligible to receive up to $500 million  
in development and regulatory milestone 
payments from Lilly. Lilly will lead clinical 
development, which allows us to leverage 
Lilly’s Alzheimer’s expertise and focus on 
developing other therapies, while we will be 
responsible for manufacturing. AstraZeneca 
and Lilly will share the commercialisation 
activities. Enrolment into AMARANTH, a 
large Phase II/III study that aims to enrol 
more than 1,500 patients in 15 countries, 
began in December 2014. 
Neurology 
Alzheimer’s disease remains one of the 
largest areas of unmet medical need and 
continues to generate significant social  
and scientific interest. To address this need,  
we continued to develop MEDI1814, which 
entered a Phase I trial in February 2014.  
We also entered into multiple collaborations 
with academic and scientific institutions to 
advance disease understanding and identify 
potential new medicines. For example,  
we entered into collaborations with the 
University of Cambridge (focusing on 
advancing research and development in 
neurodegenerative diseases), the Karolinska 
Institutet (Sweden), the Banner Alzheimer’s 
Institute (US), the National Institute of 
Radiological Sciences (Japan), Vanderbilt 
University (US) (focusing on psychosis  
and other neuropsychiatric symptoms 
associated with major brain diseases, such 
as Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia), 
an alliance of several academic centres 
(known as ‘A5’), and Tufts University (US) 
(focusing on brain diseases and disorders, 
including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s 
disease and autism spectrum disorders). 
We also joined the Medical Research 
Council Dementias Platform UK (DPUK), a 
large public-private partnership to accelerate 
and share dementias research. Through this 
partnership, we will gain access to DPUK’s 
unique and rich dementia data and be able 
to collaborate with academic and industry 
researchers. In addition, we are developing 
AZD3241, a myeloperoxidase inhibitor, to 
potentially delay progression of disability  
in patients with multiple system atrophy.

Brilinta/Brilique: PARTHENON programme 
PARTHENON is the overarching clinical trial 
programme for the ticagrelor (Brilinta/Brilique) 
life-cycle management programme. It is 
AstraZeneca’s largest ever CV outcomes 
programme, involving nearly 80,000 patients at  
high risk of CV events (MI, stroke, and/or CV death) 
due to their underlying disease. PARTHENON aims 
to enhance the scientific understanding of the role of 
Brilinta/Brilique in the treatment of atherothrombotic 
conditions. It includes five key studies covering broad 
patient populations across varying timescales and 
aims to support four new indications for Brilinta/
Brilique over the next four years.
PLATO was the first study in the 
programme and involved patients 
with ACS. The PLATO study 
demonstrated that Brilinta/Brilique 
(90mg) reduced the rate of a 
combined endpoint of CV death, MI, 
or stroke compared to clopidogrel in 
patients with ACS. The PLATO study 
is the basis on which Brilinta/Brilique 
has been approved in over 100 
countries and included in 13 major 
ACS treatment guidelines globally.

Research and Development
Through focused investment in key 
programmes, targeted business 
development and leveraging our 
distinctive capabilities, we are pushing 
the boundaries of science to create 
innovative medicines that save lives and 
transform the treatment of disease.

Achieve scientific leadership 
As outlined in Strategic priorities from page 
18, achieving scientific leadership is critical  
to our success.
During 2014, we
 > redeployed R&D spend towards 
late-stage development
 > secured 12 regulatory approvals for 
NMEs and LCM projects across our 
therapy areas 
 > accelerated and simplified what we 
consider our best programmes, including 
expanding our immune-mediated cancer 
therapy (IMT-C) research activities
 > entered into multiple collaborations to 
access novel science and technology.
Achieving scientific leadership requires 
access to the best science, whether internal 
or external. Through our biotech-style 
operating model, with two biotech units  
for discovery research and early-stage 
development, and a late-stage development 
unit, we are able to access the best 
scientific research. Our productivity and 
pipeline are benefiting from investments in 
key capabilities, such as payer partnering, 
PHC, predictive science and clinical trial 
design, and we have made good progress 
in co-locating our teams to our strategic 
R&D centres. The moves to Gaithersburg, 
Maryland US are nearly complete and the 
moves to Cambridge, UK have begun. 
To focus resources on our key R&D 
programmes, leverage the expertise and 
capabilities of other organisations, reduce 
spend and generate revenue, we have 
engaged in select out-licensing and 
divestment opportunities. Our alliance with 
Lilly to co-develop AZD3293, a potential 
treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, and our 
divestment of Myalept and our US rights to 
Zestril and Tenormin are key examples. 
 For more information about these 
transactions, please see Therapy Area Review 
from page 32
Research and early-stage development 
Our two biotech units conduct innovative 
discovery research and early-stage 
development from initial target selection  
to Phase II trial completion. MedImmune 
focuses on biologics research while IMED 
focuses on scientific advances in small 
molecules. Both units comprise specialist 
disease area-led Innovative Medicines 
sections and are responsible for delivering 
projects to our Global Medicines 
Development (GMD) unit for late-stage 
development. During 2014, IMED and 
MedImmune delivered five biologic 
programmes and two small molecule 
programmes from early-stage development 
to GMD. The work of our biotech units is 
guided by the 5R framework, which is 
comprised of five factors (the right target, 
patient, tissue, safety and commercial 
potential) and aims to progress the right 
projects, focus resources and ultimately, 
improve productivity.

52 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 70%
In 2014, we applied our PHC strategy  
to approximately 70% of our pipeline.
 > Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. to develop 
a PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay to 
identify appropriate patients for enrolment 
in clinical trials for MEDI4736, a Phase III 
PD-L1 therapy for NSCLC
 > Illumina, Inc. to develop its next 
generation sequencing platform for 
diagnostic tests that screen genes and 
help predict patient responsiveness to  
our drugs.
We also strengthened our immuno-
oncology capabilities through the acquisition 
of Definiens, a pioneer in imaging and data 
analysis technology that identifies tumour 
tissue biomarkers. By using biomarkers  
to select patients for clinical trials, we hope 
to shorten clinical timelines and increase 
response rates. 
  Oncology from page 40
We are also applying our PHC strategy to 
our asthma portfolio. For example, in our 
Phase III programmes for benralizumab and 
tralokinumab, we are targeting patients with 
distinct asthma phenotypes to identify those 
most likely to respond to therapy and 
improve health outcomes. Benralizumab 
and tralokinumab are the first in a series  
of novel PHC-driven biologic therapies  
that may represent a critical advance in  
the development of personalised asthma 
management. 
  Respiratory, Inflammation and Autoimmunity 
from page 44
Late-stage development 
GMD is the science unit that drives our 
late-stage portfolio across our therapy 
areas. This work involves large Phase III 
clinical trial programmes that support the 
approval, launch and reimbursement of  
new medicines and studies to expand 
indications for approved products. GMD 
also delivers studies that demonstrate how 
our medicines work in the ‘real world’ to 
help healthcare professionals and payers 
understand the therapeutic as well as 
economic value of our medicines.
Accelerating the pipeline and  
increasing efficiency 
In 2014, we secured approvals in the US, 
EU, Japan and China for four NMEs, 
including in the US and EU for Lynparza , a 
novel treatment for ovarian cancer. We also 
secured approvals for two LCM projects – 
the Bydureon Pen and Xigduo/Xigduo XR. 
As at 31 December 2014, there were 13 
NMEs in late-stage development – either in 
Phase III/pivotal Phase II studies or under 
regulatory review. 
Also in 2014, we launched various 
programmes and delivered timely results  
for programmes already underway. For 
example, we launched Phase III/pivotal 
Phase II studies for key NMEs, such as 
MEDI4736 and AZD9291 for NSCLC, which 
may go from Phase I trials to regulatory 
submission in just over two years. Also, we 
completed the 21,000 patient PEGASUS 
study for Brilinta/Brilique, which successfully 
met its primary efficacy endpoint. For more 
information, please see Cardiovascular  
and Metabolic diseases from page 35 and  
the PARTHENON case study on page 51. 
Also, we initiated LCM programmes for 
benralizumab for COPD and Lynparza in 
adjuvant and metastatic BRCA-mutated 
breast cancer. These programmes reflect 
our efforts to prioritise investment, 
accelerate R&D for key programmes and 
focus resources to initiate clinical studies, 
recruit patients and deliver data efficiently. 
Also, we are increasing efficiency and 
productivity by implementing various 
simplification projects. These projects 
include a new information management 
system for all regulatory submissions, 
registrations and product changes,  
and simplified clinical programme designs  
and study protocols. In addition, we  
signed an outsourcing agreement for 
operational safety, regulatory maintenance 
and publishing tasks to release internal 
resources and focus on achieving our 
strategic priorities.
  Therapy Area Review from page 32
Our personalised healthcare (PHC) 
strategy
PHC is at the heart of our R&D strategy. 
Through its application, we seek to  
better understand disease mechanisms, 
increase the success rate of development 
projects, reduce clinical trial time and cost, 
deliver novel, life-changing medicines and 
develop sophisticated diagnostic protocols 
to identify those patients most likely to 
benefit from our medicines. In 2014, we 
applied our PHC strategy to approximately 
70% of our pipeline. 
In 2014, we collaborated with various 
biomarker and diagnostic companies  
to support our drug development 
programmes. For example, in the field  
of oncology, we entered into multiple 
collaborations, including those with
 > Qiagen to develop a non-invasive 
circulating tumour DNA diagnostic test 
to identify NSCLC patients appropriate 
for treatment with Iressa
 > Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. to develop 
a plasma-based companion diagnostic 
test to support AZD9291
With the consolidation 
of R&D activities to 
strategic centres, we 
hired new employees to 
strengthen our disease 
area expertise and 
technical capabilities.”

Strategic Report Strategic Report > Business Review
Working collaboratively and fostering 
open innovation
An open research environment, in which 
scientists freely exchange knowledge  
and ideas and collaborate, is key to driving 
sustainable scientific innovation. In 2014,  
we enhanced our innovation capability, 
fostered collaboration and gained access  
to what we believe are the best science  
and scientists by strengthening existing,  
and establishing new, collaborations with 
leading organisations. Such collaborations 
include those with
 > the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) 
to improve our understanding of human 
disease and create a joint research facility 
in Cambridge, UK
 > the MRC, the US National Institute of 
Health and the National Research 
Program for Biopharmaceuticals in 
Taiwan to help researchers unlock the 
potential of our compounds and develop 
life-changing medicines
 > the Academic Drug Discovery 
Consortium to facilitate research 
collaboration and provide researchers 
access to our compound library 
 > Cancer Research UK to discover and 
develop novel cancer treatments, and the 
commercial arm of Cancer Research UK, 
Cancer Research Technology, to create  
a joint laboratory in Cambridge, UK for 
such work 
 > the Gustave Roussy Comprehensive 
Cancer Center in France to develop our 
oncology molecules in pre-clinical, 
translational and clinical phases. 
Also in 2014, we launched an online 
platform to support our open innovation 
programmes and facilitate research 
collaborations with academia, industry, 
NGOs and governments. This new 
web-based portal allows scientists to 
access our Open Innovation programmes, 
which include a clinical compound bank  
of patient-ready ‘live’ and discontinued 
compounds and biologics, as well as a 
toolbox of compounds with optimised 
pharmacological properties. 
Our scientific reputation
Publishing our work in scientific and medical 
journals and participating in key scientific 
conferences are also key to achieving 
scientific leadership. Communicating openly 
with the scientific community helps validate 
the quality of our research, strengthen our 
reputation as an innovation-driven, 
science-led organisation, and retain and 
recruit the best scientists. In 2014, our 
medical staff and scientists authored more 
than 750 publications in various journals, 
including the New England Journal of 
Medicine, Science and Nature. We also 
played a significant role at key scientific 
conferences, such as those hosted by  
the American Society of Clinical Oncology,  
the European Society of Medical Oncology, 
the American Diabetes Association, the 
European Society of Cardiology and the 
American Thoracic Society, where we 
presented positive results from various 
clinical trials and generated significant 
interest within the scientific community.
Bioethics
†
We are committed to achieving scientific 
leadership and delivering life-changing 
medicines in a trustworthy and ethical 
manner. Our global standards of bioethics 
apply to all our research activity, whether 
conducted by us or third parties on  
our behalf. 
Patient safety
Patient safety is very important to us  
and we strive to minimise the risks and 
maximise the benefits of our medicines. 
Through a robust and comprehensive 
pharmacovigilance programme, we 
continually monitor our medicines to learn  
of any side effects not identified during the 
development process and provide accurate 
and up-to-date information concerning the 
safety profile of our medicines to regulators, 
healthcare professionals and, where 
appropriate, patients. We also work closely 
with regulatory authorities worldwide to raise 
pharmacovigilance awareness. 
Our experienced patient safety team is 
dedicated to helping fulfil our commitment 
to patient safety. Each developing and 
marketed medicine is allocated a Global 
Safety Physician and at least one patient 
safety scientist. In addition, each market  
is supported by a dedicated patient  
safety manager. 
Our Chief Medical Officer has overall 
accountability for the benefit/risk profiles  
of our products in development and on  
the market. He provides medical oversight 
and enforces appropriate risk assessment 
processes to facilitate efficient and informed 
safety decision making.
Investment in disease area and scientific 
capabilities
With the consolidation of R&D activities to 
strategic centres, we hired new employees 
to strengthen our disease area expertise 
and technical capabilities. We also engaged 
medical experts to provide important insight 
into our drug programmes, which will help 
ensure our medicines address the needs of 
patients as well as healthcare professionals.
We established therapy area specific GMD 
units (GMeds) – for example, in immuno-
oncology and respiratory – to focus 
resources and therapy area expertise on 
key programmes and complement units 
driving our therapy areas. We also 
enhanced our technology and capabilities, 
and integrated people and projects within 
GMD following the acquisition of BMS’s 
interest in the joint diabetes alliance and the 
strategic transaction with Almirall.
In addition, we strengthened our support 
resources for patients and healthcare 
professionals. Our Intelligent 
Pharmaceuticals programme, which allows 
patients and healthcare professionals to 
track and manage chronic conditions using 
interactive mobile and internet-based health 
tools, gained momentum, as various pilot 
projects were launched or completed. 
We also strengthened our payer and 
real-world evidence capabilities to better 
provide the data and analysis that helps 
demonstrate the therapeutic and economic 
value of our medicines. Real-world evidence 
studies use observational data, such as 
electronic medical records and patient 
surveys, to show, for example, how a 
medicine may improve outcomes compared 
with other treatments or reduce demand for 
hospital or specialist care. These studies 
may improve patient outcomes, reduce 
healthcare cost and help focus our efforts  
to deliver innovative medicines. 
750
In 2014, our medical staff and scientists 
authored more than 750 publications in 
various journals, including the New 
England Journal of Medicine, Science 
and Nature. 
Research and Development continued
54 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 organisations to comply with our global 
standards and we periodically conduct 
risk-based audits to monitor compliance.
We believe that transparency enhances  
the understanding of how our medicines 
work and benefit patients. To facilitate 
transparency, we publish information about 
our clinical research. We also publish 
information about the registration and 
results of our clinical trials – regardless  
of whether they are favourable – for all 
products and all phases, including marketed 
medicines, drugs in development and drugs 
whose development has been discontinued. 
To further promote transparency, we 
refreshed and enhanced our transparency 
strategy in 2014. For more information 
regarding our clinical trial registration, 
results, protocols and data, please see  
our website or our dedicated clinical trials 
website, www.astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com. 
Animal research 
We are committed to helping the public 
understand our use of animals in research 
and our methods for reducing, refining,  
or replacing animals in research. Our 
commitment is reflected in our Global 
Bioethics Policy. It is also reflected in the 
‘Concordat on Openness in Animal 
Research in the UK’, which we signed in 
2014 and describes how we will increase 
transparency regarding our animal research. 
We have developed internal standards  
that define our commitment to animal 
welfare and the responsible use of animals 
in research. These standards specify the 
global principles that apply for compliance 
with our Global Bioethics Policy, such as 
authorisation of animal work, standards  
for animal care and welfare and the 
compliance evaluation process. Additionally, 
we have improved our process for tracking 
external animal use and evaluating research 
facilities to help ensure that facilities are 
evaluated uniformly.
Animal research use varies depending on 
numerous factors, including our amount of 
pre-clinical research, the complexity of the 
diseases under investigation and regulatory 
requirements. We believe that without our 
active commitment to reducing, refining, or 
replacing animals in research, our animal 
use would be much greater. In 2014, we 
used 194, 162 animals in-house (2013: 
260,930). In addition, 15,634 animals were 
used by CROs on our behalf (2013: 19,676).
†  Further information on AstraZeneca’s approach to responsible 
business can be found in Responsible Business from page 
227 and on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/responsibility.
Clinical trials and transparency 
In 2014, we conducted clinical trials at 
multiple sites in various countries and 
regions as shown in the chart below.
The broad geographic span of our studies 
helps ensure that study participants reflect 
the diversity of patients for whom our 
medicines are intended and identify the 
patients for whom the medicine may be 
most beneficial. Our global governance 
process for determining where we locate 
clinical trials, which considers the existence 
of experienced and independent ethics 
committees, the presence of a robust 
regulatory regime and the availability  
of trained healthcare professionals and 
willing participants, provides the framework 
for ensuring a consistent, high-quality 
approach worldwide. 
Protecting participants throughout the  
trial process is a priority and we have strict 
procedures to help ensure participants  
are not exposed to unnecessary risks. 
Before a trial begins, we work to ensure  
that participants understand the nature  
and purpose of the research and that the 
proper procedure for gaining informed 
consent is followed. 
All our clinical studies are conceptually 
designed and finally interpreted in-house  
but some are conducted by CROs on  
our behalf. In 2014, approximately 27%  
of patients in our small molecule studies  
and 67% of patients in our biologics studies 
were monitored by CROs. We require these

outsourcing production while retaining the 
final stages of production internally. This 
helps ensure product integrity and quality 
assurance while providing cost efficiency 
and volume flexibility.
Progress on our two new key production 
facilities continued during 2014. In October 
2014, our facility at Taizhou, China delivered 
its first commercial product, with the project 
completed ahead of schedule and under 
budget. Our facility in Vorsino, Russia 
continued to complete regulatory validation, 
and commercial production is expected to 
commence in 2015. Both facilities will 
improve our ability to supply local markets. 
Also during 2014, we announced plans to 
invest more than $200 million to expand our 
biologics manufacturing centre in Frederick, 
Maryland US. This project will increase 
production capacity to support our maturing 
pipeline as well as the growing demand  
for biologics, which represent nearly 50%  
of our pipeline. 
Product quality and supply chain 
We are committed to high product quality, 
which underpins the safety and efficacy of 
our medicines. To help assure compliance 
and quality, we maintain a comprehensive 
quality management system.
Our continuous improvement programme 
allows us to upgrade our systems and 
minimise environmental impact. By focusing 
on increasing efficiency and cutting waste, 
we have reduced manufacturing lead times, 
average stock levels and inventory costs. 
We have also improved customer 
responsiveness. 
We apply Lean production business 
improvement tools and methods to  
our manufacturing plants and entire  
supply chain to improve efficiency,  
quality, lead times and overall equipment

compliance responsibility and supported by 
dedicated compliance teams. Our Internal 
Audit Services (IA) function provides 
independent assurance. 
Working with suppliers
†
Due to our strategy to outsource most API 
manufacturing, we need an uninterrupted 
supply of high quality raw materials. As 
such, we place great importance on our 
global procurement policies and integrated 
risk management processes. We purchase 
materials from a wide range of suppliers  
and work to mitigate supply risks, such as 
disasters that disrupt supply chains or the 
unavailability of raw materials. Contingency 
plans include using dual or multiple 
suppliers where appropriate, maintaining 
adequate stock levels and working to 
mitigate the effect of pricing fluctuations  
in raw materials. 
We also seek to manage reputational risk. 
Our ethical standards are integral to our 
procurement and partnering activities and 
we continuously monitor compliance 
through assessments and improvement 
programmes. We seek to work only with 
those suppliers whose standards of ethical 
behaviour are consistent with our own and 
will not use suppliers who are unable or 
unwilling to meet our standards.
In 2014, we implemented a new process for 
third party risk management. This process, 
which consists of four steps and applies to 
all our suppliers, downstream supply chain 
partners and local business development 
partners, assesses risk based upon defined 
criteria, including that related to anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption, data privacy, the 
environment and wages. Each step of the 
process provides an additional level of 
assessment, and we conduct more detailed 
assessments on those relationships 
identified as higher risk. Through this 
process we seek to better understand the 
partner’s risk approach, ensure the partner 
understands and can meet our standards 
and mitigate risk. The tables opposite show 
the assessments we conducted, by step 
and region, since the process began in May 
2014. This new risk management process 
builds on the 7 ,587 supplier assessments 
we completed since 2009 through our 
previous suppliers audit process. 
In addition, we conducted 40 audits on 
direct materials suppliers to ensure they 
employ appropriate quality, health and 
safety practices. Thirty seven percent of 
suppliers met our expectations and 54% 
effectiveness. For example, in 2014, we 
implemented an innovative software system 
to provide real-time data on our supply  
chain performance to reduce variability, 
increase speed and identify improvement 
opportunities. We also continue to establish 
more efficient processes, with global  
supply chain experts providing support 
throughout the organisation. 
Regulation and compliance
Manufacturing facilities and processes are 
subject to rigorous regulatory standards, 
which continuously evolve and are not 
harmonised globally. They are also subject 
to inspections by regulatory authorities who 
are authorised to mandate improvements to 
facilities and processes, halt production and 
impose conditions for production to resume. 
In 2014, we hosted 36 independent 
inspections from 20 regulatory authorities. 
We reviewed observations from these 
inspections, together with the outcomes  
of internal audits, and, where necessary, 
implemented improvement actions. 
We review and comment upon evolving 
national and international compliance 
regulations through our membership of 
industry associations. For example, we  
work with the European Federation of 
Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations 
(EFPIA) and the Pharmaceutical Research 
and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) to 
improve supply chain security and minimise 
drug shortages.
Our manufacturing and supply strategy 
reflects our commitment to maintaining the 
highest ethical standards and compliance 
with internal policies, laws and regulations.

Pharmaceuticals, including

an inevitable consequence of 
manufacturing, patient use and

the environmental stewardship  
of our APIs and, to ensure our 
manufacturing discharges are

Environmental impact
†
 
Our 2014 targets
‡
 included reducing 
 > operational greenhouse gas footprint to 
758,000 tonnes CO 2 per year
 > hazardous waste to 0.66 tonnes/$m sales 
and non-hazardous waste to 0.49 tonnes 
per employee
 > water use to 3.7 million m
3
.
We are working to reduce our greenhouse 
gas emissions by, among other things, 
improving energy efficiency and pursuing 
lower-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels. 
During 2014, our air and road travel and 
freight transport emissions increased due to 
greater business activity in our pursuit of a 
return to growth. We are working, however, 
to ensure that our travel and transport 
activities are as efficient as possible.
Some of our respiratory therapies, 
specifically the pMDIs that rely on 
hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants, affect 
our carbon footprint. While HFAs have no 
ozone depletion potential and a third or less 
of the global warming potential than the 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) they replace, 
they are still greenhouse gases. By the end 
of 2015, we aim to reduce our operational 
greenhouse gas footprint (excluding 
emissions from patient use of our inhaler 
therapies) by 20% from our 2010 levels.  
In 2014, our operational greenhouse gas 
footprint totalled 738,000 metric tonnes, 
a reduction of 18% from our 2010 baseline. 
For more information on carbon reporting, 
please see Responsible Business from 
page 227 .
Waste management is another key aspect 
of our commitment to minimise our 
environmental impact. By the end of 2015, 
we aim to reduce our hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste by 15% from our 
2010 levels. While waste prevention is our 
goal, we seek to minimise waste through 
treatment, recycling and the avoidance  
of landfill disposal when prevention is 
impractical. In 2014, our total waste was 
35,800 metric tonnes with a tonnes/$m 
index of 1.37 . We reduced hazardous waste 
by 36% (a reduction of 18% indexed to $m 
revenues) since 2010 due principally to 
changing production patterns and a major 
investment at our manufacturing site in the 
UK to enable recycling and reuse of solvent 
wastes. Our non-hazardous waste indexed 
against staff numbers has not improved due 
to staff reductions since the baseline 
was set.
We recognise the need to use water 
responsibly and, where possible, to 
minimise water use in our facilities. To  
reach our 2015 water use reduction target  
of 25% from 2010 levels, we initiated water 
conservation plans at our largest sites. In 
2014, our water use was 3.8 million m
3
, a 
reduction of 17% from our 2010 baseline. 
Water use indexed to revenues was 
145 m
3
/$m (+5% from 2010 baseline). 
We are also working to ensure that we 
measure and report the environmental 
impact of our external manufacturing 
activity, and that our suppliers have 
appropriate environmental targets. 
We believe we have captured data for 
more than 90% of the globally managed 
outsourced manufacture of key 
intermediates and APIs, formulation and 
packaging for our established brands. 
 www.astrazeneca.com/responsibility
We continue to integrate environmental 
considerations across a medicine’s  
entire life-cycle, from discovery, research 
and development to manufacturing, 
commercialisation and disposal. We  
follow a progressive compliance programme 
to ensure that our manufacturing emissions 
of APIs do not exceed our standards  
for safe discharges at our manufacturing 
sites and periodically conduct compliance 
assessments. We also follow a progressive 
approach to ensure ecopharmacovigilance. 
This involves regularly reviewing emerging 
science and literature for new information 
that might inform the environmental risk 
management plans for our products.  
We published our approach in the  
Drug Safety journal in July 2013. Further 
information, including environmental  
risk assessment data for our medicines,  
is available on our website,

Organisation and approach
To improve health and bring benefits to 
patients around the world, we need to 
ensure the right medicines are available and 
that patients have access to them. To that 
end, our sales and marketing teams, which 
comprised around 34,800 employees at the 
end of 2014, are active in more than 100 
countries. In most countries, we sell our 
medicines through wholly-owned local 
marketing companies. We also sell through 
distributors and local representative offices. 
We market our products largely to  
primary care and specialty care physicians. 
We aim to meet their needs by having  
highly accountable local leaders who 
understand their customers and focus  
on business growth. 
We group our Sales and Marketing function 
into three Commercial Regions – North 
America, Europe and International, together 
with Japan, one of our growth platforms. 
Our GPPS organisation develops global 
product strategies and drives commercial 
excellence, ensuring a strong customer 
focus and commercial direction in managing 
our pipeline and marketed products. All our 
efforts are underpinned by a commitment to 
operating responsibly and conducting sales 
and marketing activity in accordance with 
applicable laws and our values.
US
As the third largest prescription-based 
pharmaceutical company in the US,  
we have a 5.2% market share of US 
pharmaceuticals by sales value.
In 2014, sales in the US increased by 4%  
to $10, 120 million (2013: $9,691 million; 
2012: $10,655 million), driven by strong 
performance of our growth platforms, 
including Symbicort and Brilinta, and the 
impact of completing the acquisition of 
BMS’s share of the global diabetes alliance, 
partially offset by declines in revenue from 
Nexium, Seroquel IR and Synagis. 
The Affordable Care Act, which was 
enacted in March 2010, has had, and is 
expected to continue to have, a significant 
impact on our US sales and the US 
healthcare industry. In 2014, the overall 
reduction in our profit before tax for  
the year, due to discounts on branded 
pharmaceutical sales to Medicare Part D 
beneficiaries and an industry-wide excise 
fee, was $714 million (2013: $557 million). 
  For more information on pricing pressure 
and the ACA, please see Marketplace from page 
14 and Geographical Review from page 220
While there is no direct governmental price 
control for commercial prescription drug 
sales in the US, some publicly funded 
programmes, such as Medicaid and 
TRICARE (Department of Veterans Affairs), 
have statutorily mandated rebates and 
discounts, which effectively serve as price 
controls for these programmes. Also, 
pressure on pricing and the availability and 
use of prescription drugs for commercial 
and public payers continues to increase. 
This is due to, among other things, an 
increased focus on generic alternatives.  
The increased use of generics is also due to 
rising patient co-insurance or co-payments 
for branded pharmaceuticals and budgetary 
Our return to growth strategy is built on 
maximising the potential of our strong 
portfolio of primary care and specialty 
care medicines, as well as leveraging our 
global commercial presence, particularly 
in Emerging Markets. We are investing  
in our growth platforms while focused 
business development supports our 
late-stage and marketed portfolio.

Established Rest of World (ROW)*: 
opportunities and challenges
In 2014, sales in Japan decreased by 3% to 
$2,227 million (2013: $2,485 million) driven 
by generic competition and the impact of 
mandated biennial price cuts, partially offset 
by performance of growth platforms. We 
share the promotion of Crestor, Symbicort, 
Nexium and Forxiga with Japanese 
partners, who also distribute Nexium, 
Symbicort and Forxiga. In Japan, we are 
ranked third in the oncology market by sales 
of medicines. To maintain this important 
franchise, we launched Janssen 
Pharmaceutical K. K. and Janssen 
Pharmaceutical NV’s Zytiga (abiraterone 
acetate) for castration-resistant prostate 
cancer in 2014 as part of a 2013  
co-promotion agreement with them.
In Canada, Provincial and Territorial payers, 
who represent nearly 55% of the market, 
have developed a structure for pan-
Canadian product listings, which could 
restrict the introduction of new products into 
the public healthcare system. Private sector 
payers, representing the remaining 45%,  
are experimenting with tiered access 
programmes for large public and private 
employer groups. While reimbursement for 
new medicines is likely to remain, pricing 
pressure will increase.
Our sales in Australia and New Zealand 
declined by 13% in 2014. This was primarily 
due to the continued erosion of Crestor and 
Atacand by generic medicines. Nexium lost 
exclusivity in Australia in 2014 and generic 
medicines were launched. 
*  Established ROW comprises Australia, Canada, New Zealand 
and Japan.
 Geographical Review from page 220
Emerging Markets: expansion  
and collaboration 
Emerging Markets, as defined in Market 
definitions on page 239, comprise  
various countries with dynamic, growing 
economies. As outlined in Marketplace  
from page 14, these countries represent  
a major growth opportunity for the 
pharmaceutical industry due to strong 
demand and economic fundamentals.
Emerging Markets are not immune, 
however, to economic downturn. Market 
volatility is higher than in Established 
Markets and various political and economic 
challenges exist, including regulatory and 
government interventions.
AstraZeneca was the eighth largest,  
as measured by sales, and the third 
fastest-growing top 10 multinational 
pharmaceutical company in Emerging 
Markets in 2014, with revenues of 
$5,827 million. Our strongest growth 
opportunities include China, Russia, Africa, 
India, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, 
Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina and Chile.
AstraZeneca is the second largest 
pharmaceutical company, as measured by 
sales, in China. We are driving sustainable 
growth through strategic brands investment, 
expanded hospitals coverage and 
systematic organisational capability 
improvements. Sales in China in 2014 
increased by 22% to $2,242 million (2013: 
$1,840 million). We delivered sales growth at 
nearly double the growth rate of the market, 
and initiated several long-term market 
expansion programmes in therapy areas. 
The healthcare environment in China 
remains dynamic with opportunities arising 
from incremental healthcare investment, 
strong underlying demand and the 
emergence of innovative medicines.
Growth drivers for Emerging Markets 
include our new medicines, notably Brilinta, 
and our diabetes, respiratory, oncology, CV 
and gastrointestinal portfolios. To educate 
physicians on our broad portfolio, we are 
selectively investing in sales capabilities 
where opportunities from unmet medical 
need exist. We are also expanding our  
reach through multi-channel marketing. 
We are also engaging in innovative 
collaborations to access novel science, 
technology and medicines to complement 
and strengthen our portfolio (such as  
policies of healthcare systems and 
providers, including policies about the use of 
‘generics only’ formularies. In 2014, 83.3% 
of prescriptions dispensed in the US were 
generic compared with 82.2% in 2013. 
While the adoption of a broad national 
price-control scheme in the near future is 
unlikely, increased focus on pharmaceutical 
prices and their impact on healthcare costs 
is likely to continue.
  Geographical Review from page 220
Europe
Our European business comprises Western 
and Eastern European markets, which 
include France, Germany, Italy, the UK, 
Spain, and the Nordic-Baltic countries. The 
total European pharmaceutical market was 
worth $216 billion in 2014. We are the tenth 
largest pharmaceutical company in Europe 
with a 2.7% market share of prescription 
sales by value. 
In 2014, our sales in Europe decreased by 
1% to $6,638 million (2013: $6,658 million). 
Key drivers of the decline were competition 
from Symbicort analogues, ongoing volume 
erosion of Atacand and Seroquel XR 
following loss of exclusivity and lower net 
pricing on Synagis. The continued austere, 
macroeconomic environment increased 
government interventions (for example, price 
and volume interventions) and increased 
trade across markets also affected sales. 
Despite these conditions, we continue to 
launch innovative medicines across Europe.

During 2014, we continued to train 
employees on the global standards  
that govern the way we operate. We  
have comprehensive processes as well  
as dedicated compliance professionals  
who monitor adherence to our Code of 
Conduct and global policies and support 
our line managers locally in supervising  
their staff. We also have a network of 
nominated signatories who review our 
promotional materials against applicable 
requirements. In 2014, audit professionals 
also conducted compliance audits on 
selected marketing companies.
As shown in the Confirmed external 
breaches table opposite, we identified six 
confirmed breaches of external sales and 
marketing regulations or codes in 2014 
(2013: 1 1). There were 1,847 instances, most 
of them minor, of non-compliance with our 
Code of Conduct, Global Policies or related

Regions, including instances by contract 
staff and other third parties (2013: 1,773). 
We removed 213 employees or contractors 
from their roles as a result of these breaches 
(a single breach may involve more than one

US Corporate Integrity Agreement  
and The Physician Payments Sunshine 
Act reporting 
In April 2010, AstraZeneca signed an 
agreement with the DOJ to settle an 
investigation relating to the sales and 
marketing of Seroquel IR. The requirements 
of the associated Corporate Integrity 
Agreement (CIA) between AstraZeneca and 
the Office of the Inspector General of the US 
Department of Health and Human Services 
(OIG) include a number of active monitoring 
and self-reporting obligations that differ from 
the self-reporting required by authorities in 
the rest of the world. To meet these 
obligations, AstraZeneca provides notices  
to the OIG describing the outcomes of 
particular investigations potentially relating  
to violations of certain laws, as well as a 
separate annual report to the OIG 
summarising monitoring and investigation 
outcomes relevant to the CIA requirements. 
Under the CIA, AstraZeneca also discloses, 
on a publicly available website, certain 
payments to US physicians and institutions. 
In addition, from March 2014, AstraZeneca 
began reporting to the US government 
detailed information relating to payments to 
physicians and teaching hospitals in the US,

  Geographical Review from page 220
Pricing our medicines 
Our global pricing policy provides the 
framework to ensure appropriate patient 
access while optimising the sustained 
profitability of our products. When setting 
the price of a medicine, we consider its  
full value to patients, payers and society 
generally. We also pursue a flexible pricing 
approach. For example, we support the 
concept of differential pricing, provided  
that appropriate safeguards are in place  
to help ensure lower-priced products  
reach the patients who need them and  
are not diverted for sale and use in more 
affluent markets. 
Delivering value for payers 
Our medicines help treat unmet medical 
need, improve health and create economic 
and therapeutic benefits. Effective 
treatments can lower healthcare costs by 
reducing the need for more expensive care, 
preventing more serious and costly diseases 
and increasing productivity by reducing or 
preventing days lost to illness. Nevertheless, 
as outlined in Pricing pressure, in 
Marketplace on page 17 , pricing pressure 
remains. We are acutely aware of the 
economic challenges faced by payers and 
remain committed to delivering value to 
payers and patients alike. We work closely 
with payers and providers to understand 
their priorities and requirements, and 
conduct real-world evidence studies to 
demonstrate how our products improve 
health outcomes, offer value and support 
cost-effective healthcare.

During 2014, we hired some 9,900 
permanent employees. These people,  
with roles in, for example, R&D, technical, 
marketing and management roles, are 
helping achieve our strategic priorities. 
To help secure our future, we are identifying 
and recruiting emerging talent and investing 
in internships and recruitment opportunities 
globally. For example, we conduct a global 
programme to hire recent graduates for our 
procurement, quality, engineering, IT and 
supply chain functions. We also have a 
graduate programme for IMED, which 
complements our established IMED Post 
Doctorate Programme for researcher 
recruitment. 
The composition of our international 
workforce changes with our business  
focus. This can be seen in the Sales and 
Marketing figures opposite, which show  
a concentration in Emerging Markets.  
To attract and retain the people we need, 
we continuously strive to maintain a strong 
global reputation. 
Voluntary employee turnover increased 
marginally to 8.7% in 2014 from 8. 1% in 
2013. Our voluntary employee turnover rate 
among our high performers in 2014 also 
increased to 6.8%. We seek to reduce 
regretted turnover through high-level reviews 
of resignations, risk assessments and 
retention plans. 
Acquisitions to support our growth 
platforms
Two of our acquisitions in 2014 involved  
the transfer of a substantial number of 
employees. Approximately 3,600 BMS  
and Amylin employees joined us in  
February 2014 following our acquisition  
of BMS’s interest in the joint diabetes 
alliance. Approximately 500 Almirall 
employees joined us in November 2014 
following our acquisition of the rights to 
Almirall’s respiratory franchise and its  
device subsidiary. 
Passionate about developing 
employees
Various leadership programmes seek to 
maximise our employees’ potential. These 
programmes, both online and instructor-led, 
help build the right capabilities and culture  
to deliver our strategy.
In 2014, we offered a customised 
programme for our top 150 talent  
with Harvard Business School and a 
programme for emerging leaders with  
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT). Both programmes aim to foster 
openness, inclusivity and innovation.  
We hope to offer leaders at all levels of the 
organisation appropriate, globally consistent 
leadership development opportunities.
Changing our culture
Each of our values has a corresponding set 
of behaviours. These behaviours, which are 
essential for strong and effective leadership, 
apply to all employees and are reinforced  
by complementary accountabilities for

62 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 To measure progress over the medium 
term, we also track the countries of origin  
of senior leaders and emerging talent. Our 
Responsible Business Council (made up  
of senior leaders from across AstraZeneca) 
oversees this process. For more information, 
please see Responsible Business from 
page 227 .
Our Insight Exchange programme  
helps foster diversity and inclusion and 
strengthens our pool of emerging talent. 
This programme, which is now in its  
third year, pairs employees from various 
locations, levels and functional areas 
to work together for one year to facilitate 
reflection and learning from diverse 
perspectives, viewpoints and experiences. 
In 2014, we launched a cohort of 60  
new pairs.
Our progress to improve diversity and 
inclusion is reflected in the Diversity & 
Inclusion index. This index, which is 
reported in our employee survey (see 
Employee engagement below), showed  
an improvement of three percentage  
points compared with 2012 and, at 80% 
favourable, is three percentage points  
above the global benchmark.
Our efforts were recognised externally.  
In 2014, the National Association for Female 
Executives ranked us in the top ten of  
its 50 leading companies for the sixth 
consecutive year and the Human Rights 
Campaign Foundation named us as a ‘Best 
Place to Work for LGBT Equality’. We were 
also featured among Working Mother 
Magazine’s ‘100 Best Companies’.
Employee engagement 
Various global leadership communication 
channels engage employees in our strategy 
and encourage dialogue. These channels 
include face-to-face meetings, video 
conferencing, Yammer (a social media tool) 
and regular global and business-specific 
communication campaigns. 
We held a global employee census survey 
(FOCUS) in 2014, as well as two brief  
‘pulse’ surveys across a sample of the 
organisation. The results from FOCUS, 
which was conducted in 29 languages and 
achieved an 89% response rate, showed 
significant improvement in employee 
engagement. Scores increased to 85%  
(up eight percentage points compared to 
FOCUS 2012, and only one percentage 
point behind the global high performing 
norm). The survey also showed 
managers. During 2014, we embedded 
these values and behaviours into key HR 
processes, such as performance and talent 
management and recruitment.
Maximising our talent
To maximise our talent, we focus on 
developing our future leaders from within 
and hiring judiciously from the outside.  
In each case, we greatly value these 
individuals and their skills and support them 
to reach their full potential. In 2014, we 
introduced a new programme for talent 
early in their career. The STAR programme, 
which we offered six times in 2014, teaches 
emerging talent about enterprise leadership 
and provides an opportunity to study 
AstraZeneca cases and interact with senior 
leaders. In 2014, approximately 240 people 
participated in our talent development 
programmes, which include the STAR 
programme, Global Talent programme  
and the Insight Exchange programme. 
We are committed to hiring and promoting 
talent ethically and in compliance with 
applicable laws. Our policies and 
procedures are designed to help protect 
against discrimination on any grounds 
(including disability) and cover recruitment 
and selection, performance management, 
career development and promotion, 
transfer, training, re-training (including 
re-training, if needed, for people who have 
become disabled) and reward.
Improving the strength and diversity  
of the talent pipeline
†
To foster innovation, we seek to harness 
various perspectives, talents and ideas  
and to ensure that our employees reflect  
the diversity of our communities. As we 
continue to reshape our organisation and its 
geographic footprint, we embed inclusion 
into our strategies. 
As shown in the gender diversity figure 
overleaf, women comprise 49.9% of our 
global workforce. There are currently four 
women on our Board (31%) and, below 
Board level, women comprise 40.5%  
of managers at Global Career Level F  
and above. 
Our 2015 target is to improve female 
representation
 > at Global Career Level F and above  
(the highest six bands of our employee 
population) from 38% (2010) to 41% (2015)
 > in the global talent pool from 33% (2010) 
to 38% (2015). 
improvements across all categories for 
which we had a point of comparison for 
2012, including understanding and belief  
in our direction and priorities. The score  
for recommending AstraZeneca as a great 
place to work was 82%. Although the 
results showed significant improvement in 
employee engagement, we identified two 
specific areas for improvement. One relates 
to further simplifying the business and 
eliminating obstacles to efficiency. The 
second relates to developing our people, 
where the survey results showed that 
employee belief in the existence of 
opportunities for career development and 
personal growth is two percentage points 
below the high performing benchmark. In 
addition to conducting several employee 
surveys, we tracked key HR metrics, such 
as retention rates, during 2014 to help 
assess levels of engagement.
Performance management
We continue to focus on performance.  
By setting high-quality objectives aligned 
with our strategy and performing coaching 
and feedback analysis, we are able to track 
performance at every level. This includes 
managers’ accountability for working  
with their employees to develop individual 
and team performance targets. It also 
involves fostering an understanding about 
each person’s contribution to our overall 
business objectives.
Our focus on performance is also 
demonstrated through our performance-
related bonus and incentive plans and 
encouragement of participation in various 
employee share plans, some of which are 
described in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report from page 100, and also in Note 26  
to the Financial Statements, from page 179.
Human rights
†
We are committed to respecting and 
promoting international human rights – not 
only in our own operations, but also in our 
wider spheres of influence. To that end, we 
integrate human rights considerations into 
our policies, processes and practices.

Employees continued
We support the principles set out in the 
United Nations Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the International Labour 
Organization’s (ILO) standards on child 
labour and minimum wages. We are also 
members of the United Nations Global 
Compact on Human Rights. 
In 201 1, we conducted labour reviews in  
106 countries that focused on ILO core 
areas, including freedom of association  
and collective bargaining, child labour, 
discrimination, working hours and wages. 
We are currently conducting these reviews 
again and returns so far show sustained 
good results. We also included questions  
on the ‘living wage’ and are conducting an 
independent external review so that we can 
assess the global developments in this area. 
Managing change 
The number of employees increased  
from approximately 51,500 in 2013 to  
57 ,500 in 2014. The majority of external  
hires were recruited into emerging markets. 
Others successfully transitioned from BMS 
and Almirall to support our diabetes and 
respiratory franchises. We also restructured 
our business in other areas to increase 
efficiencies. 
  For more information on our restructuring 
programme, please see Financial Review 
from page 70
In 2013, we announced plans to invest in 
three strategic R&D centres, which affected 
employees in the US and the UK. We 
encouraged and supported employees to 
relocate and have made good progress.  
For example, more than 400 employees 
now work at our Cambridge, UK site; of 
these employees, more than half relocated 
from other sites, such as those in London, 
Macclesfield and Alderley Park. Over the 
next three years, we expect to hire 
approximately 1,000 new employees to 
occupy our new site in Cambridge, and  
we are using interim infrastructure in and 
around Cambridge during the transitional 
phase. For employees who do not accept 
offers to relocate to Cambridge, UK, we 
provide career and outplacement support. 
Similar relocation initiatives are underway 
elsewhere in our organisation, including  
in the US where almost 300 employees 
have accepted offers to relocate to 
Gaithersburg, Maryland.
Employee relations 
We seek to follow a global approach to 
employee relations guided by global 
employment principles and standards,  
local laws and good practice. We work to 
develop and maintain good relations with 
local workforces and work closely with 
national trade unions, where practical.  
We also regularly consult with employee 
representatives or, where applicable, trade 
unions, who share our aim of retaining key 
skills and mitigating job losses. 
Safety, health and wellbeing
† 
We work to promote a safe, healthy and 
energising work environment in which our 
employees and partners are able to express 
their talents, drive innovation and improve 
business performance.
Our targets for 2014, which we set in 201 1 
for the years up to 2015, included
 > no fatalities
 > lost time injury/illness rate per million 
hours worked of 2. 1
 > 6. 1 collisions per million kilometres driven
 > at least 80% of sites and marketing 
companies offer at least five essential 
health activities.
Our highest priority for improvement 
remains driver safety, particularly among  
our sales forces who form the largest  
group of employees driving on AstraZeneca 
business. We monitor performance centrally 
to assess progress and identify areas for 
improvement. In 2014, we exceeded our 
annual target for collisions per million 
kilometres driven and met our 2015 target 
one year early. We regret, however, that an 
employee was killed in a traffic accident 
while driving on AstraZeneca business 
during 2014. We initiated a detailed 
investigation and will develop an action plan 
to address the findings of the investigation. 
We will monitor the actions and share 
learning across AstraZeneca.
Having already achieved our 2015 lost time 
injury/illness rate target two years early, we 
achieved a further reduction in 2014. The 
lost time injury/illness rate reduced by 17% 
from 2013, which equates to a 38% overall 
reduction from the 2010 baseline. 
The 2014 health and wellbeing target was 
narrowly missed, with 78% of sites offering 
at least five activities. Although this is 
disappointing, 91% of sites now offer at least 
four activities, compared with 66% in 2012.

Relationships
Our employees are critical to achieving our strategic priorities. To realise our full 
potential, however, we also depend on a wider set of stakeholders. 
We pursue strategically aligned value-
enhancing business development 
opportunities and focus on
 > research transactions – increasing 
early-stage research transactions and 
academic alliances 
 > peer collaborations – exploring 
value-creating peer collaborations 
 > in-licensing and bolt-on acquisitions – 
pursuing partnering, in-licensing and 
bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen our 
therapy area portfolios.
Over the past three years we have 
completed more than 180 major or 
strategically important business 
development transactions, including  
some 70 in 2014. Of these transactions,  
12 were related to clinical stage assets  
or programmes, 47 to pre-clinical assets  
or programmes and 1 1 to PHC and 
biomarkers. Twenty one transactions  
helped expand our biologics capabilities. 
Acquisitions included Definiens and the 
rights to Almirall’s respiratory franchise,  
as well as its subsidiary focused on the 
development of innovative proprietary 
devices. We completed the acquisition  
of BMS’s share of the diabetes alliance  
in February 2014.
For more information on our partnering 
activity in 2014, please see Research and 
Development from page 52, Therapy  
Area Review from page 32, and Note 24  
to the Financial Statements from page 170.
Community investment
†
 
Our global community investment strategy 
focuses on healthcare in the community 
and science education. We are committed 
to operating responsibly, supporting our 
community and maximising the benefit  
of our investment for all stakeholders. 
In 2014, we spent approximately 
$880 million (2013: $1. 12 billion) on 
community investment sponsorships, 
partnerships and charitable donations, 
including through our product donation and 
patient assistance programmes. Through 
our three patient assistance programmes  
in the US, which make our medicines 
available free of charge to eligible patients 
and healthcare facilities, we donated 
products valued at an average wholesale 
price of more than $800 million (2013: 
$1.05 billion). We also donated products 
worth over $13 million, valued at an  
average wholesale price, to the charitable 
organisation AmeriCares. 
Young Health Programme
We continued to develop the three strands 
of our Young Health Programme (YHP): 
advocacy; research; and on-the-ground 
programmes focused on evidence 
generation with an increased 2014 focus  
on the prevention of non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) and associated adolescent 
risk behaviours. With over 667 ,000 young 
people in communities across five 
continents directly reached with the skills 
and information they need to improve their 
health, we have therefore well exceeded  
our Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to 
Action of reaching 250,000 young people 
directly by the end of 2015. Over 9,500 of 
these young people have been trained to 
Our stakeholders include the patients and 
physicians for whom we provide medicines 
for some of the world’s most serious 
diseases and the universities and institutes 
that collaborate with our scientists. They 
also include governments, regulators, 
payers, suppliers and commercial entities.
The Sales and Marketing section from page 
59 outlines our focus on customers and 
communicating effectively with them. The 
Research and Development section from 
page 52 describes how we work with 
payers from an early stage in a medicine’s 
life-cycle to demonstrate its full value.
In Manufacturing and Supply from page 56, 
we examine our relationships with suppliers 
and our commitment to working only with 
those that embrace standards of ethical 
behaviour consistent with our own. This 
commitment extends to joint venture, 
co-promotion partners and research and 
licensing partners.
Partnering
As outlined in Strategic priorities  
from page 18, business development, 
specifically partnering, is an important  
pillar that supplements and strengthens  
our pipeline and our efforts to achieve 
scientific leadership. As noted in Research 
and Development from page 52, we strive  
to access leading science from within  
and outside our laboratories. 
We partner with others around the  
world, including academia, governments, 
industry, scientific organisations and patient 
groups to access the best science to 
stimulate innovation and accelerate the 
delivery of new medicines to target unmet 
medical need.

Strategic Report > Resources Review
of Adolescent Health in December 2014.  
To support progress in the adolescent NCD 
prevention agenda, we commissioned the 
Population Reference Bureau to produce 
several reports, including one on the 
prevalence of NCD risk behaviours among 
young people in Africa (publication expected 
early 2015).
STEM Career Academies
We support science education in the 
community in various ways. For example,  
in 2014, we extended for three years our 
partnership with the educational charity 
Career Academies UK (started in 2011)  
to support increased participation by 16  
to 19 year-olds in science, technology, 
engineering and maths (STEM) subjects. 
Career Academies UK links schools and 
colleges with employers through classes, 
mentoring, workplace visits and internships 
to help prepare adolescents for work. Thirty 
five percent (59) of Career Academies now 
have a STEM theme, exceeding the target  
of 33% by the 2014/2015 academic year.  
In 2014, 812 year one and two students 
participated in STEM, of which 41% of the 
441 students expected to graduate in  
2015 are female. This supports Career 
Academies UK’s commitment to increase 
female participation in STEM education  
and careers.
Disaster relief
The British Red Cross continues to act  
as our global disaster relief partner, with  
the majority of our disaster relief donations 
channelled through it. In addition to the 
charitable donations referenced in 
Community investment above, in 
September 2014 we donated £50,000 via 
the British Red Cross to the Gaza Israel 
Appeal and £250,000 to the Ebola Appeal.

share this health information with their  
peers and the community, and over 10,000 
frontline health providers have been trained 
in adolescent health. See the table below  
for programme details.
To help place the prevention of adolescent 
NCD-related risk behaviours on the global 
and local policy agenda, we engaged in 
various activities, including participation in 
the United Nations High-level Review on 
NCDs and the development of an NCDs 
chapter for the UNICEF Facts for Life book. 
Also in 2014, the Wellbeing of Adolescents 
in Vulnerable Environments study, 
undertaken by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg 
School of Public Health as part of YHP ,  
was completed. Headline findings were 
presented at a YHP side meeting to the

Healthy Heart Africa
†
In October 2014, we launched the Healthy Heart 
Africa (HHA) programme in Nairobi, Kenya. HHA  
is an innovative and sustainable programme that 
aims to improve the lives of hypertensive patients 
across Africa through increased screening, 
diagnosis, treatment and awareness of hypertensive 
risk factors and lifestyle modifications. The initial 
demonstration programme will be the largest African 
programme to address hypertension. Consistent with 
the WHO’s ‘25 by 2025’ global monitoring framework 
for preventing and controlling NCDs, HHA’s goal is  
to reach 10 million hypertensive patients across 
sub-Saharan Africa by 2025 – one-quarter of WHO’s 
hypertension target for Africa. 
To design and develop the programme, we  
worked closely with governments, international 
organisations, health experts and non-governmental 
and community-based organisations. Some of  
these organisations, including AMPATH (The 
Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare); 
AMREF Kenya, Africa’s largest international health 
non-governmental organisation; CHAK (Christian 
Health Association of Kenya), a leading national 
faith-based organisation; Jhpiego, a non-profit  
health organisation affiliated with The Johns Hopkins 
University; and Population Services Kenya, are  
now helping to implement HHA. We aim to increase 
the number of HHA-participating organisations and 
partners to support implementation across Kenya 
and Africa. HHA’s independent monitoring and 
evaluation partner, Abt Associates, will support  
and monitor the programme’s progress.

Intellectual Property
A well-functioning system of IP rights, which rewards innovation and underpins 
our business model.
pharmaceutical patent may not be  
marketed for several years after filing due  
to the duration of clinical trials and regulatory 
approval processes. Patent Term 
Extensions (PTE) are available in certain 
major markets, including the EU and the US, 
to compensate for these delays. The term of 
the PTE can vary from zero to five years 
depending on the time taken to obtain any 
marketing approval. The maximum patent 
term, when including PTE, cannot exceed 
15 years (EU) or 14 years (US) from the first 
marketing authorisation.
Patent expiries
The tables on pages 201 and 202 set out 
certain patent expiry dates and sales for our 
key marketed products. 
Other exclusivities
In addition to patent protection, regulatory 
data protection (RDP or ‘data exclusivity’) is 
an important IP right, which arises in respect 
of data which is required to be submitted to 
regulatory authorities to obtain marketing 
approvals for our medicines. Significant 
investment is required to generate such  
data (for example, through conducting 
global clinical trials) and this proprietary data 
is protected from use by third parties (such 
as generic manufacturers) for a number  
of years in a limited number of countries.  
The period of such protection, and the 
extent to which it is respected, differs 
significantly among countries. RDP is an 
important protection for our products,  
and we believe in enforcing our rights  
to it, particularly as patent rights are 
increasingly being challenged.
The RDP period starts from the date of the 
first marketing approval from the relevant 
regulatory authority and runs parallel to any 
pending patent protection. RDP generally 
expires prior to patent expiry in all major 
markets. If a product takes an unusually 
long time to secure marketing approval, or  
if patent protection has not been secured, 
has expired or has been lost, then RDP  
may be the sole IP right protecting a product 
from copying, as generic manufacturers 
should not be allowed to rely on 
AstraZeneca’s data to support the generic 
product’s approval or marketing until the 
RDP right has expired. In the EU, the RDP 
period is eight years followed by two years 
marketing exclusivity. In the US, under the 
Biologics License Application process, the 
FDA will grant 12 years data exclusivity for  
a new biologic to an innovator manufacturer.
In the US, new chemical entities (NCEs) are 
entitled to a period of five years exclusivity 
under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic 
Act. This period of exclusivity runs parallel  
to any pending or granted patent protection 
and starts at the approval of the new 
application. As with RDP , there are 
circumstances where this protection could 
be the sole IP right protecting a product 
from being copied.
Under orphan drug laws in the EU and US, 
exclusivity is granted to an innovator who 
gains approval for a pharmaceutical product 
developed to treat a rare disease. What 
qualifies as a rare condition differs between 
the EU and US, and qualifying orphan drugs 
are granted ten years market exclusivity in 
the EU and seven years market exclusivity  
in the US.
Under the Generating Antibiotics Incentives 
Now Act, the FDA may grant Qualified 
Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) status.  
An antibiotic achieving QIDP status is 
granted five years exclusivity while QIDPs 
that are also NCEs (such as AZD0914) are 
entitled to ten years exclusivity and 12 years 
if the disease state is an orphan. The period 
of exclusivity granted to a product with QIDP 
status runs concurrently with any pending  
or granted patent protection.
Any of these additional protections may be 
challenged by competitors or otherwise lost.
Compulsory licensing
Compulsory licensing (the overruling of 
patent rights to allow patented medicines  
to be manufactured and sold by other 
parties) is increasingly part of the access to 
medicines debate. We recognise the right of 
developing countries to use the flexibilities in 
the World Trade Organization’s Agreement 
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights (TRIPS) (including the Doha 
amendment) in certain circumstances, such 
as a public health emergency. We believe 
this should apply only when all other ways  
of meeting the emergency needs have 
been considered and where healthcare 
frameworks and safeguards exist to ensure 
the medicines reach those who need them.
Discovering and developing medicines 
requires a significant investment of 
resources by research-based 
pharmaceutical companies over ten or more 
years. For this to be a viable investment, 
new medicines must be safeguarded from 
being copied with a reasonable amount of 
certainty for a reasonable period of time.
Our industry’s principal economic safeguard 
is a well-functioning patent system that 
recognises our efforts and rewards 
innovation with appropriate protection, 
allowing time to generate the revenue  
we need to reinvest in pharmaceutical 
innovation. Patent rights are limited by 
territory and duration, and a significant 
portion of a patent’s duration can be spent 
on R&D before it is possible to launch the 
protected product. Therefore, we commit 
significant resources to establishing and 
defending our patent and related IP 
protections for inventions.
Patent process
We file patent protection applications for our 
inventions to safeguard the large investment 
required to obtain marketing approvals for 
potential new drugs. As we further develop  
a product and its uses, new developments 
may be protected by new patent filings. We 
apply for patents via patent offices around the 
world, which assess whether our inventions 
meet the strict legal requirements for a patent 
to be granted. Our competitors can challenge 
our patents in patent offices and/or courts. 
We may face challenges early in the patent 
application process and throughout a patent’s 
life. These challenges can be to the validity  
of a patent and/or its effective scope and are 
based on ever-evolving legal precedents. We 
are experiencing increased challenges in the 
US and elsewhere in the world (such as in 
Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe and 
Japan) and there can be no guarantee of 
success for either party in patent proceedings. 
For information about third party challenges to 
patents protecting our products, see Note 27 
to the Financial Statements from page 182.  
For more information on the risks relating to 
patent litigation and early loss and expiry of 
patents, please see Risk from page 203.
The basic term of a patent is typically 20 
years from the filing of the patent application 
with the relevant government patent office.

Infrastructure
The Group owns and operates R&D and production facilities and conducts sales and 
marketing activities around the world. These activities are supported by significant 
information technology and information services resources.
Manufacturing and supply resources
Our principal small molecule manufacturing 
facilities are in the UK (Avlon and 
Macclesfield), Sweden (Gärtuna and 
Södertälje), the US (Newark, Delaware; 
Westborough, Massachusetts; and West 
Chester, Ohio), China (Wuxi and Taizhou), 
Russia (Vorsino), France (Reims and 
Dunkerque), Japan (Maihara), Australia 
(North Ryde), Indonesia (Jakarta), Egypt 
(Cairo), India (Bangalore), Puerto Rico 
(Canóvanas), Germany (Wedel), Mexico 
(Lomas Verdes), Brazil (Cotia) and Argentina 
(Buenos Aires). 
We operate sites for the manufacture of 
APIs in the UK and Sweden, complemented 
by the efficient use of external sourcing.  
Our principal tablet and capsule formulation 
sites are in the UK, Sweden, Puerto Rico 
and the US. We also have major formulation 
sites for the global supply of parenteral and/
or inhalation products in Sweden, France, 
Australia and the UK. 
For biologics, our principal commercial 
manufacturing facilities are in the US 
(Frederick, Maryland and greater 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), the UK (Speke), 
and the Netherlands (Nijmegen) with 
capabilities in process development, 
manufacturing and distribution of biologics, 
including global supply of MAbs and 
influenza vaccines. 
At the end of 2014, approximately 10,200 
people at 25 sites in 16 countries were 
working on the manufacture and supply  
of our products. 
Information technology and 
information services resources 
At the end of 2014, our IT organisation 
comprised approximately 1,400 people 
across our sites in the UK (Alderley Park  
and Macclesfield), Sweden (Södertälje  
and Mölndal), the US (Wilmington, Delaware 
and Gaithersburg, Maryland), and our  
new technology centre in India (Chennai), 
together with people embedded in our  
R&D and Operations sites, and our key 
marketing companies. 
In the beginning of 2014, we launched a 
wide-ranging IT Transformation Programme 
to better support our business priorities.  
We have made various changes to our 
operating model and organisational 
structure to improve efficiency, 
responsiveness and innovation.
Our IT vision is to deliver world-class 
performance in terms of speed, quality,  
cost and innovation. Achieving this requires 
improving our current performance 
significantly while reducing our overall 
spend. Success in achieving our vision  
will be measured by metrics, which include 
customer satisfaction, the number of 
severe/business impacting incidents, the 
speed with which we respond to and 
mitigate such incidents, and project delivery 
and cost (absolute and as a percentage  
of revenue) as compared with industry 
benchmarks. 
Protecting our IT systems, IP and confidential 
information against cyberattacks is a key 
concern. As such, our IT organisation works 
to develop and implement robust, effective 
and agile risk-based approaches to protect 
our resources and keep pace with the 
rapidly evolving cybersecurity risk landscape. 
To help protect against cybercrime, we have 
adopted a comprehensive cybersecurity 
process and policy, which we regularly 
review and update. Also, we continuously 
monitor our systems and data with 
sophisticated technology, a team of skilled 
IT personnel and various other resources. 
We also educate employees regarding 
cybercrime, internet use and best practices 
to mitigate the risk of an attack.  
R&D resources 
We have approximately 9,000 employees  
in our R&D organisation in various sites 
around the world. Our small molecule  
sites are located in the UK (Alderley Park, 
Cambridge and Macclesfield), Sweden 
(Mölndal), the US (Gaithersburg, Maryland 
and Waltham, Massachusetts), Japan 
(Osaka) and China (Shanghai). Our biologics 
sites are located in the UK (Cambridge)  
and in the US (Gaithersburg, Maryland  
and Mountain View, California). Our 
Gaithersburg, Maryland site focuses on 
late-stage development for small molecules 
and biologics across our entire portfolio. In 
March 2014, we announced the sale of our 
Alderley Park, UK site as part of our plan  
to focus resources on developing our  
new global R&D centre in Cambridge,  
UK. Our strategic expansion in Emerging 
Markets continues and includes the  
ongoing growth of our R&D facility in China 
(Shanghai). In 2014, we closed our R&D  
site in India (Bangalore).

Financial Review
Dear shareholder
In 2014, we continued to balance our 
investment for long-term growth against 
exploiting brand-launch opportunities  
in the short-term. We also continued  
to follow the science and invest in our 
key therapeutic areas.

Our financial performance in 2014 reflected 
continued progress from our growth 
platforms, which grew 15% in the year and 
now contribute 53% of total revenue. 
Brilinta/Brilique showed steady progress 
globally and diabetes growth was strong, 
with a successful Farxiga/Forxiga launch 
and good US Bydureon Pen uptake, 
building further momentum since the 
acquisition of BMS’s share of the global 
diabetes alliance in February 2014. 
Emerging Markets were up 12%, with 
China growth of 22%, making China 
AstraZeneca’s second largest market. 
Investment in business development 
continued to be an important element in 
accelerating the return to growth. In addition 
to the acquisition of the diabetes franchise, 
the strategic transaction with Almirall in 
respiratory disease further builds the scope 
and strength of our respiratory business. 
Overall, the selective investment in our 
growth platforms, which balances both 
strategic initiatives with short-term 
opportunities, increased Core SG&A  
costs by 16% to $10.2 billion in 2014. 
Core R&D expense in the year was up  
15% to $4.9 billion, reflecting the conscious 
investment in our rapidly expanding 
late-stage pipeline, which has yielded an 
industry-leading six NDA/BLA approvals  
in the year.
Core other income in the year was up 64% 
at $1.2 billion, with milestone income related 
to the launch of Nexium OTC being the 
largest driver of the increase.
Core operating profit fell by 13% to 
$6.9 billion. Reported operating profit, at 
$2. 1 billion, was adversely affected by fair 
value and other charges related to the 
acquisition of BMS’s share of the global 
diabetes alliance.
Cash generated from operating activities  
in 2014 was $7 . 1 billion, as we continued  
to focus on freeing up cash and improving 
working capital management. Our robust 
2014 balance sheet was reflected in strong 
investment-grade ratings in the year. We 
ended the year with net debt of $3.2 billion 
while maintaining a significant level of cash 
to give us financial flexibility.

 > The risk of competition from generics 
following loss of patent protection or 
patent expiry of one of our products or  
an ‘at risk’ launch by a competitor or the 
launch of a generic competitor in the 
same class as one of our products, with 
the potential adverse effects on sales 
volumes and prices. Details of patent 
expiries for our key marketed products 
are included in Patent Expiries from  
page 201.
 > The adverse impact on pharmaceutical 
prices as a result of the macroeconomic 
and regulatory environment. For instance, 
although there is no direct governmental 
control on prices in the US, action from 
federal and state programmes and health 
insurance bodies is leading to downward 
pressures on realised prices. In other 
parts of the world, there are a variety of 
price and volume control mechanisms 
and retrospective rebates based on sales 
levels that are imposed by governments. 
 > The timings of new product launches, 
which can be influenced by national 
regulators, and the risk that such new 
products do not succeed as anticipated, 
together with the rate of sales growth and 
costs following new product launches. 
 > Currency fluctuations. Our functional and 
reporting currency is the US dollar, but  
we have substantial exposures to other 
currencies, in particular the euro, 
Japanese yen, pound sterling, Chinese 
renminbi and Swedish krona. 
 > Macro factors such as greater demand 
from an ageing population and increasing 
requirements of Emerging Markets. 
Over the longer term, the success of our 
R&D is crucial and we devote substantial 
resources to this area. The benefits of this 
investment are expected to emerge over the 
long term and there is considerable inherent 
uncertainty as to whether and when it will 
generate future products.
The purpose of this Financial Review is  
to provide a balanced and comprehensive 
analysis of the financial performance of the 
business during 2014, the financial position 
as at the end of the year, and the main 
business factors and trends that could 
affect the future financial performance of  
the business.
All growth rates in this Financial Review are 
expressed at CER unless noted otherwise.
Business background and results 
overview 
The business background is covered in  
the Marketplace section from page 14, the 
Therapy Area Review from page 32 and the 
Geographical Review from page 220, and 
describes in detail the developments in both 
our products and the geographical regions 
in which we operate. 
As described earlier in this Annual Report, 
sales of our products are directly influenced 
by medical need and are generally paid for 
by health insurance schemes or national 
healthcare budgets. Our operating results 
can be affected by a number of factors 
other than the delivery of operating plans 
and normal competition, such as:
The most significant features of our financial 
results in 2014 are:
 > Revenue up 3% to $26,095 million 
(Actual: 1%). 
 > A change in accounting related to the US 
Branded Pharmaceutical Fee reduced 
revenue by $1 13 million; excluding this 
effect, CER growth would have been 4%.
 > Revenues of our growth platforms 
increased 15% in 2014 and constituted 
53% of our total revenue, with
 − Brilinta/Brilique up 70%, reflecting 
continued global progress.
 − Diabetes up 139%, reflecting 100% 
ownership of the diabetes franchise, 
the strong Farxiga/Forxiga launch and 
good uptake of new Bydureon Pen in 
the US.
 − Respiratory up 10%, with Emerging 
Markets growth of 27% and 
decelerating US growth of 15%.
 − Emerging Markets up 12%, with China 
growth of 22%, making China 
AstraZeneca’s second largest market.
 − Japan down 3% due to mandated 
biennial price cuts, increased use of 
generics and a Nexium recall in the 
fourth quarter.
 > Core operating profit was down 13% 
(Actual: 17%) to $6,937 million, as we 
invested in our growth platforms and 
accelerated pipeline.
 > Reported operating profit was down  
31% (Actual: 42%) to $2, 137 million. Total 
restructuring costs associated with the 
global programme to reshape the cost 
base of our business were $1,558 million 
in 2014.
 > Core operating margin of 26.6% of 
revenue was down 5.0 percentage points 
(Actual: 6.0 percentage points). Reported 
operating margin was 8.2% of revenue.
 > Core EPS for the full year was $4.28, 
down 8% (Actual: 15%). The smaller 
decline compared with Core operating 
profit was largely due to a lower tax rate. 
Reported EPS was down 34% (Actual: 
52%) to $0.98.
 > Dividends paid increased to $3,521 million 
(2013: $3,461 million).

 > Constant exchange rate (CER) growth 
rates. These are also non-GAAP 
measures. These measures remove  
the effects of currency movements  
(by retranslating the current year’s 
performance at previous year’s exchange 
rates and adjusting for other exchange 
effects, including hedging). A reconciliation 
of the Reported results adjusted for  
the impact of currency movements is 
provided in the 2014 Reported operating 
profit table on the page opposite. 
 > Gross and operating margin percentages. 
These measures set out the progression 
of key performance margins and illustrate 
the overall quality of the business. 
 > Prescription volumes and trends for key 
products. These measures can represent 
the real business growth and the 
progress of individual products better and 
more immediately than invoiced sales. 
 > Net funds/debt. This represents our cash 
and cash equivalents, current investments 
and derivative financial instruments less 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings. 
CER measures allow us to focus on the 
changes in sales and expenses driven  
by volume, prices and cost levels relative  
to the prior period. Sales and cost growth 
expressed in CER allows management  
to understand the true local movement  
in sales and costs, in order to compare 
recent trends and relative return on 
investment. CER growth rates can be used 
to analyse sales in a number of ways but, 
most often, we consider CER growth by 
products and groups of products, and by 
countries and regions. CER sales growth 
can be further analysed into the impact of 
sales volumes and selling price. Similarly, 
CER cost growth helps us to focus on the 
real local change in costs so that we can 
manage the cost base effectively.
We believe that disclosing Core financial  
and growth measures, in addition to our 
Reported financial information, enhances 
investors’ ability to evaluate and analyse  
the underlying financial performance of  
our ongoing business and the related key 
business drivers. The adjustments made to 
our Reported financial information in order 
to show Core financial measures illustrate 
clearly, on a year-on-year or period-by-
period basis, the impact on our performance 
caused by factors such as changes in sales 
and expenses driven by volume, prices  
and cost levels relative to such prior years  
or periods.
As shown in the 2014 Reconciliation of 
Reported results to Core results table on  
the page opposite, our reconciliation of 
Reported financial information to Core 
financial measures includes a breakdown  
of the items for which our Reported financial 
information is adjusted and a further 
breakdown by specific line item as such 
items are reflected in our Reported income 
statement. This illustrates the significant 
items that are excluded from Core financial 
measures and their impact on our Reported 
financial information, both as a whole and  
in respect of specific line items.
Management presents these results 
externally to meet investors’ requirements 
for transparency and clarity. Core financial 
measures are also used internally in the 
management of our business performance, 
in our budgeting process and when 
determining compensation.
Core financial measures are non-GAAP 
measures. All items for which Core financial 
measures are adjusted are included in  
our Reported financial information as they 
represent actual costs of our business  
in the periods presented. As a result, Core 
financial measures merely allow investors  
to differentiate between different kinds  
of costs and they should not be used in 
isolation. You should also refer to our 
Reported financial information in the 2014 
Reported operating profit table on the page 
opposite, our reconciliation of Core financial 
measures to Reported financial information 
in the Reconciliation of Reported results to 
Core results table on the page opposite, 
and to the Results of operations – summary 
analysis of year to 31 December 2013 
section from page 229 for our discussion of 
comparative Actual growth measures that 
reflect all factors that affect our business. 
Our determination of non-GAAP measures, 
and our presentation of them within this 
financial information, may differ from  
similarly titled non-GAAP measures of  
other companies.
The SET retains strategic management of 
the costs excluded from Reported financial 
information in arriving at Core financial 
measures, tracking their impact on 
Reported operating profit and EPS, with 
operational management being delegated 
on a case-by-case basis to ensure clear 
accountability and consistency for each 
cost category.
Measuring performance
The following measures are referred to in 
this Financial Review when reporting on our 
performance both in absolute terms, but 
more often in comparison to earlier years:
 > Reported performance. Reported 
performance takes into account all the 
factors (including those which we cannot 
influence, principally currency exchange 
rates) that have affected the results of  
our business, as reflected in our Group 
Financial Statements prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU and as issued by the IASB. 
 > Core financial measures. These are 
non-GAAP measures because, unlike 
Reported performance, they cannot  
be derived directly from the information  
in the Group’s Financial Statements. 
These measures are adjusted to exclude 
certain significant items, such as
 − amortisation and impairment of 
intangibles, including impairment 
reversals but excluding any charges 
relating to IT assets
 − charges and provisions related to our 
global restructuring programmes (this 
will include such charges that relate to 
the impact of our global restructuring 
programmes on our capitalised IT 
assets) 
 − other specified items, principally 
comprising legal settlements and 
acquisition-related costs, which include 
fair value adjustments and the imputed 
finance charge relating to contingent 
consideration. 
 In determining the adjustments to arrive  
at the Core result, we use a set of 
established principles relating to the 
nature and materiality of individual items 
or groups of items, excluding, for 
example, events that (i) are outside the 
normal course of business, (ii) are incurred 
in a pattern that is unrelated to the trends 
in the underlying financial performance of 
our ongoing business, or (iii) are related to 
major acquisitions, to ensure that 
investors’ ability to evaluate and analyse 
the underlying financial performance of 
our ongoing business is enhanced. See 
the 2014 Reconciliation of Reported 
results to Core results table on the 
opposite page for a reconciliation of 
Reported to Core performance. 
72 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 US revenue was up 4% (Actual: 4%) to 
$10, 120 million, with Europe down 1% 
(Actual: flat) at $6,638 million. Established 
ROW was down 4% (Actual: 12%) at  
$3,510 million. Emerging Markets were up 
12% (Actual: 8%) to $5,827 million, mainly 
driven by growth in China of 22% (Actual: 
22%) to $2,242 million. China became our 
second largest market in 2014. Further 
details of our sales performance are 
contained in the Geographical Review  
from page 220.
In mid 2014, the US Internal Revenue 
Service issued final regulations that affected 
how the annual US Branded Pharmaceutical 
Fee, imposed by the healthcare reform 
legislation in 2010, is recognised. Under  
the new regulations, the fee will be based  
on actual sales in the current year, which 
necessitated an additional year’s charge  
to be recognised in 2014. In line with other 
pharmaceutical industry peers, we 
previously accrued for this charge based on 
prior year’s sales and recorded the charge 
as a cost in SG&A. The final regulation has 
two impacts on the Group’s results:
As detailed above, all growth rates in this 
section are expressed at CER unless  
noted otherwise.
Revenue for the year was up 3% at CER to 
$26,095 million (up 1% on an Actual basis). 
Accelerating performance of the Group’s 
growth platforms (as defined on page 1 1) 
more than offset the impact of volume 
erosion on mature brands including  
Nexium in the US and pricing pressures  
in Established Markets. Excluding the 
additional revenue from the acquisition  
of BMS’s share of the global diabetes 
alliance and the impact of the US Branded 
Pharmaceutical Fee restatement as detailed 
below, revenue was stable.

was greater than the decline in revenue 
primarily due to expenditure associated with 
the Group’s key growth platforms and 
strengthened pipeline.
Core EPS was $4.28, down 8% compared 
with last year (Actual: 15%). The smaller 
decline in Core EPS compared with Core 
operating profit was largely due to a lower 
tax rate. This favourable tax effect was 
partially offset by an increase in the number 
of shares outstanding and a marginally 
higher Core finance expense in the year 
compared with the prior year.
Pre-tax adjustments to arrive at Core profit 
before tax amounted to $5, 192 million in 
2014 (2013: $4,678 million), comprising 
$4,800 million adjustments to operating 
profit (2013: $4,678 million) and $392 million 
to net finance expenses (2013: $nil). 
Excluded from Core results were: 
 > Restructuring costs totalling $1,558 million 
(2013: $1,421 million), incurred as the 
Group continued the fourth phase of 
restructuring announced in March  
2013. Restructuring costs included  
a $292 million loss on disposal of our 
Alderley Park site. Further details of our 
restructuring programme are given below. 
 > Amortisation totalling $1,784 million (2013: 
$1,591 million) relating to intangible 
assets, except those related to IT and our 
acquisition of BMS’s share of the global 
diabetes alliance (which are separately 
detailed below). The increase was driven 
by amortisation charges in connection 
with our Merck exit arrangements. Further 
information on our intangible assets is 
contained in Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements from page 153.
 > Intangible impairment charges of 
$99 million (2013: net $1,712 million, 
including a $1,758 million impairment 
relating to Bydureon). Further details 
relating to intangible asset impairments 
are included in Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements from page 153.
 > Costs associated with our acquisition  
of BMS’s share of the global diabetes 
alliance amounting to $1,423 million. 
Included within this are $407 million  
of amortisation charges, a contingent 
consideration fair value uplift charge of 
$529 million reflecting higher expected 
diabetes portfolio revenues following  
the successful integration of the newly 
acquired elements, and $345 million of 
interest charges relating to a discount 
unwind on contingent consideration 
arising on the acquisition (as detailed  
in Note 18 to the Financial Statements  
on page 161). 
 > Net legal provisions and other charges  
of $328 million (2013: income of 
$46 million), including a $201 million 
charge for the additional year’s US 
Branded Pharmaceutical Fee (as detailed 
above) and $47 million discount unwind 
charges relating to contingent 
consideration arising on our other 
business combinations (as detailed  
in Note 18 to the Financial Statements  
on page 161).
Reported operating profit for the year  
was down 31% at CER (Actual: 42%) to 
$2, 137 million. Reported EPS was down 
34% (Actual: 52%) to $0.98. The larger 
declines compared with the respective Core 
financial measures are mainly the result of 
our enhanced business acquisition activities, 
including our acquisition of BMS’s share  
of the global diabetes alliance, offset by 
reduced impairment charges in 2014.
Reported net finance expense was 
$885 million (2013: $445 million). The 
increase was driven by $453 million  
(2013: $nil) for discount unwinds on 
contingent consideration arising on 
business combinations ($391 million)  
and other long-term liabilities ($62 million).
The Reported taxation charge of $1 1 million 
(2013: $696 million), consisted of a current 
tax charge of $872 million (2013: 
$1,398 million) and a credit arising from 
movements on deferred tax of $861 million 
(2013: $702 million). The current tax charge 
includes a prior period current tax credit of 
$109 million (2013: charge of $46 million).
The tax paid for the year was $1,201 million, 
which is 96% of Reported profit and 19%  
of Core profit.
The Reported tax rate for the year was 0.9% 
(2013: 21.3%). This Reported tax rate of 
0.9% was impacted by a one-off benefit  
of $1 17 million in respect of the inter-
governmental agreement of a transfer 
pricing matter, the non-Core impact of the 
revaluation of the fair value of contingent 
consideration arising on business 
combinations (charge of $512 million with 
related tax credit of $157 million), and the 
benefit of the UK Patent Box legislation 
($35 million). Excluding these effects, the 
Reported tax rate for the year would have 
been 18.2%. The Core tax rate for the year 
was 16.2%. Excluding the benefit from the 
transfer pricing agreement and Patent Box, 
 > As the fee is now calculated on actual 
sales in the current year, AstraZeneca 
considers it more appropriate to account 
for the fee as a deduction from Revenue 
rather than a charge to SG&A. The new 
legislation is effective from July 2014 and, 
therefore, AstraZeneca has treated the 
charge for the period since July 2014 as  
a deduction from Revenue rather than  
as a cost in SG&A. In 2014, this had the 
effect of reducing revenue by $1 13 million. 
This presentational change to the income 
statement had no impact on earnings for 
the year.
 > We recorded a catch-up full annual 
charge to SG&A, reflecting this new basis, 
in 2014. The additional year’s charge was 
excluded from Core financial measures as 
detailed below.
Core gross margin as a percentage of 
revenue was 81.3% in the year, 0.4 
percentage points lower than last year at 
CER (Actual: 0.7 percentage points), as the 
effect of an unfavourable product mix, 
including additional costs associated with 
the diabetes brands, more than offset the 
benefit of a lower Crestor royalty. 
Core R&D expense in the year was up 15% 
(Actual: 16%) to $4,941 million, reflecting 
increased spend on our late-stage pipeline. 
Expenditures in Core SG&A were up 16% 
(Actual: 15%) to $10,216 million, driven by 
investments in sales and marketing 
dedicated to the Group’s growth platforms. 
The acquisitions of BMS’s share of the 
diabetes alliance and the rights to Almirall’s 
respiratory franchise added approximately 
4, 100 employees. We have approximately 
34,800 employees working in Sales and 
Marketing compared to 29,600 in the prior 
year. The selective investment in our growth 
platforms is partially funded by a decline in 
G&A costs during the year.
Core other income in the year was up 64% 
(Actual: 61%) at $1,21 1 million which, in 
addition to royalty income of $586 million, 
includes milestone income of $200 million 
on the US launch and $50 million on the 
European launch of Nexium OTC, and  
$80 million of income in relation to the 
Japanese launch of Forxiga.
Core operating profit in the year was down 
13% to $6,937 million. Core operating 
margin was 26.6% of revenue, down 5.0 
percentage points (Actual: 6.0 percentage 
points). The decline in Core operating profit

74 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 completed in 2009. The second phase 
began in 2010 and the restructuring actions 
were completed in 201 1.
In March 2013, we announced a 
restructuring programme which was 
combined with the third phase of the 
programme announced in February 2012 to 
create a combined Phase 4 programme. It 
initially entailed an estimated global 
headcount reduction of about 5,050 over 
the 2013 to 2016 period. The combined 
programme of changes was estimated to 
incur $2.3 billion in one-time restructuring 
charges, of which $1.7 billion were expected 
to be cash costs. The overall Phase 4 
programme remains on track to deliver 
approximately $800 million anticipated 
annual benefits by the end of 2016.
The Phase 4 programme was expanded in 
2013 to include additional activities, such as 
a transformation of our IT organisation and 
infrastructure, the exit of R&D activities in 
Bangalore, India, and the exit from branded 
generics in certain Emerging Markets to 
further reduce costs and increase flexibility. 
When completed, the expansion of the 
restructuring programme is expected to 
deliver a further $300 million in annual 
benefits by the end of 2016, bringing total 
anticipated annualised benefits of the  
Phase 4 programme to $1. 1 billion. Total 
incremental programme costs from these 
new initiatives were estimated to be  
$700 million, of which $600 million is cash, 
bringing the total anticipated cost of our 
Phase 4 programme to $3.2 billion. The 
expansion of the programme is estimated to 
affect approximately 550 positions, bringing 
the total global headcount reduction under 
the Phase 4 programme to around 5,600 
over the 2013 to 2016 period. 
Restructuring charges of $1,558 million were 
taken in 2014. The Group is making good 
progress in implementing the fourth phase 
of restructuring announced in the first 
quarter of 2013 and the expansion of this 
programme announced in the first half of 
2014. In addition to costs of this programme, 
the restructuring charge for the year 
includes $261 million incurred on integration 
of businesses acquired in the year and  
as a result of our decision to exit the 
Westborough site. 
Final estimates for programme costs, 
benefits and headcount impact in all 
functions are subject to completion of  
the requisite consultation in the various 
areas. Our priority as we undertake these 
restructuring initiatives is to work with  
our affected employees on the proposed 
changes, acting in accordance with  
relevant local consultation requirements  
and employment law.
the Core tax rate would have been 18.5%. 
Further details relating to movements in our 
taxation balances are included in Note 4 to 
the Financial Statements from page 145.
Reported post tax profit for the year was 
$1,235 million, a decrease of 34% (Actual: 
52%). Reported EPS was down 34% 
(Actual: 52%) to $0.98.
Total comprehensive income decreased 
by $2,729 million from the prior year, 
resulting in a loss of $271 million. This was 
driven by the decrease in profit for the 
year of $1,336 million, and a decrease of 
$1,393 million in other comprehensive 
income driven by movements in exchange 
rates in our consolidated results of  
$1,352 million, principally due to the 
strengthening of the US dollar against 
pound sterling, the euro and krona, and 
losses on the remeasurement of our defined 
benefit pension liability of $766 million in 
accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 
‘Employee Benefits’ (driven by a reduction 
in the discount rate applied to our pension 
liabilities partially offset by actuarial gains 
on our scheme assets).
Restructuring 
Since 2007 , we have undertaken significant 
efforts to restructure and reshape our 
business to improve long-term 
competitiveness. The first phase was

($2,703 million), the rights to Almirall’s 
respiratory franchise ($876 million) and  
the acquisition of Definiens ($150 million). 
The comparative period of 2013 included 
payments on the completion of the 
acquisitions of Pearl Therapeutics, Omthera, 
Amplimmune and Spirogen. Further details 
of our 2014 business acquisitions and their 
impact on our cash flows and balance sheet 
are given below. Investment cash outflows 
also include $657 million (2013: $nil) of 
payments against contingent consideration 
arising on business combinations and 
$1,740 million (2013: $1,316 million) for the 
purchase of other intangible assets, which 
included a $409 million payment to Merck 
on the consummation of our Second Option 
(as detailed in Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements from page 153) and $310 million 
on the settlement of pre-existing launch- 
and sales-related milestones with BMS (as 
detailed in Note 24 to the Financial 
Statements on page 170). 
Net cash distributions to shareholders were 
$3,242 million (2013: $2,979 million), through 
dividends of $3,521 million (2013: 
$3,461 million) partially offset by proceeds 
from the issue of shares of $279 million 
(2013: $482 million) due to the exercise of 
share options. 
At 31 December 2014, outstanding gross 
debt (interest-bearing loans and borrowings) 
was $10,843 million (2013: $10,376 million). 
Of the gross debt outstanding at 31 
December 2014, $2,446 million is due within 
one year (2013: $1,788 million). 
Net debt at 31 December 2014 was 
$3,223 million, compared to a net funds 
position of $39 million at the beginning of 
the year, as a result of the net cash outflow 
as described above.
Off-balance sheet transactions and 
commitments 
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements 
and our derivative activities are non-
speculative. The table below sets out our 
minimum contractual obligations at the  
year end.
Net cash generated from operating  
activities was $7 ,058 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2014, compared with 
$7 ,400 million in 2013. Reductions in 
working capital partially offset the lower 
operating profit and higher tax payments.
Working capital movements were principally 
driven by general increases in trade 
payables and accruals as a result of our 
increased R&D and SG&A spend, an 
increase in the US rebate and chargeback 
liabilities as described on page 82, an 
additional year’s Branded Pharmaceutical 
Fee and a reduction in trade receivables 
principally in Japan and the US.
Non-cash and other movements include 
$512 million relating to fair value adjustments 
on contingent consideration arising from 
business combinations. 
Investment cash outflows of $7 , 125 million 
(2013: $3, 1 12 million) included $3,804 million 
(2013: $1, 158 million) on completion of

In 2014, net assets decreased by

decrease in net assets is broadly due to  
dividends of $3,532 million and adverse 
movements on exchange taken to reserves 
of $1,352 million, partially offset by the 
Group profit of $1,235 million.
Business combinations 
In 2014, we completed three business 
combinations
 > The acquisition of BMS’s share of the 
global diabetes alliance 
 > The acquisition of the rights to Almirall’s 
respiratory franchise
 > The acquisition of Definiens.
These acquisitions had a significant effect 
on the Group’s balance sheet (and the 
results for the year as detailed above). 
Assets and liabilities acquired, and 
consideration for the acquisitions, are 
summarised overleaf.
Each acquisition included elements of 
consideration that are contingent on future 
development and/or sales milestones,  
with both the diabetes and respiratory 
acquisitions also including royalty payments 
linked to future revenues. Our agreement 
with BMS provides for potential further 
payments of up to $1.4 billion for future 
regulatory, launch- and sales-related 
milestones, and various sales-related royalty 
payments up until 2025. Our transaction 
with Almirall includes further payments of  
up to $1.2 billion for future development, 
launch, and sales-related milestones and 
various other sales-related payments. All 
these future payments are treated as 
contingent consideration on our balance 
sheet, and are fair-valued using decision  
tree analyses, with key inputs including the 
probability of success, the potential for 
delays and the expected levels of future 
revenues. The fair value is updated at each 
balance sheet reporting date to reflect our 
latest estimate of the probabilities of these 
key inputs. Given the long-term nature  
of our contingent consideration payments,  
the fair value calculation includes the 
discounting of future potential payments  
to their present value using discount rates 
appropriate to the period over which 
payments are likely to be made. Both  
the unwind of this discount, and any 
movements of the fair value of the 
underlying future payments, can result in 
significant income statement movements. 
As detailed in the Results of operations 
section on page 74, these movements are 
treated as non-Core items in our income 
statement analysis. In 2014, we recorded an 
interest charge of $391 million on the 
discount unwind on contingent 
consideration arising on our business 
combinations, and a net fair value uplift on 
contingent consideration of $512 million 
(which resulted in a charge to our income 
statement for the same amount) driven, 
principally, by an improved forecast for 
revenues for our diabetes franchise  
following the successful integration of  
BMS’s share of the former diabetes alliance. 
At 31 December 2014, the contingent 
consideration amount held on the balance 
sheet amounted to $6,899 million (2013: 
$514 million), as detailed in Note 18 to the 
Financial Statements on page 161. Further 
details of the business combinations, 
including the strategic background to the 
transactions, and details of certain ongoing 
relationships with BMS, are included in  
Note 24 to the Financial Statements from 
page 170.

Financial Review continued
Intangible assets amounted to 
$20,981 million at 31 December 2014  
(2013: $16,047 million). Intangible  
asset additions were $8,548 million  
in 2014 (2013: $3,217 million), including  
product and other rights acquired in  
our acquisitions of $7 ,501 million (2013: 
$2,416 million). Amortisation in the year  
was $2,384 million (2013: $1,779 million). 
Impairment charges in the year amounted  
to $122 million (2013: $2,082 million). 
Further details of our additions to intangible 
assets, and impairments recorded, are 
included in Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements from page 153. 
Receivables, payables and provisions
Trade receivables decreased by $752 million 
to $4,762 million principally driven by 
reductions in Japan and the US.
Prepayments and accrued income 
decreased by $928 million. As detailed in 
our 2013 Annual Report, in 2013, we 
modified the royalty structure under our 
global licence agreement for Crestor , which 
was amended to include fixed minimum and 
maximum annual royalty payments to 
Shionogi. These future royalties were 
recognised within payables and as a 
prepayment. The reduction in prepayments  
in 2014 is driven by the payment of one 
year’s royalties under this revised 
agreement, along with a transfer of 
$350 million from prepayments to property, 
plant and equipment as detailed above.
Trade and other payables increased by 
$7 , 163 million in 2014 to $19,877 million, with 
increases of $993 million in trade payables, 
$677 million of rebates and chargebacks, 
and $5,781 million in other payables, 
including an increase of $6,385 million in 
contingent consideration offset by a 
reduction of one year’s Shionogi royalty 
payments. The increase in trade payables 
was driven by our increased in-year R&D 
and SG&A spend in the latter part of the 
year. The rebates and chargebacks balance 
includes an additional year’s US Branded 
Pharmaceutical Fee. The increase in 
contingent consideration is shown in the 
table below.
The decrease in provisions of $282 million  
in 2014 included $633 million of cash 
payments, partially offset by $434 million  
of additional charges recorded in the year. 
Included within the $434 million of charges 
for the year were $254 million for our global 
restructuring initiative and $91 million in 
respect of legal charges. Cash payments 
included $472 million for our global 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment increased  
by $192 million to $6,010 million. Additions 
of $1,607 million (2013: $816 million), 
including $515 million (2013: $8 million) 
arising on business combinations, were 
offset by depreciation of $776 million (2013: 
$906 million) and disposals of $582 million 
(2013: $82 million). Property, plant and 
equipment also increased due to the 
transfer of a prepayment balance of 
$350 million, which related to amounts  
paid to BMS for fixed assets under our 
previous joint operation with BMS; with  
the acquisition of BMS’s interest in the 
diabetes franchise we acquired the 
underlying property, plant and equipment  
to which this prepayment related. 
Goodwill and intangible assets
The Group’s goodwill of $1 1,550 million 
(2013: $9,981 million) principally arose on 
the acquisition of MedImmune in 2007 and 
the restructuring of our US joint venture with 
Merck in 1998. Goodwill of $1,841 million 
arising on our acquisitions of BMS’s share  
of the global diabetes alliance ($1,530 million) 
and the rights to Almirall’s respiratory 
franchise ($31 1 million), as detailed in Note 
24 to the Financial Statements from page 
170, was capitalised in 2014.

accordance with the accounting policies 
described in the Financial Statements in  
the Group Accounting Policies section from 
page 138. The Group also has taxation 
contingencies. These are described in the 
Taxation section in the Critical accounting 
policies and estimates section on page 85 
and in Note 27 to the Financial Statements 
on page 187 .
Research and development collaboration 
payments
Details of future potential R&D collaboration 
payments are also included in Note 27  
to the Financial Statements from page 182. 
As detailed in Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements, payments to our collaboration 
partners may not become payable due to 
the inherent uncertainty in achieving the 
development and revenue milestones linked 
to the future payments. As part of our overall 
externalisation strategy, we may enter into 
further collaboration projects in the future 
that may include milestone payments and, 
therefore, as certain milestone payments  
fail to crystallise due to, for example, 
development not proceeding, they may be 
replaced by potential payments under new 
collaborations.
Investments, divestments and capital 
expenditure 
The Group has completed over 180 major 
or strategically important business 
development transactions over the past 
three years, eight of which were accounted 
for as business acquisitions under IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’, being the 
acquisitions of BMS’s share of the global 
diabetes alliance, the rights to Almirall’s 
respiratory franchise and the acquisition  
of Definiens in 2014; Pearl Therapeutics, 
Omthera, Amplimmune and Spirogen in 
2013; and Ardea in 2012, and all others 
being in-licences, strategic alliances and 
collaborations. Further details of our 
business acquisitions in the past three years 
are contained in Note 24 to the Financial 
Statements from page 170. Details of our 
significant externalisation transactions are 
given below:
 > In September 2014, AstraZeneca and  
Lilly entered into an agreement to jointly 
develop and commercialise AZD3293,  
an oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme 
(BACE) inhibitor currently in development 
as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s 
disease. AZD3293 is an oral, potent and 
selective small molecule inhibitor of BACE 
that has been shown in Phase I studies  
to significantly and dose-dependently 
reduce levels of amyloid beta in the 
cerebro-spinal fluid of Alzheimer’s patients 
and healthy volunteers. Under the  
terms of the agreement, Lilly will pay 
AstraZeneca up to $500 million in 
development and regulatory milestone 
payments. AstraZeneca expects to 
receive the first milestone payment of 
$50 million in the first half of 2015.  
The companies will equally share all  
future costs for the development and 
commercialisation of AZD3293, as well  
as net global revenues post-launch. Lilly 
will lead clinical development, working 
with researchers from AstraZeneca’s 
Innovative Medicines Unit for 
neuroscience, while AstraZeneca will  
be responsible for manufacturing. The 
companies will take joint responsibility  
for commercialisation of AZD3293.
 > In April 2014, AstraZeneca entered into  
a joint venture agreement with Samsung 
Biologics Co. Ltd to develop a biosimilar 
using the combined capabilities of the two 
parties. The agreement resulted in the 
formation of a joint venture entity based  
in the UK, Archigen Biotech Limited, with 
a branch in South Korea. AstraZeneca 
contributed $70 million in cash to the joint 
venture entity and has a 50% interest in 
the joint venture. Further financial details 
are contained in Note 10 to the Financial 
Statements on page 157 .
 > In March 2013, AstraZeneca signed  
an exclusive agreement with Moderna 
Therapeutics to discover, develop  
and commercialise pioneering  
medicines based on messenger RNA 
Therapeutics for the treatment of serious 
cardiovascular, metabolic and renal 
diseases as well as cancer. Under the 
terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca 
made an upfront payment of $240 million. 
AstraZeneca will have exclusive access  
to select any target of its choice in 
cardiometabolic and renal diseases,  
as well as selected targets in oncology, 
over a period of up to five years for 
subsequent development of messenger 
RNA Therapeutics. In addition, Moderna 
Therapeutics is entitled to an additional 
restructuring programme. Further details  
of the charges made against provisions  
are contained in Notes 19 and 27 to the 
Financial Statements on page 162, and 182  
to 187 , respectively.
Tax payable and receivable
Net income tax payable has decreased by 
$557 million to $2,025 million, principally  
due to cash tax timing differences, foreign 
exchange and a $1 17 million adjustment  
in respect of prior periods following the 
settlement of the inter-governmental 
agreement of a transfer pricing matter.  
The tax receivable balance of $329 million 
(2013: $494 million) comprises tax owing  
to AstraZeneca from certain governments 
expected to be received on settlements of 
transfer pricing audits and disputes (see 
Note 27 to the Financial Statements from 
page 182) and cash tax timing differences. 
Net deferred tax liabilities decreased by 
$1,045 million in the year mainly due to a 
reversal of taxable temporary differences. 
Additional information on the movement in 
deferred tax balances is contained in Note 4 
to the Financial Statements from page 145.
Retirement benefit obligations
Net retirement benefit obligations increased 
by $690 million in 2014. Employer 
contributions to the pension scheme of 
$184 million and beneficial exchange 
movements of $268 million were offset by 
service cost charges of $221 million, net 
financing costs of $92 million and net 
remeasurement adjustments of $766 million, 
driven by a reduction in the discount rate 
applied to our pension liabilities under IAS 
19 partially offset by actuarial gains on our 
scheme assets.
Approximately 97% of the Group’s 
obligations are concentrated in the UK, the 
US, Sweden and Germany. In recent years, 
the Group has undertaken several initiatives 
to reduce its net pension obligation 
exposure. For the UK defined benefit 
pension scheme, which is AstraZeneca’s 
largest defined benefit scheme, these 
initiatives have included agreeing funding 
principles for cash contributions to be paid 
into the UK pension scheme to target a level 
of assets in excess of the current expected 
cost of providing benefits, and, in 2010, 
amendments to the scheme to freeze 
pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels. In 
addition to the cash contributions to be paid 
into the UK pension scheme, AstraZeneca 
makes contributions to an escrow account, 
which is held outside the pension scheme. 
The escrow account assets are payable to 
the fund in agreed circumstances, for

Japan, Europe, the CIS, the Middle East 
and South Africa, which are covered by 
an existing agreement between FibroGen 
and Astellas. The AstraZeneca-FibroGen 
joint effort will be focused on the 
development of roxadustat to treat 
anaemia in CKD and ESRD, and may be 
extended to other anaemia indications. 
AstraZeneca and FibroGen plan to 
undertake an extensive roxadustat Phase 
III development programme for the US, 
and to initiate Phase III trials in China, with 
anticipated regulatory filings in China in 
2016 and in the US in 2018. Under the 
arrangement, AstraZeneca agreed to pay 
FibroGen upfront and subsequent 
non-contingent payments totalling  
$350 million, as well as potential 
development-related milestone payments 
of up to $465 million, and potential future 
sales-related milestone payments, in 
addition to tiered royalty payments on 
future sales of roxadustat in the low 20% 
range. Additional development milestones 
will be payable for any subsequent 
indications which the companies choose 
to pursue. AstraZeneca will be 
responsible for the US commercialisation 
of roxadustat, with FibroGen undertaking 
specified promotional activities in the 
ESRD segment in this market. The 
companies will also co-commercialise 
roxadustat in China where FibroGen will 
be responsible for clinical trials, regulatory 
matters, manufacturing and medical 
affairs, and AstraZeneca will oversee 
promotional activities and commercial 
distribution. 
 > In April 2012, AstraZeneca announced  
an agreement to jointly develop and 
commercialise five monoclonal antibodies 
from Amgen’s clinical inflammation 
portfolio: AMG 139, AMG 157 , AMG 181, 
AMG 557 and brodalumab (AMG 827). 
Under the terms of the agreement, 
AstraZeneca made a $50 million upfront 
payment and the companies share both 
costs and profits. Approximately 65%  
of costs for the 2012 to 2014 period are 
funded by AstraZeneca. Thereafter,  
the companies will split costs equally.  
In addition, AstraZeneca will make 
development milestone payments up  
to launch. On commercialisation, Amgen 
will retain a low single-digit royalty for 
brodalumab and a mid single-digit royalty 
for the rest of the portfolio after which the 
companies will share profits equally.
The Group determines the above business 
development transactions to be significant 
using a range of factors. We look at the 
specific circumstances of the individual 
externalisation arrangement and apply 
$180 million for the achievement of three 
technical milestones. Through this 
agreement, AstraZeneca has the option 
to select up to 40 drug products for 
clinical development and Moderna 
Therapeutics will be entitled to 
development and commercial milestone 
payments as well as royalties on drug 
sales. AstraZeneca will lead the 
pre-clinical, clinical development and 
commercialisation of therapeutics 
resulting from the agreement and 
Moderna Therapeutics will be responsible 
for designing and manufacturing the 
messenger RNA Therapeutics against 
selected targets. AstraZeneca is currently 
progressing 19 projects across CVMD 
and Oncology. Utilising both companies’ 
expertise, significant progress has also 
been made to the technology platform, 
with the focus on formulation, safety, and 
drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics.
 > In July 2013, AstraZeneca entered into a 
strategic collaboration with FibroGen to 
develop and commercialise roxadustat 
(FG-4592), a first-in-class oral compound 
in late-stage development for the 
treatment of anaemia associated with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This 
broad collaboration focuses on the US,

October 2012.
Future prospects 
As outlined earlier in this Annual Report,  
our strategy is focused on innovation and 
returning to growth. In support of this,  
we made certain choices around our  
three strategic priorities. We described  
our immediate priorities, mid-term goals  
and long-term aspirations. 
As we experience a period of patent 
expiries: 
 > Our immediate priorities are to drive our 
on-market revenues through investment 
in our growth platforms and portfolio  
of on-market brands. These include 
products in our three main therapy areas, 
and a focus on the Emerging Markets and 
Japan. We are also pursuing business 
development and investment in R&D.  
We have already accelerated a number  
of projects and progressed them into 
Phase III development.
 > Our mid-term goals to 2016 are to 
progress our Phase II pipeline and to 
exploit the potential of our biologics 
portfolio. 
 > Our long-term aspiration to 2020 and 
beyond, in line with our strategic ambition, 
is to achieve scientific leadership and 
sustainable growth, including the launch 
of two NMEs annually. 
We expect 2015 revenue to decline by mid 
single-digit percent at CER compared to 
2014. Consistent with its business model, 
the Company will continue to seek 
externalisation revenue from partnerships 
and licensing select products and 
technologies. Core EPS is expected to 
increase in 2015 by low single-digit percent 
at CER.
Financial risk management
Financial risk management policies
Insurance
Our risk management processes are 
described in Risk from page 203. These 
processes enable us to identify risks that 
can be partly or entirely mitigated through 
the use of insurance. We negotiate the best 
available premium rates with insurance 
providers on the basis of our extensive risk 
management procedures. In the current 
insurance market, the level of cover is 
decreasing while premium rates are 
increasing. Rather than simply paying higher 
premiums for lower cover, we focus our 
insurance resources on the most critical 
areas, or where there is a legal requirement, 
and where we can get best value for money. 
Risks to which we pay particular attention 
include business interruption, Directors’  
and Officers’ liability, and property damage. 
Insurance for product liability has not been 
available on commercially acceptable terms 
for several years and the Group has not 
purchased in the market product liability 
insurance since February 2006.
Taxation
Tax risk management forms an integrated 
part of the Group’s risk management 
processes. Our tax strategy is to manage 
tax risks and tax costs in a manner 
consistent with shareholders’ best long-term 
interests, taking into account both economic 
and reputational factors. We draw a 
distinction between tax planning using 
artificial structures and optimising tax 
treatment of business transactions, and  
we engage only in the latter. 
Treasury
The principal financial risks to which the 
Group is exposed are those arising from 
liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency  
and credit. The Group has a centralised 
treasury function to manage these risks in 
accordance with Board-approved policies. 
Specifically, liquidity risk is managed through 
maintaining access to a number of sources 
of funding to meet anticipated funding 
requirements, including committed bank 
facilities and cash resources. Interest rate 
risk is managed through maintaining a debt 
portfolio that is weighted towards fixed rates 
of interest. Accordingly, the Group’s net 
interest charge is not significantly affected 
by movements in floating rates of interest. 
We monitor the impact of currency on a 
portfolio basis (to recognise correlation 
effect), and may hedge to protect against 
significant adverse impacts on cash flow 
over the short- to medium-term. We also 
hedge the currency exposure that arises 
between the booking and settlement dates 
on non-local currency purchases and sales 
by subsidiaries and the external dividend. 
Credit risk is managed through setting and 
monitoring credit limits appropriate for the 
assessed risk of the counterparty.
Our capital and risk management objectives 
and policies are described in further detail  
in Note 25 to the Financial Statements  
from page 174 and in Risk from page 203.
several quantitative and qualitative  
criteria. Because we consider business 
development transactions to be an 
extension of our R&D strategy, the expected 
total value of development payments under 
the transaction and its proportion of our 
annual R&D spend, both of which are 
proxies for overall R&D effort and cost,  
are important elements of the significance 
determination. Other quantitative criteria we 
apply include, without limitation, expected 
levels of future sales, the possible value of 
milestone payments and the resources used 
for commercialisation activities (for example, 
the number of staff). Qualitative factors we 
consider include, without limitation, new 
market developments, new territories, new 
areas of research and strategic implications.
In aggregate, payments capitalised under 
the Group’s externalisation arrangements, 
other than those detailed above, amounted 
to $201 million in 2014, $301 million in 2013, 
and $156 million in 2012. The Group 
recognised other income in respect of other 
externalisation arrangements totalling  
$400 million in 2014, including $250 million 
of income from an agreement with Pfizer for 
OTC rights for Nexium, $20 million in 2013 
and $255 million in 2012.
Capitalisation
The total number of shares in issue at 31 
December 2014 was 1,263 million (2013: 
1,257 million). Six million Ordinary Shares 
were issued in consideration of share option 
exercises for a total of $279 million. 
Shareholders’ equity decreased by  
$3,597 million to $19,627 million at the year 
end. Non-controlling interests decreased  
to $19 million (2013: $29 million).
Dividend and share repurchases
The Board has recommended a second 
interim dividend of $1.90 (125.0 pence, 
15.62 SEK) to be paid on 23 March 2015. 
This brings the full year dividend to $2.80 
(178. 1 pence, 21.82 SEK).
This dividend is consistent with the 
progressive dividend policy, by which the 
Board intends to maintain or grow the 
dividend each year.
The Board regularly reviews its distribution 
policy and its overall financial strategy to 
continue to strike a balance between the 
interests of the business, our financial 
creditors and our shareholders. Having 
regard for business investment, funding the 
progressive dividend policy and meeting our 
debt service obligations, the Board currently

programmes (Medicaid ‘best price’ 
contracts, supplemental rebates etc). 
They can be classified as follows:
 > Chargebacks, where we enter into 
arrangements under which certain 
parties, typically hospitals, long-term care 
facilities, group purchasing organisations, 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, Public 
Health Service Covered Entities and the 
Department of Defense, are able to buy 
products from wholesalers at the lower 
prices we have contracted with them.  
The chargeback is the difference between 
the price we invoice to the wholesaler  
and the contracted price charged by the 
wholesaler. Chargebacks are paid directly 
to the wholesalers.
 > Regulatory, including Medicaid and other 
federal and state programmes, where we 
pay rebates based on the specific terms 
of agreements with the US Department  
of Health and Human Services and with 
individual states, which include product 
usage and information on best prices  
and average market prices benchmarks.
 > Contractual, under which entities such as 
third party managed-care organisations 
are entitled to rebates depending on 
specified performance provisions, which 
vary from contract to contract.
The effects of these deductions on our 
US pharmaceuticals revenue and the 
movements on US pharmaceuticals  
revenue provisions are set out opposite.
Accrual assumptions are built up on a 
product-by-product and customer-by-
customer basis, taking into account specific 
contract provisions coupled with expected 
performance, and are then aggregated into 
a weighted average rebate accrual rate for 
each of our products. Accrual rates are 
reviewed and adjusted on a monthly basis. 
There may be further adjustments when 
actual rebates are invoiced based on 
utilisation information submitted to us (in  
the case of contractual rebates) and claims/
invoices are received (in the case of 
regulatory rebates and chargebacks). We 
believe that we have made reasonable 
estimates for future rebates using a similar 
methodology to that of previous years. 
Inevitably, however, such estimates involve 
judgements on aggregate future sales 
levels, segment mix and the customers’ 
contractual performance.
Managed-care and group purchasing 
organisation rebate charges increased by 
$812 million in 2014 (2013: $1,321 million; 
2012: $160 million) mainly due to the impact 
of price increases on price-protected 
business and pricing pressure resulting in 
higher negotiated rates particularly in the 
Medicare Part D business.
Cash discounts are offered to customers  
to encourage prompt payment. Accruals  
are calculated based on historical 
experience and are adjusted to reflect  
actual experience.
Industry practice in the US allows 
wholesalers and pharmacies to return 
unused stocks within six months of, and  
up to 12 months after, shelf-life expiry.  
The customer is credited for the returned 
product by the issuance of a credit note. 
Returned products are not exchanged for 
products from inventory and once a return 
claim has been determined to be valid and a 
credit note has been issued to the customer, 
the returned products are destroyed. At the 
point of sale in the US, we estimate the 
quantity and value of products which may 
ultimately be returned. Our returns accruals 
in the US are based on actual experience. 
Our estimate is based on the preceding 12 
months for established products together 
with market-related information, such as 
estimated stock levels at wholesalers and 
competitor activity, which we receive via 
third party information services. For newly 
launched products, we use rates based on 
our experience with similar products or a 
pre-determined percentage.
For products facing generic competition, 
our experience is that we usually lose  
the ability to estimate the levels of returns 
from wholesalers with the same degree  
of precision that we can for products  
still subject to patent protection. This is 
because we have limited or no insight into  
a number of areas: the actual timing of  
the generic launch (for example, a generic 
manufacturer may or may not have 
produced adequate pre-launch inventory); 
the pricing and marketing strategy of the 
competitor; the take-up of the generic; and 
(in cases where a generic manufacturer has 
approval to launch only one dose size in a 
market of several dose sizes) the likely level 
of switching from one dose to another. 
Under our accounting policy, revenue is 
recognised only when the amount of the 
revenue can be measured reliably. Our 
approach in meeting this condition for 
products facing generic competition will vary 
from product to product depending on the 
specific circumstances.
Sensitivity analysis of the Group’s  
exposure to exchange rate and interest rate 
movements is also detailed in Note 25 to  
the Financial Statements from page 174.
Critical accounting policies  
and estimates
Our Financial Statements are prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU (adopted IFRS) and as issued by the 
IASB, and the accounting policies employed 
are set out in the Group Accounting Policies 
section in the Financial Statements from 
page 138. In applying these policies, we 
make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets 
and liabilities. The actual outcome could 
differ from those estimates. Some of these 
policies require a high level of judgement 
because the areas are especially subjective 
or complex. We believe that the most critical 
accounting policies and significant areas of 
judgement and estimation are in
 > revenue recognition 
 > research and development 
 > impairment testing of goodwill and 
intangible assets 
 > litigation 
 > post-retirement benefits 
 > taxation.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recorded at the invoiced  
amount (excluding inter-company sales  
and value-added taxes) less movements  
in estimated accruals for rebates and 
chargebacks given to managed-care and 
other customers and product returns – a 
particular feature in the US. It is the Group’s 
policy to offer a credit note for all returns and 
to destroy all returned stock in all markets. 
Cash discounts for prompt payment are 
also deducted from sales. Revenue is 
recognised at the point of delivery, which  
is usually when title passes to the customer, 
either on shipment or on receipt of goods  
by the customer depending on local trading 
terms. Income from royalties and from 
disposals of IP , brands and product lines  
is included in other operating income.
Rebates, chargebacks and returns  
in the US
When invoicing sales in the US, we estimate 
the rebates and chargebacks that we 
expect to pay. These rebates typically arise 
from sales contracts with third party 
managed-care organisations, hospitals, 
long-term care facilities, group purchasing 
organisations and various federal or state 
Financial Review continued
82 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 to reduce the speculative purchasing 
behaviour of the wholesalers and reduce 
short-term fluctuations in the level of 
inventory they hold. We do not offer any 
incentives to encourage wholesaler 
speculative buying and attempt, where 
possible, to restrict shipments to underlying 
demand when such speculation occurs.
Sales of intangible assets
A consequence of charging all internal R&D 
expenditure to the income statement in the 
year in which it is incurred (which is normal 
practice in the pharmaceutical industry) is 
that we own valuable intangible assets 
which are not recorded on the balance 
sheet. We also own acquired intangible 
assets which are included on the balance 
sheet. As a consequence of regular reviews 
of product strategy, from time to time we  
sell such assets and generate income. Sales 
of product lines are often accompanied  
by an agreement on our part to continue 
manufacturing the relevant product for a 
reasonable period (often about two years) 
while the purchaser constructs its own 
The closing adjustment in respect of  
prior years increased 2014 net US 
pharmaceuticals revenue by 1.7% (2013: 
increased revenue by 0.2%; 2012: increased 
revenue by 1.0%). However, taking into 
account the adjustments affecting both the 
current and the prior year, 2013 revenue 
was increased by 1.5%, and 2012 revenue 
was reduced by 0.8%, by adjustments 
between years.

Strategic Report Strategic Report
Financial Review continued
Details of the estimates and assumptions 
we make in our annual impairment testing  
of goodwill are included in Note 8 to the 
Financial Statements on page 152. The 
Group, including acquisitions, is considered 
a single cash-generating unit for impairment 
purposes. No impairment of goodwill  
was identified.
Impairment reviews have been carried  
out on all intangible assets that are in 
development (and not being amortised), all 
major intangible assets acquired during the 
year and all intangible assets that have had 
indications of impairment during the year. 
Sales forecasts and specific allocated  
costs (which have both been subject to 
appropriate senior management sign-off) 
are discounted using appropriate rates 
based on AstraZeneca’s risk-adjusted, 
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. 
Our weighted average cost of capital  
reflects factors such as our capital structure 
and our costs of debt and equity. In building 
to the range of rates used in our internal 
investment appraisal of future projects  
and capital investment decisions, we adjust 
our weighted average cost of capital for 
other factors which reflect, without limitation, 
local matters such as risk on a case-by-
case basis.
A significant portion of our investments in 
intangible assets and goodwill arose from 
the restructuring of the joint venture with 
Merck in 1998, the acquisition of 
MedImmune in 2007 , and the payments  
to retire Merck’s interests in our products  
in the US in 2008, 2010 and 2014. In 
addition, our recent business combinations, 
as detailed in Note 24 to the Financial 
Statements from page 170, have added 
significant product, marketing and 
distribution intangible rights to our intangible 
asset portfolio. We are satisfied that the 
carrying values of our intangible assets as  
at 31 December 2014 are fully justified by 
estimated future cash flows. The accounting 
for our intangible assets, including details of 
our arrangements with Merck, is fully 
explained in Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements from page 153. 
Further details of the estimates and 
assumptions we make in impairment testing 
of intangible assets are included in Note 9  
to the Financial Statements. 
Litigation
In the normal course of business,  
contingent liabilities may arise from 
product-specific and general legal 
proceedings, from guarantees or from 
environmental liabilities connected with  
our current or former sites. Where we 
believe that potential liabilities have a less 
than 50% probability of crystallising, or 
where we are unable to make a reasonable 
estimate of the liability, we treat them as 
contingent liabilities. These are not provided 
for but are disclosed in Note 27 to the 
Financial Statements from page 182.
In cases that have been settled or 
adjudicated, or where quantifiable fines and 
penalties have been assessed and which 
are not subject to appeal (or other similar 
forms of relief), or where a loss is probable 
(more than 50% assessed probability) and 
we are able to make a reasonable estimate 
of the loss, we indicate the loss absorbed or 
the amount of the provision accrued.
Where it is considered that the Group is 
more likely than not to prevail, or in the rare 
circumstances where the amount of the 
legal liability cannot be estimated reliably, 
legal costs involved in defending the claim 
are charged to profit as they are incurred. 
Where it is considered that the Group has  
a valid contract which provides the right  
to reimbursement (from insurance or 
otherwise) of legal costs and/or all or part  
of any loss incurred or for which a provision 
has been established and we consider 
recovery to be virtually certain, then the best 
estimate of the amount expected to be 
received is recognised as an asset.
Assessments as to whether or not to 
recognise provisions or assets and of the 
amounts concerned usually involve a series 
of complex judgements about future events 
and can rely heavily on estimates and 
assumptions. AstraZeneca believes that the 
provisions recorded are adequate based on 
currently available information and that the 
insurance recoveries recorded will be 
received. However, given the inherent 
uncertainties involved in assessing the 
outcomes of these cases and in estimating 
the amount of the potential losses and the 
associated insurance recoveries, we could 
in future periods incur judgments or 
insurance settlements that could have  
a material adverse effect on our results  
in any particular period.
The position could change over time, and 
there can, therefore, be no assurance that 
any losses that result from the outcome of 
any legal proceedings will not exceed the 
amount of the provisions that have been 
booked in the accounts.
manufacturing facilities. The contracts 
typically involve the receipt of an upfront 
payment, which the contract attributes  
to the sale of the intangible assets, and 
ongoing receipts, which the contract 
attributes to the sale of the product we 
manufacture. In cases where the transaction 
has two or more components, we account 
for the delivered item (for example, the 
transfer of title to the intangible asset) as  
a separate unit of accounting and record 
revenue on delivery of that component, 
provided that we can make a reasonable 
estimate of the fair value of the undelivered 
component. Where the fair market value of 
the undelivered component (for example,  
a manufacturing agreement) exceeds the 
contracted price for that component, we 
defer an appropriate element of the upfront 
consideration and amortise this over the 
performance period. However, where the 
fair market value of the undelivered 
component is equal to or lower than  
the contracted price for that component,  
we treat the whole of the upfront amount  
as being attributable to the delivered 
intangible assets and recognise that part  
of the revenue upon delivery. No element  
of the contracted revenue related to the 
undelivered component is allocated to the 
sale of the intangible asset. This is because 
the contracted revenue relating to the 
undelivered component is contingent on 
future events (such as sales) and so cannot 
be anticipated.
Research and development
Our business is underpinned by our 
marketed products and development 
portfolio. The R&D expenditure on internal 
activities to generate these products is 
generally charged to profit in the year  
that it is incurred. Purchases of IP and 
product rights to supplement our R&D 
portfolio are capitalised as intangible  
assets. Further details of this policy are 
included in the Group Accounting Policies 
section of our Financial Statements  
from page 138. Such intangible assets  
are amortised from the launch of the 
underlying products and are tested for 
impairment both before and after launch. 
This policy is in line with practice adopted  
by major pharmaceutical companies.
Impairment testing of goodwill and 
intangible assets
We have significant investments in goodwill 
and intangible assets as a result of 
acquisitions of businesses and purchases  
of assets, such as product development 
and marketing rights.
84 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Further details of our accounting for 
post-retirement benefit plans are included  
in Note 20 to the Financial Statements  
from page 162.
Taxation
Accruals for tax contingencies require 
management to make judgements and 
estimates in relation to tax audit issues and 
exposures. Amounts accrued are based  
on management’s interpretation of 
country-specific tax law and the likelihood of 
settlement. Tax benefits are not recognised 
unless the tax positions are probable of 
being sustained. Once considered to be 
probable, management reviews each 
material tax benefit to assess whether a 
provision should be taken against full 
recognition of the benefit on the basis of 
potential settlement through negotiation 
and/or litigation. All such provisions are 
included in current liabilities. Any recorded 
exposure to interest on tax liabilities is 
provided for in the tax charge.
AstraZeneca faces a number of transfer 
pricing audits in jurisdictions around  
the world and, in some cases, is in  
dispute with the tax authorities. These 
disputes usually result in taxable profits 
being increased in one territory and 
correspondingly decreased in another.  
Our balance sheet positions for these 
matters reflect appropriate corresponding 
relief in the territories affected.
Further details of the estimates and 
assumptions we make in determining our 
recorded liability for transfer pricing audits 
and other tax contingencies are included in 
the Tax section of Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements on page 187 .
Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404
As a consequence of our NYSE listing, 
AstraZeneca is required to comply with 
those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley  
Act applicable to foreign issuers. Section 
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires 
companies annually to assess and make 
public statements about the quality and 
effectiveness of their internal control over 
financial reporting. As regards Sarbanes-
Oxley Act Section 404, our approach is 
based on the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations (COSO) 2013 framework. 
Our approach to the assessment has  
been to select key transaction and financial 
reporting processes in our largest operating 
units and a number of specialist areas,  
such as financial consolidation and 
reporting, treasury operations and taxation, 
so that, in aggregate, we have covered  
a significant proportion of the key line  
in our Financial Statements. Each of these 
operating units and specialist areas has 
ensured that its relevant processes and 
controls are documented to appropriate 
standards, taking into account, in particular, 
the guidance provided by the SEC. We  
have also reviewed the structure and 
operation of our ‘entity level’ control 
environment. This refers to the overarching 
control environment, including structure  
of reviews, checks and balances that  
are essential to the management of  
a well-controlled business.
The Directors have concluded that our 
internal control over financial reporting is 
effective at 31 December 2014 and the 
assessment is set out in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities for, and Report on,  
Internal Control over Financial Reporting on 
page 129. KPMG Audit LLP has audited the 
effectiveness of our internal control over 
financial reporting at 31 December 2014 
and, as noted in the Auditor’s Reports on 
the Financial Statements and on Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting (Sarbanes-
Oxley Act Section 404) on page 130, their 
report is unqualified. 
Although there can be no assurance 
regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, 
we do not currently expect them to have  
a material adverse effect on our financial 
position, but they could significantly affect 
our financial results in any particular period.
Post-retirement benefits
We offer post-retirement benefit plans which 
cover many of our employees around the 
world. In keeping with local terms and 
conditions, most of these plans are ‘defined 
contribution’ in nature, where the resulting 
income statement charge is fixed at a set 
level or is a set percentage of employees’ 
pay. However, several plans, mainly in the 
UK (which has by far the largest single 
scheme), the US and Sweden, are defined 
benefit plans where benefits are based on 
employees’ length of service and final salary 
(typically averaged over one, three or five 
years). The UK and US defined benefit 
schemes were closed to new entrants in 
2000. All new employees in these countries 
are offered defined contribution schemes. 
In applying IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’,  
we recognise all actuarial gains and losses 
immediately through Other Comprehensive 
Income. Investment decisions in respect  
of defined benefit schemes are based  
on underlying actuarial and economic 
circumstances with the intention of ensuring 
that the schemes have sufficient assets to 
meet liabilities as they fall due, rather than 
meeting accounting requirements. The 
trustees follow a strategy of awarding 
mandates to specialist, active investment 
managers, which results in a broad 
diversification of investment styles and asset 
classes. The investment approach is 
intended to produce less volatility in the  
plan asset returns.
In assessing the discount rate applied to  
the obligations, we have used rates on  
AA corporate bonds with durations 
corresponding to the maturities of those 
obligations, except in Sweden where we 
have used rates on mortgage bonds as the 
market in high-quality corporate bonds is 
insufficiently deep.
In all cases, the pension costs recorded in 
the Financial Statements are assessed in 
accordance with the advice of independent 
qualified actuaries, but require the exercise 
of significant judgement in relation to 
assumptions for long-term price inflation, 
and future salary and pension increases.

Dear shareholder 
This Corporate Governance Report 
describes how the Group is organised, 
including the overall structure and 
principal roles and responsibilities of the 
Board, its Committees and the SET .
Board composition
The membership of the Board at  
31 December 2014 and information about 
individual Directors is contained in the Board 
of Directors section on pages 28 and 29.
Corporate governance
We have prepared this Annual Report  
with reference to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published by the UK 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in 
September 2012
1
.
This Corporate Governance Report 
(together with other sections of this Annual 
Report) describes how we apply the main 
principles of good governance in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. We have 
complied throughout the accounting period 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which is available on  
the FRC’s website, www.frc.co.uk. 
Leadership and responsibilities
The roles of Chairman and CEO are split. 
Leif Johansson, our Non-Executive 
Chairman, is responsible for leadership of 
the Board. Our CEO, Pascal Soriot, leads 
the SET and has executive responsibility  
for running our business. The Board 
comprises 1 1 Non-Executive Directors, 
including the Chairman, and two Executive 
Directors – the CEO, Pascal Soriot, and the 
CFO, Marc Dunoyer.
All Directors are collectively responsible  
for the success of the Group. In addition,  
the Non-Executive Directors are responsible 
for exercising independent, objective 
judgement in respect of Board decisions, 
and for scrutinising and challenging 
management. The Non-Executive Directors 
also have various responsibilities concerning 
the integrity of financial information, internal 
controls and risk management.
The Board conducts an annual review  
of the Group’s overall strategy. The CEO,  
CFO and SET take the lead in developing 
our strategy, which is then reviewed, 
constructively challenged and approved  
by the Board.
John Varley, who joined the Board as  
a Non-Executive Director in 2006, was 
appointed as our Senior independent 
Non-Executive Director in April 2012.  
The role of the Senior independent 
Non-Executive Director is to serve as  
a sounding board for the Chairman and  
as an intermediary for the other Directors 
when necessary. The Senior independent 
Non-Executive Director is also available  
to shareholders if they have concerns  
that contact through the normal channels  
of Chairman or Executive Directors has 
failed to resolve, or for which such contact  
is inappropriate. 
There are four principal Board Committees: 
the Audit Committee; the Remuneration 
Committee; the Nomination and Governance 
Committee; and the Science Committee. 
The membership and work of these 
Committees is described on the following 
pages. In addition, there may from time to 
time be constituted ad hoc Board 
Committees for specific projects or tasks.  
1  
The FRC published an updated UK Corporate Governance 
Code in September 2014 applicable to reporting  
periods beginning on or after 1 October 2014. The Group 
expects to report against this edition for the year ending  
31 December 2015.
86 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 All Directors are 
collectively responsible  
for the success of the 
Group. In addition, the 
Non-Executive Directors 
are responsible for 
exercising independent, 
objective judgement…”
Operation of the Board 
The Board is responsible for setting our 
strategy and policies, overseeing risk  
and corporate governance, and monitoring 
progress towards meeting our objectives 
and annual plans. The Board discharges 
these responsibilities through a programme 
of meetings that includes regular reviews of 
financial performance and critical business 
issues, and the formal annual strategy 
review day. The Board also aims to ensure 
that a good dialogue with our shareholders 
is maintained and that their issues and 
concerns are understood and considered.
The Board held 19 meetings in 2014, 
including its usual annual strategy review. 
Two meetings were telephone meetings, 
which were convened at short notice, at 
which business development transactions 
were discussed and approved. Eleven  
meetings related to the approaches  
from Pfizer during the year. All of the six 
scheduled meetings took place in London, 
UK with the exception of the meeting in 
September 2014, which took place at 
AstraZeneca’s offices in Shanghai,  
China. The Board is currently scheduled  
to meet six times in 2015, and will meet  
at such other times as may be required  
to conduct business. 
As part of the business of each Board 
meeting, the CEO typically submits a 
progress report, giving details of business 
performance and progress against the 
goals the Board has approved. To ensure 
that the Board has good visibility of the  
key operating decisions of the business, 
members of the SET attend Board meetings 
regularly and Board members meet other 
senior executives throughout the year.  
The Board also receives accounting and 
other management information about our 
resources, and presentations from internal 
and external speakers on legal, governance 
and regulatory developments. At the end  
of Board meetings, the Non-Executive 
Directors meet without the Executive 
Directors present to review and discuss  
any matters that have arisen during the 
meeting and/or such other matters as may 
appear to the Non-Executive Directors to  
be relevant in properly discharging their  
duty to act independently.
Board effectiveness
Composition of the Board, succession 
planning and diversity
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee and, where appropriate, the full 
Board, regularly review the composition of 
In these cases, the scope and 
responsibilities of the Committee are 
documented. The Board provides adequate 
resources to enable each Committee to 
undertake its duties.
Reserved matters and delegation  
of authority
The Board maintains and periodically 
reviews a list of matters that are reserved  
to, and can only be approved by, the Board. 
These include: the appointment, termination 
and remuneration of any Director; approval 
of the annual budget; approval of any  
item of fixed capital expenditure or any 
proposal for the acquisition or disposal of  
an investment or business which exceeds 
$150 million; the raising of capital or loans by 
the Company (subject to certain exceptions); 
the giving of any guarantee in respect of any 
borrowing of the Company; and allotting 
shares of the Company. The matters that 
have not been expressly reserved to the 
Board are delegated by the Board to its 
Committees or the CEO.
The CEO is responsible to the Board for  
the management, development and 
performance of our business for those 
matters for which he has been delegated 
authority from the Board. Although the CEO 
retains full responsibility for the authority 
delegated to him by the Board, he has 
established, and chairs, the SET, which is 
the vehicle through which he exercises that 
authority in respect of our business.
The roles of the Board, Board Committees, 
Chairman and CEO are documented, as  
are the Board’s reserved powers and 
delegated authorities.
the Board and the status of succession  
to both senior executive management and 
Board level positions. Directors have regular 
contact with, and access to, succession 
candidates for senior executive 
management positions.
The Board aims to maintain a balance in 
terms of the range of experience and skills  
of individual Board members, which  
includes relevant international business, 
pharmaceutical industry and financial 
experience, as well as appropriate scientific 
and regulatory knowledge. The biographies 
of Board members set out on pages 28  
and 29 give more information about current 
Directors in this respect. The Board views 
gender, nationality and cultural diversity 
among Board members as important 
considerations when reviewing the 
composition of the Board. The Board 
recognises, in particular, the importance  
of gender diversity. Currently, 36% of the 
Company’s Non-Executive Directors are 
women and women make up 31% of the full 
Board. Although it has not set any specific 
measurable objectives, the Board intends  
to continue with its current approach to 
diversity in all its aspects, while at the same 
time seeking Board members of the highest 
calibre, and with the necessary experience 
and skills to meet the needs of the Company 
and its shareholders. Information about our 
approach to diversity in the organisation 
below Board level can be found in 
Employees from page 62. 
The following changes to the composition  
of the Board have occurred during the 
period covered by this Annual Report:
 > Ann Cairns was elected as a Non-
Executive Director and appointed  
as a member of the Audit Committee  
with effect from 24 April 2014.
 > Graham Chipchase was appointed as a 
member of the Remuneration Committee 
with effect from 6 May 2014 and stepped 
down from the Audit Committee with 
effect from the same date.
Independence of the Non-Executive 
Directors
During 2014, the Board considered the 
independence of each Non-Executive 
Director for the purposes of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the 
corporate governance listing standards  
of the NYSE (Listing Standards). With the 
exception of Marcus Wallenberg, the Board 
considers that all of the Non-Executive 
Directors are independent. Leif Johansson 
87 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
Corporate Governance Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report continued
be a breach of the Director’s duty, under 
Section 175 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Board has a formal system in place  
for Directors to declare such situations  
to be considered for authorisation by those 
Directors who have no interest in the matter 
being considered. In deciding whether to 
authorise a situation, the non-conflicted 
Directors must act in the way they consider, 
in good faith, would be most likely to 
promote the success of the Company, and 
they may impose limits or conditions when 
giving the authorisation, or subsequently,  
if they think this is appropriate. Situations 
considered by the Board and authorisations 
given are recorded in the Board minutes 
and in a register of conflicts maintained  
by the Company Secretary, and are 
reviewed annually by the Board. The Board 
believes that this system operates effectively.
Appointments to the Board
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee section from page 91 provides 
information about the appointment  
process for new Directors.
Newly appointed Directors are provided  
comprehensive information about  
the Group and their role as Non-Executive 
Directors. They also typically attend tailored 
induction programmes that take account  
of their individual skills and experience.
Time commitment
Our expectation is that Non-Executive 
Directors should be prepared to commit  
15 days a year, as an absolute minimum,  
to the Group’s business. In practice, Board 
was considered by the Board to be 
independent upon his appointment as 
Chairman. In accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the test of 
independence is not appropriate in relation 
to the Chairman after his appointment.
Marcus Wallenberg was appointed  
as a Director of Astra in May 1989 and 
subsequently became a Director of the 
Company in 1999. He is a Non-Executive 
Director of Investor AB, which has a 4.08% 
interest in the issued share capital of the 
Company as at 5 February 2015. A number 
of Wallenberg charitable foundations have 
connections to Mr Wallenberg and to 
Investor AB. For these reasons, the Board 
does not believe that he can be determined 
independent under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. However, the Board 
believes that he has brought, and continues 
to bring, considerable business experience 
and makes a valuable contribution to the 
work of the Board. In April 2010, he was 
appointed as a member of the Science 
Committee, reflecting his interest in 
innovation and R&D, knowledge of the 
history of the Company and its scientific 
heritage and culture, and his broad 
experience of other industries and 
businesses in which innovation and R&D  
are important determinants of success.
Conflicts of interest
The Articles enable the Directors to 
authorise any situation in which a Director 
has an interest that conflicts or has the 
potential to conflict with the Company’s 
interests and which would otherwise  
members’ time commitment exceeds this 
minimum expectation when all the work that 
they undertake for the Group is considered, 
particularly in the case of the Chairman of 
the Board and the Chairmen of the Board 
Committees. As well as their work in relation 
to formal Board and Board Committee 
meetings, the Non-Executive Directors also 
commit time throughout the year to 
meetings and telephone calls with various 
levels of executive management, visits to 
AstraZeneca’s sites throughout the world 
and, for new Non-Executive Directors, 
induction sessions and site visits.
On occasions when a Director is 
unavoidably absent from a Board or  
Board Committee meeting, for example 
where a meeting clashes with their existing 
commitments, they still receive and review 
the papers for the meeting and typically 
provide verbal or written input ahead of the 
meeting, usually through the Chairman of 
the Board or the Chairman of the relevant 
Board Committee, so that their views are 
made known and considered at the 
meeting. Given the nature of the business  
to be conducted, some Board meetings are 
convened at short notice, which can make  
it difficult for some Directors to attend due  
to prior commitments.
Information and support
The Company Secretary is responsible  
to the Chairman for ensuring that all  
Board and Board Committee meetings  
are properly conducted, that the Directors 
receive appropriate information prior to 
meetings to enable them to make

  Leif Johansson was considered by the Board to be independent upon his appointment as Chairman. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the test of independence is not appropriate 
in relation to the Chairman after his appointment.
88 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Other than these limited instances, Lintstock 
is not a supplier to the Company and was 
able to act as a robust and independent 
external facilitator for the Board 
performance evaluation.
The 2014 evaluation involved a series  
of short, web-based questionnaires and 
individual conversations between Lintstock 
and each Board member, following which 
Lintstock prepared a report of its findings  
for the Chairman. Subsequently, the main 
themes of the report were discussed 
between the Chairman and individual 
Directors, and collectively at the Board 
meeting in December 2014. A number  
of areas were reviewed, including the 
composition of the Board and expertise  
of Board members; the dynamics among 
Board members and between the Board 
and management; the effectiveness of 
Board oversight, with particular focus on 
strategy and succession planning; how the 
Board handled the approaches from Pfizer; 
and the Board’s priorities for 2015. Overall,  
it was concluded that the Board operates 
effectively and in an open manner and no 
significant problems were raised. Some 
improvements to ways of working were 
proposed, such as the way in which the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee report 
back to the full Board and how the Board 
makes use of its informal time outside  
Board meetings. As part of each Director’s 
individual discussion with the Chairman, his 
or her contribution to the work of the Board 
and personal development needs were 
considered. Each Director continues to 
an effective contribution, and that 
governance requirements are considered 
and implemented.
The Company maintained Directors’ and 
Officers’ Liability Insurance cover throughout 
2014. The Directors are also able to obtain 
independent legal advice at the expense  
of the Company, as necessary, in their 
capacity as Directors.
The Company has entered into a deed of 
indemnity in favour of each Board member 
since 2006. These deeds of indemnity are 
still in force and provide that the Company 
shall indemnify the Directors to the fullest 
extent permitted by law and the Articles,  
in respect of all losses arising out of, or  
in connection with, the execution of their 
powers, duties and responsibilities as 
Directors of the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries. This is in line with current 
market practice and helps us attract and 
retain high-quality, skilled Directors.
Performance evaluation
During the year, the Board conducted the 
annual evaluation of its own performance 
and that of its Committees and individual 
Directors. This was facilitated by Lintstock 
Ltd (Lintstock), a London-based corporate 
advisory firm that provides objective and 
independent counsel to leading European 
companies. For a number of years, 
Lintstock has supplied software and 
services to the Company Secretary’s team 
for the web-based questionnaires used  
for internal Board performance evaluations, 
and for the management of insider lists. 
perform effectively and to demonstrate 
commitment to his or her role. In addition, 
led by the Senior independent Non-
Executive Director, the other Non-Executive 
Directors (absent the Chairman) evaluated 
the performance of the Chairman. The 
reviews of the Board’s Committees did not 
raise any significant problems and 
concluded that the committees are 
operating effectively.
The Board intends to continue to comply 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
guidance that the evaluation should be 
externally facilitated at least every three 
years and expects to commission the next 
externally facilitated review in 2017 .
Re-election of Directors
In accordance with Article 66 of the  
Articles, all Directors retire at each AGM  
and may offer themselves for re-election  
by shareholders. Accordingly, all of the 
Directors will retire at the AGM in April 2015. 
The Notice of AGM will give details of those 
Directors seeking re-election.
Accountability
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for  
our system of internal controls and risk 
management policies and has an  
ongoing responsibility for reviewing their 
effectiveness. During 2014, the Directors 
continued to review the effectiveness of  
our system of controls, risk management 
and high level internal control processes. 
These reviews included an assessment  
of internal controls and, in particular,

89 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
Corporate Governance Corporate Governance
we aim to present a balanced and 
understandable assessment of our strategy, 
financial position and prospects.
We make information about the Group 
available to shareholders through a range  
of media, including our corporate website, 
www.astrazeneca.com, which contains a 
wide range of data of interest to institutional 
and private investors. We consider our 
website to be an important means of 
communication with our shareholders. 
The Company has been authorised  
by shareholders to place shareholder 
communications (such as the Notice  
of AGM and this Annual Report) on the 
corporate website in lieu of sending paper 
copies to shareholders (unless specifically 
requested). While recognising and 
respecting that some shareholders may 
have different preferences about how  
they receive information from us, we  
will continue to promote the benefits  
of electronic communication given the 
advantages that this has over traditional 
paper-based communications, both in 
terms of the configurability and accessibility 
of the information provided and the 
consequent cost savings and reduction  
in environmental impact. 
We have frequent discussions with 
institutional shareholders on a range of 
issues. In addition to holding discussions 
with groups of shareholders, we also hold 
individual meetings with some of our largest 
institutional shareholders to seek their views. 
Board members are kept informed of any 
issues, and receive regular reports and 
presentations from executive management 
and our brokers to assist them to develop 
an understanding of major shareholders’ 
views about the Group. From time to  
time, we conduct an audit of institutional 
shareholders to ensure that we are 
communicating clearly with them and that  
a high-quality dialogue is being maintained. 
The results of this audit are reported to,  
and discussed by, the full Board. We also 
respond to individual ad hoc requests for 
discussions from institutional shareholders 
and analysts. Our Investor Relations team 
acts as the main point of contact for 
investors throughout the year. During 2014, 
the Chairman, the Senior independent 
Non-Executive Director, the CEO and the 
CFO held numerous meetings with our 
largest institutional shareholders in relation 
to the approaches from Pfizer. As discussed 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls, and risk management and their 
effectiveness, supported by management 
assurance of the maintenance of controls 
reports from IA, as well as the external 
auditor on matters identified in the course  
of its statutory audit work. The system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable 
(not necessarily absolute) assurance of 
effective operation and compliance with 
laws and regulations.
The internal control framework was in 
operation throughout 2014 and continues  
to operate up to the date of the approval  
of this Annual Report. The Directors believe 
that the Group maintains an effective, 
embedded system of internal controls and 
complies with the FRC’s guidance entitled 
‘Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting’ and, in the view of the Directors, 
no significant deficiencies have been 
identified in the system.
More information about the ways in which 
we manage our business risks is set out  
in Risk from page 203, which also describes 
the principal risks and uncertainties that  
we face.
Remuneration
Information about our approach to 
remuneration and the role and work of  
the Remuneration Committee, including  
our policy on executive remuneration, is set 
out in Governance and Remuneration from 
page 26 and in more detail in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report from page 100.
Policy on external appointments and 
retention of fees
Subject to specific Board approval in  
each case, Executive Directors and other 
SET members may accept external 
appointments as non-executive directors  
of other companies, and retain any related 
fees paid to them, provided that such 
appointments are not considered by the 
Board to prevent or reduce the ability  
of the executive to perform his or her role 
within the Group to the required standard.
Relations with shareholders
In our quarterly, half yearly and annual 
financial and business reporting to 
shareholders and other interested parties, 
above, the Senior independent Non-
Executive Director, John Varley, is also 
available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman, CEO and/or CFO 
has failed to resolve, or in relation to  
which such contact is inappropriate. All 
shareholders, including private investors, 
have an opportunity at the AGM to  
put questions to members of the Board 
about our operation and performance. 
Formal notification of the AGM is sent to 
shareholders at least one month in advance. 
The Board ordinarily attends the AGM to 
answer questions raised by shareholders.  
In line with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, details of proxy voting by 
shareholders, including votes withheld,  
are given at the AGM and are posted  
on our website following the AGM.
Pfizer’s approaches
On 28 April 2014, Pfizer issued a statement 
regarding a possible offer for the Company 
under Rule 2.4 of the City Code on 
Takeovers and Mergers (the ‘Takeover 
Code’) and confirmed that a preliminary, 
non-binding indication of interest had been 
submitted to the Board in January 2014 
regarding a possible merger transaction.  
On the same date, the Company 
responded, issuing a statement that, absent 
a specific and attractive proposal, it was  
not appropriate to engage in discussions 
with Pfizer.
On 2 May 2014, Pfizer made a further 
announcement of a possible offer for  
the Company under Rule 2.4 of the 
Takeover Code. The Company made an 
announcement on the same date stating 
that the Board had met and considered  
the approach from Pfizer and had rejected  
it on the basis that the financial and other 
terms described in the proposal were 
inadequate, substantially undervalued the 
Company and were not a basis on which  
to engage with Pfizer.
On 16 May 2014, Pfizer made a third 
proposal of £53.50 per share, which the 
Board rejected on 17 May.
On 18 May 2014, Pfizer announced  
a ‘final proposal’ to AstraZeneca under  
Rule 2.4 of the Takeover Code. On 19 May, 
the Company issued a statement noting  
that the Board had rejected Pfizer’s final 
proposal on the basis that it still undervalued 
the Company and its attractive prospects, 
with a statement from the Chairman saying:
Corporate Governance Report continued
90 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 We have rejected Pfizer’s final proposal 
because it is inadequate and would 
present significant risks for shareholders, 
while also having serious consequences 
for the Company, our employees and the 
life-sciences sector in the UK, Sweden 
and the US.”
On 26 May 2014, Pfizer made an 
announcement under Rule 2.8 of the 
Takeover Code stating that it did not intend 
to make an offer for AstraZeneca. The 
Company made an announcement on  
the same date, with a statement from the 
Chairman saying: 
“We note Pfizer’s confirmation that it no 
longer intends to make an offer for 
AstraZeneca. We welcome the opportunity 
to continue building on the momentum  
we have already demonstrated as an 
independent company. We are fully 
focused on the delivery of our strategy. We 
have attractive growth prospects and a 
rapidly progressing pipeline. In the coming 
months, we anticipate positive news flow 
across our core therapeutic areas, which 
underpins our confidence in the long-term 
prospects of the business. The Board is 
grateful to Pascal, his management team 
and to all of our employees for their 
dedication and focus over a period of 
uncertainty. AstraZeneca has a culture  
of innovation, with science at the heart of 
everything we do. I believe this will create 
significant value for our shareholders, 
employees and patients who will benefit 
from our life-changing medicines.”
Audit Committee
The principal role of the Audit Committee  
is to provide assurance to the Board in the 
following areas: the integrity of our financial 
reporting and internal controls over financial 
“Pascal Soriot, Marc Dunoyer and I had  
a lengthy discussion with Pfizer over the 
weekend about the proposal Pfizer made 
on Friday evening at a value of £53.50  
per share. During this discussion, Pfizer 
said that it could consider only minor 
improvements in the financial terms of the 
Friday proposal. In response, we indicated, 
even assuming that other key aspects  
of any proposal had been satisfactory,  
that the price at which the Board of 
AstraZeneca would be prepared to 
provide a recommendation would have  
to be more than 10% above the level 
contained in Pfizer’s Friday proposal. The 
final proposal is a minor improvement 
which continues to fall short of the Board’s 
view of value and has been rejected.
Pfizer’s approach throughout its pursuit  
of AstraZeneca appears to have been 
fundamentally driven by the corporate 
financial benefits to its shareholders of 
cost savings and tax minimisation. From 
our first meeting in January to our latest 
discussion yesterday, and in the numerous 
phone calls in between, Pfizer has failed  
to make a compelling strategic, business 
or value case. The Board is firm in its 
conviction as to the appropriate terms  
to recommend to shareholders.
AstraZeneca has created a culture of 
innovation, with science at the heart of its 
operations, which will continue to create 
significant value for patients, shareholders 
and all stakeholders of AstraZeneca.
As an independent company, the entire 
value of AstraZeneca’s pipeline will  
accrue to our shareholders. Under  
Pfizer’s final proposal, this value would  
be significantly diluted.
matters; our internal controls over 
non-financial matters, compliance with laws 
and our Code of Conduct; the Company’s 
relationship with its external auditor; and  
the appropriateness of the Company’s  
risk management framework, in each case 
with the ultimate aim of protecting our 
shareholders’ interests.

Remuneration Committee
The principal role of the Remuneration 
Committee is to consider and set, on  
behalf of the Board, the remuneration 
(including pension rights and compensation 
payments) of Executive Directors and other 
senior executives. It also considers and  
sets the remuneration of the Chairman,  
in conjunction with the Senior independent 
Non-Executive Director and in the absence 
of the Chairman. No Director is involved  
in deciding his or her own remuneration.

Nomination and Governance 
Committee
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee’s role is to recommend to the 
Board any new Board appointments and  
to consider, more broadly, succession plans 
at Board level. It reviews the composition  
of the Board using a matrix that records  
the skills and experience of current Board 
members, comparing this with the skills and 
experience it believes are appropriate to the 
Company’s overall business and strategic 
needs, both now and in the future. Any 
decisions relating to the appointment of 
Directors are made by the entire Board 
based on the merits of the candidates and 
the relevance of their background and 
Pfizer’s approaches

US corporate governance 
requirements
Our ADSs are traded on the NYSE and, 
accordingly, we are subject to the reporting 
and other requirements of the SEC 
applicable to foreign private issuers. Section 
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires 
companies to include in their annual report 
experience, measured against objective 
criteria, with care taken to ensure that 
appointees have enough time to devote  
to our business. 
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee also advises the Board 
periodically on significant developments  
in corporate governance and the 
Company’s compliance with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code.
During 2014, the Chairman of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
was Leif Johansson. The members of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
were Rudy Markham, Nancy Rothwell  
and John Varley. Each member is a 
Non-Executive Director and considered 
independent by the Board. The Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to the 
Nomination and Governance Committee.
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee considers both planned and 
unplanned (unanticipated) succession 
scenarios and met five times in 2014.  
As part of routine succession planning  
for Non-Executive Director roles during the 
year, MWM Consulting and The Zygos 
Partnership assisted the Nomination and 
Governance Committee with searches for 
new Non-Executive Directors. One of those 
searches culminated in a recommendation 
from the Committee to the Board to 
propose Ann Cairns for election by 
shareholders as a new Non-Executive 
Director at the AGM in 2014. Neither MWM 
Consulting nor The Zygos Partnership has 
any other connection to the Company. 
During 2014, the Nomination and 
Governance Committee also undertook 
routine and long-term succession planning 
work in respect of the role of CEO, with the 
assistance of Spencer Stuart. Spencer 
Stuart undertakes executive search 
assignments for the Company periodically.
The attendance record of the Nomination 
and Governance Committee’s members is 
set out on page 89.
The Nomination and Governance 
Committee’s terms of reference are available 
on our website, www.astrazeneca.com.
Science Committee
The Science Committee’s core role is to 
provide assurance to the Board regarding 
the quality, competitiveness and integrity  
of the Group’s R&D activities by way of 
meetings and dialogue with our R&D 
on Form 20-F filed with the SEC, a report  
by management stating its responsibility for 
establishing internal control over financial 
reporting and to assess annually the 
effectiveness of such internal control. We 
have complied with those provisions of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to foreign 
private issuers. The Board continues to 
believe that the Group has a sound 
corporate governance framework, good 
processes for the accurate and timely 
reporting of its financial position and results 
of operations, and an effective and robust 
system of internal controls. We have 
established a Disclosure Committee,  
further details of which can be found in the 
Disclosure Committee section opposite.
The Directors’ assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over  
financial reporting is set out in Directors’ 
Responsibilities for, and Report on, Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting in the 
Financial Statements on page 129.
We are required to disclose any significant 
ways in which our corporate governance 
practices differ from those followed by US 
companies under the Listing Standards. In 
addition, we must comply fully with the 
provisions of the Listing Standards relating 
to the composition, responsibilities and 
operation of audit committees, applicable  
to foreign private issuers. These provisions 
incorporate the rules concerning audit 
committees implemented by the SEC under 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have reviewed 
the corporate governance practices 
required to be followed by US companies 
under the Listing Standards and our 
corporate governance practices are 
generally consistent with those standards.
Business organisation
Senior Executive Team
The CEO is responsible for establishing, and 
chairs, the SET. The SET normally meets 
once a month or as otherwise required by 
business need, to consider major business 
issues, and makes recommendations to the 
CEO. Typically, it also reviews, in advance  
of submission to the Board, those matters 
which are to be submitted to the Board for 
review and decision. 
In addition to the CEO, CFO, General 
Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer,  
the SET comprises nine EVPs representing: 
IMED; MedImmune; GMD; North America; 
International; Europe; GPPS; Operations  
& Information Services; and Human 
Resources. The Company Secretary acts  
as secretary to the SET.

Disclosure Committee
Our disclosure policy provides a framework 
for the handling and disclosure of inside 
information and other information of interest 
to shareholders and the investment 
community. It also defines the role of the 
Disclosure Committee. The members  
of the Disclosure Committee in 2014 were: 
the CFO, who chaired the Disclosure 
Committee; the EVP , GMD (who is also  
the Company’s Chief Medical Officer); the 
General Counsel; the Vice-President,  
Global Communications; the Vice-President, 
Investor Relations; and the Vice-President, 
Group Financial Reporting. The Deputy 
Company Secretary acted as secretary to 
the Disclosure Committee. The Disclosure 
Committee meets regularly to assist and 
inform the decisions of the CEO concerning 
inside information and its disclosure. 
Periodically, it reviews our disclosure 
controls and procedures and its own 
operation as part of work carried out to 
enable management and the Board to 
assure themselves that appropriate 
processes are operating for our planned 
disclosures, such as our quarterly results 
announcements and scheduled investor 
relations events.
Disclosure of information to auditors 
The Directors who held office at the date of 
approval of this Annual Report confirm that, 
so far as they are each aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and  
each Director has taken all the steps that he  
or she ought to have taken as a Director  
to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information.
Compliance and Internal Audit  
Services (IA) 
The role of the Global Compliance function 
is to manage and maintain the compliance 
programme infrastructure and to help 
embed a culture of ethics and integrity  
in the Group. Global Compliance works 
closely with IA, with whom it provides 
assurance reporting to the Audit 
Committee. During 2015, the Global 
Compliance function will continue to focus 
on ensuring the delivery of an aligned 
Early Stage Product Committees (ESPCs) 
and Late Stage Product Committee 
(LSPC) 
The ESPCs and LSPC were established  
in 2013.
Early Stage Product Committees 
The ESPCs are senior level, cross-functional 
governance bodies with accountability for 
oversight of our early-stage small molecule 
and biologics portfolio to Proof of Concept 
stage. The EVPs of our two biotech units, 
IMED and MedImmune, chair our ESPCs. 
The ESPCs seek to deliver a flow of 
products to GMD for Phase III development 
through to launch. The ESPCs also seek  
to maximise the value of our internal and 
external R&D investments through robust, 
transparent and well-informed decision 
making that drives business performance 
and accountability. 
Specifically, the ESPCs have responsibility 
for the following 
 > approving early-stage investment 
decisions 
 > prioritising the respective portfolios
 > licensing activity for products in Phase I 
and earlier
 > delivering internal and external 
opportunities
 > reviewing allocation of R&D resources.
Late Stage Product Committee 
The LSPC is also a senior level governance 
body, accountable for the quality of the 
portfolio post-Phase III investment decision. 
It was formed in early 2013, replacing three 
committees, in a move to streamline 
development project governance. Jointly 
chaired by the EVPs of GMD and GPPS, 
members include, as appropriate, members 
of the SET, including the CEO and CFO,  
and members of the GMD and GPPS 
leadership teams.
The LSPC seeks to maximise the  
value of our investments in the late-stage 
portfolio, also ensuring well-informed  
and robust decision making. Specific 
accountabilities include
 > approval of the criteria supporting Proof  
of Concept
 > decision to invest in Phase III development 
based on agreement of commercial

  Risk from page 203
Global Compliance provides direct 
assurance to the Audit Committee on 
matters concerning compliance issues, 
including an analysis of compliance 
breaches. Complementing this, IA carries 
out a range of audits that include 
compliance-related audits and reviews  
of the assurance activities of other  
Group assurance functions. The results 
from these activities are reported to the 
Audit Committee.
IA is established by the Audit Committee  
on behalf of the Board and acts as an 
independent and objective assurance 
function guided by a philosophy of adding 
value to improve the operations of the 
Group. The scope of IA’s responsibilities 
encompasses, but is not limited to, the 
examination and evaluation of the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the Group’s 
governance, risk management, and internal 
control processes in relation to the Group’s 
defined goals and objectives.
Internal control objectives considered by  
IA include 
 > consistency of operations or programmes 
with established objectives and goals and 
effective performance 
 > effectiveness and efficiency of operations 
and employment of resources 
 > compliance with significant policies, 
plans, procedures, laws, and regulations 
 > reliability and integrity of management 
and financial information processes, 
including the means to identify, measure, 
classify, and report such information
 > safeguarding of assets. 
Based on its activity, IA is responsible for 
reporting significant risk exposures and 
control issues identified to the Board and  
to senior management, including fraud  
risks, governance issues, and other  
matters needed or requested by the Audit 
Committee. It may also evaluate specific 
operations at the request of the Audit 
Committee or management, as appropriate.

Distributions to shareholders – dividends 
for 2014
Details of our distribution policy are set out 
in the Financial Review on page 81 and 
Notes 22 and 23 to the Financial Statements 
on page 169. 
The Company’s dividend for 2014 of $2.80 
(178. 1 pence, SEK 21.82) per Ordinary 
Share amount to, in aggregate, a total 
Group. A Finance Code complements the 
Code. It applies to the CEO, the CFO, the 
Group’s principal accounting officers 
(including key Finance staff in major 
overseas subsidiaries) and all Finance 
function employees. This reinforces the 
importance of the integrity of the Group’s 
Financial Statements, the reliability of the 
accounting records on which they are 
based and the robustness of the relevant 
controls and processes. 
The Code is at the core of our compliance 
programme. It has been translated into over 
40 languages and employees have access 
to an electronic copy. It provides clear 
direction as to how our commitment to 
honesty and integrity is to be realised in 
consistent actions across all areas of the 
business. Compliance with the Code is 
mandatory and every employee receives 
training on it. Every employee is required  
to comply with local laws and regulations,  
as well as applicable national and 
international codes. We always seek  
to operate at the highest standards. The 
Code is reviewed periodically and updated 
to take account of changing legal and 
regulatory obligations. 
The Code contains information on how  
to report possible violations through our 
Helpline, which includes the AZethics 
telephone lines, the AZethics website, and 
the Global Compliance email and postal 
addresses described in the Code. Anyone 
who raises a potential breach in good faith  
is fully supported by management. We  
take all alleged compliance breaches  
and concerns extremely seriously, and 
investigate them and report the outcome of 
such investigations to the Audit Committee, 
as appropriate. 
In 2014, 247 reports of alleged compliance 
breaches or other ethical concerns were 
made through the Helpline. In 2013, there 
were 149 reports. However, during 2014  
we extended our recording of Helpline 
cases to include reports made by any other 
anonymous route that could be considered 
whistleblowing, and this change accounts, 
at least in part, for the increase from 2013  
to 2014. The majority of cases come to  
our attention through management and 
self-reporting, which can be seen as an 
indication that employees are more 
comfortable in raising their concerns  
with line managers, local HR, Legal or 
Compliance, as recommended in the Code 
and reinforced in the 2014 Code training.
dividend payment to shareholders of 
$3,521 million. An employee share trust, 
AstraZeneca Share Trust Limited, waived  
its right to a dividend on the Ordinary  
Shares that it holds and instead received  
a nominal dividend. 
A shareholders’ resolution was passed  
at the 2014 AGM authorising the Company 
to purchase its own shares. The Company 
did not repurchase any of its own shares  
in 2014.
Going concern accounting basis 
Information on the business environment in 
which AstraZeneca operates, including the 
factors underpinning the industry’s future 
growth prospects, is included in the 
Strategic Report. Details of the product 
portfolio of the Group are contained in both 
the Strategic Report (in the Therapy Area 
Review from page 32) and the Directors’ 
Report. Information on patent expiry dates 
for key marketed products is included  
in Patent Expiries from page 201. Our 
approach to product development and our 
development pipeline are also covered in 
detail with additional information by therapy 
area in the Strategic Report.
The financial position of the Group, its  
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Financial 
Review from page 70. In addition, Note 25  
to the Financial Statements from page 174 
includes the Group’s objectives, policies  
and processes for managing capital; 
financial risk management objectives; details 
of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit, market 
and liquidity risk. Further details of the 
Group’s cash balances and borrowings are 
included in Notes 16 and 17 to the Financial 
Statements from page 159.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources available. As at 31 December 
2014, the Group had $7 .0 billion in financial 
resources (cash balances of $6.4 billion  
and undrawn committed bank facilities of 
$3.0 billion, which are available until April 
2019, with only $2.4 billion of debt due 
within one year). The Group’s revenues are 
largely derived from sales of products that 
are covered by patents, which provide  
a relatively high level of resilience and 
predictability to cash inflows, although  
our revenue is expected to continue to  
be significantly impacted by the expiry of 
patents over the medium term. In addition, 
government price interventions in response 
to budgetary constraints are expected to 
94 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 donations and other political expenditure  
in broad terms, a resolution will be put to 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM, similar to 
that passed at the 2014 AGM, to authorise 
the Company and its subsidiaries to 
 > make donations to political parties or 
independent election candidates
 > make donations to political organisations 
other than political parties
 > incur political expenditure, up to an 
aggregate limit of $250,000.
Corporate political contributions in the US 
are permitted in defined circumstances 
under the First Amendment of the US 
Constitution and are subject to both federal 
and state laws and regulations. In 2014, the 
Group’s US legal entities made contributions 
amounting in aggregate to $1,650,200 
(2013: $1, 147 ,950) to national political 
organisations, state-level political party 
committees and to campaign committees 
of various state candidates. No corporate 
donations were made at the federal level 
and all contributions were made only where 
allowed by US federal and state law. We 
publicly disclose details of our corporate US 
political contributions, which can be found 
on our website, www.astrazeneca-us.com/
responsibility/transparency. The annual 
corporate contributions budget is reviewed 
and approved by the Deputy General 
Counsel, North America, the US Vice-
President, Corporate Affairs and the 
President of our US business to ensure 
robust governance and oversight. US 
citizens or individuals holding valid green 
cards exercised decision making over the 
contributions and the funds were not 
provided or reimbursed by any non-US legal 
entity. Such contributions do not constitute 
political donations or political expenditure for 
the purposes of the Companies Act 2006 
and were made without any involvement  
of persons or entities outside the US. 
Significant agreements
There are no significant agreements to 
which the Company is a party that take 
effect, alter or terminate on a change of 
control of the Company following a takeover 
bid. There are no persons with whom we 
have contractual or other arrangements, 
who are deemed by the Directors to be 
essential to our business. 
Use of financial instruments 
The Notes to the Financial Statements, 
including Note 25 from page 174, include 
further information on our use of financial 
instruments.
continue to adversely affect revenues in 
many of our mature markets. However, we 
anticipate new revenue streams from both 
recently launched medicines and products 
in development, and the Group has a  
wide diversity of customers and suppliers 
across geographic areas. Consequently,  
the Directors believe that, overall, the  
Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements.
Changes in share capital 
Changes in the Company’s Ordinary Share 
capital during 2014, including details of  
the allotment of new shares under the 
Company’s share plans, are given in Note 
22 to the Financial Statements on page 169.
Directors’ shareholdings 
The Articles require each Director to be the 
beneficial owner of Ordinary Shares in the 
Company with an aggregate nominal value 
of $125 (which currently represents at least 
500 shares because each Ordinary Share 
has a nominal value of $0.25). Such holding 
must be obtained within two months of the 
date of the Director’s appointment. At 31 
December 2014, all of the Directors 
complied with this requirement and full 
details of each Director’s interests in shares 
of the Company are set out in Directors’ 
interests in shares on page 1 12. Information 
about the shareholding expectations of the 
Remuneration Committee (in respect of 
Executive Directors and SET members)  
and the Board (in respect of Non-Executive 
Directors) is also set out in Directors’ 
interests in shares on page 1 12.
Political donations 
Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries 
made any EU political donations or incurred 
any EU political expenditure in 2014 and they 
do not intend to do so in the future in respect 
of which shareholder authority is required, or 
for which disclosure in this Annual Report is 
required, under the Companies Act 2006. 
However, to enable the Company and its 
subsidiaries to continue to support interest 
groups or lobbying organisations concerned 
with the review of government policy or law 
reform without inadvertently breaching the 
Companies Act 2006, which defines political 
Annual General Meeting 
The Company’s AGM will be held on 24 
April 2015. The meeting place will be in 
London, UK. A Notice of AGM will be sent  
to all registered holders of Ordinary Shares 
and, where requested, to the beneficial 
holders of shares.
External auditor 
A resolution will be proposed at the AGM  
on 24 April 2015 for the re-appointment  
of KPMG LLP as auditor of the Company. 
The external auditor has undertaken various 
non-audit work for us during 2014. More 
information about this work and the audit 
and non-audit fees that we have paid are  
set out in Note 29 to the Financial 
Statements on page 188. The external 
auditor is not engaged by us to carry out 
any non-audit work in respect of which it 
might, in the future, be required to express 
an audit opinion. As explained more fully in 
the Audit Committee Report from page 96, 
the Audit Committee has established 
pre-approval policies and procedures for 
audit and non-audit work permitted to be 
carried out by the external auditor and has 
carefully monitored the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor 
throughout 2014.
Directors’ Report

prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006, 
comprises the following sections

Audit Committee Report
Dear shareholder
In this Report, we describe the work  
of the Audit Committee during the year 
and highlight the significant issues 
considered. In 2014, our priorities were, 
once again, sound financial reporting 
and compliance with our Code of 
Conduct, which are considered below. 
considered and altered the scope of its 
external audit in 2014 to match the changing 
dynamics of the Group. Accounting for  
the business combinations consummated  
in the year was an area of focus, principally 
our acquisition of BMS’s interest in the 
diabetes alliance and the strategic 
transaction with Almirall. 
The Company is involved with IP litigation, 
which is a feature of the pharmaceutical 
industry, and a number of government 
investigations, and is a defendant in certain 
product liability and anti-trust actions. The 
Audit Committee receives a regular update 
from the General Counsel on the status of 
those litigation matters that might result in 
fines or damages against the Group to 
assess whether provisions should be taken 
and, if so, when and for what amounts.
Compliance with the Code of Conduct
The Audit Committee has oversight of the 
Company’s responsibilities under a US 
Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) which  
is now in its final year. In 2014, we received 
quarterly updates from the US Compliance 
Officer on our compliance with the CIA. 
Compliance with our Code of Conduct in 
Emerging Markets, particularly in Russia  
and China, has been an area of continuing 
focus for the Audit Committee in 2014. In 
September, the Board visited our marketing 
company based in Shanghai, China. We 
discussed the challenges and opportunities 
of China, which is one of AstraZeneca’s 
fastest growing markets. We talked to 
members of management, including our 
local and regional compliance officers about 
The principal duties of the Audit Committee 
are to provide assurance to the Board,  
as part of the Board’s stewardship and 
protection of our shareholders’ interests, on 
 > the integrity of our financial reporting  
and internal controls over financial matters
 > the effectiveness of our internal controls 
over non-financial matters, and 
compliance with laws and our Code  
of Conduct 
 > the quality of the Company’s relationship 
with its external auditor
 > the role, resources and effectiveness of 
the Company’s internal audit function
 > the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management framework. 
Financial reporting
Robust financial reporting is underpinned by 
well-designed internal controls, appropriate 
accounting practices and policies, and good 
judgement. The Audit Committee reviews, 
at least quarterly, the Company’s significant 
accounting matters and, where appropriate, 
challenges management’s decisions before 
approving the accounting policies applied. 
In 2014, we looked in more detail at the 
appropriateness of our revenue recognition 
practices and policies. We also considered 
our restructuring and other related charges 
as we go through a period of significant 
reorganisation throughout the Group, how 
those charges benchmark against our 
pharmaceutical peer group, and the 
robustness of our processes to ensure that 
charges are appropriately accounted for  
as Core or non-Core. Our external auditor, 
after discussion with the Audit Committee, 
AstraZeneca’s performance and approach 
to operating ethically, within the law and in 
accordance with our global Code of 
Conduct in China. During the course of the 
year, we received and discussed quarterly 
reports from the Chief Compliance Officer 
on compliance in all areas of our business.
Engagement with senior leaders
During 2014, the Committee took the 
opportunity to extend its interactions with 
members of management below the SET.  
In particular, it held meetings with the senior 
leadership teams of Internal Audit Services 
(IA), IS/IT and Finance. It takes a special 
interest in the strength and depth of the 
finance organisation and talent development 
within that function.
We value dialogue with our shareholders 
and welcome your feedback on this Audit 
Committee Report.
Yours sincerely
Rudy Markham 
Chairman of the Audit Committee

such other times as may be required.
Terms of reference
The core terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee, which are available on our

reviewing and reporting to the Board on
 > matters relating to the audit plans  
of the external auditor and IA as well

The Audit Committee is responsible for 
notifying the Board of any significant 
concerns of the external auditor or the 
Vice-President, IA arising from their audit 
work; any matters that may materially affect 
or impair the independence of the external 
auditor; any significant deficiencies or 
material weaknesses in the design or 
operation of our internal control over 
financial reporting or other internal controls; 
and any serious issues of non-compliance 
and how the Audit Committee has 
discharged its responsibilities. It oversees 
the establishment, implementation and 
maintenance of our Code of Conduct and 
other related policies. It monitors the 
Company’s response to letters requesting 
information and investigations initiated by 
regulatory and governmental authorities 
such as the SEC, the DOJ and the UK 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) pertaining 
to matters within the remit of the Audit 
Committee’s work. It has established 
procedures for the receipt and handling of 
complaints concerning accounting or audit 
matters. It recommends to the Board the 
appointment of the external auditor,  
Audit Committee membership  
and attendance
The members of the Audit Committee  
are Rudy Markham (Chairman of the Audit 
Committee), Bruce Burlington, Ann Cairns, 
Jean-Philippe Courtois and Shriti Vadera. 
They are all Non-Executive Directors. The 
Board considers each member to be 
independent under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and under the general 
guidance and specific criteria of the Listing 
Standards concerning the composition of 
audit committees applicable to non-US 
companies listed on the NYSE. In April 2014, 
we submitted the required annual written 
affirmation to the NYSE confirming our full 
compliance with those standards. For the 
purposes of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Board remains satisfied that at 
least one member of the Audit Committee 
has recent and relevant financial experience. 
At its meeting in December 2014, the Board 
determined that Rudy Markham and Ann 
Cairns are Audit Committee financial 
experts for the purposes of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. For more information regarding 
the experience of the Audit Committee 
members, see the Board of Directors’ 
biographies on pages 28 and 29. The 
Deputy Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to the Audit Committee. 
Meetings of the Audit Committee are 
routinely attended by the CFO; the General 
Counsel; the Chief Compliance Officer;  
the Vice-President, IA; the Vice-President, 
Group Financial Reporting; and our external 
auditor. The CEO attends on an agenda-
driven basis. In line with its normal practice, 
the Audit Committee also held a number  
of private meetings, without management 
present, with the Chief Compliance Officer; 
the General Counsel; the Vice-President,  
IA; and the Company’s external auditor. 
These meetings were held between Audit 
Committee members and those individuals, 
separately from the main sessions of the 
Audit Committee.
Number of meetings and attendance 
The Audit Committee held five scheduled 
meetings in 2014. The attendance record  
of the Audit Committee members is set out 
in the Board and Board Committee meeting 
attendance in 2014 table on page 89. 
Following each Audit Committee meeting, 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
reported to the Board on the principal 
matters covered at the meeting and minutes 
of the meetings were circulated to all Board 
members. In addition, the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee held regular scheduled 
subject to the approval of the Company’s 
shareholders at a general meeting. 
Shareholders authorise the Directors to  
fix the remuneration of the external auditor 
at a general meeting. The Audit Committee 
reviews and approves the appointment and 
dismissal of the Vice-President, IA. 
Activities of the Audit Committee  
in 2014
The Audit Committee has an annual 
calendar of topics, developed from its  
terms of reference, with standing items 
which it considers in accordance with its 
schedule at each quarterly meeting or, 
in some cases, annually.
During 2014 and in February 2015, the Audit 
Committee considered and discussed the 
following standing items: 
 > The key elements of the Financial 
Statements, and the estimates and 
judgements contained in our financial 
disclosures. Various accounting matters 
were considered. These included the 
areas described in the Financial Review 
under ‘Critical accounting policies and 
estimates’ (with a focus on accounting 
issues relevant to litigation and taxation 
matters and goodwill impairment) from 
page 82 and other matters such as 
non-Core items, including restructuring 
costs, with a particular focus on those 
items that are non-Core. Discussion of 
these matters was supported by papers 
prepared by management and the 
external auditor. 
 > The reports received from the external 
auditor concerning its audit of the Financial 
Statements of the Group and from 
management, IA, Global Compliance and 
the external auditor on the effectiveness  
of our system of internal controls and, in 
particular, our internal control over financial 
reporting. The Audit Committee also 
reviewed quarterly activity reports of audit 
work carried out by IA and the status of 
follow-up actions with management, as 
well as reports from Global Compliance.
 > An update of the Group Risk Appetite 
Statement to reflect the revised strategy 
and an annual review and update of  
the AstraZeneca Risk Management 
Framework, Top Risks, Emerging Risks 
and Group Risk Taxonomy.
 > The systems and processes that 
management has developed for risk 
identification, classification and mitigation.
 > Compliance with the applicable provisions 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In particular, 
the status of compliance with the 
97 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
Corporate Governance Corporate Governance
Audit Committee Report continued
Committee’s work and to provide an 
opportunity to discuss specific areas  
of interest. These included 
 > receiving regular updates from the IT team 
in connection with the transformation  
of AstraZeneca’s IT infrastructure, with 
particular attention to cybersecurity
 > considering our approach to the 
management of foreign exchange risk  
in Emerging Markets
 > considering the robustness of the process 
by which product forecasts are compiled, 
assessed and included in the long-term 
business plan
 > considering post-investment reviews  
of a recent major business development 
transaction, a capital expenditure project, 
and the integration of the BMS diabetes 
business acquired at the start of 2014.
In addition to the quarterly reporting 
stipulated by the CIA as described above,  
a number of other obligations required by 
the CIA were discharged by members of  
the Board and the Audit Committee during 
2014. For example, all members of the 
Board completed the annual CIA-required 
training, addressing the Code of Conduct 
and the elements of the CIA and the US 
compliance programme. Furthermore, the 
Board adopted a resolution (signed by each 
Board member) in respect of the fourth  
12 month reporting period under the CIA.  
The resolution summarised the Board’s 
oversight of the US compliance programme 
and stated that, to the best of the Board’s 
knowledge, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals 
LP and AstraZeneca LP (AstraZeneca’s 
principal US trading entities) have 
implemented an effective US compliance 
programme to meet US federal healthcare 
programme, FDA and CIA requirements. 
Significant financial reporting issues 
considered by the Audit Committee 
in 2014
The Audit Committee determined that the 
significant issues considered during the  
year were
 > revenue recognition
 > impairment of intangible assets
 > litigation and contingent liabilities
 > tax accounting
 > post-retirement benefits.
Revenue recognition
The US is our largest single market and 
sales accounted for 38.8% of our revenue  
in 2014. Revenue recognition, particularly  
in the US, is impacted by rebates, 
programme of internal controls over 
financial reporting implemented pursuant 
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
The Audit Committee remained focused 
on IT controls in the context of the 
changes to the Group’s IT environment, 
described below. More information about 
this is set out in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
Section 404 section of the Financial 
Review on page 85. 
 > Data about reports made by employees 
via the AZethics helpline, online facilities 
and other routes regarding potential 
breaches of the Code of Conduct, 
together with the results of inquiries into 
those matters.
 > Quarterly reports received from the US 
Compliance Officer responsible for 
monitoring the US business’s compliance 
with the CIA (for more information about 
the obligations imposed on the Board by 
the CIA, see below).
 > Reports from the Group Treasury function 
and, in particular, reports concerning the 
Group’s liquidity and cash position and the 
appropriateness of its cash management 
policies in the context of the current 
economic situation.
 > Going concern assessment and adoption 
of the going concern basis in preparing 
this Annual Report and the Financial 
Statements.
 > Other reports, on a quarterly basis, 
concerning IA, Global Compliance and 
Finance, including the internal audit plan 
and progress and plans of Global 
Compliance.
 > Quarterly reports from the General 
Counsel on the status of certain litigation 
matters and governmental investigations.
 > The amount of audit and non-audit fees of 
the external auditor throughout 2014. The 
Audit Committee was satisfied throughout 
the year that the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor were 
not in any way impaired by the nature of 
the non-audit work undertaken by the 
external auditor during the year, the level of 
non-audit fees charged for such work or 
any other facts or circumstances. Further 
information about the audit and non-audit 
fees for 2014 is disclosed in Note 29 to the 
Financial Statements on page 188.
 > A review and assessment of the Audit 
Committee’s performance.
In addition to its usual business as 
described above, during 2014, members  
of the Audit Committee met individual 
managers or groups of managers on a 
number of occasions to gain a deeper 
insight into areas relevant to the Audit 
chargebacks, cash discounts and returns 
(for more information, please see the 
Financial Review from page 70). The Audit 
Committee pays particular attention to 
management’s estimates of these items,  
its analysis of any unusual movements  
and their impact on revenue recognition 
informed by commentary from the  
external auditor. In particular, in 2014,  
the Audit Committee considered the  
accounting treatment of the US branded 
pharmaceutical fee following enactment  
of final regulations by the US Internal 
Revenue Service in the third quarter 
and the rebate calculation methodology 
and assumptions used at MedImmune.
Impairment of intangible assets
The Group has significant intangible assets 
arising from the acquisition of businesses 
and IP rights to medicines in development 
and on the market. In his quarterly report  
to the Audit Committee, the CFO outlines 
the carrying value of the Group’s intangible 
assets and, in respect of those intangible 
assets that are identified as at risk of 
impairment, the difference between the 
carrying value and management’s current 
estimate of discounted future cash flows  
for ‘at risk’ products (the headroom). 
Products will be identified as ‘at risk’ 
because the headroom is limited or 
because, for example, in the case of a 
medicine in development, a significant 
development milestone such as the 
publication of clinical trial results could 
significantly alter management’s forecasts 
for the product. 
In 2014, there were no significant 
impairments of intangible assets.
Litigation and contingent liabilities
Litigation, particularly that relating to the 
enforcement and defence of IP rights 
protecting medicines, is a significant feature 
of the pharmaceutical industry. In addition  
to IP litigation, the Group is involved in a 
number of government investigations and  
is a defendant in certain product liability 
actions. The Audit Committee receives 
regular updates from the General Counsel, 
and is informed by commentary from the 
external auditor, on the status of those 
litigation matters that might result in fines  
or damages against the Company to 
assess whether provisions should be taken 
and, if so, when and in what amounts. 
Of the matters the Audit Committee 
considered in 2014, the Nexium anti-trust 
case and the DOJ investigation into 
Brilinta were among the most significant. 
98 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 with the transitional guidance issued by the 
FRC. KPMG was first appointed as sole 
external auditor to AstraZeneca in 2001 
following a competitive tender. The new EU 
audit reform framework and the Competition 
& Markets Authority’s Order do not impact 
the Audit Committee’s decision to put the 
audit out to tender by 2018.
Non-audit services
The Audit Committee maintains a policy  
(the Non-Audit Services Policy) and 
procedures for the pre-approval of all audit 
services and permitted non-audit services 
undertaken by the external auditor, the 
principal purpose of which is to ensure that 
the independence of the external auditor  
is not impaired. The policies and procedures 
cover three categories of work: audit 
services; audit-related services; and tax 
services. The policies define the type of 
work that falls within each of these 
categories and the non-audit services that 
the external auditor is prohibited from 
performing under the rules of the SEC and 
other relevant UK and US professional and 
regulatory requirements. The pre-approval 
procedures permit certain audit, audit-
related and tax services to be performed  
by the external auditor during the year, 
subject to fee limits agreed with the Audit 
Committee in advance. The CFO (supported 
by the Vice-President, Group Financial 
Reporting) monitors the status of all services 
being provided by the external auditor. The 
procedures also deal with placing non-audit 
work out for tender, where appropriate. 
Authority to approve work in excess of the 
pre-agreed fee limits is delegated to the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee together 
with one other Audit Committee member in 
the first instance. A standing agenda item  
at Audit Committee meetings covers the 
operation of the pre-approval procedures 
and regular reports are provided to the  
full Audit Committee. 
In 2014, non-audit services provided  
to the Company by KPMG included tax 
compliance services and audit services in 
relation to employee benefit funds, within 
the scope of the pre-approved services set 
out in the Non-Audit Services Policy. The 
Audit Committee supported management’s 
decision to enter into an outsourcing 
arrangement for tax and statutory accounts 
preparation work, which, following 
implementation in 2014, resulted in such 
work previously undertaken by KPMG 
transitioning to another firm. In addition, for 
other non-audit services, management has 
determined that the Company’s auditors 
AstraZeneca successfully defended the 
claims against it in the Nexium anti-trust 
case and the DOJ decided to discontinue  
its investigation into the Brilinta PLATO trial.
Tax accounting
The Audit Committee considered the 
overall tax affairs of the Group in 2014, 
noting that the exposure associated with 
significant tax contingencies had reduced 
somewhat but remains significant. The 
Audit Committee considered the key tax 
developments at OECD, including proposed 
requirements for tax transparency through 
country-by-country reporting. The Audit 
Committee concluded that the Company 
would be well positioned to meet such 
additional requirements.
Post-retirement benefits
Pension accounting continues to be 
a significant area of focus. The Audit 
Committee reviewed solvency ratios for 
all significant pension plans and assessed 
ongoing actions to secure the long-term 
funding of the plans. The Audit Committee 
supported the Company’s funding plans.
Internal controls
At each quarterly meeting, the Audit 
Committee receives a report of the matters 
considered by the Disclosure Committee 
during the quarter. At the February 2015 
meeting, the CFO presented to the Audit 
Committee the conclusions of the CEO  
and the CFO following the evaluation of  
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls 
and procedures required by Item 15(a) of 
Form 20-F at 31 December 2014. Based  
on their evaluation, the CEO and the CFO 
concluded that, as at that date, we maintain 
an effective system of disclosure controls 
and procedures.
There was no change in our internal control 
over financial reporting that occurred during 
the period covered by this Annual Report 
that has materially affected, or is reasonably 
likely to materially affect, our internal control 
over financial reporting.
Appointing the auditor and safeguards 
on non-audit services
We noted in our 2012 Annual Report that, 
having reviewed the changes to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code with regard  
to putting the external audit contract out  
to tender at least every 10 years, and 
cognisant of the fact that the lead audit 
partner at KPMG rotated in 2013, the Audit 
Committee determined that the audit would 
be put out to tender by 2018 in accordance 
should only be engaged where they are  
the only credible choice of service provider 
for a particular piece of work. At its meeting 
in July 2014, the Audit Committee 
determined that, with immediate effect, all 
tax services to be performed by the auditor 
should be presented to the Audit Committee 
for pre-approval. This decision was in 
response to EU legislation that will restrict 
the non-audit services that can be provided 
by the external auditor and which is 
expected to be effective from June 2016. 
Fees paid to the auditor for audit, 
audit-related and other services are 
analysed in Note 29 to the Financial 
Statements on page 188. Fees for non-audit 
services amounted to 34% of the fees paid 
to KPMG for audit, audit-related and other 
services in 2014. 
Assessing external audit effectiveness
In accordance with its normal practice,  
the Audit Committee considered the 
performance of KPMG. It also considered 
KPMG’s compliance with the independence 
criteria under the relevant statutory, 
regulatory and ethical standards applicable 
to auditors and assessed its objectivity, 
taking into account the level of challenge 
provided around the critical estimates and 
judgements involved in our financial 
reporting and the quality of our internal 
control over financial reporting. Having 
considered all these factors, the Audit 
Committee recommended to the Board  
that a resolution for the re-appointment of 
KPMG as the Company’s external auditor 
for the year ending 31 December 2015 be 
proposed to shareholders at the AGM in 
April 2015. 
Consistent with current market practice, 
KPMG’s services to the Company are 
provided pursuant to terms of engagement, 
which are reviewed by the Audit Committee. 
Neither these terms of engagement nor  
any other agreement include any contractual 
obligations under which the Board would be 
prevented from appointing a different audit 
firm were they to consider this to be in the 
best interests of the Group. The Audit 
Committee, through management, 
continues to maintain contact and dialogue 
with other major audit firms who are familiar 
with the Group’s business for succession 
purposes as required.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dear shareholder 
2014 was an eventful year for 
AstraZeneca, as we continued to deliver 
on our ambitious strategy against the 
backdrop of uncertainty generated by  
a takeover approach in the first half  
of the year.
particularly in China, where we continue to 
outpace the market. Brilinta/Brilique also 
performed well. 
Our leadership team is similarly focused  
on our Achieve scientific leadership  
targets, with short- and long-term  
measures aligned to these priorities too.  
The Company delivered exceptional  
pipeline performance in 2014, with many 
opportunities accelerated and progressed 
significantly above expectations through 
innovative R&D, as well as successful 
strategic collaborations and acquisitions.  
To highlight two achievements, the year 
opened with the approval of Farxiga  
(for Type 2 diabetes mellitus) in the US  
and closed with the US and European 
approval of Lynparza for the treatment  
of ovarian cancer.
Our overall financial performance for the 
year reflects both where our market 
products are in their life-cycle and the 
progress made in our pipeline. We have 
invested heavily in our growth platforms  
and pipeline. Patent expiries have, as 
expected, led to a fall in Core operating 
profit and, as a consequence, Core EPS 
has also declined. Our short-term Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) performance, 
however, continues to improve, and from  
the start of 2014 to year end, AstraZeneca’s 
TSR was ranked first among its global 
pharmaceutical peers. The Board believes 
that the current leadership team is having  
a profound and positive impact on the 
performance of the Company. This has 
influenced the Remuneration Committee’s 
judgements about pay in 2014 and 2015. 
The Company has been reinvigorated by 
As the Remuneration Committee,  
our approach to pay is clear – we aim  
to use it to facilitate the implementation  
of AstraZeneca’s strategy and to promote 
the long-term success of the Company,  
with performance-related elements that  
are intended to be stretching and rigorously 
applied. During the course of 2014, the 
Remuneration Committee’s discussions  
and judgements reflected these core 
principles, and also took into account 
AstraZeneca’s overall performance, the 
personal contribution of the Executive 
Directors and the experience of our 
shareholders and their feedback.
2014 performance and outcomes
When Pascal Soriot joined AstraZeneca as 
CEO in October 2012, he articulated a clear 
and bold strategy based on three strategic 
pillars: Return to growth; Achieve scientific 
leadership; and Achieve Group financial 
targets. Since that time, all aspects of 
performance-related pay have been directly 
aligned to the business plan based on these 
pillars and developed to deliver the strategy.
Our Return to growth strategy is focused  
on revenue generation through the growth 
platforms of Brilinta/Brilique, the diabetes 
and respiratory franchises, Emerging 
Markets and Japan. Our pay framework 
supports these aims, with specific revenue 
targets for each area being included in both 
the short term incentive and long term 
incentive (LTI) plan performance measures. 
This year saw strong commercial 
performance in diabetes following our 
acquisition of BMS’s interest in the diabetes 
alliance respiratory driven by Symbicort;  
and strong sales in Emerging Markets, 
both the strategy which Mr Soriot has  
put in place since appointment, and the 
determination he has shown in driving  
this forward during 2013 and 2014. The 
Remuneration Committee also considered 
this performance within the context  
of the uncertainty created by the Pfizer 
approaches, with destabilising speculation 
persisting through most of the year. The 
Board believes that Mr Soriot has developed 
a truly innovative culture within AstraZeneca, 
which places science and patients  
at its heart, and this culture has been 
fundamental to the delivery of the strong 
scientific and commercial results this year. 
Taking all of this into account, the 
Remuneration Committee awarded Pascal 
Soriot an annual bonus for 2014 of 170%  
of base salary. We have awarded Marc 
Dunoyer an annual bonus for 2014 of 
149.4% of base salary.
The bonus award outcomes determined  
by the Remuneration Committee for  
Mr Soriot and Mr Dunoyer reflect strong 
corporate performance across all our  
global scorecard measures, but particularly 
those relating to Achieve scientific 
leadership and Group financial targets. 
These outcomes reflect the acceleration  
in our pipeline across all of our main therapy  
areas, most notably in oncology, and  
the strengthening of our growth platforms 
through targeted investments, such  
as the acquisition of BMS’s interest  
in the diabetes alliance. In 2014, the 
Company achieved a record six NDA/BLA 
product approvals and delivered four 
quarters of revenue growth with the Return 
to growth platforms now contributing over 
half of the Group’s revenues. 
100 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 We see remuneration  
as your resource,  
and we attempt to 
spend it wisely to 
increase the value  
of your shareholdings  
in AstraZeneca.”
of these longer term goals pre-dated the 
Pfizer approaches and our confidence in  
the achievement of them was an important 
part of the Board’s judgement to reject 
Pfizer. As a result, the Remuneration 
Committee believes that the existing 
performance measures already focus 
participants on the long-term targets that  
we articulated during the Pfizer approaches, 
and that, ultimately, the realisation of the 
annuaI bonus and LTI awards will be 
intimately influenced by the delivery of  
the independent strategy.
The Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
performance measures were amended  
to reflect the new strategy with effect from 
the beginning of 2013. During the year, the 
Remuneration Committee reviewed the 
AstraZeneca Investment Plan (AZIP), under 
which awards have an eight year time 
horizon. We concluded that the existing 
dividend yield and dividend cover metrics 
underpinning the AZIP and the original intent 
of the plan, which was to align Executives’ 
pay directly to the experience of the 
shareholder, remain valid. As such, no 
changes to the structure of LTI plans are 
currently proposed. The Remuneration 
Committee will continue to keep the overall 
levels of awards and structure of the 
remuneration framework under review as 
the business grows and the strategic plan  
is delivered.
Responding to shareholder feedback 
The Remuneration Committee took careful 
note of the response from shareholders to 
the 2013 Annual Report on Remuneration 
(the Implementation Report). The vote in 
favour of the Remuneration Policy was 
85.00% but the vote in favour of the 
Implementation Report was 61.46%. As  
part of my consultation with shareholders  
in the summer, I sought to understand the 
concerns that led to the lower than usual 
support for our Implementation Report,  
and how we might address these matters  
in the future. 
One concern raised was whether the 
Remuneration Committee has the ability  
to go outside the Remuneration Policy for 
new joiners – which was not, and is not,  
our intention. As a result, you will see in the 
introduction to our Remuneration Policy 
Report this year that we have included  
a statement to clarify that it is not the 
Remuneration Committee’s intention to go 
outside the Policy in respect of new recruits, 
and the Remuneration Committee maintains 
Key matters considered in 2014
The Pfizer approaches
In the course of the last year, approaches 
from Pfizer in January and again in May 
resulted in the Remuneration Committee 
meeting on a number of occasions to 
consider the key remuneration matters 
associated with a potential takeover. In the 
summer, I spoke with a number of major 
shareholders to seek their views on the 
Company’s approach to pay. This year,  
I particularly sought input on whether the 
rejection of the Pfizer approach impacted 
our shareholders’ opinions on how we 
should reward the Executive Directors.
The clear message we received was that 
our executive pay arrangements must be 
directly linked to the strategy and its delivery. 
There were some suggestions that we 
should include some of the 2023 metrics 
cited in response to Pfizer’s approaches. 
However, there was no consensus view as 
to how this should be structured and there 
was variation in shareholders’ individual 
preferences as to how the Remuneration 
Committee might respond.
The Remuneration Committee carefully 
considered this feedback, whilst being 
mindful that the existing annual bonus  
and LTI measures were recently revised in 
2013 to bring them into line with our new 
strategy, and already include a number of 
important science-based and commercial 
performance metrics. These measures are 
directly aligned to each stage of the pipeline 
and the commercial business plan, which 
are projected to deliver the Company’s 
longer term goals, including the 2023 
$45 billion revenue target. The existence  
its policy not to pay ‘golden hellos’ to 
executives upon joining AstraZeneca. 
In the Implementation Report, we have 
enhanced the disclosure of our retrospective 
annual bonus and LTI targets and outcomes. 
As you will know from what I wrote in this 
letter a year ago, the Board believes that  
the disclosure of certain targets in advance 
would create commercial risk. However, for 
each outstanding award under the PSP , we 
have disclosed the three-year cash flow and 
relative TSR targets in advance. We similarly 
disclose the AZIP targets in advance. In 
relation to the financial goal metrics for the 
annual bonus, we will habitually disclose 
these in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
of the year for which the targets were set 
(thus the 2014 financial targets can be found 
on page 106 in the Implementation Report). 
Our intention is that the Achieve scientific 
leadership and Return to growth targets 
supporting the annual bonus opportunity 
will be disclosed two years after the end of 
the performance year to which the targets 
relate. In respect of the PSP , the Achieve 
scientific leadership and Return to growth 
targets will be disclosed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, which coincides  
with the vesting date of the relevant awards 
(so for example the Achieve scientific 
leadership and Return to growth targets 
underlying the PSP awards made in March 
2015 will be disclosed in the 2017 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report). I hope that these 
improvements, along with the insights  
we have shared with regard to specific 
decisions relating to the CEO and CFO’s 
pay, will reassure shareholders that we  
are committed to providing readers with 
disclosure that is clear, transparent and 
appropriately timely. 
UK Corporate Governance Code
A revised UK Corporate Governance  
Code was published towards the end of the 
year. We aim to observe UK best practice. 
We note that last year’s introduction of an 
additional two-year holding period for 
Executive Director PSP awards, as well  
as the clawback and malus provisions 
included in all our executive LTI plans, 
means that the Company’s existing reward 
arrangements already comply with the 
relevant new elements of the Code. 
Chairman’s pay
The Chairman’s fee has not been changed 
since Mr Johansson took up the role in 
2012. During 2014, the Remuneration 
Committee reviewed the fee, and in 
101 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
Corporate Governance Corporate Governance
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
recognition of Mr Johansson’s excellent 
leadership of the Board and the amount of 
time he dedicates to AstraZeneca, which 
exceeds what the Board anticipated at the 
time of his appointment, the Remuneration 
Committee felt that it was appropriate to 
increase his fee from £500,000 to £575,000 
with effect from 1 July 2014. 
Non-Executive Director pay
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors  
have not been reviewed since 2010. In 
recognition of the increased demands  
of chairing Board committees generally,  
and the increasing business development 
activity, which is reviewed by the Science 
Committee, the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors determined that the fees for 
chairing a committee and for membership 
of the Science Committee should increase 
with effect from 1 January 2015. Details are 
set out on page 1 14. Other fees remain 
unchanged.
Approach to remuneration in 2015 
In 2015, the Remuneration Committee will 
continue to ensure that the Company’s 
approach to pay incentivises and rewards 
long-term performance, helping to deliver 
sustainable shareholder value. The setting of 
our global scorecard and LTI performance 
measures will continue to link directly to  
the long-term business plan (including the  
2023 $45 billion revenue target, which we 
announced in May 2014), with measures 
aligned to each key stage of the pipeline  
and the core commercial growth platforms. 
In 2015, we will include an oncology sales 
target, representing its future strategic 
importance to the business, within the 
cohort of commercial targets in the Return 
to growth group of measures as we 
continue to ensure pay is aligned to the  
core aspects of the strategy. We believe  
this therapy area will play a key role in 
delivering the Company’s long-term 
strategy. It is important that the pay of our 
senior executives is tied to the successful 
delivery of these milestones. 
I will describe the other elements of  
Mr Soriot’s compensation. He received a 
salary increase of 3% effective 1 January 
2015. This increase is in line with the wider 
employee population. The Remuneration 
Committee intends to award a within-Policy, 
but above target, LTI grant for 2015 of 285% 
of base salary (target remaining 250%). 
During the year, the Remuneration 
Committee reviewed the CEO’s pay against 
both the FTSE30 market and the US 
pharmaceutical peer group. This award 
reflects the Remuneration Committee’s 
desire to reward and incentivise sustained 
value-creating performance when evaluated 
against his direct peer group, while also 
recognising, and being sensitive to, our 
shareholders’ expectations. We believe that 
it is strongly in the interests of shareholders 
that Mr Soriot’s compensation opportunity 
is both competitive and motivational.
Marc Dunoyer received a salary increase  
of 2% for 2015, broadly in line with the wider 
employee population, and the Remuneration 
Committee proposes a within-Policy, but 
above target, LTI award of 210% of base 
salary (target remaining 200%). 2014 was 
Marc’s first full year as CFO of AstraZeneca. 
With Pascal Soriot, he delivered a strong 
financial performance, while also remaining 
a key leader in business development 
activity, including leading the project to 
acquire Almirall’s respiratory franchise. 
We see remuneration as your resource,  
and we attempt to spend it wisely to 
increase the value of your shareholdings in 
AstraZeneca. We hope you feel that we are 
striking the right balance between protecting 
your interests by not over-spending on the 
one hand, and on the other, rewarding our  
senior executives fairly and subject to the 
Policy approved by our shareholders at  
the 2014 AGM.
We greatly value our ongoing dialogue  
with our shareholders and, as always, we 
welcome your feedback on this Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.

Independent Adviser  
to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee re-appointed 
Deloitte as its independent adviser following 
a tender process undertaken in 2013, which 
involved interviews with both the Company’s 
management and the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. Deloitte’s service 
to the Remuneration Committee was 
provided on a time-spent basis at a cost  
to the Company of £71,300 (excluding VAT). 
During the year, Deloitte also provided

Key areas of shareholder concern with our 2013 Directors’ Remuneration Report
The Remuneration Committee has carefully considered shareholders’ comments about the 2013 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Following the AGM, the Remuneration Committee Chairman met and/or spoke with the Company’s major shareholders to understand  
their views.
The table below describes what the Remuneration Committee understands to have been the key areas of shareholder concern and how it 
has sought to address those concerns in this year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Policy Report
Focus of shareholder commentary The Remuneration Committee’s response
A perception that the Remuneration Committee has 
the ability to go outside the Remuneration Policy (the 
Policy) for new joiners.
The Remuneration Committee has sought to clarify its treatment of remuneration for new joiners under the Policy. 
See paragraphs headed ‘Operating guidelines’ on page 124.
 The Policy becoming effective from 1 January 2015 
instead of from the date of the Company’s AGM.
As the Remuneration Committee indicated in the 2013 annual report, it intended to and, in fact, did apply the Policy 
in determination of its remuneration decisions during 2014. 
2013 Implementation Report 
Focus of shareholder commentary The Remuneration Committee’s response
A wish for greater disclosure of
  >  annual bonus performance targets  
and outcomes 
  >  PSP performance targets.
Annual bonus: the Remuneration Committee has enhanced the disclosure of performance outcomes and has 
included the 2013 and 2014 targets for the Achieve Group financial targets performance measures, as set out in 
the Annual bonus section on pages 106 and 107. The Remuneration Committee has also provided performance 
outcomes under the Achieve scientific leadership and Return to growth areas. It considers that the targets 
themselves remain commercially sensitive. We commit to providing full disclosure of these targets when they are 
deemed to be no longer commercially sensitive, which we currently anticipate to be two years after the end of the 
performance period.
PSP: the Remuneration Committee has disclosed the cumulative cash flow and TSR targets for existing  
awards; see the Performance Share Plan section on page 108, and will include these targets in the disclosure  
of future awards.
The Remuneration Committee continues to consider the performance targets relating to the Achieve scientific 
leadership and Return to growth measures as commercially sensitive. We commit to providing full disclosure  
of these targets when they are deemed to be no longer commercially sensitive, which we currently anticipate  
to be immediately following the end of the performance period.
The Remuneration Committee intends to maintain this level of disclosure in future Implementation Reports.
A wish for greater disclosure of the rationale  
for the exercise of the Remuneration Committee’s 
discretion in respect of the CEO’s 2013 bonus  
award and 2014 LTI award.
The Remuneration Committee acknowledges the wish of shareholders to understand better the rationale for 
annual bonus and LTI awards, especially if these are above target, and has sought to address this for 2015  
through the disclosures in the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee’s statement from page 100 and in the 
Annual bonus section from page 105. 
The increase in the CEO’s pension allowance. The Remuneration Committee has noted the concerns of shareholders and will be mindful of this when considering 
the CEO’s pension allowance in the future. However, the Remuneration Committee is also cognisant of the need  
to ensure that the overall remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors are competitive.
There has not been any increase in the CEO’s pension allowance for 2015. 
Basis of preparation of this Directors’ Remuneration Report
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the Regulations) and meets the relevant requirements of the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Listing Rules. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the Implementation Report of this Directors’ Remuneration 
Report will be proposed at the AGM on 24 April 2015.
Terms of reference
A copy of the Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference is available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com. The Remuneration 
Committee conducted a review of its terms of reference during 2014. A number of changes were recommended to the Board, principally  
to reflect the changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code during the year. The changes were approved by the Board in February 2015.

  Executive Directors may select benefits within the Company’s UK Flexible Benefits Programme or can select to take all, or any remaining allowance after the selection of benefits, in cash. In 2014,  
the Executive Directors principally took the allowance in cash (£102,000 in respect of Mr Soriot, and £56,000 in respect of Mr Dunoyer) and selected other benefits including healthcare insurance, 
death-in-service provision and advice in relation to tax.
2
 One-third of the pre-tax bonus is deferred into Ordinary Shares. These will be held for three years before being released, subject to continued employment. The bonus is not pensionable.
3
  For Mr Soriot, for 2014, this sum is equivalent to 30% of base salary. For Mr Soriot, for 2013, and Mr Dunoyer for both 2013 and 2014, this sum is equivalent to 24% of base salary. In all instances  
the sums were taken as a cash alternative to participation in a defined contribution pension scheme.
4
 Mr Dunoyer was appointed as CFO with effect from 1 November 2013, with an annualised base salary of £680,000.
5
 Mr Lowth ceased to be a Director of the Company on 31 October 2013.

  Includes office costs (invoiced in Swedish krona) of £34,500 for 2014, and £40,000 for 2013. The Remuneration Committee approved an inflation-related increase in office costs with effect  
from 1 August 2014.
Additional notes to the Directors’ single total figure remuneration table
Annual bonus
For 2014, the principal drivers of annual bonus opportunity were measures for Achieve Group financial targets (40%), Achieve scientific 
leadership (30%) and Return to growth (30%), together with individual performance, details of which are set out below. The CEO had a 
target annual bonus of 100% of base salary (range 0-180%) and the CFO had a target annual bonus of 90% of base salary (range 0-150%).
One-third of the pre-tax bonuses earned for the year will be deferred into Ordinary Shares which will vest three years from the date  
of deferral, subject to continued employment.
The precise targets or target ranges set at the beginning of the performance period are closely aligned to the Company’s strategic  
priorities, set out in the global scorecard. Following feedback from shareholders that they would like to see greater disclosure of the link 
between performance and pay outcomes, we have sought to increase our disclosure levels around the annual bonus, while being mindful 
of commercial sensitivity in some areas. As such, under the Achieve Group financial targets element of the bonus, we have set out overleaf 
the targets for 2014 and Company performance against those targets. In addition, we have provided the outcomes under each of the 
Achieve scientific leadership and Return to growth measures. While, in the judgement of the Board, the targets themselves under these 
areas remain commercially sensitive, we will make retrospective disclosure of these when we no longer consider the targets to be 
commercially sensitive, which we currently anticipate to be two years after the end of the performance period.
Furthermore, we have sought to provide shareholders with more context around our performance in 2013 and, as such, have provided 
2013 targets for the Achieve Group financial targets measure at the bottom of this section.
Although the performance targets in the global scorecard drive prima facie bonus outcomes, the Remuneration Committee also applies 
judgement to assess the Executive Director’s individual performance. In 2014, the Remuneration Committee determined that Mr Soriot’s 
annual bonus should amount to 170% of base salary, representing 94.4% of the potential maximum. The Remuneration Committee 
determined that Mr Dunoyer’s bonus should amount to 149.4% of base salary, representing 99.6% of the potential maximum. 
105 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
Corporate Governance Corporate Governance > Directors’ Remuneration Report
The bonus award outcomes determined by the Remuneration Committee for both Mr Soriot and Mr Dunoyer reflect strong corporate 
performance across all our global scorecard measures, but particularly those relating to Achieve scientific leadership and Achieve Group 
financial targets. These outcomes reflect the acceleration in our pipeline across all main therapy areas, most notably in oncology, and  
the strengthening of our growth platforms through targeted investments, such as the acquisition of BMS’s interest in the diabetes alliance.  
In 2014, the Company achieved a record six NDA/BLA product approvals and delivered four quarters of revenue growth with the Return  
to growth platforms now contributing over half of the Group’s revenues. 
1. Achieve Group financial targets
These targets are based on the Company’s key financial measures. The annual bonus outcomes reflect the strong revenue and cash flow 
performance delivered in 2014, exceeding the targets set at the beginning of the year. Core EPS performance was also above target.

2. Achieve scientific leadership
These measures reflect the Company’s ability to deliver innovation to the market. In 2014, we continued to make significant progress 
towards achieving scientific leadership and exceeded three out of five of our pipeline targets. The AstraZeneca pipeline now includes  
133 projects, of which 1 18 are in the clinical phase of development. There are 13 NME projects currently in late-stage development, either  
in Phase III/pivotal Phase II studies or under regulatory review. During 2014, across the portfolio, 50 projects successfully progressed to their 
next phase. This includes two first launches and four first approvals in a major market, and 14 NME progressions. In addition, 21 projects 
have entered Phase I and nine projects have been discontinued.

106 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 4. Individual performance
The Remuneration Committee’s decisions recognise the profound and positive impact that the CEO and the CFO are having on the 
performance of the Company. Mr Soriot’s focus on delivering the strategy and the leadership he displayed during the Pfizer approaches 
have enabled the organisation to deliver strong scientific, financial, and commercial results in 2014. This performance has been delivered 
while implementing a significant programme of change in the organisation.
2014 was Mr Dunoyer’s first full year as CFO of AstraZeneca. With Mr Soriot he delivered a strong financial performance, while also 
remaining a key leader in business development activity, including leading the project to acquire Almirall’s respiratory franchise. 
Disclosure of Achieve Group financial targets information for 2013
The Remuneration Committee has determined that the 2013 targets relating to the Achieve Group financial targets element of the annual

at a grant price of 3904 pence per share.
Description of interest The PSP provides for the grant of awards over Ordinary Shares or ADSs. The vesting date is the third anniversary of the date  
of the award, subject to performance and continued employment.
The annual target award is expressed as a percentage of base salary. Awards are weighted 75% in favour of the PSP and 25%

285% of base salary (expected value).
Mr Dunoyer’s LTI award (PSP and AZIP):
200% of base salary (expected value).
For the PSP, we assume an expected value on vesting of 50% of the value of the award at grant.
For Mr Soriot, this equated to a PSP award at face value  
of 427.5% of base salary.
For Mr Dunoyer, this equated to a PSP award at face value

End of performance period 31 December 2016
Summary of performance measures 
and targets
A combination of measures focused on our scientific, commercial and financial performance assessed over the relevant three-year 
performance period:
Twenty-five percent of the award is based on the relative TSR performance of the Company against a predetermined peer group  
of global pharmaceutical companies. The rank which the Company’s TSR achieves over the performance period will determine how 
many shares will vest under the part of the award subject to the TSR performance measure. Payouts against performance  
in relation to TSR for PSP awards are expressed as a percentage of the maximum award currently payable, shown within a range of 
0% to 100%, as shown in the table below.
TSR ranking of the Company –  
PSP awards made in 2013 and 2014 % of award under TSR performance measure that vests
Below median 0%
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata
Upper quartile 75%
Above upper quartile 75% to 100% at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion
More information about the TSR performance of the Company, including the Company’s peer group, is set out in the Total 
shareholder return section on page 111.
Twenty-five percent of the award is based on the achievement of a cumulative free cash flow target. The measure for the cash  
flow target for the PSP awards made in 2013 and 2014 is net cash flow before distributions and other adjustments required by the 
performance conditions (subject to any further adjustments the Remuneration Committee chooses to make using its judgement) 
and thus referred to as ‘adjusted cumulative cash flow’, over the same three-year performance period as the TSR performance 
measure, and the level of vesting for the part of the award subject to the cash flow performance measure is based on a sliding scale 
between a threshold cash flow target and an upper target. Vesting levels in relation to the threshold target and the upper target are 
shown in the table below.
Adjusted cumulative cash flow –  
PSP awards made in 2013 and 2014 % of award under cash flow performance measure that vests
Less than $9 billion 0%
$9 billion 25%
Between $9 billion and $11 billion Pro rata
$11 billion 75%
Between $11 billion and $13 billion Pro rata
$13 billion and above 100%
Twenty-five percent of the award is based on Achieve scientific leadership measures covering five areas: an NME target, which 
reflects the Company’s ability to deliver innovation to the market; major life-cycle management approvals, which represent a good 
proxy for near-to-mid term growth; the volume of NMEs in Phase III and their registration; a target for peak-year sales, to track the 
value of pipeline output; and delivery from our research and early development organisation, assessed by Phase II starts.
Twenty-five percent of the award is based on Return to growth measures based on quantitative sales targets relating to the 
Company’s five growth platforms: Brilinta/Brilique, diabetes, respiratory, Emerging Markets, and Japan. 
As the PSP performance measures related to Achieve scientific leadership and Return to growth are an indicator of the Company’s 
longer-term strategic priorities, we believe that the targets/target ranges associated with them are commercially sensitive. We will 
make retrospective disclosure when the targets are deemed to be no longer commercially sensitive, which we currently anticipate to 
be immediately following the end of the performance period.
More information about the PSP’s performance measures is set out on page 120 of the Remuneration Policy Report.

110 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Total shareholder return (TSR)
The graph below compares the TSR performance of the Company over the past six years with the TSR of the FTSE100 Index. This graph is 
re-based to 100 at the start of the relevant period. As a constituent of the FTSE100, this index represents an appropriate reference point for 
the Company. We have also included a ‘Pharmaceutical peers average’, which reflects the TSR of the current comparator group and 
provides shareholders with additional context.
The charts below show how the Company’s TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the relevant companies in the comparator 
group from the first day in the three-year performance period in respect of the PSP awards made in 2013 and 2014, and how the Company 
ranks against those other companies on this basis.
To alleviate any short-term volatility, the return index is averaged in the TSR calculations for each company over the three months prior  
to the start of the relevant performance period (as stipulated in the PSP rules) and, for the purposes of the charts below, over the last three 
months of 2014.

Corporate Governance Corporate Governance > Directors’ Remuneration Report
Directors’ interests in shares (Audited)
Under the Company’s Articles all Directors must, within two months of their appointment, acquire a beneficial interest in at least 500  
shares in the Company. All of the Directors fulfil this requirement at the date of this Directors’ Remuneration Report.
In addition to this mandatory requirement, the Board imposes minimum shareholding requirements on the Executive Directors and SET 
members. The CEO is required to build a shareholding and hold shares amounting to 300% of base salary, and the CFO is required to  
hold shares amounting to 200% of base salary, each within five years of their date of appointment. At the date of this report, Mr Soriot  
has fulfilled this requirement. Due to Mr Dunoyer’s recent appointment as CFO, he is currently working towards fulfilling the shareholding 
requirement for this role. All other SET members are required to build a shareholding over time and hold 125% of base salary as shares 
while in office.
The Board also encourages each Non-Executive Director to build up, over a period of three years, a shareholding in the Company with a 
value approximately equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director (£75,000) or, in the case of the Chairman, approximately 
equivalent to his basic annual fee (£575,000). Ann Cairns, who was appointed as a Non-Executive Director at the Company’s AGM held in 
April 2014, is building her shareholding in the Company to fulfil this expectation. All of the other Non-Executive Directors, including the 
Chairman, had fulfilled this expectation as at 31 December 2014.
The tables below show the interests of the Directors (including the interests of their Connected Persons, as such term is defined in  
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in Ordinary Shares as at 31 December 2014, as well as details of any Director’s interests  
in options over the Company’s shares. All such interests were beneficial except as otherwise stated. No Director or senior executive 
beneficially owns, or has options over, 1% or more of the issued share capital of the Company, nor do they have different voting rights  
from other shareholders. None of the Directors has a beneficial interest in the shares of any of the Company’s subsidiaries. Between  
31 December 2014 and 5 February 2015, there was no change in the interests in Ordinary Shares shown in the tables below.

112 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2015
This section sets out how the Remuneration Committee intends to implement our Remuneration Policy during 2015. 
Effective from 1 January 2015, Mr Soriot’s base salary was increased, in line with increases in the UK employee population, by 3%  
to £1, 167 ,000. Mr Soriot’s target annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged at 100% of salary and his LTI plan target will remain 
unchanged at 250% of base salary. However, the Remuneration Committee has granted an above-target LTI award for 2015 of 285%  
of base salary.
Effective from 1 January 2015, Mr Dunoyer’s base salary was increased, broadly in line with increases in the UK employee population, by 
2% to £694,000. His target annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged at 90% of base salary and his LTI plan target award will remain 
unchanged at 200% of base salary. However, the Remuneration Committee has granted an above-target LTI award for 2015 of 210%  
of base salary.
The annual bonus measures and weightings for 2015 are set out in the table below and are broadly consistent with those applicable in 
2014. However, oncology has been added as a new therapy area under our Return to growth measure. Individual performance for each  
of the Executive Directors will be assessed by reference to individual objectives in line with the Company’s objectives for the year.
The performance measures and weightings for 2015 in respect of the LTI plans (AZIP and PSP) will be consistent with those described  
in the Long Term Incentives section in the Remuneration Policy Report from page 1 19.

Corporate Governance Corporate Governance > Directors’ Remuneration Report
Summary of Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration for 2015
Board and Committee fees for the Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, were reviewed in 2014. The review of the Chairman’s 
fee and the fees for chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees took into account relevant benchmark data from FTSE100 and 
FTSE30 companies and the resultant fee levels, in each case, remain below the FTSE30 median. The review of the fees for the Science 
Committee, for which there are few, if any, market benchmarks, took account of the increased scope of its remit and associated time 
commitment. The Non-Executive Director fees for 2015 (together with those for 2014) are set out below. Further information on the 
Non-Executive Directors’ Board and Committee fees can be found on page 128 of the Remuneration Policy Report.

Corporate Governance Corporate Governance > Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration Policy Report
This section sets out the Remuneration Policy (the Policy) that was approved by shareholders at the Company’s AGM in April 2014. 
It is intended that the Policy shall remain in effect for a period of three years from 1 January 2015.
The Policy set out below has not been amended since its approval by shareholders in April 2014, other than to show changes to individual 
remuneration in 2015 in the Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors section on page 123, which remain within Policy. However, 
mindful of shareholder commentary on the Policy since its approval, the Remuneration Committee has sought to clarify certain aspects  
of the Policy in relation to its approach to recruitment remuneration for Executive Directors and has adopted ‘Operating guidelines’ with 
effect from 1 January 2015 identified on page 124, which do not form part of the Company’s Policy as approved by shareholders. These 
clarifications are marked in bold in this Policy Report.
Setting the Company’s Policy
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about specific remuneration 
arrangements in the broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group. All roles within the organisation are benchmarked 
against comparable roles in similar organisations and in the employee’s local market to ensure the Company is paying fairly at all levels. 
Executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements are benchmarked against a global pharmaceutical peer group and the FTSE30. Each year 
the Company actively engages with its employees, either on a Group-wide basis or in the context of smaller focus groups, in order to solicit 
feedback generally and on a wide range of specified issues, including pay. 
While the Remuneration Committee did not consult with employees when determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration policy, it does 
annually review Group remuneration data including ratios of average pay to senior executive pay; bonus data; gender and geographical 
data in relation to base salaries and variable compensation; and aggregate data about the shareholding levels of senior managers. Many 
employees are also shareholders in the Company and therefore had the opportunity to vote at the 2014 AGM on this Remuneration Policy 
Report. In reviewing the base salaries of Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee considers the overall level of any salary 
increases being awarded to employees in the Executive Director’s local market in the relevant year. 
In all aspects of its work, the Remuneration Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and 
the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders. It consults the Company’s largest investors on general 
and specific remuneration matters and provides an annual opportunity for representatives of those investors to meet the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and other Remuneration Committee and Board members. It is the Company’s policy to seek input from major 
shareholders on an ad hoc basis where significant changes to remuneration arrangements are proposed. The Company’s shareholders 
are encouraged to attend the Company’s AGM and any views expressed will be considered by the Remuneration Committee’s members. 
The Remuneration Committee works with the Audit Committee to ensure that the Group’s remuneration policies and practices achieve 
the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good performance, managing risk, and the pursuit of the Company’s 
business objectives. 
Legacy arrangements
The Remuneration Committee may approve remuneration payments and payments for loss of office where the terms of the payment were 
agreed before the Policy came into effect, or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company (provided that, in the 
opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the agreement was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company). 
This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the Remuneration Committee in connection with such payments.
For these purposes, payments include the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration including awards over 
shares, on the basis of the terms agreed at the time the award is granted.
Minor amendments
The Remuneration Committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for the Directors as described in this Remuneration 
Policy Report (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes, or to take account of a change in legislation).
116 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors
Fixed elements of remuneration: base salary, benefits and pension
The Company’s approach to determining and reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors and the employee population as a whole is the same. 
On an annual basis, the salaries for individual roles are reviewed in the context of individual sustained performance and the external market. AstraZeneca 
participates in annual global compensation surveys, which provide benchmarking data for all roles within the organisation, ensuring a robust salary 
review process for all employees.
The Company seeks to provide an appropriate range of competitive benefits, including pension, to all employees (including Directors) in the context 
of their local market.
Base salary
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Base salary is intended to 
be sufficient (but no more 
than necessary) to attract, 
retain and develop 
high-calibre individuals 
in order to deliver the 
Company’s strategy.
The Remuneration Committee determines base salary based on a number 
of factors, including (but not limited to):
 > Recognition of the value of an individual’s sustained personal 
performance and contribution to the business
 > The individual’s skills and experience 
 > Internal relativities
 > Conditions in the relevant external market.
Base salaries are normally reviewed annually to ensure they remain 
competitive, with any change usually taking effect from 1 January. 
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of base salary.
The current base salaries can be found on page 105 of the 
Implementation Report. 
While there is no formal maximum, annual base salary 
increases, if any, for the Executive Directors will normally be  
in line with the percentage increases awarded to the employee 
population within the individual’s country location. 
Higher increases may be made if the Remuneration Committee 
in its discretion considers it appropriate. For example, this may 
include:
 > Increase in the scope and/or responsibility of the individual’s role
 > Development of the individual within the role.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
To provide market 
competitive benefits.
Non-cash benefits are 
designed to be sufficient 
(but no more generous 
than necessary) to attract, 
retain and develop 
high-calibre individuals in 
order to deliver the 
Company’s strategy.
UK-based Executive Directors are provided with a fund under the UK 
Flexible Benefits Programme. The fund value is based on a range of 
benefits including:
 > Private Medical Insurance for partner and children
 > Life assurance
 > Permanent health insurance
 > Company car
 > Additional holidays
 > Other additional benefits made available by the Company from time  
to time that the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate based  
on the Executive Director’s circumstances.
A Director may choose to take a proportion of, or the entire fund, as cash.
Non-UK-based Executive Directors will receive a range of benefits (or a 
fund of equivalent value) comparable to those typically offered in their local 
market. They can elect to take the fund as cash or elect one or more of 
these benefits and take the balance as cash.
At its discretion, for Executive Directors on an international assignment or 
relocating to take up other Company duties, the Remuneration Committee 
may consider support towards the reasonable costs of relocation. 
At its discretion, the Remuneration Committee may provide an allowance 
towards the reasonable fees for professional services such as legal, tax, 
property and financial advice. The Company may also fund the cost of a 
driver and car for Executive Directors.
The Company also provides Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance and 
an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the Company’s 
Articles. 
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of benefits.
The current value of benefits available can be found on page 
105 of the Implementation Report. 
The maximum value of the fund available under the UK Flexible 
Benefits Programme will be equivalent to the cost to the

The maximum value of the suite of benefits for non-UK-based 
Executive Directors will be equivalent to the cost of the suite of 
benefits at the time. 
The value of the support towards the costs of relocation will be 
the reasonable costs associated with the Executive Director’s

The value of the support towards the costs of professional fees 
and other costs will be the reasonable costs associated with the 
Executive Director’s particular circumstances.
The maximum value of the Directors’ and Officers’ Liability 
Insurance and third party indemnity insurance is the cost at the 
relevant time. 
While the Remuneration Committee has not set an overall level 
of benefit provision, the Remuneration Committee keeps the 
benefit policy and benefit levels under review. 
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Provision of retirement 
benefits to attract,

high-calibre individuals 
in order to deliver the 
Company’s strategy.
Company allocations for Executive Directors’ pensions will be a proportion 
of the individual’s base salary and is in line with local market practice.
As part of the UK Flexible Benefits Programme, the Company provides an 
allocation consisting of a percentage of the UK-based Executive Director’s 
base salary, which the Executive Director can elect to pay into a pension 
scheme or take as cash. The Company will allocate an amount 
benchmarked to the local market. 
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of pension.
Currently the CEO and CFO receive an allocation equivalent 
to 30% and 24% of their base salaries respectively as a 
contribution towards the cost of their pension provisions. 
The maximum annual allocation that may be provided to 
UK-based Executive Directors is 35% of base salary.
Non-UK-based Executive Directors will receive a fund for the 
purpose of providing retirement benefits in line with the local 
market practice. The maximum value of that fund will be a sum 
equivalent to local market practice. The Executive Director may 
elect to take some or all of the fund as cash.

Variable elements of remuneration 
Annual bonus
All employee bonuses are determined by reference to the Group scorecard and an assessment of individual performance. The Group scorecard is 
designed to reflect the Company’s strategy and the focus of its business activity and priorities in the performance year. The performance measures are 
recommended by the CEO and determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each year. They are designed to ensure that all eligible 
employees receive an element of reward based on the Group’s overall financial and non-financial performance. A scorecard approach ensures that all 
employees across functions and geographies are focused on the activities critical to delivering the business strategy. The performance measures and 
weightings underlying the annual bonus plan will be disclosed in advance. The outcomes against targets, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, will be 
disclosed in arrears. The Implementation Report will identify, in arrears, the performance versus the objectives and the consequent levels of 
remuneration deemed appropriate by the Remuneration Committee. 
For Executive Directors, one-third of their pre-tax annual bonus is delivered in shares, which are deferred for three years, under the Deferred Bonus Plan. 
Employees below SET level receive a bonus in cash and are not required to defer a proportion in shares.
Annual bonus: cash
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The annual cash bonus 
rewards short-term 
performance against 
specific annual Group 
and individual objectives.
These objectives are 
designed to facilitate the 
delivery of the Company’s 
short-term strategy and 
thereby create value 
for our shareholders 
over time.
The annual cash bonus is based on Group and individual performance in the relevant 
performance year.
Scorecard measures and targets are set annually by the Remuneration Committee 
based on the key strategic objectives for the year. Payout levels are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee after the year end, based on performance against targets. 
The performance period is one year.
The performance measures form a Group scorecard which is closely aligned to business 
strategy, and rewards scientific, commercial and financial success. While we expect the 
performance measures to be largely unchanged each year, the Remuneration Committee 
believes it is inadvisable to commit to a fixed set of measures in advance in order to retain 
flexibility to align incentives with the focus of corporate strategy in the relevant year. 
The greatest weighting is typically placed on the achievement of financial targets, with 
an equal weighting between the scientific and commercial growth metrics reflecting the 
importance of both sales and R&D success. The actual annual weighting will depend  
on the strategic priorities for the performance year. 
The Group scorecard is made up of a number of separate metrics within each performance 
measure. Each metric has a payout range associated with it (including a target which is 
intended to be stretching). In relation to each metric, a threshold level of performance is 
specified. If performance falls below this level there will be no payout for that proportion 
of the award. Each metric has a different weighting. If none of the metrics attributable to 
a performance measure is met then a bonus payout will not be made in respect of that 
performance measure. If none of the metrics is met in any of the performance measures, 
then no bonus payout will be made.
The Board will consider Company performance against the Group scorecard objectives as 
well as the Executive Director’s individual performance in order to determine the value of the 
bonus award. Individual performance will be assessed by the Remuneration Committee on 
the basis of objective criteria established by the Chairman in the case of the CEO, and by 
the CEO in the case of the CFO. The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to move 
the theoretical award up or down subject to the annual bonus award being no greater than 
the maximum percentage of base salary applicable to that award in the year in question.
The Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to ensure that a fair and balanced 
outcome is achieved, taking into account the overall performance of the Company and 
the experience of its shareholders.
Two-thirds of the annual bonus is delivered in cash and one-third is delivered in shares, 
which are deferred for three years as explained opposite. 
The annual bonus, including the deferred share element, payable for target performance for 
the CEO is currently 100% of base salary and for the CFO is currently 90% of base salary. 
For bonuses awarded in respect of 2015 and subsequent years, the Remuneration 
Committee will have discretion, for up to six years from the payment date, to claw back 
from individuals some or all of the cash bonus award in certain circumstances including 
(i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage 
to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual. However, in the case of (i) and 
(ii) the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years from 
the payment date.
The maximum annual amount payable to an 
Executive Director is 250% of base salary. 
If the Remuneration Committee ever felt that 
it would be in the interests of shareholders 
to grant an annual bonus of an amount 
exceeding the historical maximum opportunity 
of 180% of base salary in the case of the 
CEO and 150% of base salary in the case of 
the CFO, it would consult major shareholders 
in advance.
118 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Annual bonus: Deferred Bonus Plan
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The deferred share 
element of the annual cash 
bonus under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan is designed to 
align Executive Directors’ 
interests with those of 
shareholders. 
Executive Directors are required to defer one-third of their pre-tax annual cash bonus 
into shares. 
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends that would have been paid during 
the three-year holding period will be paid subject to continued employment.
Directors must normally remain in employment for three years from grant for deferred 
shares to vest.
Once performance measures have been applied to determine the value of the total bonus, 
no further performance measures apply to the deferred share element.
For deferred share elements relating to bonuses awarded in respect of 2015 and 
subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee has discretion: 
 > to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested deferred bonus award in certain 
circumstances (malus), including (i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) 
significant reputational damage to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual 
 > for up to six years from the vesting date, to claw back from individuals some or all of the 
deferred bonus award in certain circumstances, including (i) material restatement of the 
results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the Group, or (iii) serious 
misconduct by the individual. However, in the case of (i) and (ii) the Remuneration 
Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years from the vesting date. 
The maximum deferred bonus for Executive 
Directors is one-third of the maximum pre-tax 
bonus as detailed in the Annual bonus:  
cash section on page 118.
Long Term Incentives (LTIs)
Overview: An Executive Director’s target LTI award is considered annually and set at a level which takes account of market analysis. The Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to grant awards above or below target based on individual performance and potential. The CEO’s current LTI target is 250% 
of base salary on an expected value basis, and the CFO’s current LTI target is 200% of base salary on an expected value basis. An illustration of the 
expected value basis can be found in the Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors section from page 123.
The Company’s variable long-term arrangements for Executive Directors currently comprise two LTI plans: the PSP and the AZIP . Under each of these 
plans the maximum market value of shares that may be awarded is 500% of a participant’s base salary. If the Remuneration Committee ever felt that 
it would be in the interests of shareholders to grant annual variable awards to an Executive Director with values exceeding the historical range of up to 
500% in aggregate under the LTI plans, it would consult major shareholders in advance. Currently when LTI awards are granted to Executive Directors, 
the split between the two plans is weighted in the proportion: 75% PSP and 25% AZIP .
When granting LTI awards the Remuneration Committee applies a target as a percentage of base salary on an expected value basis. For the AZIP , 
the expected value on vesting is 100% of the value of the award at grant. For the PSP , the expected value on vesting is 50% of the value of the award 
at grant. 
The table overleaf explains the operation, minimums and maximums payable under each of these LTI plans.
Performance measures: Performance measures are recommended by the CEO and determined by the Remuneration Committee. The performance 
measures in respect of the PSP are designed to drive long-term performance against the Company’s strategic objectives, in terms of commercial, 
scientific and financial success. 
In respect of the AZIP , dividend-based performance hurdles motivate the generation of returns for shareholders on a sustainable basis over an extended 
period of time, and will be set by the Remuneration Committee at a level it considers appropriate at the start of the performance period. The combined 
eight-year performance and holding period is designed to reflect the development cycle of a medicine and therefore to align executive reward with 
successful product development.
When setting the performance measures at the start of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee will also determine an appropriate  
payout curve (if any), for each measure. The Remuneration Committee will assess performance against the performance measures to determine the 
level of payout. The Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to increase or decrease the payout should it consider it appropriate, subject  
to the maximum percentage of base salary applicable in the year in question. The intention of the Remuneration Committee is to exercise judgement 
appropriately, in particular so that the experience of shareholders over time is taken into account. As a matter of good practice, certain major 
shareholders would be consulted before any material change to the performance measures for the PSP or AZIP are implemented.
The Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that, on the one hand, reward outcomes are not purely mechanistic; but on the other, that in exercising 
its discretion, that exercise is not seen by employees to be arbitrary or unfair. The Remuneration Committee’s objective is to use reward arrangements 
to drive performance by employees which supports the creation of value for shareholders.
Cessation of employment and other circumstances: The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which define how individual awards should  
be treated upon termination of an Executive Director’s employment (see Principles of payment for loss of office for Executive Directors section on  
page 126). Provision is also made for the treatment of awards in respect of corporate activity including rights issues, sale of a business outside the  
Group and a change of control. The treatment of awards in these circumstances is also subject to Remuneration Committee discretion. In the event  
of a change of control an award will vest pro rata to the time elapsed between the date of grant of the award and the date of the event to the extent  
that the performance measures have been met up to the date of the event, subject to the Remuneration Committee’s discretion to make an  
alternative determination. 
Other employees: Other employees at mid to senior levels globally are eligible for LTI awards in the form of PSP and/or Restricted Stock Units. 
The occupants of approximately 700 senior roles in the Company are currently eligible for PSP awards – these are the leaders who have the ability 
directly to influence the delivery of the Company’s strategic goals. Awards under the AZIP are currently granted to SET members only (including the 
Executive Directors).

Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors continued
AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The PSP is an LTI plan 
designed to align the 
variable pay of our 
Executive Directors 
directly to the delivery 
of our medium-term 
business strategy. 
The PSP provides for the grant of awards over Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
Vesting is dependent on the achievement of stretching three-year performance targets 
and continued employment. 
Performance measures and targets under the PSP are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at the start of the relevant three-year performance period and consist of a range 
of measures designed to incentivise performance in furtherance of the Company’s business 
strategy. The performance measures (currently a combination of four measures: TSR; 
cumulative cash flow; sales of medicines in key therapy areas and territories; and innovation 
metrics) are closely aligned to business strategy, and reward commercial, scientific and 
financial success.
Currently each of the four measures has an equal weighting. When setting the performance 
measures at the start of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee will allocate 
weightings to those measures as it considers appropriate, taking into account strategic and 
business priorities.
The three-year performance period commences on 1 January in the year of the award. 
The vesting date is the third anniversary of the date on which the award is granted. A 
two-year holding period commencing three years from the date of grant for Executive 
Directors will be included in the new PSP rules which are being put to shareholders for 
approval at the AGM in 2014 and, if approved, will be effective for awards made after the 
AGM. These awards will vest at the end of the holding period. During the holding period, 
no further performance measures will apply as performance has already been assessed.
All the performance measures have a payout curve. The payout curves are structured in 
different ways depending on the overall objective they are intended to measure. Typically, 
performance measures are structured such that 25% of the award will vest for threshold 
level of performance. The relationship between threshold, target and out-performance will 
be determined by the Remuneration Committee at each grant of the PSP and is dependent 
on whether the performance measure is science, commercial or finance based. An award 
will typically vest at 100% if the target (usually set at upper quartile performance) is achieved 
and threshold level of performance associated with any metric will be at or above a median 
level. There will be other vesting points between the threshold and maximum of 100% 
vesting, typically on a straight-line basis where the performance measures permit. 
The Remuneration Committee may (acting fairly and reasonably) adjust or waive a 
performance target if an event occurs that causes it to believe that the performance target 
is no longer appropriate.
Payouts can range from 0% to 100% of the original award.
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends accrued during the vesting period 
will be paid.
Subject to shareholder approval of the renewal of the PSP at the 2014 AGM, for awards 
granted under the PSP after the AGM and in subsequent years, the Remuneration 
Committee will have discretion: 
 > to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested award in certain circumstances (malus), 
including (i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational 
damage to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual 
 > for up to six years from the third anniversary of the date of grant, to claw back from 
individuals some or all of the award in certain circumstances, including (i) material 
restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the  
Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual. However, in the case of (i) and 
(ii) the Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years 
from the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
Under the PSP plan rules, the maximum 
market value of shares that may be awarded 
at the date of grant in respect of any year is 
500% of a participant’s annual base salary. 
If each aspect of all of the performance 
measures is met and exceeded, the 
Remuneration Committee currently has the 
discretion to pay out a maximum of 125% 
of the value of the original award. However, 
the Remuneration Committee has determined 
that it will not exercise this discretion in relation 
to outstanding or future awards. 
This feature has therefore been removed from 
the new PSP rules which are being put to 
shareholders for approval at the AGM in 2014.
120 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 AstraZeneca Investment Plan (AZIP)
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and framework used to assess performance Maximum opportunity
The combined eight-year 
performance and holding 
periods of the AZIP are 
influenced by the Group’s 
medicine development 
cycle, reflecting the long- 
term investment horizons 
that are a feature of the 
pharmaceutical industry. 
The AZIP provides for the grant of awards over Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
Vesting is dependent on achievement of two performance measures over a four-year 
performance period. The award is then subject to a further four-year holding period. 
Payout of the award is subject to continued employment. 
Performance measures and targets under the AZIP are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee at the start of the relevant four-year performance period.
Currently, two performance measures apply: dividend level and dividend cover. 
Both measures must be achieved for the award to vest. 
If an event occurs which causes the Remuneration Committee (acting fairly and 
reasonably) to consider that a performance measure is no longer appropriate it 
may adjust that measure.
The AZIP is operated over a four-year performance period, with a subsequent four-year 
holding period. Performance periods commence on 1 January in the year of the award. 
Holding periods run for a period of four years starting from the end of the performance 
period, and end on the eighth anniversary of the start of the performance period. During 
the holding period, no further performance measures apply as performance has already 
been assessed. 
If both measures are achieved in each year of the performance period, the award will vest 
in full at the end of the holding period. If either or both of the measures are not achieved, 
the award will lapse.
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends paid during the performance and holding 
periods will be paid.
For awards granted under the AZIP prior to the AGM in 2014, the Company may reduce or 
cancel some or all of the shares that are the subject of a participant’s award at any time 
during the performance or the holding period if, in the opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee (acting fairly and reasonably), this is warranted by the underlying performance of 
the Company, the occurrence of an event that causes, or is very likely to cause, reputational 
damage to the Company, or serious misconduct by the participant.
In order to ensure consistency between our LTI plans, for awards granted under the  
AZIP on or after the AGM and in subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee will  
have discretion: 
 > to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested award in certain circumstances (malus), 
including (i) material restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational 
damage to the Group, or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual
 > for up to six years from the end of the performance period, to claw back from individuals 
some or all of the award in certain circumstances, including (i) in the case of material 
restatement of the results of the Group, (ii) significant reputational damage to the Group,  
or (iii) serious misconduct by the individual. However, in the case of (i) and (ii) the 
Remuneration Committee may only exercise its discretion for up to two years from the  
end of the performance period.
Under the AZIP plan rules the maximum 
market value of shares that may be awarded 
at the date of grant in respect of any year is 
500% of a participant’s annual base salary.

Corporate Governance > Directors’ Remuneration Report
Restricted shares
In certain circumstances, as part of the recruitment arrangements, an Executive Director may be awarded restricted shares. There are no performance 
measures attached to awards of restricted shares because typically they will be awarded for the purpose of compensating newly recruited Executive 
Directors for loss of entitlements on leaving a previous employment. However, the Remuneration Committee will consider whether the lost incentives 
were subject to performance measures and their likely vesting. If foregone awards were subject to performance testing, then the compensatory 
AstraZeneca award will normally be granted under the PSP and/or AZIP in order to align the performance conditions attaching to the award to the 
delivery of the Company’s strategy. Restricted share awards will generally be used only when the foregone compensation was not subject to 
performance testing.
The Remuneration Committee may divide an award of restricted shares into tranches vesting at different points and may apply performance measures 
bespoke to the individual if it considers it appropriate. If it decides to attach performance conditions, the performance conditions and period will be 
defined at grant.
In most instances, there are no performance conditions attached to these awards. They will therefore vest in full if the individual remains in office  
on the vesting date. 
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to dividends accrued during the vesting period will be paid.
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of awards of restricted shares.
Restricted shares may be used for the same purpose on the recruitment of other employees. 
AstraZeneca also operates another restricted share plan (the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan) to provide LTI awards to eligible employees 
globally. Currently Executive Directors and other senior executives are not eligible to participate in this plan.

When granting LTI awards the Remuneration Committee applies a target as a percentage of base salary on an expected value basis.  
For the AZIP , the expected value on vesting is 100% of the value of the award at grant, and for the PSP , the expected value on vesting  
is 50% of the award at grant.
When granting LTI awards for the CEO, we typically apply a target expected value of 250% of base salary weighted 25% in favour  
of the AZIP (ie 62.5% of base salary) which provides for an award at face value of 62.5% of base salary, and 75% in favour of the PSP  
(ie 187 .5% of base salary) which provides for an award at face value of 375% of base salary. Accordingly, the combination of the AZIP and 
PSP awards for the CEO at an expected value of 250% provides a maximum number of shares under the awards with a face value of 
437 .5% of base salary. For 2015, the Remuneration Committee awarded an above-target LTI award of 285%, which provides for an award 
at face value of 498.75% which is taken into account in the figures provided in the Out performance row of the chart above.
When granting LTI awards for the CFO, we apply a target expected value of 200% of base salary, weighted 25% in favour of the AZIP  
(ie 50% of base salary) which provides for an award at face value of 50% of base salary, and 75% in favour of the PSP (ie 150% of base 
salary) which provides for an award at face value of 300% of base salary. Accordingly, the combination of the AZIP and PSP awards for the 
CFO at an expected value of 200% provides a maximum number of shares under the awards with a face value of 350% of base salary.  
For 2015, the Remuneration Committee awarded an above-target LTI award of 210%, which provides for an award at face value of 
367 .5% which is taken into account in the figures provided in the Out performance row of the table on the chart above.

Approach to recruitment remuneration for Executive Directors
The Company seeks to pay no more than necessary to recruit the best candidate available for a role as an Executive Director. On the 
recruitment of a new Executive Director, the Company seeks to put in place a remuneration package which is broadly in line with the 
remuneration package applicable to relevant incumbent Executive Directors. However, in order to offer a competitive package to the most 
capable candidate, the Company may consider providing remuneration arrangements that exceed those of existing Executive Directors. 
The Remuneration Committee may also agree to pay allowances to expatriates in line with the Company’s international assignment policy 
which provides for support towards housing, schooling and other relocation or assignment related costs. 
The remuneration package offered to new recruits may include any element listed in the policy table above, or any other element which 
the Remuneration Committee considers is appropriate given the particular circumstances, with due respect to the interests of the 
Company’s shareholders. 
Operating guidelines: The Remuneration Committee is aware that the pharmaceutical industry is global and that future 
Executive Directors might come from organisations with very different pay structures and practices. The Remuneration 
Committee believes that it is in the interests of shareholders to retain an element of flexibility in the recruitment policy  
to enable it to recruit the best candidates. However, this flexibility is limited. As described below, our intention is to use 
buy-out awards on recruitment only to compensate a new recruit for awards which are forfeited at the previous employer. 
All other aspects of the compensation opportunity of a new recruit will be subject to the maxima contained in the Policy. 
In considering which elements to include, and in determining the approach for all relevant elements, the Remuneration Committee will take 
into account a number of different factors, including typical market practice, existing arrangements for the other Executive Directors and 
internal relativities and market positioning. 
The Company may reimburse the costs of financial planning and tax advice to Executive Directors. The Company also provides  
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the Company’s Articles  
to all Executive Directors.
The Company may find it necessary to compensate a new recruit for forfeiture of entitlements from a previous employer. The value of such 
compensation cannot be anticipated and will depend upon a range of factors including the circumstances of the individual in question.  
In such circumstances, the Company will seek to offer a package weighted towards equity in the Company. However, the precise nature  
of the compensation package will depend on the type of entitlement that the recruit is foregoing and which the Company will generally seek 
to compensate in kind; the buyout might therefore comprise cash and/or restricted shares and/or LTI. The Remuneration Committee will 
obtain and take into account independent valuations of the entitlements to determine the appropriate level of compensation.
Shares which could be offered to the new recruit would be granted under LTI plans available at the time or under a plan specific to that 
individual as permitted under the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules. Performance measures may apply to such share awards. 
The Company’s policy seeks to link the performance of the Executive Director to the performance of the Company in any given period. 
The precise targets and measures will depend on the objectives of the Company and the individual at that time and will be determined 
by the Remuneration Committee. 
The Company will not offer cash or shares to newly recruited Executive Directors as a bonus, or ‘golden hello’ on joining other than 
to compensate for the loss of a previous remuneration opportunity. Where compensation is offered to a new recruit on his or her hire, 
the Company will explain the reasons for this to shareholders in a timely manner, and will provide details of the payments.
Operating guidelines: The Remuneration Committee will not grant cash or share awards as a ‘golden hello’. As described 
above, cash or share awards granted on joining the Company will be to compensate a new recruit for loss of previous 
remuneration awards only.
Ongoing annual variable remuneration will not exceed an award which comprises up to 250% of base salary under the annual bonus, and 
up to 500% of base salary under the PSP and up to 500% of base salary under the AZIP . If the Remuneration Committee ever felt that it 
would be in the interests of shareholders to grant annual variable awards to a new Executive Director with values exceeding the historical 
range of 0 – 680% of base salary (comprising up to 180% under the annual bonus and up to 500% in aggregate under the LTI plans),  
it would consult major shareholders in advance.
The Company intends to honour all remuneration arrangements previously entered into in the case of Group employees who are promoted 
to the position of an Executive Director. 
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors continued
124 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Service contracts for Executive Directors
Save as noted below, it is not intended that service contracts for new Executive Directors will contain terms that are materially different  
from those summarised below or contained in the Policy set out in this Remuneration Policy Report. The contractual obligations below  
are applicable to each of the current Executive Directors unless stated otherwise, and to the Executive Directors only.
Notice period The Company may terminate the employment of an Executive Director by giving not less than 12 months’ written 
notice. The Company may agree, on the appointment of a new Executive Director, that any notice given by the 
Company will not expire prior to the second anniversary of the commencement date of the Executive Director’s 
appointment. The Company agreed to such a provision in the case of Mr Dunoyer. 
An Executive Director may terminate his employment on 12 months’ written notice.
Payment in 
lieu of notice
The Company may terminate an Executive Director’s contract at any time with immediate effect and pay him  
a sum in lieu of notice. This sum will consist of (i) the base salary that the relevant Executive Director would  
have been entitled to receive during the notice period and (ii) the cost to the Company of funding the Executive 
Director’s flexible benefit arrangements for this period, including the Company’s contribution in respect of pension. 
The payment in lieu of notice may be paid as a lump sum or the Company may decide to pay the first six months 
of the payment in lieu in equal monthly instalments, with the balance paid within 30 days of the final instalment 
being paid. 
Garden leave If an Executive Director has given or been given notice of termination, the Company has the right to place the 
Executive Director on ‘garden leave’. 
Summary 
termination
The Company may terminate an Executive Director’s employment summarily, in particular defined circumstances 
such as gross misconduct, with no further payment.
Payments in 
lieu of holiday
If, on termination, the relevant Executive Director has exceeded his accrued holiday entitlement, the value of this 
excess may be deducted by the Company from any sums payable. If the Executive Director has unused holiday 
entitlement, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to require the Executive Director to take such unused 
holiday during any notice period, or make a payment in lieu of it calculated in the same way as the value of any 
excess holiday.
Directors’ and 
Officers’ Liability 
Insurance
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance and an indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the law and the 
Company’s Articles is provided to the Executive Directors for the duration of their employment and for a minimum 
of five years following termination.
Deemed 
treatment 
under AZIP 
and restricted 
share award
In respect of awards made to compensate Mr Soriot for loss of remuneration opportunity at his previous  
employer, if Mr Soriot gives notice of termination of his employment after the end of the performance period under 
the AZIP but before the end of the holding period, the award under the AZIP will vest on the earlier of the end of 
the holding period and the end of the period of 24 months from the date of cessation of employment, unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines otherwise. If Mr Soriot’s employment is terminated by the Company (other 
than in the event of prescribed misconduct events), his restricted share award will continue to subsist.

Corporate Governance Corporate Governance > Directors’ Remuneration Report
Principles of payment for loss of office for Executive Directors
The Company does not make additional payments for loss of office, other than, as appropriate, payments in lieu of notice as described 
above or payments in respect of damages if the Company terminates an Executive Director’s service contract in breach of contract  
(taking into account, as appropriate, the Director’s ability to mitigate his loss). The Remuneration Committee has discretion to award 
payments in certain circumstances, as set out below, depending on the nature of the termination and the Executive Director’s performance. 
The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which define how individual awards under those plans should be treated upon termination of 
employment. Provision is also made for the treatment of awards in respect of corporate activity including sale of a business outside the 
Group. The treatment of awards in these circumstances may also be subject to Remuneration Committee discretion. Generally, awards 
under LTI plans will only be allowed to vest for those Executive Directors who leave the Company by mutual agreement, for example in 
circumstances of ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or where employment terminates by reason of the Executive 
Director’s death (see the table opposite for further information). In addition to any payment in lieu of notice, the individual components of 
remuneration and other payments which may be payable on loss of office are set out below, subject to the terms of any applicable bonus 
rules or share incentive plan rules:
>  Annual bonus  
An Executive Director may receive a bonus for the performance year in which he leaves the Company. Typically this sum will reflect  
an on-target bonus pro-rated for the part of the year in which he worked. This is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and  
will depend on the circumstances, including an assessment of the Executive Director’s performance in the relevant period and the 
circumstances of his departure. The deferred share element of previous bonuses granted, and any deferred share element of the bonus 
awarded in respect of the departing year, may still vest for the benefit of the departing Executive Director at the end of the period of 
deferral despite the fact that the Executive Director did not work for the entirety of this period. The Remuneration Committee has the 
discretion to accelerate and/or retain the deferral period and allow shares to vest for the benefit of the Executive Director on his departure 
and/or in accordance with the vesting schedule as the case may be. The Remuneration Committee will decide whether it is appropriate  
in the circumstances for these shares to vest for the benefit of the departing Executive Director. 
>  LTI plans 
The rules of the LTI plans envisage circumstances under which some, all or none of an Executive Director’s shares held under LTI plans 
will vest in connection with his departure. The exact timing and number of shares vesting will depend on the circumstances, including  
the Executive Director’s reason for leaving (as set out in the table opposite) and may be subject to Remuneration Committee discretion, 
depending on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 
>  Restricted share awards and awards under the RSP 
The treatment on termination will depend upon the terms of the individual Executive Director’s awards on recruitment. The Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to determine the treatment at the time of departure based on what it considers to be fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances.
>  Non-statutory redundancy payment 
Executive Directors are not entitled to non-statutory redundancy payments.
>  Pension contributions and other benefits 
Pension contributions and other benefits for Executive Directors will be payable up to the termination date or as part of a payment in lieu 
of notice as described on page 125.
>  Payments in relation to statutory rights 
The amount considered reasonable to pay by the Remuneration Committee in respect of statutory rights may be included in the overall 
termination payment.
>  Payments required by law 
The Company may pay damages, awards, fines or other compensation awarded to or in respect of an Executive Director by any 
competent court or tribunal or other payments required to be made on termination of employment by any applicable law, regulator 
or collective labour agreement.
>  M i ti g a ti o n 
The departing Executive Director will be required to mitigate his loss by using reasonable efforts to secure new employment.
>  Professional fees 
The Company may pay an amount considered reasonable by the Remuneration Committee in respect of fees for legal and tax advice, 
and outplacement support for the departing Executive Director.

Committee terminates an Executive Director’s employment (other than for gross 
misconduct) during the holding period, the awards will vest on the same basis.
In each case described above, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to vest the 
award or part of the award on a different basis.

his employment ceases, pro-rated to take into account the period elapsed between the date 
of grant and the date of cessation of employment, unless the Remuneration Committee 
decides not to pro-rate or to pro-rate on some other basis.

Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, receive annual Board fees. Additional fees are also payable for membership and 
chairmanship of a Board Committee. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for performance-related bonuses or the grant of share 
awards or options. No pension contributions are made on their behalf. The annual Board fees applicable to Non-Executive Directors during 
2013 are set out below. Fees applicable in future years will be set out in the corresponding year’s Implementation Report. The remuneration 
of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined  
by the other members of the Remuneration Committee and the Senior independent Non-Executive Director. 
No Director is involved in any decision relating to his or her own remuneration.
Annual Board and Committee fees
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
The annual fees are 
intended to be sufficient 
(but no more than 
necessary) to attract, 
retain and develop 
high-calibre individuals.
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, receive annual Board fees and additional fees 
for membership and chairmanship of a Board Committee. 
The individual fees paid to a Non-Executive Director are subject to periodic review and may be 
increased in the future to ensure that they remain sufficient to attract high-calibre individuals while 
remaining fair and proportionate. While Non-Executive Directors currently receive their fees in 
cash, the Company reserves the right to award part, or all, of their fees in shares.
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of fees.

of financial planning and tax advice.
The maximum amount payable in 
respect of these costs and cost of 
insurance will be the reimbursement 
of the Directors’ benefits grossed up 
for any tax payable by the individual. 
Other costs and expenses
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Intended to reimburse 
individuals for legitimately 
incurred costs and

In addition to the Chairman’s fee, a proportion of the office costs of the Chairman are reimbursed. 
In 2013, this amounted to £40,000. The amount of office costs to be reimbursed each year will  
be determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, based on an assessment of the 
reasonable requirements of the Chairman. The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to 
approve contributions by the Company to office costs of other Non-Executive Directors in 
circumstances where such payments are deemed proportionate and reasonable.
The Company will pay for all travel (including travel to the Company’s offices), hotel and other 
expenses reasonably incurred by Non-Executive Directors in the course of the Company’s 
business, for example, professional fees such as secretarial support, and reimbursement for 
domestic security arrangements such as lights and alarms following a security assessment.
There are no contractual provisions for clawback or malus of other costs and expenses.
The maximum amounts payable in 
respect of these costs and expenses 
will be the reimbursement of the 
Directors’ costs and expenses 
grossed up for any tax payable 
by the individual.
Letters of appointment
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a service contract but all have letters of appointment. In accordance with the Articles, following 
their appointment, all Directors must retire at each AGM and may present themselves for election or re-election. The Company is mindful  
of the independence provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and, in this regard, it is anticipated that Non-Executive Directors’ 
overall tenure will not normally exceed nine years. The Chairman may terminate his appointment at any time, with three months’ notice. 
None of the Non-Executive Directors has a notice period or any provision in his or her letter of appointment giving him, or her, a right to 
compensation payable upon early termination of appointment.

The Directors assessed the effectiveness  
of AstraZeneca’s internal control over  
financial reporting as at 31 December  
2014 based on the criteria set forth by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  
of the Treadway Commission in Internal 
Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based 
on this assessment, the Directors believe 
that, as at 31 December 2014, the internal 
control over financial reporting is effective 
based on those criteria.
KPMG LLP, an independent registered

explained on page 130, has issued an 
unqualified report thereon.
The Directors are responsible for establishing 
and maintaining adequate internal control

Opinions and conclusions arising 
from our audit
1. Our opinion on the Group financial 
statements is unmodified
We have audited the Group Financial 
Statements of AstraZeneca PLC for the  
year ended 31 December 2014 set out on 
pages 134 to 189. In our opinion the Group 
Financial Statements: 
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 
and of its profit for the year then ended; 
 > have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union (EU); and
 > have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as 
issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB)
As explained in the Group accounting policies 
section of the Group Financial Statements set 
out on pages 138 to 142, the Group, in 
addition to complying with its legal obligation 
to apply IFRSs as adopted by the EU, has 
also applied IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
In our opinion, the Group Financial 
Statements comply with IFRSs as issued  
by the IASB.

3. Our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
We summarise below the risks of material 
misstatement that had the greatest effect  
on our audit, our key audit procedures 
to address those risks and our findings  
from those procedures in order that the 
Company’s members as a body may better 
understand the process by which we arrived 
at our audit opinion. Our findings are the 
result of procedures undertaken in the 
context of and solely for the purpose of our 
statutory audit opinion on the Group Financial 
Statements as a whole and consequently  
are incidental to that opinion, and we do  
not express discrete opinions on separate 
elements of the Group Financial Statements. 
Revenue recognition ($26,095m)
Refer to page 98 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 138 (accounting policy), pages 143 and 
149 (financial disclosures) and page 82 
(financial risk management)
The risk
Revenue recognition is one of the key 
judgmental areas for our audit, particularly  
in respect of estimates made for rebates, 
chargebacks and returns under contractual 
and regulatory requirements in the United 
States of America (‘US’) which are deducted  
in arriving at revenue.
Our response
Our principal audit procedures included: 
testing the Group’s controls surrounding 
revenue recognition and key manual and 
systems-based controls in the order-to-cash 
transaction cycle. This included 
reconciliations between sales systems 
and the general ledger; assessing whether 
appropriate revenue recognition policies are 
applied through comparison with accounting 
standards; and performing testing over 
revenue at significant components, which 
included analysis of product sales year on 
year, corroborating movements compared 
with expectations and inspection of contracts 
with customers. Our audit work in respect of 
the accrual for US rebates, chargebacks and 
returns involved testing key controls including 
the Group’s review of claims, credits and 
system accrual rates. We also assessed 
the accuracy of the accrual calculation, 
corroborated inputs and key assumptions, 
both to internal and independent sources, 
and considered the historical accuracy of the 
accrual. In addition, due to the reduced 
profitability of the Group, we scoped in an 
additional component, MedImmune, LLC, 
for the first time, for the latter procedures. 
We also assessed the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures of its revenue recognition 
policy, the judgment involved and other 
related disclosures.
KPMG LLP has also reported separately  
on the Company Financial Statements of 
AstraZeneca PLC and on the information 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is 
described as having been audited. This audit 
report is set out on page 190.
The report set out below is provided in 
compliance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). KPMG LLP has 
also issued reports in accordance with

Our findings
In determining the appropriate revenue 
recognition policy to be applied in calculating 
rebates, chargebacks and returns under 
contractual and regulatory requirements, 
there is room for judgment and we found  
that within that, the Group’s judgment  
was balanced. We found the assumptions 
used and the resulting estimates to be 
balanced, other than our findings in relation  
to the opening position at MedImmune.  
We also found no errors in the year-end 
rebate accruals. 
We have reported an audit difference 
in respect of the rebate calculation 
methodology and assumptions at the start  
of the year at MedImmune, for its principal 
product, which led to an opening over-
accrual of liability of $40m. This has been 
adjusted and consequently included in 
revenue this year. We also consequently 
increased the scope and depth of our audit 
procedures at MedImmune from that 
originally planned. 
We found the disclosures on revenue 
recognition to be extensive. 
Carrying value of intangible assets 
($20,981m)
Refer to page 98 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 141 (accounting policy), page 153  
(financial disclosures) and page 84 (financial 
risk management)
The risk
The Group has significant intangible  
assets arising from the acquisition of  
products both launched and in development. 
Recoverability of these assets is based on 
forecasting and discounting future cash 
flows, which are inherently highly judgmental. 
For products in development the main risk  
is achieving successful trial results and 
obtaining required regulatory approvals. For 
launched products, the key risk is the ability 
to successfully commercialise the individual 
product concerned. 
Our response
In this area our principal audit procedures 
included testing the Group’s controls 
surrounding intangible asset impairments  
and evaluating the Group’s assumptions  
used in assessing the recoverability of 
intangible assets, in particular, revenue 
and cash flow projections, useful economic 
lives and discount rates. We also performed 
sensitivity analysis over individual intangible 
asset models, where there was a higher  
risk of impairment, to assess the level of 
sensitivity to key assumptions and focus  
our work in those areas. For products in 
development, a key assumption is the 
probability of obtaining the necessary clinical 
and regulatory approvals. Our procedures for 
products in development included critically 
assessing the reasonableness of the Group’s 
assumptions through consideration of trial 
readouts, regulatory announcements and the 
Group’s internal governance and approval 
process. We also interviewed a range of key 
Research, Development and Commercial 
personnel and compared the assumptions  
with industry practice where available. For 
launched products we challenged key 
assumptions including the size of the 
therapeutic area market, the product’s 
projected share of this and expected pricing 
and associated costs. Our procedures also 
included holding discussions with relevant 
management personnel and challenging 
management’s statements by reviewing 
analyst commentaries, consensus forecasts 
and retrospective assessment of the accuracy 
of the Group’s projections. We also assessed 
the adequacy of related disclosures in the 
Group’s financial statements.
Our findings
We found the Group’s assumptions and  
the resulting estimates to be balanced.  
We found that the disclosures proportionately 
describe the inherent degree of subjectivity  
in the estimates and the potential impact on 
future periods of revisions to these estimates.
Litigation and contingent liabilities 
(provisions of $74m)
Refer to page 98 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 141 (accounting policy), page 182  
(financial disclosures) and page 84 (financial 
risk management)
The risk
In the normal course of business, litigation 
and contingent liabilities may arise from 
product-specific and general legal 
proceedings, from guarantees, government 
investigations or from environmental liabilities 
connected with the Group’s current or  
former sites. The amounts involved are 
potentially material and the application of 
accounting standards to determine the 
amount, if any, to be provided as a liability,  
is inherently subjective.
Our response
Having made enquires of the Directors to 
obtain their view on the status of significant 
legal matters, our principal audit procedures 
included: testing the Group’s controls 
surrounding litigation and contingent 
liabilities, assessment of correspondence 
with the Group’s external counsel on all 
significant legal cases and discussions 
with external counsel where necessary. 
In addition we obtained formal confirmations 
from the Group’s external counsel for all 
significant litigation, used our own forensic 
and compliance specialists to assess the 
Group’s compliance logs and reports to 
identify actual and potential non-compliance 
with laws and regulations, both those specific 
to the Group’s business and those relating  
to the conduct of business generally. We then 
analysed correspondence with regulators, 
reviewed legal expenses incurred during the 
year, monitored external sources and 
considered management’s assessment of  
the probability of defending any litigation  
and the reliability of estimating any obligation. 
We also assessed whether the Group’s 
disclosures detailing significant legal 
proceedings adequately disclose the  
potential liabilities of the Group.
Our findings
Whilst the outcome of these litigation matters 
is inherently uncertain in each case, we found 
that the Group applied balanced judgments, 
on a case by case basis, in assessing 
whether or not a provision should be 
recognised. We found that the assumptions 
used and the resulting liability recorded to be 
balanced. We found that the Group gives 
extensive disclosure on the potential liability  
in excess of that recognised in the Financial 
Statements and the significant but 
unquantifiable contingent liability in respect  
of these litigation matters.
Tax provisioning ($2,275m)
Refer to page 99 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 139 (accounting policy), page 187  
(financial disclosures) and page 85 (financial 
risk management)
The risk
Due to the Group operating in a number of 
different tax jurisdictions and the complexities 
of transfer pricing and other international tax 
legislation, accruals for tax contingencies 
require the Directors to make judgments  
and estimates in relation to tax issues 
and exposures.
Our response
In this area our principal audit procedures 
included: testing the Group’s controls 
surrounding tax provisioning and assessment 
of correspondence with the relevant tax 
authorities and the use of our own local  
and international tax specialists to analyse 
and challenge the assumptions used by 
management to determine tax provisions, 
based on our knowledge and experiences of 
the application of the relevant legislation by 
authorities and courts. We also assessed the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of tax and uncertain tax positions.
Our findings
We found the Group’s estimate of the 
amounts to be recognised as tax liabilities  
to be conservative and that the disclosures 
provide a proportionate description of the 
current status of uncertain tax positions.

Post‑ retirement benefits ($2,951m)
Refer to page 99 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 139 (accounting policy), page 162  
(financial disclosures) and page 85 (financial 
risk management).
The risk
Significant estimates are made in valuing  
the Group’s post-retirement defined benefit 
plans. Small changes in assumptions and 
estimates used to value the Group’s net 
pension deficit could have a significant  
effect on the results and financial position  
of the Group. 
Our response
Our principal audit procedures included  
the testing of the Group’s controls 
surrounding the post-retirement defined 
benefit plans valuations and the challenge  
of key assumptions, being the discount  
rate, inflation rate and mortality/life 
expectancy, which are included in the 
valuation calculations of the Group’s 
retirement benefit obligations in countries 
with significant defined benefit pension  
plans, with the support of our own actuarial 
specialists. This involved a comparison of 
these key assumptions used against our  
own internal benchmarks and externally 
derived data. We obtained and assessed 
third party assurance reports on controls  
over the valuation of pension assets held  
by key custodians and compared asset 
values to third party confirmations. 
Additionally, we assessed the adequacy 
of the Group’s disclosures in respect of 
post-retirement benefits.
Our findings
Overall, we found the key assumptions  
used in, and the resulting estimate of, the 
valuation of retirement benefit obligations 
within the Group to be balanced. The third 
party assurance reports did not identify 
significant deviations in the operation of 
controls over the valuation of assets which 
caused us to change the scope or extent  
of our procedures and we found no errors  
in our comparison of asset values to  
third party confirmations. We found the 
disclosures in respect of post-retirement 
benefits to be proportionate. 
Overall findings
In reaching our audit opinion on the Group 
Financial Statements we took into account 
the findings that we describe above and 
those for other, lower risk areas. Overall 
the findings from across the whole audit  
are that, although the estimates used in 
the Group Financial Statements are mainly 
balanced, there is one conservative estimate, 
as well as the audit difference identified 
above. However, compared with materiality 
and considering the qualitative aspects  
of the Group Financial Statements as a 
whole, our opinion on the Group Financial 
Statements is unmodified. 
4. Our application of materiality and 
an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group Financial 
Statements as a whole was set at $94m, 
determined with reference to a benchmark  
of Group profit before taxation, normalised  
to exclude this year’s intangible asset 
impairments and fair value movement on 
contingent consideration as disclosed in 
Notes 9 and 18, of which it represents 5.0%.
We report to the Audit Committee any 
corrected or uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding $4.7m (0.25% of 
normalised Group profit before taxation), in 
addition to other identified misstatements that 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group operates a significant number  
of trading entities, each of which is 
determined to be a reporting component, 
located in 82 countries around the globe.  
The Operating Segment disclosures in  
Note 6 set out the individual significance  
of each geographical region. 
We performed audits for group reporting 
purposes at 8 components and specified 
risk-focused audit procedures at one 
standalone component as well as at 36 
components serviced by the Group’s shared 
service centres. The latter 37 components 
were not individually financially significant 
enough to require an audit for group reporting 
purposes, but were included in the scope of 
our audit in order to provide further coverage 
over relevant account balances. 
The Group operates four principal shared 
service centres (both in-house and 
outsourced) in the UK, Malaysia, Romania 
and India, which process a substantial 
proportion of the Group’s transactions. 
The outputs from the shared service centres 
are included in the financial information of  
the reporting components they service and 
therefore they are not separate reporting 
components. Each of the service centres

6. We have nothing to report in respect 
of the matters on which we are required to 
report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required 
to report to you if, based on the knowledge 
we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in this Annual 
Report that contains a material inconsistency 
with either that knowledge or the Financial 
Statements, a material misstatement of fact, 
or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to  
you if: 
 > we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired 
during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 
taken as a whole are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or
 > the Audit Committee Report does 
not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 > certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or 
 > we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review: 
 > the Directors’ statement, set out on page 
138, in relation to going concern; and
 > the part of the Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 86 to 95 relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the ten 
provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
above responsibilities.
7. Other matter – we have reported 
separately on the Parent Company 
Financial Statements
We have reported separately on the 
Parent Company Financial Statements 
of AstraZeneca PLC for the year ended 
31 December 2014 and on the information  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that  
is described as having been audited.
is subject to specified risk-focused audit 
procedures, predominantly the testing of 
transaction processing and review controls. 
Additional procedures are performed by 
component audit teams at certain reporting 
components to address the audit risks not 
covered by the work performed over the 
shared service centres. These procedures 
are designed to address the risk of material 
misstatement identified through our group 
risk assessment processes. 
This resulted in the coverage shown in 
the neighbouring charts. For the remaining 
components, we performed analysis at the 
Group level to re-examine our assessment 
that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within them. 
The Group audit team instructed component 
and shared service centre auditors as to the 
significant areas to be covered, including  
the relevant risks detailed above and the 
information to be reported back. The Group 
audit team approved the component 
materiality levels, which ranged from $6m  
to $90m, having regard to the mix of size  
and risk profile of the Group across the 
components as well as considering the risk 
when aggregating misstatements that may 
exceed group materiality. 
The work on all components in scope of our 
work, other than on the parent company, was 
performed by component and shared service 
centre auditors. The audit of the Parent 
Company and consolidation was performed 
by the Group audit team.
The Group audit team visited four component 
locations, during the year, in the UK, US, 
France and Russia to discuss and challenge 
key risks and audit strategy. Video or 
telephone conference meetings were also 
held with all group reporting component 
auditors throughout the audit and the majority 
of the other component and shared service 
centre auditors that were not physically 
visited. At these visits and meetings, the audit 
approach, findings and observations reported 
to the Group audit team were discussed in 
more detail, and any further work required  
by the Group audit team was then performed 
by the component auditor.
5. Our opinion on the other matter 
prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
is unmodified
In our opinion the information given in the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report  
for the financial year for which the Financial 
Statements are prepared is consistent with 
the Group Financial Statements. 
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on 
page 129, the Directors are responsible for  
the preparation of the Financial Statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. A description of the scope  
of an audit of financial statements is provided 
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.  
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members as a body and is subject to 
important explanations and disclaimers 
regarding our responsibilities, published 
on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/
auditscopeukco2014b, which are 
incorporated into this report as if set out  
in full and should be read to provide an 
understanding of the purpose of this report, 
the work we have undertaken and the  
basis of our opinions.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
for the year ended 31 December
Financial Statements AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 138
The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in the Financial Review from 
page 70. In addition, Note 25 to the Financial 
Statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its 
capital, its financial risk management 
objectives, details of its financial instruments 
and hedging activities and its exposures to 
credit, market and liquidity risk. Further details 
of the Group’s cash balances and borrowings 
are included in Notes 16 and 17 to the 
Financial Statements.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources available. As at 31 December 
2014, the Group has $7.0bn in financial 
resources (cash balances of $6.4bn and 
undrawn committed bank facilities of $3.0bn 
that are available until April 2019, with only 
$2.4bn of debt due within one year). The 
Group’s revenues are largely derived from 
sales of products which are covered by 
patents which provide a relatively high level  
of resilience and predictability to cash inflows, 
although our revenue is expected to continue 
to be significantly impacted by the expiry of 
patents over the medium term. In addition, 
government price interventions in response  
to budgetary constraints are expected to 
continue to adversely affect revenues in many 
of our mature markets. However, we anticipate 
new revenue streams from both recently 
launched medicines and products in 
development, and the Group has a wide 
diversity of customers and suppliers across 
different geographic areas. Consequently,  
the Directors believe that, overall, the Group 
is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the Directors have  
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements.
Estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Financial Statements  
in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management 
to make estimates and judgements that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the Financial Statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.
Judgements include matters such as the 
determination of operating segments while 
estimates focus on areas such as carrying 
values, estimated useful lives, potential 
obligations and contingent consideration.
AstraZeneca’s management considers 
the following to be the most important 
accounting policies in the context of the 
Group’s operations.
The accounting policy descriptions set out 
the areas where judgements and estimates 
need exercising, the most significant of  
which are revenue recognition, research and 
development (including impairment reviews  
of associated intangible assets), business 
combinations and goodwill, litigation and 
environmental liabilities, employee benefits 
and taxation.
Further information on estimates and critical 
judgements made in applying accounting 
policies, including details of significant 
methods and assumptions used, is detailed 
in the Financial Review from page 70 and is 
included in Notes 4, 6, 8, 9, 20, 24 and 27  
to the Financial Statements. Financial risk 
management policies are detailed in Note 25.
Revenue
Revenues comprise sales and income under 
co-promotion and co-development 
agreements.
Income under co-promotion and co-
development agreements is recognised when 
it is earned as defined in the contract and can 
be reliably estimated. In general, this is upon 
the sale of the co-promoted/co-developed 
product or upon the delivery of a promotional 
or developmental service.
Revenues exclude inter-company revenues 
and value-added taxes and represent net 
invoice value less estimated rebates, returns 
and settlement discounts. Revenues are 
recognised when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to a third party. In general, this is upon 
delivery of the products to wholesalers. 
In markets where returns are significant 
(currently only in the US), estimates of returns 
are accounted for at the point revenue is 
recognised. In markets where returns are not 
significant, they are recorded when returned.
For the US market, we estimate the quantity 
and value of goods which may ultimately be 
returned at the point of sale. Our returns 
accruals are based on actual experience  
over the preceding 12 months for established 
products together with market-related 
Basis of accounting and preparation  
of financial information
The Consolidated Financial Statements  
have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention, modified to include revaluation  
to fair value of certain financial instruments  
as described below, in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006 and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the EU (adopted IFRSs) 
in response to the IAS regulation (EC 
1606/2002). The Consolidated Financial 
Statements also comply fully with IFRSs 
as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB).
During the year, the Group has adopted the 
amendments to IAS 32, on offsetting financial 
assets and liabilities, and IAS 39, on novation 
of derivatives and continuation of hedge 
accounting. The Group has also adopted 
IFRIC Interpretation 21 ‘Levies’. The adoption 
of these new amendments and the 
Interpretation has not had a significant impact 
on the Group’s profit for the period, net 
assets or cash flows.
The Company has elected to prepare 
the Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practices (GAAP). These are 
presented on pages 191 to 195 and the 
Accounting Policies in respect of Company 
information are set out on page 192.
The Consolidated Financial Statements 
are presented in US dollars, which is the 
Company’s functional currency.
In preparing their individual Financial 
Statements, the accounting policies of some 
overseas subsidiaries do not conform 
with IASB issued IFRSs. Therefore, where 
appropriate, adjustments are made in order 
to present the Consolidated Financial 
Statements on a consistent basis.
Basis for preparation of Financial 
Statements on a going concern basis
Information on the business environment 
AstraZeneca operates in, including the 
factors underpinning the pharmaceutical 
industry’s future growth prospects, is 
included in the Strategic Report. Details 
of the product portfolio of the Group 
(including patent expiry dates for key 
marketed products), our approach to 
product development and our development 
pipeline are covered in detail with additional 
information by Therapy Area in the Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report.
Group Accounting Policies
Financial Statements AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 139
Intangible assets relating to products in 
development (both internally generated 
and externally acquired) are subject to 
impairment testing annually. All intangible 
assets are tested for impairment when there 
are indications that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable. Any impairment losses 
are recognised immediately in profit. 
Intangible assets relating to products 
which fail during development (or for which 
development ceases for other reasons) 
are tested for impairment at the point of 
termination and are written down to their 
recoverable amount (which is usually zero).
If, subsequent to an impairment loss being 
recognised, development restarts or other 
facts and circumstances change indicating 
that the impairment is less or no longer exists, 
the value of the asset is re-estimated and its 
carrying value is increased to the recoverable 
amount, but not exceeding the original  
value, by recognising an impairment reversal 
in profit.
Business combinations and goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values 
are attributed to the identifiable assets and 
liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the 
fair value cannot be measured reliably,  
in which case the value is subsumed into 
goodwill. Where the Group fully acquires, 
through a business combination, assets that 
were previously held in joint operations, the 
Group has elected not to uplift the book value of 
the existing interest in the asset held in the joint 
operation to fair value at the date full control is 
taken. Where fair values of acquired contingent 
liabilities cannot be measured reliably, the 
assumed contingent liability is not recognised 
but is disclosed in the same manner as other 
contingent liabilities.
Future contingent elements of consideration 
which may include development and launch 
milestones, revenue threshold milestones  
and revenue-based royalties, are fair valued 
at the date of acquisition using decision-tree 
analysis with key inputs including probability 
of success, consideration of potential delays 
and revenue projections based on the 
Group’s internal forecasts. Unsettled amounts 
of consideration are held at fair value within 
payables with changes in fair value 
recognised immediately in profit.
Goodwill is the difference between the 
fair value of the consideration and the fair 
value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised 
and subject to an impairment review, both 
annually and when there is an indication that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 
2002, goodwill was amortised over its 
estimated useful life; such amortisation 
ceased on 31 December 2002.
The Group’s policy up to and including 1997 
was to eliminate goodwill arising upon 
acquisitions against reserves. Under IFRS 1 
‘First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards’ and IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’, such goodwill will remain 
eliminated against reserves.
Joint arrangements
The Group has arrangements over which it 
has joint control and which qualify as joint 
operations or joint ventures under IFRS 11 
‘Joint Arrangements’. For joint operations, the 
Group recognises its share of revenue that it 
earns from the joint operations and its share 
of expenses incurred. The Group also 
recognises the assets associated with the 
joint operations that it controls and the 
liabilities it incurs under the joint arrangement 
collaboration agreements. For joint ventures, 
the Group recognises its interest in the joint 
venture as an investment and uses the equity 
method of accounting.
Employee benefits
The Group accounts for pensions and other 
employee benefits (principally healthcare) 
under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ issued 
in 2011. In respect of defined benefit plans, 
obligations are measured at discounted 
present value while plan assets are measured 
at fair value. The operating and financing 
costs of such plans are recognised separately 
in profit; current service costs are spread 
systematically over the lives of employees 
and financing costs are recognised in full  
in the periods in which they arise. 
Remeasurements of the net defined pension 
liability, including actuarial gains and losses, 
are recognised immediately in other 
comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a surplus  
to the Group, the recognised asset is limited 
to the present value of any available future 
refunds from the plan or reductions in future 
contributions to the plan. Payments to 
defined contribution plans are recognised  
in profit as they fall due.
Taxation
The current tax payable is based on taxable 
profit for the year. Taxable profit differs 
from reported profit because taxable profit 
excludes items that are either never taxable 
or tax deductible or items that are taxable  
or tax deductible in a different period. 
The Group’s current tax assets and liabilities 
are calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance 
sheet liability method, providing for temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts  
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation 
purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the asset 
information such as estimated stock levels at 
wholesalers and competitor activity which we 
receive via third party information services. 
For newly launched products, we use 
rates based on our experience with similar 
products or a pre-determined percentage.
When a product faces generic competition, 
particular attention is given to the possible 
levels of returns and, in cases where the 
circumstances are such that the level of 
returns (and, hence, revenue) cannot be 
measured reliably, revenues are only 
recognised when the right of return expires, 
which is generally on ultimate prescription  
of the product to patients.
Further detail on key judgements and 
estimates is included in the Financial Review 
from page 70.
Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised in profit 
in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is 
capitalised only if it meets the recognition 
criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. 
Where regulatory and other uncertainties  
are such that the criteria are not met, the 
expenditure is recognised in profit and this  
is almost invariably the case prior to approval 
of the drug by the relevant regulatory authority. 
Where, however, recognition criteria are  
met, intangible assets are capitalised and 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic lives from product launch.  
At 31 December 2014, no amounts have  
met recognition criteria.
Payments to in-licence products and 
compounds from third parties for new 
research and development projects 
(in process research and development), 
generally taking the form of upfront payments 
and milestones, are capitalised. Where 
payments made to third parties represent 
future research and development activities, 
an evaluation is made as to the nature of 
the payments. Such payments are expensed 
if they represent compensation for 
subcontracted research and development 
services not resulting in a transfer of 
intellectual property. By contrast, 
payments are capitalised if they represent 
compensation for the transfer of intellectual 
property developed at the risk of the 
third party. Since acquired products and 
compounds will only generate sales and  
cash inflows following launch, our policy is to 
minimise the period between final approval and 
launch if it is within AstraZeneca’s control to 
do so. Assets capitalised are amortised, on a 
straight-line basis, over their useful economic 
lives from product launch. Under this policy,  
it is not possible to determine precise 
economic lives for individual classes of 
intangible assets. However, lives do not 
exceed 20 years. 
Financial Statements AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 140
However, the total lives range from 
approximately 10 to 50 years for buildings, 
and three to 15 years for plant and 
equipment. All items of property, plant and 
equipment are tested for impairment when 
there are indications that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. Any impairment 
losses are recognised immediately in profit.
Borrowing costs
The Group has no borrowing costs with 
respect to the acquisition or construction  
of qualifying assets. All other borrowing  
costs are recognised in profit as incurred  
and in accordance with the effective interest 
rate method.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases  
if they transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership, otherwise 
they are classified as operating leases. 
Assets and liabilities arising on finance  
leases are initially recognised at fair value or,  
if lower, the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. The discount rate used in 
calculating the present value of the minimum 
lease payments is the interest rate implicit  
in the lease. Finance charges under finance 
leases are allocated to each reporting  
period so as to produce a constant periodic 
rate of interest on the remaining balance  
of the finance liability. Rentals under  
operating leases are charged to profit  
on a straight-line basis.
Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, directly  
or indirectly, by AstraZeneca PLC. Control  
is regarded as the exposure or rights to the 
variable returns of the entity when combined 
with the power to affect those returns.
The financial results of subsidiaries are 
consolidated from the date control is 
obtained until the date that control ceases.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost  
and net realisable value. The first in, first out 
or an average method of valuation is used. 
For finished goods and work in progress, 
cost includes directly attributable costs and 
certain overhead expenses (including 
depreciation). Selling expenses and certain 
other overhead expenses (principally central 
administration costs) are excluded. Net 
realisable value is determined as estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs to be incurred in selling 
and distribution.
Write-downs of inventory occur in the general 
course of business and are recognised in 
cost of sales.
Trade and other receivables
Financial assets included in trade and other 
receivables are recognised initially at fair 
value. Subsequent to initial recognition they 
are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method, less any 
impairment losses. Trade receivables that are 
subject to debt factoring arrangements are 
derecognised if they meet the conditions for 
derecognition detailed in IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
Trade and other payables
Financial liabilities included in trade and other 
payables are recognised initially at fair value. 
Subsequent to initial recognition they are 
measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments include 
interests in leases, trade and other 
receivables and payables, liabilities for 
contingent consideration under business 
combinations, and rights and obligations 
under employee benefit plans which are  
dealt with in specific accounting policies.
The Group’s other financial 
instruments include:
 > cash and cash equivalents
 > fixed deposits
 > other investments
 > bank and other borrowings
 > derivatives.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash  
in hand, current balances with banks and 
similar institutions and highly liquid 
investments with maturities of three months 
or less when acquired. They are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash  
and are held at amortised cost.
Fixed deposits
Fixed deposits, principally comprising  
funds held with banks and other financial 
institutions, are initially measured at fair value, 
plus direct transaction costs, and are 
subsequently remeasured to amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method at 
each reporting date. Changes in carrying 
value are recognised in profit.
Other investments
Where investments have been classified  
as held for trading, they are measured initially 
at fair value and subsequently remeasured  
to fair value at each reporting date. Changes  
in fair value are recognised in profit.
In all other circumstances, the investments 
are classified as ‘available for sale’, initially 
measured at fair value (including direct 
transaction costs) and subsequently 
remeasured to fair value at each reporting 
date. Changes in carrying value due to 
changes in exchange rates on monetary 
available for sale investments or impairments 
are recognised in profit. All other changes  
in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
can be utilised. This requires judgements  
to be made in respect of the availability of 
future taxable income.
No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised  
in respect of temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries 
and branches where the Group is able to 
control the timing of reversal of the temporary 
differences and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in  
the foreseeable future.
The Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are calculated using tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset realised based 
on tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Accruals for tax contingencies require 
management to make judgements and 
estimates of exposures in relation to tax  
audit issues. Tax benefits are not recognised 
unless the tax positions will probably be 
sustained. Once considered to be probable, 
management reviews each material tax 
benefit to assess whether a provision should 
be taken against full recognition of that 
benefit on the basis of potential settlement 
through negotiation and/or litigation. All 
provisions are included in current liabilities. 
Any liability to interest on tax liabilities is 
provided for in the tax charge. See Note 27  
to the Financial Statements for further details.
Share-based payments
All plans are assessed and have been 
classified as equity settled. The grant date  
fair value of employee share plan awards is 
calculated using a modified version of the 
binomial model. In accordance with IFRS 2 
‘Share-based Payment’, the resulting cost is 
recognised in profit over the vesting period  
of the awards, being the period in which the 
services are received. The value of the charge is 
adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels 
of awards vesting, except where the failure  
to vest is as a result of not meeting a market 
condition. Cancellations of equity instruments 
are treated as an acceleration of the vesting 
period and any outstanding charge is 
recognised in profit immediately.
Property, plant and equipment
The Group’s policy is to write off the 
difference between the cost of each item 
of property, plant and equipment and its 
residual value over its estimated useful life  
on a straight-line basis. Assets under 
construction are not depreciated.
Reviews are made annually of the estimated 
remaining lives and residual values of 
individual productive assets, taking account 
of commercial and technological 
obsolescence as well as normal wear and 
tear. Under this policy it becomes impractical 
to calculate average asset lives exactly. 
Financial Statements > Group Accounting Policies AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 141
Monetary assets, arising from foreign 
currency transactions, are retranslated at 
exchange rates prevailing at the reporting 
date. Exchange gains and losses on  
loans and on short-term foreign currency 
borrowings and deposits are included within 
finance expense. Exchange differences on  
all other foreign currency transactions are 
recognised in operating profit in the individual 
Group entity’s accounting records.
Non-monetary items arising from 
foreign currency transactions are not 
retranslated in the individual Group entity’s 
accounting records.
In the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
income and expense items for Group entities 
with a functional currency other than US 
dollars are translated into US dollars at 
average exchange rates, which approximate 
to actual rates, for the relevant accounting 
periods. Assets and liabilities are translated  
at the US dollar exchange rates prevailing  
at the reporting date. Exchange differences 
arising on consolidation are recognised in 
other comprehensive income.
If certain criteria are met, non-US dollar 
denominated loans or derivatives are 
designated as net investment hedges of 
foreign operations. Exchange differences 
arising on retranslation of net investments, 
and of foreign currency loans which are 
designated in an effective net investment 
hedge relationship, are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Foreign exchange 
derivatives hedging net investments in  
foreign operations are carried at fair value. 
Effective fair value movements are recognised  
in other comprehensive income, with  
any ineffectiveness taken to the income 
statement. Gains and losses accumulated  
in the translation reserve will be recycled to 
profit when the foreign operation is sold.
Litigation and environmental liabilities
Through the normal course of business, 
AstraZeneca is involved in legal disputes, the 
settlement of which may involve cost to the 
Group. Provision is made where an adverse 
outcome is probable and associated costs, 
including related legal costs, can be 
estimated reliably. In other cases, appropriate 
disclosures are included.
Where it is considered that the Group is  
more likely than not to prevail, or in the rare 
circumstances where the amount of the 
legal liability cannot be estimated reliably, 
legal costs involved in defending the claim  
are charged to profit as they are incurred.
Where it is considered that the Group has  
a valid contract which provides the right to 
reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) 
of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss 
incurred or for which a provision has been 
established, the best estimate of the amount 
expected to be received is recognised as  
an asset only when it is virtually certain.
AstraZeneca is exposed to environmental 
liabilities relating to its past operations, 
principally in respect of soil and groundwater 
remediation costs. Provisions for these costs 
are made when there is a present obligation 
and where it is probable that expenditure on 
remedial work will be required and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the cost. Provisions 
are discounted where the effect is material.
Impairment
The carrying values of non-financial assets, 
other than inventories and deferred tax 
assets, are reviewed at least annually to 
determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. For goodwill, intangible assets 
under development and for any other assets 
where such indication exists, the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated based 
on the greater of its value in use and its fair 
value less cost to sell. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows, 
adjusted for the risks specific to each asset, 
are discounted to their present value using  
a discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and 
the general risks affecting the pharmaceutical 
industry. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, assets are grouped together into the 
smallest group of assets that generates cash 
inflows from continuing use that are largely 
independent of the cash flows of other assets. 
Impairment losses are recognised 
immediately in profit.
International accounting transition
On transition to using adopted IFRSs in 
the year ended 31 December 2005, the Group 
took advantage of several optional 
exemptions available in IFRS 1 ‘First-time 
Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards’. The major impacts which are of 
continuing importance are detailed below:
 > Business combinations – IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’ has been applied from 
1 January 2003, the date of transition, 
rather than being applied fully 
retrospectively. As a result, the combination 
of Astra and Zeneca is still accounted for 
as a merger, rather than through purchase 
accounting. If purchase accounting had 
been adopted, Zeneca would have been 
deemed to have acquired Astra.
 > Cumulative exchange differences – 
the Group chose to set the cumulative 
exchange difference reserve at 1 January 
2003 to zero.
Impairments are recorded in profit when there  
is a decline in the value of an investment that 
is deemed to be other than temporary. On 
disposal of the investment, the cumulative 
amount recognised in other comprehensive 
income is recognised in profit as part of the 
gain or loss on disposal.
Bank and other borrowings
The Group uses derivatives, principally 
interest rate swaps, to hedge the interest  
rate exposure inherent in a portion of its fixed 
interest rate debt. In such cases the Group 
will either designate the debt as fair value 
through profit or loss when certain criteria  
are met or as the hedged item under a fair 
value hedge.
If the debt instrument is designated as 
fair value through profit or loss, the debt is 
initially measured at fair value (with direct 
transaction costs being included in profit as 
an expense) and is remeasured to fair value 
at each reporting date with changes in 
carrying value being recognised in profit 
(along with changes in the fair value of the 
related derivative). Such a designation has 
been made where this significantly reduces 
an accounting mismatch which would result 
from recognising gains and losses on 
different bases.
If the debt is designated as the hedged  
item under a fair value hedge, the debt is 
initially measured at fair value (with direct 
transaction costs being amortised over the  
life of the bonds), and is remeasured for fair 
value changes in respect of the hedged risk 
at each reporting date with changes in 
carrying value being recognised in profit 
(along with changes in the fair value of the 
related derivative).
Other interest-bearing loans are initially 
measured at fair value (with direct transaction 
costs being amortised over the life of the 
bond) and are subsequently remeasured to 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method at each reporting date. Changes  
in carrying value are recognised in profit.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value 
(with direct transaction costs being included 
in profit as an expense) and are subsequently 
remeasured to fair value at each reporting 
date. Changes in carrying value are 
recognised in profit.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions, being 
transactions denominated in a currency  
other than an individual Group entity’s 
functional currency, are translated into the 
relevant functional currencies of individual 
Group entities at average rates for the 
relevant monthly accounting periods, 
which approximate to actual rates.

net results, net assets or disclosures. The 
amendments to IAS 19 were endorsed by  
the EU on 17 December. The remaining 
amendments have yet to be endorsed by  
the EU.
Applicable accounting standards 
and interpretations issued but not 
yet adopted
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was finalised 
by the IASB in July 2014 and is effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018. The new standard will 
replace existing accounting standards. It is 
applicable to financial assets and liabilities, 
and will introduce changes to existing 
accounting concerning classification and 
measurement, impairment (introducing an 
expected-loss method), hedge accounting, 
and on the treatment of gains arising from the 
impact of credit risk on the measurement of 
liabilities held at fair value. The standard has 
not yet been endorsed by the EU. The 
adoption of IFRS 9 is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group’s net results 
or net assets, although the full impact will be 
subject to further assessment.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers’ was issued by the IASB in May 
2014. It is effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2017. The 
new standard will replace existing accounting 
standards, and provides enhanced detail  
on the principle of recognising revenue to 
reflect the transfer of goods and services  
to customers at a value which the company 
expects to be entitled to receive. The 
standard also updates revenue disclosure 
requirements. The standard has yet to be 
endorsed by the EU. The Group is currently 
assessing the impact of IFRS 15 on the 
results of the Group and are considering the 
impacts, if any, on certain revenue items 
including, but not limited to, licence income 
and milestone revenues.

2 Operating profit
Operating profit includes the following items:
Research and development expense
In 2013, research and development includes a reversal of the intangible asset impairment charge of $285m, booked in 2011 for Lynparza 
(olaparib). It also includes an impairment charge of $138m against Bydureon, following revised estimates for future sales performance  
below AstraZeneca’s commercial expectations at the time of entering into our collaboration with BMS on Amylin products in 2012, and  
an impairment charge of $136m following AstraZeneca’s decision not to proceed with regulatory filings for fostamatinib. Research and 
development in 2012 includes a $50m impairment following the decision by AstraZeneca not to pursue a regulatory filing for TC-5214. 
Selling, general and administrative costs
In 2014, selling, general and administrative costs includes a $529m charge resulting from changes in the fair value of the liabilities for  
contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of the diabetes alliance with BMS. The uplift in fair value reflects increased estimates  
for future sales performance for the products acquired and, as a result, increased estimates for future royalties payable.
In July 2014, the US Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations that affected how the annual Branded Pharmaceutical Fee (the Fee), 
imposed by the health care reform legislation in 2010 is recognised. As a result, entities covered by the legislation now accrue for the obligation 
as each sale occurs. AstraZeneca recorded a catch-up charge of $226m in 2014 to reflect this new basis, $113m of which has been recorded 
in selling, general and administrative costs and $113m as a deduction from revenue.
In 2013, selling, general and administrative costs includes an intangible asset impairment charge of $1,620m against Bydureon following 
revised estimates for future sales performance as detailed above. Selling, general and administrative costs in 2012 includes net legal provisions of 
$72m, in respect of net legal provision charges relating to ongoing Seroquel franchise legal matters, Average Wholesale Price litigation in the 
US, the Toprol-XL anti-trust litigation and Nexium commercial litigation. The current status of these matters is described in Note 27 . These 
provisions constituted our best estimate at that time of losses expected for these matters.
Further details of impairment charges and reversals for 2014, 2013 and 2012 are included in Notes 7 and 9.

The reported tax rate of 0.9% for the year ended 31 December 2014 benefited from a $117m adjustment in respect of prior periods following 
the settlement of the inter-governmental agreement of a transfer pricing matter, the impact of the revaluation of the fair value of contingent 
consideration arising on business combinations (charge of $512m with related tax credit of $157m) and the benefit of the UK Patent Box 
legislation ($35m). Excluding these items, the reported tax rate for the year was 18.2%.
Taxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the periods covered by the Group Financial Statements. The 2014 prior 
period current tax adjustment relates mainly to a reduction in provisions for tax contingencies, including a benefit of $117m arising from the 
inter-governmental agreement of a transfer pricing matter, partially offset by tax accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2013 prior period 
current tax adjustment relates mainly to an increase in provisions for tax contingencies partially offset by tax accrual to tax return adjustments. 
The 2012 prior period current tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $259m arising from a number of tax settlements (including settlement of  
a transfer pricing matter), partially offset by an increase in provisions for other tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.  
The 2014 prior period deferred tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2013 prior period deferred tax 
adjustment relates to tax accrual to tax return adjustments. The 2012 prior period deferred tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $102m arising 
from a number of tax settlements (including settlements of a transfer pricing matter) and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, 
appropriate amounts have been provided for. No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as 
these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies. Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and/or 
UK taxation (after allowing for double tax relief) if distributed as dividends. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $6,128m at  
31 December 2014 (2013: $6,196m; 2012: $8,655m).
Factors affecting future tax charges
As a group with worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and 
mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms. In 2013, the UK Government 
enacted legislation to reduce the main rate of UK Statutory Corporation Tax to 20% by 2015. Details of material tax exposures and items 
currently under audit and negotiation are set out in Note 27.

 Other items include the impact of internal transfers of intellectual property including recognition of deferred tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination (tax charge of $304m), and the

4 Taxation continued
AstraZeneca is domiciled in the UK but operates in other countries where the tax rates and tax laws are different to those in the UK. The 
impact of differences in effective overseas tax rates on the Group’s overall tax charge is noted above. Profits arising from our manufacturing 
operation in Puerto Rico are granted special status and are taxed at a reduced rate compared with the normal rate of tax in that territory under 
a tax incentive grant that expires in 2016.

6 Segment information
AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of biopharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments. Our 
biopharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold. 
All of these functional activities take place (and are managed) globally on a highly integrated basis. We do not manage these individual 
functional areas separately. 
The SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which he exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board for the 
management, development and performance of our business. We consider that the SET is AstraZeneca’s chief operating decision making body 
(as defined by IFRS 8). The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, and manufacturing 
and supply. In addition to the CEO, CFO, the General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer, the SET comprises nine Executive Vice-
Presidents representing IMED, MedImmune, Global Medicines Development, North America, Europe, International, GPPS, Operations & 
Information Services, and Human Resources. All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET. While members of the SET have responsibility 
for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole. Where necessary, these are 
implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision. For example, product launch 
decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub-team for implementation. The impacts of 
being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision making process.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, 
and on the same basis as, the Group’s IFRS Financial Statements. The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products coupled 
with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing 
businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product. 
Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is 
not monitored by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need. In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are 
allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Group’s Early Stage 
Product Committees and a single Late Stage Product Committee. 
Geographic areas

Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party. In general this is upon 
delivery of the products to wholesalers. Transactions with two wholesalers (2013: one; 2012: two) individually represented greater than 10% of 
total revenue. The value of these transactions recorded as revenue were $3,261m and $2,674m (2013: $3,166m; 2012: $3,517m and $3,155m).

For the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill, the Group is regarded as a single cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Group’s pre-tax cash flows over 10 years 
which is considered by the Board as a reasonable period given the long development and life-cycle of a medicine. The projections include 
assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics entering the 
market. In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information (including information on expected 
increases and ageing of the populations in our established markets and the expanding patient population in newer markets), our knowledge  
of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry. The 10 year period is covered by internal budgets 
and forecasts. Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates are used to extrapolate 
internal budgets and forecasts for the purposes of determining value in use. No terminal value is included as these cash flows are more than 
sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist. The methods used to determine recoverable amounts have remained consistent  
with the prior year.
In arriving at value in use, we disaggregate our projected pre-tax cash flows into groups reflecting similar risks and tax effects. For each  
group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects. In arriving at the appropriate discount rate for 
each group of cash flows, we adjust AstraZeneca’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital (7 .0% for 2014, 2013 and 2012) to reflect the 
impact of relevant industry risks, the time value of money and tax effects. The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was 
approximately 10% (2013: 10%; 2012: 10%).
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus at 
31 December 2014 (and 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012).
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections used and discount rate applied. The Directors have 
concluded that, given the significant headroom that exists, and the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant risk  
that reasonable changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use.

The impairment reversal of $285m booked in 2013 was recorded in Research and development expense.
Impairment charges and reversals
In 2014, impairment charges relate to the termination, or reassessment of the likelihood of success, of several individual projects, none of 
which had significant capitalised values.
In 2013, AstraZeneca commenced enrolment of the first patient in the first of several Phase III clinical programmes for Lynparza (olaparib).  
As a result of the initiation of this programme, an impairment charge of $285m, taken in 2011, was reversed and the full historic carrying  
value of the asset restored to our balance sheet. There are several indications currently under development for Lynparza (olaparib) and,  
at the date of the reversal of the impairment, the recoverable value of the intangible asset relating to Lynparza (olaparib) determined using value  
in use calculations as detailed below, was estimated to be at least $650m above its carrying value. The 2013 impairment charge of product, 
marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $1,758m against the intangible asset for Bydureon, acquired as part of the 2012 
collaboration with BMS on Amylin products, following revised estimates for future sales performance as part of the annual budgeting process 
that are below AstraZeneca’s commercial expectations at that time of entering into the collaboration. Impairment charges also include $136m 
following AstraZeneca’s decision not to proceed with regulatory filings for fostamatinib.
The 2012 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $50m following the decision by AstraZeneca not to 
pursue a regulatory filing for TC-5214 (with a partial impairment of $150m having been taken in the prior year, 2011), based on the final results  
of Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies of the compound as an adjunct therapy to an anti-depressant in patients with major depressive 
disorder who do not respond adequately to initial anti-depressant treatment. The remaining $149m charge in 2012 relates to the termination  
of other development projects during the year. 
The write downs in value of intangible assets, other than those arising from termination of R&D activities, were determined based on value  
in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the products’ expected post-tax cash flows over a period reflecting the 
patent-protected lives of the individual products. The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and forecasts. By their nature,  
the value in use calculations are sensitive to the underlying methods, assumptions and estimates. The estimated recoverable amount of the 
acquired and in development assets exceeded their respective calculated value in use. Consistent with prior years, as part of the impairment 
review process, management has identified that reasonably possible changes in certain key assumptions including the likelihood of achieving 
successful trial results and obtaining regulatory approval for in development assets, the projected market share of the therapeutic area  
and expected pricing for launched products, may cause the carrying amount of the intangible assets to exceed the recoverable amount.  
In addition, there is a significant risk that partial impairments recognised may be subject to adjustments in future periods. Any resulting 
adjustments may be material. In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZeneca’s post-tax weighted 
average cost of capital (7.0% for 2014, 2013 and 2012) to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products.  
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 13% (2013: 13%; 2012: 14%).

 Assets in development are not amortised but are tested annually for impairment.
Arrangements with Merck
In 1982, Astra set up a joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc. (now Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of the new Merck & Co., Inc. that 
resulted from the merger with Schering-Plough) (‘Merck’) for the purposes of selling, marketing and distributing certain Astra products in the 
US. In 1998, this joint venture was restructured (the ‘Restructuring’). Under the agreements relating to the Restructuring (the ‘Agreements’),  
a US limited partnership (the ‘Partnership’) was formed, in which Merck was the limited partner and AstraZeneca the general partner, and 
AstraZeneca obtained control of the joint venture’s business subject to certain limited partner and other rights held by Merck and its affiliates. 
These rights provided Merck with safeguards over the activities of the Partnership and placed limitations on AstraZeneca’s commercial 
freedom to operate. The Agreements provided in part, for 
 > annual contingent payments 
 > termination arrangements which cause Merck to relinquish its interests in AstraZeneca’s products and activities in stages, some of which 
are mandatory and others optional. 
The termination arrangements and payments included 
 > the Advance Payment 
 > the Partial Retirement 
 > the True-Up 
 > the Loan Note Receivable 
 > the First Option 
 > the Second Option. 
AstraZeneca considered that the termination arrangements described above represent the acquisition, in stages, of Merck’s interests in the 
Partnership and Agreement products (including Merck’s rights to contingent payments). Once all payments were made, AstraZeneca would 
have unencumbered discretion in its operations in the US market. AstraZeneca benefits under the termination arrangements from: 
 > The substantial freedom over products acquired or discovered after the merger of Astra and Zeneca in 1999; and 
 > Enhanced contributions from, and substantial freedom over, those products that have already been launched (for example, Prilosec, 
Nexium, Brilinta, Pulmicort, Symbicort, Rhinocort and Atacand) and those that are in development. 
Economic benefits include relief from contingent payments and other cost efficiencies, together with the strategic advantages of increased 
freedom to operate. 
The intangible assets relating to purchased product rights are subject to impairment testing and would be partially or wholly impaired if  
a product is withdrawn or if activity in any of the affected therapy areas is significantly curtailed. 
Annual Contingent Payments
Following the exercise of the Second Option (as detailed below) all contingent payments to Merck have now ceased. 156 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
9 Intangible assets continued 
Advance Payment 
The merger between Astra and Zeneca in 1999 triggered the first step in the termination arrangements. Merck relinquished all rights, including 
contingent payments on future sales, to potential Astra products with no existing or pending US patents at the time of the merger. As a result, 
AstraZeneca now has rights to such products and is relieved of potential obligations to Merck and restrictions in respect of those products 
(including annual contingent payments), affording AstraZeneca substantial freedom to exploit the products as it sees fit. At the time of the 
merger, the Advance Payment of $967m was made. The Advance Payment has been accounted for as an intangible asset and is being 
amortised over 20 years. Although the rights obtained apply in perpetuity, the period of amortisation of 20 years is used to reflect the typical 
timescale of development and marketing of a product. 
Partial Retirement, True-Up and Loan Note Receivable 
On 17 March 2008, AstraZeneca made a net cash payment to Merck of approximately $2.6bn in connection with the Partial Retirement, the 
True-Up and the Loan Note Receivable. This payment resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring Merck’s interests in certain AstraZeneca products 
(including Pulmicort, Rhinocort, Symbicort and Toprol-XL), AstraZeneca ceasing contingent payments on these products and AstraZeneca 
obtaining the ability to exploit these products and other opportunities in the Respiratory Therapy Area. Intangible assets of $994m were 
recognised at the time with the balance of the net payment ($1,656m) representing payments on account for future product rights associated 
with the First Option and the Second Option as detailed below. These ‘non-refundable deposits’ were classified as intangible assets. 
First Option 
On 26 February 2010, AstraZeneca exercised the First Option. Payment of $647m to Merck was made on 30 April 2010. This payment resulted 
in AstraZeneca acquiring Merck’s interests in products covered by the First Option, including Entocort, Atacand, Plendil and certain products in 
development at the time (principally Brilinta and lesogaberan; development of lesogaberan was subsequently discontinued). Also on 30 April 
2010, contingent payments on these products ceased with respect to periods after this date and AstraZeneca obtained the ability to exploit 
these products and other opportunities in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas. These rights were valued at $1,829m and were 
recognised as intangible assets from 26 February 2010 ($1,182m having been transferred from non-refundable deposits to supplement the 
payment of $647m to Merck). Of these rights, $689m was allocated to contingent payment relief and $1,140m to intangible assets reflecting the 
ability to fully exploit the products in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas. The remaining non-refundable deposits of $474m 
relate to benefits that were secured upon AstraZeneca exercising the Second Option, as detailed below.
Second Option
The Agreements provided that AstraZeneca may exercise a Second Option to purchase Merck’s interests in the Merck affiliates that hold the 
limited partner and other rights referred to above. Exercise of the Second Option would result in the repurchase by AstraZeneca of Merck’s 
interests in Prilosec and Nexium in the US. This option was exercisable by AstraZeneca in May to October of 2012, or in 2017, or if combined 
annual sales of the two products fell below a minimum amount. 
On 26 June 2012, AstraZeneca and Merck agreed to amend certain provisions of the Agreements with respect to the Second Option. 
The principal areas covered by the amendments were a change in the timing for AstraZeneca to exercise the Second Option, and agreement 
on the valuation methodology for setting certain aspects of the option exercise price. Under the amended Agreements, Merck granted to 
AstraZeneca a new Second Option exercisable by AstraZeneca between 1 March 2014 and 30 April 2014, with closing on 30 June 2014. 
Options exercisable in 2017 or if combined annual sales fell below a minimum amount also remained available to AstraZeneca. In addition to 
this revised timing for the Second Option, AstraZeneca and Merck also reached agreement on the valuation methodology for setting certain 
components of the option exercise price for a 2014 exercise. 
On 30 June 2014, the Second Option was consummated, resulting in (i) the termination of Merck’s interests in entities that hold the US  
rights to Nexium and Prilosec, and (ii) the control of these entities by AstraZeneca. At closing, AstraZeneca paid to Merck a total exercise  
price of $409m, $327m of which was fixed in 2012 based on a shared view by AstraZeneca and Merck of the forecasts for sales of Nexium 
and Prilosec in the US market. This amount is subject to a true-up in 2018 that replaces the shared forecast with actual sales for the period 
from closing in 2014 to June 2018. At closing, AstraZeneca also paid to Merck an administrative fee of $10m. In 2018, Merck will receive  
an additional administrative fee of $11m. The intangible assets arising from the Second Option, and the $474m from the First Option  
(detailed above), in aggregate, reflect the value of the ability to exploit opportunities in the Gastrointestinal Therapy Area and relief from 
contingent payments.

Equity securities and bonds available for sale, and equity securities held for trading, are held on the consolidated statement of financial 
position at fair value. The fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices. For unlisted investments whose fair value 
cannot be reliably measured, cost is considered to approximate to fair value. Fixed deposits are held at amortised cost with carrying value being 
a reasonable approximation of fair value given their short-term nature.
None of the financial assets or liabilities have been reclassified in the year.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments, contained within other investments and carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different 
levels have been defined as follows:
 > Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 > Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices)  
or indirectly (ie derived from prices).

All derivatives are held at fair value and fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 11. None of the derivatives have been 
reclassified in the year.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to 
discount future contractual cash flows based on rates at current year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are estimated by cash flow accounting models using appropriate yield 
curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end. The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing 
transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end. 
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the 
reporting date, and were as follows.

13 Non-current other receivables
Non-current other receivables of $1, 1 12m (2013: $1,867m; 2012: $352m) include a prepayment of $906m (2013: $1,276m; 2012: $nil) which 
represents the long-term element of minimum contractual royalties payable to Shionogi under the global licence agreement for Crestor,  
which was re-negotiated in December 2013. The resulting modified royalty structure, which includes fixed minimum and maximum payments  
in years until 2020, has resulted in the Company recognising liabilities, and corresponding prepayments, for the discounted value of total 
minimum payments. The current portion of the prepayment is $323m (2013: $350m; 2012: $nil) and is reported in amounts due within one year 
(see Note 15). Non-current other receivables also include prepayments in relation to our research collaboration with Moderna Therapeutics.

 Included within borrowings held at amortised cost are amounts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations of $1,453m (2013: $1,608m; 2012: $1,551m) held at amortised cost. 
The fair value of these borrowings was $1,641m at 31 December 2014 (2013: $1,769m; 2012: $1,808m).
The fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices; the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, 
as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets. The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through 
profit or loss is the fair value; this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 11. For loans designated in a fair value hedge 
relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each 
reporting date. All other loans are held at amortised cost. Fair values, as disclosed in the table above, are all determined using the Level 1 
valuation method as defined in Note 11, with the exception of overdrafts and finance leases, where fair value approximates to carrying values.

17 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings continued
A loss of $1m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss, due to increased credit risk.  
A gain of $38m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk. Changes in credit risk had no material effect on 
any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Group Financial Statements. The change in fair value attributable to 
changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk. The amount payable at maturity on bonds 
designated at fair value through profit or loss is $288m.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the 
reporting date, and were as follows.

As detailed in Note 24, contingent consideration arising from business combination is fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs 
including the probability of success, consideration of potential delays and the expected levels of future revenues. 
Revaluations of contingent consideration include:
 > In 2013, a reduction of $18m based on the Group’s revised view of the likelihood of triggering certain approval milestones arising on the 
acquisition of Omthera Pharmaceuticals (as detailed in Note 24).
 > An increase of $529m in 2014, based on revised milestone probabilities, and revenue and royalty forecasts, following the successful 
integration of BMS’s share of our previous global diabetes alliance following the acquisition in February 2014 (as detailed in Note 24).
 > An increase of $12m in 2014 relating to an approval milestone payable on our Almirall franchise business combination (as detailed in  
Note 24) following approval developments since the acquisition date.
 > A reduction of $29m in 2014 based on a revision to our assessment of the likelihood of triggering certain approval milestones arising  
on the acquisition of Omthera Pharmaceuticals (as detailed in Note 24).
Further details of the potential future payments on our business combinations, including details of the possible ranges of payments, are 
included in Note 24. Management has identified that reasonably possible changes in certain key assumptions including the likelihood of 
achieving successful trial results, obtaining regulatory approval, the projected market share of the therapeutic area and expected pricing  
for launched products may cause the calculated fair value of the above contingent consideration to vary materially in future years. 162 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014

AstraZeneca is undergoing a global restructuring initiative which involves rationalisation of the global supply chain, the sales and  
marketing organisation, IT and business support infrastructure, and R&D. Employee costs in connection with the initiatives are recognised  
in severance provisions.
Details of the environmental and legal provisions are provided in Note 27.
Employee benefit provisions include the Deferred Bonus Plan. Further details are included in Note 26.
Other provisions comprise amounts relating to specific contractual or constructive obligations and disputes.
No provision has been released or applied for any purpose other than that for which it was established.

Pensions
Background
The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group. Many of these plans are 
‘defined contribution’, where AstraZeneca’s contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees’ pay. 
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US, Sweden and Germany, are ‘defined benefit’, where benefits are based on employees’ length of 
service and average final salary (typically averaged over one, three or five years). The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively 
bargained Swedish plan (which is still open to employees born before 1979), have been closed to new entrants since 2000. During 2010, 
following consultation with its UK employees’ representatives, AstraZeneca introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels  
for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through separate, fiduciary-administered funds. The cash funding of the plans, which may from 
time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets together with 
future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations. The funding is monitored rigorously by AstraZeneca and appropriate 
fiduciaries specifically with reference to AstraZeneca’s credit rating, market capitalisation, cash flows and the solvency of the relevant  
pension scheme.

Financing Principles
97% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2014 are in schemes within the UK, the US, Sweden or Germany. In these 
countries, the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles:
 > The Group has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
 > The Group considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure. In general, it does not believe in committing 
excessive capital for funding while it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
 > The pension funds are not part of the Group’s core business. The Group believes in taking some rewarded risks with the investments 
underlying the funding, subject to a medium to long-term plan to reduce those risks if opportunities arise.
 > The Group recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position. The Group would not wish to 
amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be short-term 
volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations. 
 > In the event that local regulations require an additional level of financing, the Group would consider the use of alternative methods  
of providing this that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk  
of the Group.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZeneca’s business at the present date; should circumstances change they may require review.
AstraZeneca has developed a funding framework to implement these principles. This determines the cash contributions payable to the 
pension funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 liabilities. To reduce the risk of committing excess capital to pension funds, liability valuations are 
based on the expected return on the actual pension assets, rather than a corporate bond yield. At present, this puts a different, lower value  
on the liabilities than IAS 19.
UK
With regard to the Group’s UK defined benefit fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements (summarised below) 
and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee. 
Role of Trustees (UK)
The UK Pension Fund is managed by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Company. The Trustee Directors are composed  
of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees, and include an independent professional Trustee Director. The Trustee 
Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for the asset investment policy 
plus the day to day administration of the benefits. They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions  
due to the UK Pension Fund (see below).
Funding requirements (UK)
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently (ie to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits).  
On a triennial basis the Trustee and the Company must agree the contributions required (if any) to ensure the Fund is fully funded over time  
on a suitable prudent measure. The last funding valuation of the AstraZeneca Pension Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary as at  
31 March 2013.
In addition, AstraZeneca will make contributions to a separate account which will be held outside the UK Pension Fund. The assets held  
in this account will be payable to the AstraZeneca Pension Fund in agreed circumstances, for example, in the event of AstraZeneca and the 
Pension Fund Trustee agreeing on a change to the current long-term investment strategy. At 31 December 2014, £501m ($775m) of assets held 
in this separate account are included within other investments (see Note 11). The structure of this separate account has changed during the 
year from a tripartite Escrow arrangement (between AstraZeneca, the Pension Fund Trustee and JPMorgan) to a custody account held by 
AstraZeneca with HSBC. There is a charge in favour of the Pension Fund Trustee over the assets held in this custody account.
Under the current funding plan, a lump sum contribution of £196m ($305m) was made towards the deficit in January 2015. This contribution 
was made by transferring assets from the custody account described above. The Company and the UK Pension Fund are currently exploring 
revised funding plans and extended target dates for full funding.
Under the agreed funding principles used to set the statutory funding target, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2013 were as follows: 
long-term UK price inflation set at 3.55% per annum, salary increases at 0% per annum (as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen  
in 2010), pension increases at 3.2% per annum and investment returns at 4.86% per annum. The resulting valuation of the Fund’s liabilities  
on that basis were £4,887m ($7,603m) compared to a market value of assets at 31 March 2013 of £4,394m ($6,836m).
Under the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to AstraZeneca by refund 
assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the fund. As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC 14  
‘IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’.
Regulation (UK)
The UK pensions market is regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its 
website, www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk. 164 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
20 Post-retirement benefits continued
Rest of Group
The IAS 19 positions as at 31 December 2014 are shown below for each of the other countries with significant defined benefit plans. These 
plans account for 92% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations outside the UK. The US and Sweden pension funds are managed by fiduciary 
bodies with responsibility for the investment policies of those funds. These plans are funded in line with the financing principles and contributions 
paid as prescribed by the funding framework.
 > The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2014, when plan obligations were $1,990m and plan assets 
were $1,725m. This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
 > The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2014, when plan obligations were estimated to amount 
to $1,889m and plan assets were $1,178m.
 > The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2014. In accordance with practice in Germany, the plan 
has a low level of funding; plan obligations amounted to $413m and plan assets were $21m. 
On current bases, it is expected that contributions (excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions) during the year ending  
31 December 2015 to the four main countries will be $435m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions
In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZeneca’s employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life 
assurance benefits for retired employees. As at 31 December 2014, some 3,616 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit 
from these provisions and some 9,680 current employees will be eligible on their retirement. AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such 
retiree obligations over the working life of the employee. In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2014 was $20m (2013: $16m; 2012: $16m). Plan assets were $306m 
and plan obligations were $402m at 31 December 2014. These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits 
under IAS 19.
Financial assumptions
Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group 
to 31 December 2014. The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the 
long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. These assumptions were as follows.

The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables. These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and 
adjusted where sufficient data is available. Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where 
there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2014 and members expected to retire in 2034 
(2013: 2013 and 2033 respectively).

Risks associated with the Company’s defined benefit pensions
The UK defined benefit plan accounts for 66% of the Group’s defined benefit obligations and exposes the Company to a number of risks, the 
most significant of which are:
Risk Description Mitigation
Volatile asset 
returns 
The Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) is calculated using a 
discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; 
asset returns that differ from the discount rate will create 
an element of volatility in the solvency ratio. The UK 
Pension Fund holds a significant proportion (around 35%) 
of its assets in growth assets (such as equities) which, 
though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the 
long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.  
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure  
it remains appropriate given the UK Pension Fund’s 
long-term objectives.
The Company and Trustee have put in place an equity  
option hedging strategy for the UK Pension Fund to reduce the 
volatility of equity investment returns. The hedging strategy 
protects against falls in equity markets of between 94% and 
80% by foregoing upside above 105% returns on 75% of  
the portfolio.
The Company and Trustee have also hedged the UK  
Pension Fund equity investments against any changes  
to the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen for assets 
denominated in these currencies. Currently around 35% of 
the fund’s equity mandate is hedged against the US dollar, 
8% against the euro and 4% against the Japanese yen.
Changes in 
bond yields 
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the 
value placed on the DBO for accounting purposes, 
although this will be partially offset by an increase  
in the value of the UK Pension Fund’s bond holdings.
The UK Pension Fund also holds a substantial proportion of its 
assets (60%) as corporate bonds, which provide a significant 
hedge against falling bond yields (falling yields which increase 
the DBO will also increase the value of the bond assets). This 
interest rate hedge is further extended by the use of interest 
rate swaps, so that overall the UK Pension Fund liabilities are 
around 40% hedged against falling interest rates on an 
economic value basis. Note that there are some differences in 
the credit quality of bonds held by the UK Pension Fund and 
the bonds analysed to decide the DBO discount rate, such 
that there remains some risk should yields on different quality 
bond/swap assets diverge.
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the DBO is indexed in line with 
price inflation (specifically inflation in the UK Retail Price 
Index) and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities 
(although, in most cases, this is capped at an annual 
increase of 5%).
The UK Pension Fund holds some inflation-linked assets  
which provide a hedge against higher-than-expected inflation 
increases on the DBO. This is augmented by inflation swaps, 
such that overall the UK Pension Fund assets hedge around 
50% of the liability exposure to changes in forward inflation.
Life expectancy The majority of the UK Pension Fund’s obligations are  
to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases  
in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities. 
The UK Pension Fund entered into a longevity swap during 
2013 which provides hedging against the longevity risk of 
increasing life expectancy over the next 79 years for around 
10,000 of the Pension Fund’s current pensioners and covers 
$3.75bn of the Pension Fund’s liabilities. A one year increase 
in life expectancy will result in $269m increase in pension  
fund assets.
Other risks
There are a number of other risks of running the UK Pension Fund including operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits) and 
legislative risks (such as the government increasing the burden on pension through new legislation). 166 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014

Post-retirement scheme deficit
The assets and obligations of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2014, as calculated in accordance with  
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, are shown below. The fair values of the schemes’ assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may 
be subject to significant change before they are realised. The present value of the schemes’ obligations is derived from cash flow projections 
over long periods and is therefore inherently uncertain.

deducted from retained earnings (2013: 99,341 shares, at a cost of $2m; 2012: 55,555 shares, at a cost of $4m).
There are no significant statutory or contractual restrictions on the distribution of current profits of subsidiaries; undistributed profits of prior  
years are, in the main, permanently employed in the businesses of these companies. The undistributed income of AstraZeneca companies 
overseas might be liable to overseas taxes and/or UK taxation (after allowing for double taxation relief) if they were to be distributed as dividends 
(see Note 4).

24 Acquisitions of business operations
2014 Acquisitions
BMS’s share of Global Diabetes Alliance Assets
On 1 February 2014, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMS) interests in the companies’ diabetes alliance.  
The acquisition provides AstraZeneca with 100% ownership of the intellectual property and global rights for the development, manufacture and 
commercialisation of the diabetes business, which includes Onglyza (saxagliptin), Kombiglyze XR (saxagliptin and metformin HCl extended 
release), Komboglyze (saxagliptin and metformin HCl), Farxiga (dapagliflozin, marketed as Forxiga outside the US), Byetta (exenatide), 
Bydureon (exenatide extended release for injectable suspension), Myalept (metreleptin) and Symlin (pramlintide acetate). 
The transaction consolidates worldwide ownership of the diabetes business within AstraZeneca, leveraging its primary and specialty care 
capabilities and its geographical reach, especially in emerging markets. The transaction included the acquisition of 100% of the share  
capital of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and the asset purchase of the additional intellectual property and global rights not already owned  
by AstraZeneca, for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of Onglyza, Kombiglyze XR, Komboglyze and Farxiga, including 
associated BMS employees. This combination of intangible product rights and manufacturing assets with an established workforce and their 
associated operating processes, principally those related to the global manufacturing and selling and marketing operations, requires that the 
acquisition is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. 
Upfront consideration for the acquisition of $2.7bn was paid on 1 February 2014, with further payments of up to $1.4bn being payable for  
future regulatory, launch and sales-related milestones. AstraZeneca has also agreed to pay various sales-related royalty payments up until 2025. 
The amount of royalties payable under the agreement is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, given the direct link to future sales and  
the range of outcomes cannot be reliably estimated. The maximum amount payable in each year is with reference to net sales. AstraZeneca 
also agreed to make payments up to $225m when certain additional assets are transferred. Contingent consideration has been fair valued  
using decision tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success, consideration of potential delays and the expected levels of  
future revenues. In accordance with IFRS 3, the fair value of contingent consideration, including future royalties, is recognised immediately  
as a liability. 
The acquiring entity within the Group was a Swedish krona functional currency subsidiary. Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation  
of the US dollar denominated contingent consideration. To manage this foreign currency risk the contingent consideration liability has been 
designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge of the Group’s underlying US dollar net investments. Exchange differences  
on the retranslation of the contingent consideration liability are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is 
effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.
In addition to the acquired interests, AstraZeneca has entered into certain agreements with BMS to maintain the manufacturing and supply 
chain of the full portfolio of diabetes products. BMS will also continue to deliver specified clinical trials in line with the ongoing clinical trial plan, 
with an agreed number of R&D and manufacturing employees dedicated to diabetes remaining with BMS to progress the diabetes portfolio 
and support the transition for these areas. These arrangements will continue to be carried out over future periods and future payments by 
AstraZeneca to BMS in relation to these arrangements will be expensed as incurred. No amounts have been recognised in the initial acquisition 
accounting in relation to these arrangements but have been separated, at fair value, from the business combination accounting in accordance 
with IFRS 3. 
The terms of the agreement partially reflect settlement of the launch and sales-related milestones under the pre-existing Onglyza and Farxiga 
collaboration agreements, which have been terminated in relation to the acquisition. The expected value of those pre-existing milestones is 
$0.3bn and has been recognised as a separate component of consideration and excluded from the business combination accounting in 
accordance with IFRS 3. Subsequently, these separate intangible assets have been recognised.
Goodwill of $1,530m arising on the transaction is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified. Most 
significant among these are the synergies AstraZeneca expect to be able to generate through more efficient manufacturing processes and the 
incremental value accessible through strategic and operational independence upon taking full control of the alliance. Goodwill of $1.5bn is 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The fair value of receivables acquired as part of the acquisition approximates the gross contractual amounts receivable. There are no 
significant amounts which are not expected to be collected. 
The results from the additional acquired interests in the diabetes alliance have been consolidated into the Company’s results from 1 February 2014, 
which have added revenue of $895m in the period to 31 December 2014. Due to the highly integrated nature of the diabetes alliance, and the 
fact that it is not operated through a separate legal entity, the incremental direct costs associated with the additional acquired interest are not 
separately identifiable and it is impracticable therefore to disclose the profit or loss recognised in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred (1 January 2014), on a pro forma 
basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been $26,174m. As detailed above, it is impracticable to disclose a pro forma 
profit after tax. This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred 
had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2014 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.

24 Acquisitions of business operations continued
Almirall
On 31 October 2014, the Group completed the agreement with Almirall to transfer the rights to Almirall’s respiratory franchise to AstraZeneca.
The transaction provides AstraZeneca with 100% of the rights for the development and commercialisation of Almirall’s existing proprietary 
respiratory business, including rights to revenues from Almirall’s existing partnerships, as well as its pipeline of investigational novel therapies. 
The franchise includes Eklira (aclidinium); Duaklir Genuair, the combination of aclidinium with formoterol which had been filed for registration  
in the EU and is being developed in the US (EU approval received in November 2014); LAS100977 (abediterol), a once daily long-acting 
beta 2-agonist (LABA) in Phase II; an M3 antagonist beta 2-agonist (MABA) platform in pre-clinical development (LAS191351, LAS194871) and 
Phase I (LAS190792); and multiple pre-clinical programmes. Almirall Sofotec, an Almirall subsidiary focused on the development of innovative 
proprietary devices, has also transferred to AstraZeneca. In addition, Almirall employees dedicated to the respiratory business, including 
Almirall Sofotec employees, have transferred to AstraZeneca.
Upfront consideration for the acquisition of $878m was paid in November, with further payments of up to $1.22bn being payable for future 
development, launch, and sales-related milestones. AstraZeneca has also agreed to make various sales-related payments. The amount of 
royalties payable under the agreement is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, given the direct link to future sales and the range of 
outcomes cannot be reliably estimated. The maximum amount payable in each year is with reference to net sales. Contingent consideration has 
been fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success, consideration of potential delays and the 
expected levels of future revenues.
The acquiring entity within the Group was a pounds sterling functional currency subsidiary. Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation 
of the contingent consideration. To manage this foreign currency risk the contingent consideration liability has been designated as the hedge 
instrument in a net investment hedge. Exchange differences on the retranslation of the contingent consideration liability are recognised in 
other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.
Almirall’s pipeline of novel respiratory assets and its device capabilities further strengthen AstraZeneca’s respiratory portfolio, which includes 
Symbicort and Pulmicort, as well as the company’s investigational medicines in development. The addition of aclidinium and the combination 
of aclidinium with formoterol, both in proprietary Genuair device, will allow AstraZeneca to offer patients a choice between dry powder inhaler 
and metered dose inhaler devices across a range of molecules and combinations.
The combination of intangible product rights with an established workforce and their associated operating processes, principally those related 
to the selling and marketing operations, requires that the transaction is accounted for as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3. 
Goodwill of $311m is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified. Most significant among these is the 
premium attributable to the significant competitive advantage associated with AstraZeneca’s complementary portfolio and that attributable to 
a highly skilled workforce. Goodwill of $0.3bn is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Almirall’s respiratory franchise results have been consolidated into the Company’s results from 31 October 2014. For the period from 
acquisition to 31 December 2014, Almirall’s respiratory franchise revenues were $13m. Due to the highly integrated nature of the respiratory 
franchise, and the fact that it is not operated through a separate legal entity, the incremental direct costs associated with the acquired interest 
are not separately identifiable and it is impracticable therefore to disclose the profit or loss recognised in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred (1 January 2014), on a pro forma basis, 
the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been $26,198m. As detailed above, it is impracticable to disclose a pro forma profit 
after tax. This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had 
the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2014 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
Definiens
On 25 November 2014, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Definiens Group. Definiens is a privately-held German company focused  
on imaging and data analysis technology, known as Tissue Phenomics
™
, which dramatically improves the identification of biomarkers in 
tumour tissue.
Definiens technology provides detailed cell-by-cell readouts from target structures on tissue slides and allows the correlation of this 
information with data derived from other sources, generating new knowledge and supporting better decisions in research, diagnostics  
and therapy.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Definiens shares for an upfront consideration of $150m and contingent consideration of up to $150m based 
on reaching three predetermined development milestones. Contingent consideration has been fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key 
inputs including the probability of success and consideration of potential delays.
The acquiring entity within the Group was a pound sterling functional currency subsidiary. Foreign currency risk arises from the retranslation  
of the US dollar denominated contingent consideration. To manage this foreign currency risk the contingent consideration liability has been 
designated as the hedge instrument in a net investment hedge of the Group’s underlying US dollar net investments. Exchange differences  
on the retranslation of the contingent consideration liability are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is 
effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.
Definiens’ results have been consolidated into the Company’s results from 25 November 2014. For the period from acquisition to 
31 December 2014, Definiens’ revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Group’s revenues, and its loss after tax was immaterial. 172 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
24 Acquisitions of business operations continued
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred (1 January 2014), on a pro forma 
basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2014 would have been unchanged and the change in profit after tax would have been 
immaterial. This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred  
had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2014 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.

Pearl Therapeutics
On 27 June 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics. Pearl Therapeutics is based in Redwood City, California,  
and is focused on the development of inhaled small molecule therapeutics for respiratory disease. AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Pearl 
Therapeutics’ shares for an upfront consideration of $569m. In addition, consideration of up to $450m is payable if specified development  
and regulatory milestones in respect of any triple combination therapies and selected future products that AstraZeneca develops using Pearl 
Therapeutics’ technology platform are achieved. Sales-related payments of up to a further $140m are payable if pre-agreed cumulative sales 
thresholds are exceeded. Contingent consideration was fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of 
success and consideration of potential delays.
Goodwill of $44m was recorded for the acquisition and is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified. Most 
significant among these is the synergistic benefit generated by acquiring Pearl Therapeutics’ workforce, whose skills and knowhow are critical 
to the best and most efficient completion of the ongoing development programmes.
Pearl Therapeutics’ results have been consolidated into the Company’s results from 27 June 2013. For the period from acquisition to  
31 December 2013, Pearl Therapeutics’ revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Group’s revenue, and its loss after tax was $49m.
Omthera Pharmaceuticals
On 18 July 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Omthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Omthera is a specialty pharmaceutical company 
based in Princeton, New Jersey, focused on the development and commercialisation of new therapies for abnormal levels of lipids in the 
blood, referred to as dyslipidaemia. 
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Omthera’s shares for an upfront consideration of $323m with up to $120m in future development and approval 
milestones. Contingent consideration was fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success and 
consideration of potential delays.
Omthera’s results have been consolidated into the Company’s results from 18 July 2013. For the period from acquisition to 31 December 
2013, Omthera’s revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Group’s revenue, and its loss after tax was $10m. 
Amplimmune
On 4 October 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Amplimmune, a privately-held, Maryland, US-based biologics company 
focused on developing novel therapeutics in cancer immunology. Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca acquired 100% of 
Amplimmune’s shares for an initial consideration of $225m and deferred consideration of up to $275m based on reaching predetermined 
development milestones. Contingent consideration was fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs including the probability of success 
and consideration of potential delays.
The acquisition bolsters AstraZeneca’s oncology pipeline by obtaining multiple early-stage assets for its immune-mediated cancer therapy 
(IMT-C) portfolio, including AMP-514, an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (MAb). Other Amplimmune assets include 
multiple preclinical molecules targeting the B7 pathways.

24 Acquisitions of business operations continued
Goodwill of $33m arising on the acquisition is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified, but include 
Amplimmune’s very early programmes of potential interest for oncology, immunology and infectious diseases, as well as research tools and 
animal models.
Amplimmune’s results have been consolidated into the Company’s results from 4 October 2013. For the period from acquisition to 
31 December 2013, Amplimmune’s revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Group’s revenue, and its loss after tax was $5m. 
Spirogen
On 15 October 2013, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Spirogen, a privately-held biotech company focused on antibody drug 
conjugate technology for use in oncology. AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Spirogen’s shares for an initial consideration of $200m and deferred 
consideration of up to $240m based on reaching predetermined development milestones. Existing out-licensing agreements and associated 
revenue streams are excluded from this acquisition. Contingent consideration was fair valued using decision tree analysis, with key inputs 
including the probability of success and consideration of potential delays.
AstraZeneca has also entered into a collaboration agreement with ADC Therapeutics to jointly develop two of ADC Therapeutics’ antibody-
drug conjugate programmes in preclinical development. AstraZeneca has also made an equity investment in ADC Therapeutics, which has an 
existing licensing agreement with Spirogen.
Spirogen’s results have been consolidated into the Company’s results from 15 October 2013. For the period from acquisition to 31 December 
2013, Spirogen’s revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Group’s revenue, and its loss after tax was immaterial.

2012 acquisitions
Ardea
On 19 June 2012, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Ardea. Ardea is a US (San Diego, California) based biotechnology company 
focused on the development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases. AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Ardea’s shares 
for cash consideration of $1,268m. The acquisition strengthens our research and development capabilities in the Respiratory, Inflammation and 
Autoimmunity Therapy Area.
In most business acquisitions, there is a part of the cost that is not capable of being attributed in accounting terms to identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired and is therefore recognised as goodwill. In the case of the acquisition of Ardea, this goodwill is underpinned by a number of 
elements, which individually cannot be quantified. Most significant among these is the premium attributable to a highly-skilled workforce and 
established experience in the field of gout. 174 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014

25 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, finance leases, loans, current and non-current 
investments, cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s funding and liquidity 
requirements. The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from  
its operations. 
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit. Each of these  
is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies. These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards, currency options, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps for the 
purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Group may designate certain financial instruments as either fair value hedges 
or net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39. Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only 
instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to 
offset previously purchased options. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity (Note 22), debt (Note 17) and cash (Note 16). For the foreseeable future, the 
Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Group’s strategic objectives through
 > managing funding and liquidity risk
 > optimising shareholder return
 > maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.
The Group utilises factoring arrangements for selected trade receivables. These factoring arrangements qualify for full derecognition of the 
associated trade receivables under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
The Board’s distribution policy comprises a regular cash dividend, and subject to business needs, a share repurchase component. The Board 
regularly reviews its shareholders’ return strategy, and in 2012 decided to suspend share repurchases in order to retain strategic flexibility.
The Group’s net funds position (loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial 
instruments) has decreased from a net funds position of $39m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $3,223m at 31 December 2014, 
primarily as a result of increased outflows from investing activities, including acquisitions.
Liquidity risk
The Board reviews the Group’s ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis. The Board considers 
short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows. The Group manages liquidity risk by 
maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements. Specifically, the Group 
uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by 
raising funds through the capital markets. The Group is assigned short-term credit ratings of P-1 by Moody’s and A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s. 
The Group’s long-term credit rating is A2 stable outlook by Moody’s and AA- negative outlook by Standard and Poor’s.

committed bank facilities of $3bn available to manage liquidity. At 31 December 2014, the Group has issued $2,354m under a Euro Medium 
Term Note programme and $6,895m under a SEC-registered programme. The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group 
and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary. The committed facilities of $3bn 
mature in April 2019 and were undrawn at 31 December 2014.
The maturity profile of the anticipated future contractual cash flows including interest in relation to the Group’s financial liabilities, on an 
undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:

Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of each year 
ended 31 December.
It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts, with the 
exception of $6,899m of contingent consideration held within other payables at fair value (see Note 18). 176 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires 
Board approval. A significant portion of the long-term debt entered into in 2007 in order to finance the acquisition of MedImmune has been held 
at fixed rates of interest. The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
At 31 December 2014, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1.0bn, converting the 7% guaranteed debentures payable 
in 2023 to floating rates and partially converting the 5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 to floating rates. No new interest rate swaps were 
entered into during 2014, 2013 or 2012. At 31 December 2014, swaps with a notional value of $0.75bn were designated in fair value hedge 
relationships and swaps with a notional value of $0.29bn related to debt designated as fair value through profit or loss. Designated hedges are 
expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material. The accounting treatment for fair 
value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 138.
The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds earning floating rates of interest.
The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2014, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012, 
is set out below. In the case of current and non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which 
convert the debt to floating rate.

In addition to the financial assets above, there are $7 ,576m (2013: $7 ,772m; 2012: $7 ,924m) of other current and non-current asset investments and 
other financial assets on which no interest is received. 
Foreign currency risk
The US dollar is the Group’s most significant currency. As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are 
managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational
Approximately 60% of Group external sales in 2014 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of 
manufacturing, and research and development costs were denominated in pound sterling and Swedish krona. Surplus cash generated by 
business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars. As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will 
be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows. The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated 
significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar. Monitoring of 
currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval. 
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment 
hedging. As at 31 December 2014, 5.0% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pound sterling and 16.7% of interest-
bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in euros. Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment 
hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit. 
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit.
In 2012, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert $750m of the 1.95% 2019 maturing bond into fixed Japanese yen debt. During 
2013, the Group entered into an additional cross-currency swap to convert the remaining un-hedged $250m of the 1.95% 2019 maturing bond 
into fixed Japanese yen debt. Both these instruments were designated in net investment hedges against the foreign currency risk of the Group’s 
Japanese yen net assets. In 2014, $125m of the second Japanese yen cross-currency swap was de-designated from the net investment hedge 
in order to maintain hedge effectiveness.
Also in 2013, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert $151m into fixed Chinese renminbi debt maturing in 2018. 
This instrument was designated in a net investment hedge against the foreign currency risk of the Group’s Chinese renminbi net assets. 
Fair value movements on the revaluation of the cross-currency swaps are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the 
hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness would be taken to profit.

Financial Statements
25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
Foreign currency risk arises where the Group has intercompany funding and investments in certain subsidiaries operating in countries with 
exchange controls. The most significant risk in this respect is Venezuela, where the Group has approximately $108m equivalent of local 
currency cash, on which there have been delays in obtaining approval for remittance outside the country. As a result, the Group is exposed  
to a potential income statement devaluation loss on its total intercompany balances with the subsidiary in Venezuela, which amounted to 
approximately $139m as at 31 December 2014. 
For the period to 31 December 2014, the Group used the official exchange rate as published by CENCOEX (the National Foreign Trade Center)  
of VEF 6.3/$. However, effective from 31 December 2014, the Group used the SICAD (Supplementary Foreign Currency Administration System) rate 
of VEF 12/$ for the consolidation of the financial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiaries. The Group believes that the SICAD rate represents the 
most appropriate rate for consolidation as it reflects their best expectation of the rate at which profits will be remitted. Factors such as future 
uncertainty and significant delays experienced in remitting cash at the official rate of 6.3 VEF/$, as well as management actions in dealing with 
the Government to settle a portion of the overdue receivables at the SICAD rate of 12 VEF/$ were taken into account. The 12 VEF/$ exchange 
rate has been used in stating equivalent US dollar exposures above.
Transactional
One hundred percent of the Group’s major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to 
three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies’ reporting currency. 
In addition, the Group’s external dividend, which is paid principally in pound sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to 
payment date. Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit.
Sensitivity analysis 
The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in 
market rates and prices. The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible 
over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date. For 
long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2014, 
with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2014, a 1% increase in 
interest rates would result in an additional $27m in interest expense being incurred per year. The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an 
instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2014, with all other variables held constant. The 
+10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the 
US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the 
table below and each 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.

25 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances (including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents), 
derivative instruments, trade and other receivables. The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 
2023 debentures which are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate  
for the customer. The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately 
owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world. Where appropriate, the Group 
endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. The Group establishes 
an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is 
deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable. When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the 
underlying receivable. 
In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 75% of US sales (2013: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 77%; 
2012: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 73%).

The allowance for impairment has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers. Given the profile of our 
customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables 
not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
Other financial assets
The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the level  
of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash. The majority of excess cash is centralised within the Group 
treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested. This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and 
liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments. Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed 
risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis. The majority of the Group’s cash is invested in US 
dollar AAA-rated liquidity funds, fully collateralised repurchase agreements and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2014 was $5,475m invested in six AAA-rated liquidity funds. The 
liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the AAA rating. No more than 15% of fund 
value is invested within each individual fund. There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had investments of $300m (2013: nil; 2012: nil) in short-term repurchase agreements, which are fully 
collateralised investments. In the event of any default, ownership of the collateral would revert to the Group and would be readily convertible  
to cash. The value of the collateral held at 31 December 2014 was $316m (2013: nil; 2012: nil).
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice. The Group has agreements with some bank 
counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative 
positions above a predetermined threshold. The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2014 was $457m 
(2013: $326m; 2012: $230m).

Severance costs of $254m are not included above (2013: $653m; 2012: $846m).
The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Group’s employee incentive schemes provide competitive and market-
related packages to motivate employees. They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through 
long-term share ownership in the Company. The Group’s current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below; other arrangements 
apply elsewhere.
Bonus plans
The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan
Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual 
performance. Bonuses are paid in cash. The Company also offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares (Ordinary 
Shares). Employees may invest up to £1,800 over a 12 month accumulation period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company with the 
total proceeds at the end of the period. The purchase price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12 month 
period. In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element in respect of Partnership Shares, the first award of which was made in 2011. 
Partnership Shares and Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)-approved All-Employee Share Plan. At the 
Company’s AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme
This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance 
Bonus Plan. Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures. The Remuneration Committee 
has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the 
payment of bonuses inappropriate.
The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan
This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme 
into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years. The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members 
of the SET. Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in March each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.
Sweden
In Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance. Bonuses are paid 50% into 
a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash. The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance 
Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.
US
In the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual 
performance. Annual bonuses are paid in cash. There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 88 participants may be 
eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs. AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market or funded via 
a share trust. The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan operate in respect of relevant 
employees in the US. 180 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014

Share plans 
The charge for share-based payments in respect of share plans is $178m (2013: $156m; 2012: $139m). The plans are equity settled.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan
This plan was approved by shareholders in 2005 for a period of 10 years. Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a close 
period of the Company. The first grant of awards was made in June 2005. The main grant of awards in 2014 under the plan was in March, with 
a further, smaller grant in February. Awards granted under the plan vest after three years and can be subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions. For awards to all participants in 2014, vesting is subject to a combination of measures focused on scientific leadership, revenue 
growth and financial performance. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the 
policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited to 
participate. The grant of awards in March 2014 was the final grant under this plan. The plan has been replaced by the AstraZeneca 2014 
Performance Share Plan. Further details of this plan can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 100.

awards can be granted at any time, but not during a close period of the Company. The first grant of awards was made in May 2014 with further 
grants in August, September and November. Awards granted under the plan vest after three years, or in the case of Executive Directors, after 
a two year holding period, and can be subject to the achievement of performance conditions. For awards to all participants in 2014, vesting is 
subject to a combination of measures focused on scientific leadership, revenue growth and financial performance. The Remuneration 
Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be

The AstraZeneca Investment Plan
This plan was introduced in 2010 and approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM. The main grant of awards in 2014 under the plan was  
in March, with a further, smaller grant in September. Awards granted under the plan vest after eight years and are subject to performance 
conditions measured over a period of between three and eight years. For awards granted in 2014, the performance conditions relate to the 
annual dividend paid to shareholders and dividend cover over a four year performance period. The awards are then subject to a four year 
holding period before they can vest. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting 
the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited  
to participate. Further details of this plan can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report from page 100.

The AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan
This plan was introduced in 2010. The main grant of awards in 2014 under the plan was in March, with a further, smaller grant in August. This 
plan provides for the grant of restricted stock unit (RSU) awards to selected below SET-level employees and is used in conjunction with the 
AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan to provide a mix of RSUs and performance shares. Awards typically vest on the third anniversary of the 
date of grant and are contingent on continued employment with the Company. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing 
any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated.

Guarantees and contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, for which no security has been given, are not expected to result in 
any material financial loss.
Research and development collaboration payments
The Group has various ongoing collaborations, including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners. Such 
collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although 
the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost. The Group recognises research and development milestones as 
intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle. 
Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Group’s long-term revenue 
forecasts for the related product. The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be 
required to make under such collaborations.

Future potential research and development milestone payments 6,920 660 1,110 958 4,192
Future potential revenue milestone payments 4,896 – – 229 4,667
The table includes all potential payments for achievement of milestones under ongoing research and development arrangements. Revenue-
related milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in 
individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales (eg royalty-type payments) which are expensed  
as the associated sale is recognised. The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for the year ended  
31 December 2014.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted. As detailed in 
the Risk section from page 203, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any 
stage in the development process due to a number of factors (including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data 
from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns). The timing of the payments is based on 
the Group’s current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
Environmental costs and liabilities
The Group’s expenditure on environmental protection, including both capital and revenue items, relates to costs that are necessary for 
implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting legal and regulatory requirements for processes and products.
They are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying out the Group’s research, manufacturing and commercial operations and 
are not separated from overall operating and development costs. There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements resulting  
in material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2012, 2013 or 2014.
In addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in investigating and 
cleaning up land and groundwater contamination. In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, 
leased and third party sites.
In the US, Zeneca Inc., and/or its indemnitees, have been named as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) or defendants at approximately  
17 sites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under federal,  
state, statutory or common law environmental liability allocation schemes (together, US Environmental Consequences). Similarly, Stauffer 
Management Company LLC (SMC), which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical Company 
acquired that year, and/or its indemnitees, have been named as PRPs or defendants at 30 sites where SMC is likely to incur US Environmental 
Consequences. AstraZeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the US. These environmental liabilities 
arise from legacy operations that are not currently part of the Group’s business and, at most of these sites, remediation, where required, is 
either completed or nearing completion.
AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance activity 
beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Group’s R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges, where a present 
obligation exists, it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably. With respect to such estimated future costs, 
there were provisions at 31 December 2014 in the aggregate of $84m (2013: $87m; 2012: $88m), mainly relating to the US. Where we are 
jointly liable or otherwise have cost-sharing agreements with third parties, we reflect only our share of the obligation. Where the liability is 
insured in part or in whole by insurance or other arrangements for reimbursement, an asset is recognised to the extent that this recovery is 
virtually certain.

(4) uncertainties in timing of litigation;  
and (5) the possible need for further legal 
proceedings to establish the appropriate 
amount of damages, if any.
While there can be no assurance regarding 
the outcome of any of the legal proceedings 
referred to in this Note 27, based on 
management’s current and considered view 
of each situation, we do not currently expect 
them to have a material adverse effect on  
our financial position. This position could of 
course change over time, not least because  
of the factors referred to above.
In cases that have been settled or 
adjudicated, or where quantifiable fines and 
penalties have been assessed and which are 
not subject to appeal (or other similar forms 
of relief), or where a loss is probable and we 
are able to make a reasonable estimate of the 
loss, we generally indicate the loss absorbed 
or the amount of the provision accrued.
Where it is considered that the Group is more 
likely than not to prevail, legal costs involved 
in defending the claim are charged to profit 
as they are incurred.
Where it is considered that the Group has  
a valid contract which provides the right 
to reimbursement (from insurance or 
otherwise) of legal costs and/or all or part  
of any loss incurred or for which a provision 
has been established, and we consider 
recovery to be virtually certain, the best 
estimate of the amount expected to be 
received is recognised as an asset.
Assessments as to whether or not to 
recognise provisions or assets, and of 
the amounts concerned, usually involve  
a series of complex judgements about  
future events and can rely heavily on 
estimates and assumptions. AstraZeneca 
believes that the provisions recorded are 
adequate based on currently available 
information and that the insurance recoveries 
recorded will be received. However, given  
the inherent uncertainties involved in 
assessing the outcomes of these cases,  
and in estimating the amount of the potential 
losses and the associated insurance 
recoveries, we could in the future incur 
judgments or insurance settlements that 
could have a material adverse effect on  
our results in any particular period.
IP claims include challenges to the Group’s 
patents on various products or processes 
and assertions of non-infringement of 
patents. A loss in any of these cases could 
result in loss of patent protection on the 
related product. The consequences of any 
such loss could be a significant decrease in 
product sales, which could have a material 
adverse effect on our results. The lawsuits 
filed by AstraZeneca for patent infringement 
against companies that have filed ANDAs in 
the US, seeking to market generic forms of 
products sold by the Group prior to the expiry 
of the applicable patents covering these 
27 Commitments and contingent 
liabilities continued
It is possible that AstraZeneca could incur 
future environmental costs beyond the extent 
of our current provisions. The extent of such 
possible additional costs is inherently difficult 
to estimate due to a number of factors, 
including: (1) the nature and extent of claims 
that may be asserted in the future; (2) whether 
AstraZeneca has or will have any legal 
obligation with respect to asserted or 
unasserted claims; (3) the type of remedial 
action, if any, that may be selected at sites 
where the remedy is presently not known; (4) 
the potential for recoveries from or allocation  
of liability to third parties; and (5) the length  
of time that the environmental investigation, 
remediation and liability allocation process can 
take. Notwithstanding and subject to the 
foregoing, we estimate the potential additional 
loss for future environmental investigation, 
remediation, remedial operation and 
maintenance activity above and beyond our 
provisions to be, in aggregate, between 
$50m and $80m (2013: $50m and $90m; 
2012: $50m and $90m), which relates solely 
to the US.
Legal proceedings
AstraZeneca is involved in various legal 
proceedings considered typical to its 
business, including actual or threatened 
litigation and/or actual or potential 
government investigations relating to 
employment matters, product liability, 
commercial disputes, pricing, sales and 
marketing practices, infringement of IP  
rights, the validity of certain patents and 
competition laws. The more significant 
matters are discussed below.
Most of the claims involve highly complex 
issues. Often these issues are subject to 
substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the 
probability of a loss, if any, being sustained 
and an estimate of the amount of any loss is 
difficult to ascertain. Consequently, for a 
majority of these claims, it is not possible to 
make a reasonable estimate of the expected 
financial effect, if any, that will result from 
ultimate resolution of the proceedings. 
In these cases, AstraZeneca discloses 
information with respect to the nature and 
facts of the cases.
With respect to each of the legal proceedings 
described below, other than those for which 
provision has been made, we are unable to 
make estimates of the possible loss or range 
of possible losses at this stage, other than  
as set forth in this section. We also do not 
believe that disclosure of the amount sought 
by plaintiffs, if known, would be meaningful 
with respect to those legal proceedings. This 
is due to a number of factors, including (1) the 
stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial 
dates have not been set) and the overall 
length and extent of pre-trial discovery; (2) the 
entitlement of the parties to an action to 
appeal a decision; (3) clarity as to theories of 
liability, damages and governing law; 
products, typically also involve allegations of 
non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability 
of these patents by the ANDA filers. In the 
event that the Group is unsuccessful in these 
actions or the statutory 30-month stay 
expires before a ruling is obtained, the ANDA 
filers involved will also have the ability, subject 
to FDA approval, to introduce generic 
versions of the product concerned.
AstraZeneca has full confidence in, and will 
vigorously defend and enforce, its IP.
Over the course of the past several years, 
including in 2014, a significant number 
of commercial litigation claims in which 
AstraZeneca is involved have been resolved, 
particularly in the US, thereby reducing 
potential contingent liability exposure arising 
from such litigation. Similarly, in part due to 
patent litigation and settlement developments, 
greater certainty has been achieved 
regarding possible generic entry dates with 
respect to some of our patented products.  
At the same time, like other companies in the 
pharmaceutical sector and other industries, 
AstraZeneca continues to be subject to 
government investigations around the world.
Patent litigation
Byetta (exenatide)
US patent litigation 
In October 2014, AstraZeneca received 
a Paragraph IV notice from Teva 
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva). Teva is 
seeking FDA approval to market a generic 
version of Byetta prior to the expiration of 
certain AstraZeneca patents listed in the  
FDA Orange Book with reference to Byetta.  
In December 2014, AstraZeneca commenced 
patent litigation against Teva in the US  
District Court for the District of Delaware. 
AstraZeneca is asserting several patents.  
In January 2015, Teva filed a complaint in  
the same court for declaratory judgment  
that its proposed generic version of Byetta 
would not infringe US Patent Nos. 7,297,761 
and 7,741,269. 
Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium) 
US patent litigation
AstraZeneca is defending three patent 
infringement lawsuits in the US District Court 
for the District of South Carolina which, 
among other things, claim that AstraZeneca’s 
Crestor sales induce infringement of the 
plaintiffs’ patents. The first was filed in April 
2011 by plaintiff Palmetto Pharmaceuticals, 
LLC, and the other two, which have been 
consolidated together, were filed in July and 
December 2013 by co-plaintiffs Medical 
University of South Carolina Foundation for 
Research Development and Charleston 
Medical Therapeutics, Inc.
Patent proceedings outside the US 
AstraZeneca is engaged in proceedings in 
Australia, Brazil, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, 
Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, South 
Africa and Taiwan regarding patent and/or 
regulatory exclusivity for Crestor. AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 184
commenced separate patent infringement 
litigation against Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc. 
and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc.  
in the US District Court for the District of  
New Jersey. 
In October 2014 and subsequently, 
AstraZeneca received Paragraph IV notice 
letters from companies seeking to market 
generic versions of Nexium 24HR (OTC) 
20mg delayed-release capsules. In response 
to the notice letters and corresponding ANDA 
filings, AstraZeneca commenced separate 
patent infringement litigation against Actavis 
Laboratories FL, Inc., Andrx Labs, LLC and 
Perrigo Company PLC in the US District 
Court for the District of New Jersey. 
Patent proceedings outside the US 
In the UK, in 2010, AstraZeneca initiated 
patent infringement proceedings against 
Consilient Health Limited and Krka, d.d.  
Novo Mesto (Consilient/Krka). Consilient/Krka 
had previously agreed not to launch their 
esomeprazole magnesium product pending 
the outcome of patent infringement 
proceedings. This injunction was discharged  
in July 2011. In March 2014, in proceedings 
initiated by Consilient/Krka, the High Court 
awarded Consilient/Krka £27m in damages. 
AstraZeneca has appealed. A provision has 
been taken.
In Canada, in October 2012, the Federal 
Court prohibited Pharmascience Inc. (PMS) 
from receiving a marketing authorisation for 
its esomeprazole magnesium product until 
May 2018. PMS appealed. On 22 May 2014, 
the Federal Court of Appeal reversed the 
decision of the lower court. PMS has now 
received its marketing authorisation.
In Canada, patent infringement proceedings 
against Apotex Inc. continue. In July 2014, the 
Federal Court found Canadian Patent No. 
2,139,653 invalid. AstraZeneca has appealed. 
In Canada, in July 2014, AstraZeneca 
received a Notice of Allegation from Teva 
Canada Limited (Teva) alleging either that 
Teva’s esomeprazole magnesium product 
would not infringe the patents listed on the 
Canadian Patent Register in relation to 
Nexium or, alternatively, that certain of the 
patents were invalid. AstraZeneca has 
commenced an application in response.
Onglyza (saxagliptin) and Kombiglyze XR 
(saxagliptin and metformin) 
US patent litigation 
Beginning April 2014, a number of generics 
companies sent notices that they had 
submitted ANDAs for saxagliptin 
hydrochloride 2.5mg and 5mg tablets 
containing a Paragraph IV Certification 
alleging that US Patent Nos. 7,951,400 and 
RE44,186, listed in the FDA Orange Book  
with reference to Onglyza, are invalid, 
unenforceable and/or will not be infringed  
by the products as described in the ANDAs. 
Several of these companies also sent notices 
that they had submitted ANDAs for

Faslodex prior to the expiration of the 
same four patents, and AstraZeneca filed 
a patent infringement lawsuit against 
Glenmark in the US District Court in New 
Jersey. The lawsuits remain pending. 
Patent proceedings outside the US
In 2008, the Opposition Division of the 
European Patent Office (EPO) maintained  
a Faslodex formulation patent, EP1250138, 
following an opposition against the grant of 
this patent by Gedeon Richter Plc, which 
appealed this decision. The Board of  
Appeal of the EPO called the parties to oral 
proceedings in March 2014 and decided  
to remit the case back to the Opposition 
Division for further consideration.
In Brazil, in January 2013, AstraZeneca 
instituted proceedings against Eurofarma 
Laboratorios S.A. (Eurofarma) asserting 
infringement of a formulation patent for 
Faslodex. In May 2013, Eurofarma was  
found to infringe the patent. Eurofarma 
appealed and legal proceedings are in 
progress. In February 2013, Eurofarma 
separately filed nullity actions against the 
formulation patent in the 31st Specialized 
Intellectual Property Federal Court of Rio  
de Janeiro and, in April 2013, at the Brazilian 
Patent Office (BPO). The BPO proceedings 
have been suspended, but the Federal  
Court proceedings remain pending.
Losec/Prilosec (omeprazole) 
US patent litigation
In 2008, Apotex Inc. (Apotex) was found 
to infringe AstraZeneca’s US Patent 
Nos. 4,786,505 and 4,853,230. In 2013, the 
US District Court for the Southern District of 
New York ordered Apotex to pay $76m in 
damages with an additional sum of $28m  
in pre-judgment interest, and an unspecified 
amount of post-judgment damages.  
Apotex appealed.
Patent proceedings outside the US
In Canada, the AstraZeneca infringement 
proceeding against Apotex Inc. remains 
pending.
Moventig (naloxegol)
Patent proceedings outside the US
In October 2014, in Europe, Generics UK 
(trading as Mylan) filed an opposition to 
the grant of EP1694363 (a Moventig new 
chemical entity patent). AstraZeneca is 
licensed under this patent by virtue of 
the 2009 licence agreement with Nektar 
Therapeutics. The European Patent Office 
has now invited the patent holder to file 
a response to the Statement of Grounds 
of Opposition.
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium)
US patent litigation
In 2014, AstraZeneca received Paragraph  
IV notice letters from companies seeking  
to market esomeprazole magnesium 20mg 
and 40mg delayed-release capsules. In 
response to these notice letters and 
corresponding ANDA filings, AstraZeneca 
Generic drug manufacturers have 
commenced sales of generic rosuvastatin 
drug products in many jurisdictions where  
a substance patent is not in force.
In March 2014, in the Netherlands, 
AstraZeneca received a letter from Resolution 
Chemicals Ltd. (Resolution) indicating that  
it had sought marketing authorisation for a 
rosuvastatin zinc product in the Netherlands. 
In April 2014, AstraZeneca received a writ of 
summons from Resolution alleging partial 
invalidity and non-infringement of the 
supplementary protection certificate related 
to the Crestor substance patent. A hearing  
is scheduled for 6 February 2015.
In April 2014, in Japan, Shionogi & Co., Ltd., 
the licensor of the Crestor patent, received 
confirmation of a request for trial for patent 
invalidation in the Japanese Patent Office. 
The request was initiated by Teva Pharma 
Japan Inc. and relates to the Crestor 
substance patent. A hearing is scheduled  
for 25 February 2015.
In Australia, in 2011 and 2012, AstraZeneca 
instituted proceedings against Actavis 
Australia Pty Ltd, Apotex Pty Ltd and Watson 
Pharma Pty Ltd. asserting infringement of 
various formulation and method patents for 
Crestor. In March 2013, the Federal Court of 
Australia held all three patents at issue invalid. 
AstraZeneca appealed in relation to two 
patents. In August 2014, the Full Court of the 
Federal Court of Australia held the two patents 
invalid. AstraZeneca has sought leave to 
appeal to the High Court in relation to one 
method patent.
Epanova (omega-3-carboxylic acids) 
US patent litigation 
In March 2014 and subsequently, 
AstraZeneca received complaints from 
Amarin Pharmaceuticals Ireland Ltd (Amarin) 
alleging that AstraZeneca’s Epanova product 
infringes Amarin’s US Patent No. 8,663,662.  
In November 2014, the US District Court for 
the District of Delaware dismissed Amarin’s 
complaints. Amarin may file a complaint  
at a later date.
Faslodex (fulvestrant)
US patent litigation 
In June and September 2014, AstraZeneca 
filed patent infringement lawsuits against 
Sandoz Inc. and Sandoz International GmbH, 
and Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the US 
District Court in New Jersey relating to four 
patents listed in the FDA Orange Book with 
reference to Faslodex, after those companies 
sent Paragraph IV notices that they are 
seeking FDA approval to market generic 
versions of Faslodex prior to the expiration of 
AstraZeneca’s patents. In January 2015, 
AstraZeneca received a Paragraph IV  
notice from Glenmark Generics, Inc. USA 
(Glenmark), which is also seeking FDA 
approval to market a generic version of

co-ordination judge dismissed the claims 
of the 492 non-California plaintiffs whose 
claims were in the co-ordinated proceeding. 
Plaintiffs have appealed the October 2014

Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) 
AstraZeneca has been defending product 
liability lawsuits brought by approximately 
1,900 plaintiffs who alleged that Nexium 
caused osteoporotic injuries, such as bone 
deterioration, loss of bone density and/or 
bone fractures, and approximately 1,700 of 
these plaintiffs’ claims were consolidated for 
pre-trial proceedings in the US District Court 
for the Central District of California (the Court) 
through the multi-district litigation (MDL) 
process. Between November 2013 and 
September 2014, the Court dismissed 
approximately 1,440 plaintiffs’ claims. 
In October 2014, the Court granted 
AstraZeneca’s motion for summary judgment 
as to all of the claims that remained pending 
in the MDL and entered judgment in 
AstraZeneca’s favour as to all pending MDL 
claims. Approximately 270 plaintiffs have 
appealed this judgment to the 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals. In addition, fewer than  
40 plaintiffs’ claims remain active and 
pending in California state courts.
Onlgyza (saxagliptin)
Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, and/or 
AstraZeneca are among multiple defendants  
in various lawsuits filed in federal and state 
courts in the US involving a total of nine 
plaintiffs claiming physical injury from 
treatment with Onglyza. The lawsuits allege 
injuries including pancreatic cancer. 
Seroquel IR (quetiapine fumarate) and 
Seroquel XR (quetiapine fumarate)
With regard to the Seroquel IR product 
liability litigation in the US, AstraZeneca 
is currently defending two cases in active 
litigation, each involving a single plaintiff.
With regard to insurance coverage for 
the substantial legal defence costs and 
settlements that have been incurred in 
connection with the Seroquel IR product 
liability claims in the US related to alleged 
diabetes and/or other related alleged injuries 
(which now exceed the total amount of 
insurance coverage available), disputes 
continue with two insurers about the

saxagliptin hydrochloride and metformin 
2.5mg/1000mg, 5mg/1000mg, and 
5mg/500mg tablets containing a Paragraph 
IV Certification alleging that US Patent Nos. 
8,628,799, 7,951,400 and/or RE44,186, listed 
in the FDA Orange Book with reference to 
Kombiglyze XR, are invalid, unenforceable 
and/or will not be infringed by the products  
as described in the ANDAs. AstraZeneca 
initiated patent infringement proceedings in 
the US Federal Court in Delaware against all 
of the above-referenced patent challenges.
The District Court denied Mylan 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (Mylan) motion 
to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and 
subsequently certified the issue for 
interlocutory review. Mylan filed a petition with 
the Federal Circuit to accept the appeal, and 
AstraZeneca has opposed that petition. 
AstraZeneca also filed a protective lawsuit 
against Mylan in the US District Court for the 
District of West Virginia, which has been 
stayed pending the outcome of Mylan’s 
motion to dismiss the Delaware action.
Pulmicort Respules (budesonide 
inhalation suspension)
US patent litigation 
In December 2013, the US District Court  
for the District of New Jersey temporarily 
enjoined the generic defendants from 
entering the market until resolution of 
AstraZeneca’s motion for a preliminary 
injunction. In October 2014, the Court 
commenced a hearing on the preliminary 
injunction motion as well as a trial on the 
merits in respect of US Patent No. 7 ,524,834. 
Closing arguments were submitted in 
January 2015. A decision is awaited. 
Seroquel XR (quetiapine fumarate) 
US patent litigation 
In September and October 2014, 
AstraZeneca received Paragraph IV notices 
from Pharmadax, Inc. and Pharmadax USA, 
Inc. (together, Pharmadax) alleging that 
the patent listed in the FDA Orange Book  
with reference to Seroquel XR is invalid, 
unenforceable and/or is not infringed by  
the Pharmadax proposed generic product. 
Pharmadax has submitted an ANDA seeking 
to market quetiapine fumarate 50mg,  
150mg, 200mg, 300mg and 400mg tablets. 
In October and November 2014, AstraZeneca 
filed patent infringement lawsuits against 
Pharmadax in the US District Court for the 
District of New Jersey. In October 2014, 
AstraZeneca also filed a similar patent 
infringement suit in the US District Court for 
the Central District of California Southern 
Division, which was subsequently dismissed 
by the Court with AstraZeneca’s consent.
Patent proceedings outside the US
In Germany, Ratiopharm GmbH, CT 
Arzneimittel GmbH and AbZ Pharma GmbH 
are seeking damages relating to the 
preliminary injunction issued in April 2012  
that prevented generic Seroquel XR sales  
by those entities. The injunction was 
subsequently lifted following the November 
2012 Federal Patent Court (the Federal Court) 
decision that held that the Seroquel XR 
patent was invalid. In January 2015, 
the Federal Court of Justice denied 
AstraZeneca’s appeal of the November  
2012 Federal Court decision. 
In Romania, in March 2014, AstraZeneca 
settled patent litigation with Teva 
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Teva 
Pharmaceuticals S.R.L.
In the Netherlands, in June 2014, the Dutch 
Court of Appeal in The Hague reversed the 
March 2012 opinion of the Commercial  
Court and found the Seroquel XR formulation 
patent invalid. 
Vimovo (naproxen/
esomeprazole magnesium)
US patent litigation
In the US District Court for the District of  
New Jersey, patent infringement actions are 
ongoing against generic challengers seeking 
approval to market generic copies of Vimovo 
prior to expiry of AstraZeneca’s patents listed 
in the FDA Orange Book. 
Zestril (lisinopril dihydrate) 
Patent proceedings outside the US
In Canada, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., 
Inc., Merck Frosst Canada & Co., and Merck 
Frosst Canada Ltd. (Merck) sued Apotex Inc. 
(Apotex) for infringement of Merck’s patent 
no. 1,275,350. In 2006, Apotex was found to 
infringe the patent. AstraZeneca and Merck 
commenced a reference to determine the 
quantum of damages. In December 2014 the 
parties settled the reference.
Product liability litigation
Byetta/Bydureon (exenatide) 
Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, and/or 
AstraZeneca are among multiple defendants  
in various lawsuits filed in federal and state 
courts in the US involving approximately  
1,474 plaintiffs claiming physical injury from 
treatment with Byetta and/or Bydureon. The 
lawsuits allege multiple types of injuries 
including pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer and 
thyroid cancer. A multi-district litigation has 
been established in the US District Court for 
the Southern District of California in regard  
to the alleged pancreatic cancer cases 
in federal courts. Further, a co-ordinated 
proceeding has been established in Los 
Angeles, California in regard to the various 
lawsuits in California state courts.
Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium)
AstraZeneca is defending a number of lawsuits 
alleging multiple types of injuries caused by 
the use of Crestor, including diabetes mellitus, 
various cardiac injuries, rhabdomyolysis, and/
or liver and kidney injuries. The claims of 594 
plaintiffs, comprising 102 California residents 
and 492 non-California residents, were 
aggregated in one co-ordinated proceeding   AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 186
Settlement anti-trust litigation
AstraZeneca is a defendant in a multi-district 
litigation class action and individual lawsuits 
alleging that AstraZeneca’s settlements of 
certain patent litigation in the US relating 
to Nexium violated US anti-trust law and 
various state laws. A trial in the US District 
Court for the District of Massachusetts 
commenced on 20 October 2014 on certain 
liability issues for claims that remain in the 
case. On 5 December 2014, a jury returned  
a verdict in favour of AstraZeneca. On 31 
December 2014, the plaintiffs filed motions 
for a new trial. On 7 January 2015, the 
plaintiffs filed motions for a permanent 
injunction. AstraZeneca opposed those 
motions. A hearing on the plaintiffs’ motions 
for a permanent injunction is scheduled  
for 6 February 2015. 
On 10 December 2014, following the 
favourable jury verdict, AstraZeneca filed 
a motion requesting dismissal of its appeal  
of the District Court’s procedural decision to 
certify a class of end payers. On 21 January 
2015, the Court of Appeals denied 
AstraZeneca’s request to dismiss the appeal 
and issued a decision affirming the District 
Court’s class certification ruling. 
The two lawsuits filed in Pennsylvania state 
court by various indirect purchasers of 
Nexium are pending. The cases are in their 
initial stages.
Seroquel  IR (quetiapine fumarate) and 
Seroquel XR (quetiapine fumarate) 
In relation to the state law claims brought by 
state Attorneys General generally alleging that 
AstraZeneca made false and/or misleading 
statements in marketing and promoting 
Seroquel, AstraZeneca remains in litigation 
with the Attorney General of Mississippi.
Qui tam litigation 
In April 2014, AstraZeneca was served with  
a lawsuit filed in the US District Court for  
the District of Delaware under the qui tam 
(whistleblower) provisions of the federal False 
Claims Act and related state statutes, alleging 
that AstraZeneca directed certain employees 
to promote Seroquel off-label and provided 
unlawful remuneration to physicians. The 
DOJ and all US states have declined to 
intervene in the lawsuit.
Texas Attorney General litigation
In October 2014, following a previously 
disclosed investigation by the State of Texas 
into AstraZeneca’s sales and marketing 
activities involving Seroquel, the Texas 
Attorney General’s Office intervened in a  
state whistleblower action pending in Travis 
County Court, Texas. The lawsuit alleges  
that AstraZeneca engaged in inappropriate 
promotion of Seroquel and made improper 
payments intended to influence the formulary 
status of Seroquel. 
Synagis (palivizumab) 
In September 2011, MedImmune filed 
an action against AbbVie, Inc. (AbbVie) 
(formerly Abbott International, LLC) in the 
Circuit Court for Montgomery County, 
Maryland, seeking a declaratory judgment  
in a contract dispute. AbbVie’s motion to 
dismiss was granted. In September 2011, 
AbbVie filed a parallel action against 
MedImmune in the Illinois State Court,  
where the case is currently pending. 
Other commercial litigation
Average Manufacturer’s Price qui tam 
litigation (Streck)
AstraZeneca is one of several manufacturers 
named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the 
US Federal Court in Philadelphia under the 
qui tam (whistleblower) provisions of the 
federal and certain state False Claims Acts 
alleging inaccurate reporting of Average 
Manufacturer’s prices to the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services. The action 
was initially filed in October 2008 but 
remained under seal until May 201 1, following 
the US Government’s decision not to 
intervene in the case with regard to certain 
manufacturers, including AstraZeneca. 
A provision has been taken.
Average Wholesale Price (AWP) litigation 
AstraZeneca and other pharmaceutical 
manufacturers were named as defendants in 
litigation involving allegations that, by causing 
the publication of allegedly inflated wholesale 
list prices, defendants caused entities to 
overpay for prescription drugs. In March 
2014, AstraZeneca reached a settlement  
with the State of Utah and, in April 2014, 
AstraZeneca reached a settlement with the 
State of Wisconsin. With these settlements, 
AstraZeneca has brought the AWP litigation 
to a conclusion.
Medco qui tam litigation (Schumann) 
AstraZeneca was named as a defendant  
in a lawsuit filed in the Federal Court in 
Philadelphia (the Court) under the qui tam 
(whistleblower) provisions of the federal  
and certain state False Claims Acts  
alleging overpayments by federal and 
state governments resulting from alleged 
false pricing information reported to the 
government and alleged improper payments 
intended to influence the formulary status  
of Prilosec and Nexium to Medco and its 
customers. In January 2013, the Court 
granted AstraZeneca’s motion and dismissed 
the case with prejudice. The plaintiff 
appealed. In October 2014, the US Court  
of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the 
lower court’s decision to dismiss AstraZeneca 
from the litigation with prejudice.
Government investigations/proceedings 
Except as otherwise noted, the precise 
parameters of the following inquiries are 
unknown, and AstraZeneca is not in a 
position at this time to predict the scope, 
duration or outcome of these matters, 
AstraZeneca has not recognised an 
insurance receivable in respect of these  
legal actions.
Commercial litigation 
Crestor (rosuvastatin calcium) 
Qui tam litigation 
In January and February 2014, AstraZeneca 
was served with lawsuits filed in the US 
District Court for the District of Delaware 
under the qui tam (whistleblower) provisions 
of the federal False Claims Act and related 
state statutes, alleging that AstraZeneca 
directed certain employees to promote 
Crestor off-label and provided unlawful 
remuneration to physicians in connection  
with the promotion of Crestor. The DOJ and 
all US states have declined to intervene  
in the lawsuits.
Texas Attorney General litigation
In January 2015, following a previously 
disclosed investigation by the State of Texas 
into AstraZeneca’s sales and marketing 
activities involving Crestor, AstraZeneca was 
served with a lawsuit in which the Texas 
Attorney General’s Office intervened in a  
state whistleblower action pending in Travis 
County Court, Texas. The lawsuit alleges  
that AstraZeneca engaged in inappropriate 
promotion of Crestor and improperly 
influenced the formulary status of Crestor. 
Israel
In November 2012, a Motion to Certify 
a Claim as a Class Action and Statement 
of Claim were filed in Israel in the District 
Court in Tel Aviv, Jaffa, against AstraZeneca 
and four other pharmaceutical companies  
for alleged deception and failure to disclose 
material facts to consumers regarding 
potential adverse events associated with 
certain drugs, including Crestor . In July 2013, 
an amended Motion to Certify a Claim as 
a Class Action and Statement of Claim 
containing similar allegations to those in 
the first action were filed in the same court 
against the same defendants. The court has 
not yet ruled on the Motion to Certify. 
Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) 
Consumer litigation 
AstraZeneca is a defendant in a class action 
filed in Delaware State Court alleging that 
AstraZeneca’s promotion, advertising and 
pricing of Nexium to physicians, consumers 
and third party payers was unfair, unlawful 
and deceptive. The action, which is the  
last of a number of lawsuits previously 
resolved, was stayed until 6 February 2014. 
On 9 January 2015, AstraZeneca filed a 
motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim 
and, in the alternative, a motion to strike 
certain allegations.

internal controls, certain distributors and 
interactions with healthcare providers and 
other government officials in several 
countries. AstraZeneca is co-operating with 
these inquiries. AstraZeneca’s investigation 
has involved indications of inappropriate 
conduct in certain countries, including China. 
Resolution of this matter could involve the 
payment of fines and/or other remedies.
Good Manufacturing Practices subpoena 
In March 2013, AstraZeneca received 
a subpoena duces tecum from the US 
Attorney’s Office in Boston seeking 
documents and information relating to 
products manufactured or packaged at 
AstraZeneca’s Macclesfield facility in the UK. 
AstraZeneca is co-operating with this inquiry.
Medco
The US Attorney’s Office for the District of 
Delaware, Criminal Division, conducted 
an investigation relating to AstraZeneca’s 
relationship with Medco and sales of Nexium, 
Plendil, Prilosec, and Toprol-XL. In addition, 
the US Attorney’s Office for the District of 
Delaware and the DOJ investigated potential 
civil claims relating to the same conduct. This 
matter has been resolved and a provision 
was previously taken.
Additional government inquiries
As is true for most, if not all, major 
prescription pharmaceutical companies 
operating in the US, AstraZeneca is currently 
involved in multiple US federal and state 
inquiries into drug marketing and pricing 
practices. In addition to the investigations 
described above, various federal and state 
law enforcement offices have, from time to 
time, requested information from the Group. 
There have been no material developments  
in those matters.
Tax
Where tax exposures can be quantified,  
an accrual is made based on best estimates 
and management’s judgement. Details  
of the movements in relation to material tax 
exposures are discussed below. As accruals 
can be built up over a long period of time  
but the ultimate resolution of tax exposures 
usually occurs at a point in time, and given 
the inherent uncertainties in assessing 
the outcomes of these exposures (which 
sometimes can be binary in nature), we 
could, in future periods, experience 
adjustments to these accruals that have  
a material positive or negative effect on  
our results in any particular period.
Transfer pricing and other international tax 
contingencies
The total net accrual included in the Group 
Financial Statements to cover the worldwide 
exposure to transfer pricing audits is $595m, 
an increase of $72m compared to 2013. 
AstraZeneca faces a number of transfer 
pricing audits in jurisdictions around the world 
and, in some cases, is in dispute with the tax 
authorities. The issues under discussion are 
often complex and can require many years  
to resolve. Accruals for tax contingencies 
require management to make estimates and 
judgements with respect to the ultimate 
outcome of a tax audit, and actual results 
could vary from these estimates. The 
international tax environment presents 
increasingly challenging dynamics for the 
resolution of transfer pricing disputes. These 
disputes usually result in taxable profits being 
increased in one territory and correspondingly 
decreased in another. Our balance sheet 
positions for these matters reflect appropriate 
corresponding relief in the territories affected. 
Management considers that at present such 
corresponding relief will be available, but 
given the challenges in the international tax 
environment will keep this aspect under 
careful review.
Management continues to believe that 
AstraZeneca’s positions on all its transfer 
pricing audits and disputes are robust and 
that AstraZeneca is appropriately provided.
For transfer pricing audits where AstraZeneca 
and the tax authorities are in dispute, 
AstraZeneca estimates the potential for 
reasonably possible additional losses above 
and beyond the amount provided to be up  
to $521m (2013: $529m; 2012: $522m), 
however, management believes that it is 
unlikely that these additional losses will  
arise. It is possible that some of these 
contingencies may reduce in the future to  
the extent that any tax authority challenge  
is unsuccessful, or matters lapse following 
expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation 
resulting in a reduction in the tax charge in 
future periods.
Other tax contingencies
Included in the tax accrual is $1,680m relating 
to a number of other tax contingencies, a 
reduction of $373m mainly due to releases 
following expiry of statute of limitations and 
exchange rate effects offset by the impact of 
an additional year of transactions relating to 
contingencies for which accruals had already 
been established. For these tax exposures, 
AstraZeneca does not expect material 
additional losses. It is, however, possible that 
some of these contingencies may reduce in 
the future if any tax authority challenge is 
unsuccessful or matters lapse following 
expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation 
resulting in a reduction in the tax charge in 
future periods.
Timing of cash flows and interest 
It is not possible to estimate the timing of  
tax cash flows in relation to each outcome, 
however, it is anticipated that a number of 
significant disputes may be resolved over  
the next one to two years. Included in the 
provision is an amount of interest of $227m 
(2013: $344m; 2012: $248m). Interest is 
accrued as a tax expense.
including whether they will result in any 
liability to AstraZeneca.
Brilinta (ticagrelor) 
In October 2013, AstraZeneca received a civil 
investigative demand from the DOJ, Civil 
Division seeking documents and information 
regarding PLATO, a clinical trial about Brilinta. 
In August 2014, AstraZeneca announced that 
it had received confirmation from the DOJ that 
it was closing its investigation. AstraZeneca 
understands that the US Government is not 
planning any further action.
Crestor (rosuvastatin Calcium) 
The DOJ and all US states have declined to 
intervene in the civil component of a 
previously disclosed investigation regarding 
Crestor. Additional components of the 
investigation by the DOJ continue.
Synagis (palivizumab) 
In June 2011, MedImmune received a 
demand from the US Attorney’s Office for  
the Southern District of New York requesting 
certain documents related to the sales and 
marketing activities of Synagis. In July 2011, 
MedImmune received a similar court order  
to produce documents from the Office of the 
Attorney General for the State of New York 
Medicaid and Fraud Control Unit pursuant to 
what the government attorneys advised was a 
joint investigation. MedImmune has accepted 
receipt of these requests and is co-ordinating 
with the government offices to provide the 
appropriate responses and co-operate with 
any related investigation.
In May 2012, MedImmune received a 
subpoena duces tecum from the Office of 
Attorney General for the State of Florida 
Medicaid and Fraud Control Unit requesting 
certain documents related to the sales and 
marketing activities of Synagis. MedImmune 
has accepted receipt of the request and has 
co-ordinated with the Florida government 
to provide the appropriate responses and 
co-operated with any related investigation. 
AstraZeneca is unaware of the nature or 
focus of the investigation, however, based on 
the nature of the requests, it appears to be 
similar to the inquiries from the State of New 
York and DOJ (which is described above).
Other government  
investigations/proceedings 
Dutch National Competition 
Authority investigation 
In December 2014, the Dutch National 
Competition Authority, the ACM, issued its 
decision that AstraZeneca had not abused  
a dominant position with respect to Nexium.  
It has now closed its file.

agreement, Aegerion have paid AstraZeneca $325m to acquire the global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialise Myalept, subject 
to an existing distributor licence with Shionogi covering Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The transaction did not include the transfer of any 
AstraZeneca employees or facilities. At 31 December 2014, the Group’s balance sheet included $126m of intangible assets associated with 
Myalept, which were disposed of in this transaction.

Basis of accounting
The Company Financial Statements are 
prepared under the historical cost convention  
in accordance with the Companies Act  
2006 and UK GAAP. The Group Financial 
Statements are presented on pages 134 to 
189 and have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as 
issued by the IASB and in accordance with 
the Group Accounting Policies set out on 
pages 138 to 142.
The following paragraphs describe the main 
accounting policies under UK GAAP, which 
have been applied consistently.
Accounting standards issued but not yet 
adopted
FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ 
and FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the UK and the 
Republic of Ireland’ have been issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council and are effective 
for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2015. The Company intends to 
adopt FRS 101 as the basis for preparation  
of its Company-only financial statements for 
the year ended 31 December 2015 and will,  
in accordance with the FRC’s reduced 
disclosure framework, provide an opportunity 
for shareholders to serve objections to the 
Company’s proposal.
Foreign currencies
Profit and loss account items in foreign 
currencies are translated into US dollars at 
average rates for the relevant accounting 
periods. Assets and liabilities are translated  
at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the 
Company Balance Sheet. Exchange gains 
and losses on loans and on short-term 
foreign currency borrowings and deposits  
are included within net interest payable. 
Exchange differences on all other 
transactions, except relevant foreign currency 
loans, are taken to operating profit.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the result 
for the year and takes into account taxation 
deferred because of timing differences 
between the treatment of certain items 
for taxation and for accounting purposes.  
Full provision is made for the effects of  
these differences. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised where it is more likely than not 
that the amount will be realised in the future. 
These estimates require judgements to 
be made including the forecast of future 
taxable income. Deferred tax balances are 
not discounted.
Accruals for tax contingencies require 
management to make judgements and 
estimates in relation to tax audit issues. Tax 
benefits are not recognised unless the tax 
positions will probably be sustained. Once 
considered to be probable, management 
reviews each material tax benefit to assess 
whether a provision should be taken against 
full recognition of that benefit on the basis of 
potential settlement through negotiation and/
or litigation.
Any recorded exposure to interest on tax 
liabilities is provided for in the tax charge. All 
provisions are included in creditors due within 
one year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments, including 
investments in subsidiaries, are stated at  
cost less any provision for impairment.
Share-based payments
The issuance by the Company to employees 
of its subsidiaries of a grant of awards over 
the Company’s shares represents additional 
capital contributions by the Company to 
its subsidiaries. An additional investment 
in subsidiaries results in a corresponding 
increase in shareholders’ equity. The 
additional capital contribution is based on the 
fair value of the grant issued, allocated over 
the underlying grant’s vesting period, less the 
market cost of shares charged to subsidiaries  
in settlement of such share awards.
Financial instruments
Loans and other receivables are held at 
amortised cost. Long-term loans payable  
are held at amortised cost.
Litigation
Through the normal course of business, 
AstraZeneca is involved in legal disputes,  
the settlement of which may involve cost 
to the Company. Provision is made where an 
adverse outcome is probable and associated 
costs can be estimated reliably. In other 
cases, appropriate descriptions are included.

All loans are at fixed interest rates. Accordingly, the fair values of the loans will change as market rates change. However, since the loans are 
held at amortised cost, changes in interest rates and the credit rating of the Company do not have any effect on the Company’s net assets.

7 Litigation and environmental liabilities
In addition to those matters disclosed below, there are other cases where the Company is named as a party to legal proceedings. These 
include the Seroquel  IR product liability litigation and the Nexium product liability litigation each of which are described more fully in Note 27  
to the Group Financial Statements.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
In connection with an investigation into Foreign Corrupt Practices Act issues in the pharmaceutical industry, AstraZeneca has received 
inquiries from the DOJ and the SEC regarding, among other things, sales practices, internal controls, certain distributors and interactions  
with healthcare providers and other government officials in several countries. AstraZeneca is co-operating with these inquiries. AstraZeneca’s 
investigation has involved indications of inappropriate conduct in certain countries, including China. Resolution of this matter could involve  
the payment of fines and/or other remedies.
Dutch National Competition Authority investigation
In December 2014, the Dutch National Competition Authority, the ACM, issued its decision that AstraZeneca had not abused a dominant 
position with respect to Nexium. It has now closed its file.
Other
The Company has guaranteed the external borrowing of a subsidiary in the amount of $288m.
8 Statutory and other information
The Directors were paid by another Group company in 2014 and 2013.

202 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Additional Information
Risk management embedded in 
business processes
We strive to ensure that sound risk 
management is embedded in our strategy, 
planning, budgeting and performance 
management processes. The Board has 
defined the Group’s risk appetite expressing 
the acceptable levels of risk for the Group 
using three key dimensions. These are: (i) 
earnings and cash flow; (ii) return on 
investment; and (iii) ethics. This definition 
provides a clear statement by the Board of 
its position on risk, which enables the 
Group, in both quantitative and qualitative 
terms, to judge the level of risk it is prepared 
to take so as to achieve its overall objectives. 
Annually, the Group develops a long-term 
business plan to support the delivery of its 
strategy, which the Board reviews to ensure 
that it conforms to its risk appetite. Our risk 
management approach is aligned to our 
strategy and business planning processes. 
Financial risks and opportunities identified 
through the business planning process are 
cross-checked and integrated into the 
overall risk management reporting. Line 
managers are accountable for identifying 
and managing risks and for delivering 
business objectives in accordance with  
the Group’s risk appetite. 
Within each SET function, leadership  
teams discuss the risks the business  
faces. Annually, these risks are mapped to 
AstraZeneca’s risk ‘taxonomy’ providing a 
Group-wide assessment that is shared with 
the Board, Audit Committee and SET. 
Quarterly each SET function identifies any 
changes to these risks, its mitigation plans 
and new and emerging risks. The quarterly 
updates are assimilated into a Group Risk 
Report for the Board, Audit Committee  
and SET. Supporting tools are in place to 
assist risk leaders and managers in this 
process and we continue to work on 
developing our risk management standards 
and guidelines. We develop business 
continuity plans to address situations where 
specific risks have the potential to severely 
impact our business. These plans include 
training and crisis simulation activities for 
business managers. 
Key responsibilities
Internal Audit Services (IA) 
IA is an independent assurance and 
advisory function that reports, and is 
accountable, to the Audit Committee. IA’s 
budget, resources and audit programme 
are approved by the Audit Committee 
annually and the findings from its audit work 
are reported to, and discussed at, each 
Audit Committee meeting. A core part  
of the audit work carried out by IA includes 
assessing how we are managing risk and 
reviewing the effectiveness of selected 
aspects of our risk control framework, 
including the effectiveness of other 
assurance and compliance functions  
within the business. 
Global Compliance
Our Global Compliance function seeks to 
drive and embed a culture of ethics and 
integrity within our organisation. 
Our key compliance priorities include
 > focusing our efforts on important 
compliance risk areas 
 > communicating clear policies to 
employees 
 > improving compliance behaviours through 
effective training and support 
 > ensuring employees can raise concerns 
and that those concerns will be properly 
addressed 
 > ensuring fair and objective investigations 
of possible policy breaches 
 > monitoring compliance with policies 
 > providing key stakeholders with 
assurance and effective reporting of 
material issues.
In the Strategy section on pages 10 to 31,  
we provide an overview of the principal risks 
we face and our efforts to manage them.  
In this section we describe in further detail 
our key risk management and assurance 
mechanisms and the principal risks and 
uncertainties we consider material to  
our business, as they may significantly  
affect our financial condition, results of 
operations and/or reputation. Specific  
risks and uncertainties are also discussed  
in the Strategic Report from page 2,  
where relevant. 
Managing risk
As a global, innovation-driven 
biopharmaceutical business, we face a 
diverse range of risks and uncertainties  
that may adversely affect our business. Our 
approach to risk management is designed 
to encourage clear decision making as to 
which risks we take and how these risks are 
managed, based on an understanding of 
the potential strategic, commercial, financial, 
compliance, legal and reputational 
implications of these risks.
We work continuously to ensure that we 
have effective risk management processes 
in place to support the delivery of our 
strategic priorities, the material needs of our 
stakeholders and our values. We monitor 
our business activities and external and 
internal environments for new, emerging  
and changing risks to ensure that these  
are managed appropriately.
The Board believes that the processes and 
accountabilities that exist and are described 
below, provide it with adequate information 
on the principal risks and uncertainties we 
face. Further information about these risks 
and uncertainties is set out in this section.

Oversight and monitoring
The SET is responsible for overseeing and 
monitoring the effectiveness of the risk 
management processes implemented  
by management. The Global Compliance 
and Finance functions, together with IA, 
support the SET by advising on policy and 
standard setting, monitoring and auditing, 
communication and training, as well as 
reporting on the adequacy of line 
management processes as they apply  
to risk management. 
Our compliance organisation is comprised 
of the Global Compliance function and 
various specialist compliance functions. 
More information about Global Compliance 
and the Code of Conduct can be found in 
the Corporate Governance Report from 
page 86. 
Management reporting and assurance
Quarterly risk reports are provided to the 
SET and the Board. Among other things, 
these reports summarise our current 
assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including environmental, social and 
governance risks, senior management 
accountability and our proposed plans to 
address these risks, to the extent possible.
The Audit Committee comprises five 
Non-Executive Directors. It reviews and 
reports to the Board following each Audit 
Committee meeting on the overall 
framework of risk management and internal 
controls, and is responsible for promptly 
informing the Board of any significant 
concerns about the conduct, results or 
outcomes of internal audits and other 
compliance matters. The Audit Committee 
receives regular reports from our external 
auditor and the following business functions
 > IA: independent assurance reports on the 
Group’s risk management and control 
framework
 > Global Compliance: reports on key 
compliance risks, compliance incidents 
and investigations, including contact 
made by employees via AZethics via our 
helplines
 > Financial Control and Compliance 
Group: reports on Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
compliance and the financial control 
framework
 > Management: the Group-level risk 
summary from the annual business 
planning process and reports on the 
performance management and 
monitoring processes, key risks and 
opportunities analysis from the business 
plan, quarterly Group level risk reports 
and ad hoc comprehensive reviews  
of specific risks.
For more information on the Audit 
Committee, please see the Audit Committee 
Report from page 96.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Operating in the pharmaceutical sector 
carries various inherent risks and 
uncertainties that may affect our business. 
In the remainder of this section we describe 
the principal risks and uncertainties that we 
consider material to our business in that 
they may have a significant effect on our 
financial condition, results of operations and/
or reputation. 
These risks are not listed in any particular 
order of priority. Other risks, unknown or  
not currently considered material, could 
have a similar effect. We believe that the 
forward-looking statements about 
AstraZeneca in this Annual Report, identified 
by words such as ‘anticipates’, ‘believes’, 
‘expects’ and ‘intends’, and that include, 
among other things, the statements made  
in Outlook in the Chairman’s Statement and 
Future prospects in the Financial Review 
from page 5 and from page 81 respectively, 
are based on reasonable assumptions. 
However, forward-looking statements 
involve inherent risks and uncertainties such 
as those summarised below. They relate to 
events that may occur in the future, that may 
be influenced by factors beyond our control 
and that may have actual outcomes 
materially different from our expectations.
These priorities are aligned to our strategy 
and reflect our commitment to provide 
oversight at all levels, including risk 
management relating to external parties  
and anti-bribery/anti-corruption. IA and 
Global Compliance work closely together 
and separately provide assurance reporting 
to the Audit Committee. Through the  
Group Compliance Council, Global 
Compliance and IA work with various 
specialist compliance functions  
throughout our organisation to  
co-ordinate compliance activities.
When a potential compliance breach  
is identified, an internal investigation is 
undertaken by appropriate staff from  
our Global Compliance, HR and/or  
Legal teams. When appropriate, external 
advisers are engaged to conduct and/or 
advise on investigations. Should an 
investigation conclude that a significant 
breach has occurred, management, in 
consultation with our Legal function, will 
consider whether the Group needs to 
disclose and/or report the findings to a 
regulatory or governmental authority. 
More information on IA and our overall risk 
management and control framework can be 
found in the Corporate Governance Report 
from page 86. 
Management of risk
Day-to-day risk management is delegated 
from the Board to the CEO and through the 
SET to line managers. SET functions are 
accountable for establishing an appropriate 
line management-led process and for 
providing the resources for supporting 
effective risk management.
Line and project managers have primary 
responsibility, within the context of their 
functional area, for identifying and managing 
risk as well as for implementing appropriate 
controls and procedures to monitor 
effectiveness.

Failure to meet development targets
The development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex, 
risky and lengthy process involving significant financial, R&D and other 
resources, which may fail at any stage of the process due to various 
factors. These include failure to obtain the required regulatory or marketing 
approvals for the product candidate or its manufacturing facilities; 
unfavourable clinical efficacy data; safety concerns; failure of R&D to 
develop new product candidates; failure to demonstrate adequate 
cost-effective benefits to regulatory authorities and/or payers; and the 
emergence of competing products. 
Because our business model and strategy rely on the success of relatively 
few compounds, the failure of any in-line production may have a significant 
negative effect on our business or results of operations.
Production and release schedules for biologics may be more significantly 
impacted by regulatory processes than other products. This is due to more 
complex and stringent regulation on the manufacturing of biologics and 
their supply chain.
A succession of negative drug project results and a failure to reduce 
development timelines effectively, or produce new products that achieve 
the expected commercial success, could frustrate the achievement of 
development targets, adversely affect the reputation of our R&D 
capabilities, and is likely to materially adversely affect our business and 
results of operations. See also Failure to achieve strategic priorities or to 
meet targets or expectations on page 217 .
Difficulties obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new products 
We are subject to strict controls on the commercialisation processes for 
our pharmaceutical products, including their development, manufacture, 
distribution and marketing. Safety, efficacy and quality must be established 
before a drug can be marketed for a given indication. The criteria for 
establishing safety, efficacy and quality may vary by country or region and 
the submission of an application to regulatory authorities may or may not 
lead to the grant of marketing approval. Regulators can refuse to grant 
approval or may require additional data before approval is given, even 
though the medicine may already be launched in other countries. Approved 
products are also subject to regulations, and a failure to comply can 
potentially result in losing regulatory approval to market our products. 
Regulations may require a company to conduct additional clinical trials after 
a drug’s approval, which can result in increased costs, labelling challenges 
or loss of regulatory approval.
Factors, including advances in science and technology, evolving regulatory 
science, and different approaches to benefit/risk tolerance by regulatory 
authorities, the general public, and other third party public interest groups 
influence the initial approvability of new drugs. Existing marketed products 
are also subject to these same forces, and new data and meta-analyses 
have the potential to drive changes in the approval status or labelling. 
Recent years have seen an increase in post-marketing regulatory 
requirements and commitments, and an increased call for third party 
access to regulatory and clinical trial data packages for independent 
analysis and interpretation.
Politically motivated and unpredictable policy making by governments and 
regulators can adversely influence regulatory decision making, often 
leading to severe delays in regulatory approval. The predictability of the 
outcome and timing of review processes remains challenging due to 
evolving regulatory science, competing regulatory priorities, unpredictable 
policy making and downward pressure on regulatory authority resources.
Delays in regulatory reviews and approvals impact patient and market 
access. In addition, post-approval requirements result in increased  
costs and may impact the labelling and approval status of currently 
marketed products.

Failure to obtain and enforce effective IP protection
Our ability to obtain and enforce patents and other IP rights in relation to our 
products is an important element of our ability to protect our investment in 
R&D and create long-term value for the business. Some countries in which 
we operate are still developing their IP laws or may even be limiting the 
applicability of these laws to pharmaceutical inventions. Adverse political 
perspectives on the desirability of strong IP protection for pharmaceuticals 
in certain emerging and even developed markets may limit our ability to 
obtain effective IP protection for our products. As a result, certain countries 
may seek to limit or deny effective IP protection for pharmaceuticals.
Limitations on the availability of patent protection or the use of compulsory 
licensing in certain countries in which we operate could have a material 
adverse effect on the pricing and sales of our products and, consequently, 
could materially adversely affect our revenues from those products. More 
information about protecting our IP is contained in the Intellectual Property 
section from page 68. Information about the risk of patent litigation and the 
early loss of IP rights is contained in the Expiry or loss of, or limitations to,  
IP rights risk on page 208.
Delay to new product launches
Our continued success depends on the development and successful 
launch of innovative new drugs. The anticipated launch dates of major new 
products significantly affect our business, including investment in large 
clinical studies, the manufacture of pre-launch product stocks, investment 
in marketing materials pre-launch, sales force training and the timing of 
anticipated future revenue streams from new product sales. Launch dates 
are primarily driven by our development programmes and the demands  
of the regulatory authorities in the approvals process, as well as pricing 
negotiations. Delays to anticipated launch dates may result from  
various factors, including adverse findings in pre-clinical or clinical  
studies, regulatory demands, price negotiation, competitor activity  
and technology transfer.
Significant delays to anticipated launch dates of new products could  
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of 
operations. For example, for the launch of products that are seasonal in 
nature, delays in regulatory approvals or manufacturing difficulties may 
delay launch to the next season which, in turn, may significantly reduce  
the return on costs incurred in preparing for the launch for that season.  
In addition, a delayed launch may lead to increased costs if, for example, 
marketing and sales efforts need to be rescheduled or performed for 
longer than expected.
Acquisitions and strategic alliances, including licensing and collaborations, may be unsuccessful
We seek licensing arrangements and strategic collaborations to expand  
our product portfolio and geographical presence as part of our  
business strategy. 
Such licensing arrangements and strategic collaborations are key,  
enabling us to grow and strengthen the business. The success of such 
arrangements is largely dependent on the technology and other IP rights 
we acquire, and the resources, efforts and skills of our partners. Also, 
under many of our licensing arrangements and strategic collaborations,  
we make milestone payments well in advance of the commercialisation  
of the products, with no assurance that we will recoup these payments. 
Furthermore, we experience strong competition from other pharmaceutical 
companies in respect of licensing arrangements, strategic collaborations, 
and acquisition targets, and therefore, we may be unsuccessful in 
implementing some of our intended projects. 
We may also seek to acquire complementary businesses or enter into  
other strategic transactions. The integration of an acquired business could 
involve incurring significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities, as 
well as having a negative effect on our reported results of operations from 
acquisition-related charges, amortisation of expenses related to intangibles 
and charges for the implementation of long-term assets. We may also 
experience difficulties in integrating geographically separated organisations, 
systems and facilities, and personnel with different organisational cultures. 
If we fail to complete these types of collaborative projects in a timely 
manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, this may limit our ability to 
access a greater portfolio of products, IP technology and shared expertise. 
Additionally, disputes or difficulties in our relationship with our collaborators 
or partners may arise, often due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of 
interest between parties, which may erode or eliminate the benefits of  
these alliances. 
The incurrence of significant debt or liabilities due to the integration of an 
acquired business could cause deterioration in our credit rating and result 
in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. 
Further, if liabilities are uncovered in an acquired business, an acquired 
business fails to perform in line with expectations, or a strategic  
transaction does not deliver the results we intended, then the Group  
or our shareholders may suffer losses and may not have adequate 
remedies against the seller or third parties. Integration processes may also 
result in business disruption, diversion of management resources, the loss 
of key employees and other issues, such as a failure to integrate IT and 
other systems.

Challenges to achieving commercial success of new products
The successful launch of a new pharmaceutical product involves 
substantial investment in sales and marketing activities, launch stocks and 
other items. The commercial success of our new medicines is particularly 
important to replace lost sales following patent expiry. We may ultimately be 
unable to achieve commercial success for any number of reasons. These 
include difficulties in manufacturing sufficient quantities of the product 
candidate for development or commercialisation in a timely manner, the 
impact of price control measures imposed by governments and healthcare 
authorities, the outcome of negotiations with third party payers, erosion of 
IP rights, including infringement by third parties, failure to show a 
differentiated product profile and changes in prescribing habits. 
As a result, we cannot be certain that compounds currently under 
development will achieve success, and our ability to accurately assess, 
prior to launch, the eventual efficacy or safety of a new product once in 
broader clinical use can only be based on data available at that time, which 
is inherently limited due to relatively short periods of product testing and 
relatively small clinical study patient samples. 
The commercialisation of biologics is often more complex than for small 
molecule pharmaceutical products, primarily due to differences in the 
mode of administration, technical aspects of the product, and rapidly 
changing distribution and reimbursement environments.
Our products are subject to competition by other products approved for 
the same or similar indication, and the approval of a competitive product 
that is considered superior with, or equivalent to, one of our products may 
result in immediate and significant decreases in our sales.
If a new product does not succeed as anticipated or its rate of sales growth 
is slower than anticipated, there is a risk that we may be unable to fully 
recoup the costs incurred in launching it, which could materially adversely 
affect our business or results of operations. 
Due to the complexity of the commercialisation process for biologics, the 
methods of distributing and marketing biologics could materially adversely 
impact our revenues from the sales of products, such as Synagis and 
FluMist/Fluenz.
Illegal trade in our products
The illegal trade in pharmaceutical products is widely recognised by 
industry, non-governmental organisations and governmental authorities to 
be increasing. Illegal trade includes counterfeiting, theft and illegal diversion 
(that is, when our products are found in a market where we did not send 
them and where they may not be locally approved). There is a risk to public 
health when illegally traded products enter the supply chain, as well as 
associated financial risk. Regulators and the public expect us to help 
reduce opportunities for illegal trade in our products through securing the 
integrity of our supply chain, surveillance, investigation and supporting legal 
action against those found to be engaged in illegal trade.
Public loss of confidence in the integrity of pharmaceutical products  
as a result of illegal trade could materially adversely affect our reputation 
and financial performance. In addition, undue or misplaced concern about 
this issue may cause some patients to stop taking their medicines, with 
consequential risks to their health. Authorities may take action, financial  
or otherwise, if they believe we are liable for breaches in our own  
supply chains.
There is also a direct financial loss when counterfeit, stolen and/or illegally 
diverted products replace sales of genuine products or genuine products 
are recalled following discovery of counterfeit, stolen and/or illegally 
diverted products.

Developing our business in Emerging Markets
The development of our business in Emerging Markets is a critical factor in 
determining our future ability to sustain or increase our global product 
revenues. This poses various challenges including: more volatile economic 
conditions and/or political environments; competition from multinational 
and local companies with existing market presence; the need to identify 
and to leverage appropriate opportunities for sales and marketing; poor IP 
protection; inadequate protection against crime (including counterfeiting, 
corruption and fraud); inadequate infrastructure to address disease 
outbreaks (such as the Ebola virus); the need to impose developed market 
compliance standards; the need to meet a more diverse range of national 
regulatory, clinical and manufacturing requirements; inadvertent breaches 
of local and international law; not being able to recruit appropriately skilled 
and experienced personnel; identification of the most effective sales and 
marketing channels and route to market; and interventions by national 
governments or regulators restricting market access and/or introducing 
adverse price controls.
The failure to exploit potential opportunities appropriately in Emerging 
Markets may materially adversely affect our reputation, business or results 
of operations.
Expiry or loss of, or limitations to, IP rights
Pharmaceutical products are only protected from being copied during the 
limited period of protection under patent rights and/or related IP rights such 
as Regulatory Data Protection or orphan drug status. Expiry or loss of 
these rights typically leads to the immediate launch of generic copies of the 
product in the country where the rights have expired or been lost. See the 
Patent Expiries section on page 201, which contains a table of certain 
patent expiry dates for our key marketed products. 
Additionally, the expiry or loss of patents covering other innovator 
companies’ products may also lead to increased competition for our own, 
still-patented, products in the same product class due to the availability of 
generic products in that product class. Further, there may be increased 
pricing pressure on our still-patented products due to the lower prices of 
generic entrants.
Products under patent protection or within the period of Regulatory Data 
Protection typically generate significantly higher revenues than those not 
protected by such rights. Our revenues, financial condition and results of 
operations may be materially adversely affected upon expiry or early loss  
of our IP rights due to generic entrants into the market for the applicable 
product. Additionally, the loss of patent rights covering major products  
of other pharmaceutical companies may materially adversely affect  
the growth of our still-patented products in the same product class  
in that market.

208 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Commercialisation and business execution risks continued Impact
Pressures resulting from generic competition
Our products compete not only with other products approved for the  
same condition, marketed by research-based pharmaceutical companies, 
but also with generic drugs marketed by drug manufacturers. These 
competitors may invest more resources into the marketing of their products 
than we do, depending on the relative priority of these competitor products 
within their company’s portfolio. Generic versions of products are often 
sold at lower prices than branded products, as the manufacturer does not 
have to recoup the significant cost of R&D investment and market 
development. The majority of our patented products, including Nexium, 
Crestor and Seroquel XR, are subject to pricing pressures due to 
competition from generic copies of these products and from generic forms 
of other drugs in the same product class (for example, generic forms of 
Losec/Prilosec, Lipitor and Seroquel IR). 
As well as facing generic competition upon expiry or loss of IP rights, we 
also face the risk that generic drug manufacturers seek to market generic 
versions of our products prior to expiries of our patents and/or the 
Regulatory Exclusivity periods. For example, we are currently facing 
challenges in the US from numerous generic drug manufacturers regarding 
our patents for Nexium and Pulmicort Respules, two of our key products. 
Generic manufacturers may also take advantage of the failure of certain 
countries to properly enforce Regulatory Data Protection and may launch 
generics during this protected period. This is a particular risk in some 
Emerging Markets where appropriate patent protection may be difficult to 
obtain or enforce. 
If challenges to our patents by generic drug manufacturers succeed and 
generic products are launched, or generic products are launched ‘at risk’ 
on the expectation that challenges to our IP will be successful, this may 
materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
In 2014, US sales for Crestor and Seroquel XR were $2,918 million (2013: 
$2,912 million) and $738 million (2013: $743 million), respectively. 
Furthermore, if limitations on the availability, scope or enforceability of 
patent protection are implemented in jurisdictions in which we operate, 
generic manufacturers in these countries may be increasingly able to 
introduce competing products to the market earlier than they would have 
been able to, had more robust patent protection or Regulatory Data 
Protection been available.
Effects of patent litigation in respect of IP rights
Any of the IP rights protecting our products may be asserted or challenged 
in IP litigation initiated against or by external parties. Such IP rights may also 
be the subject of validity challenges in patent offices. We expect our most 
valuable products to receive the greatest number of challenges. Despite 
our efforts to establish and defend robust patent protection for our 
products, we may not succeed in protecting our patents from such litigation 
or other challenges.
We also bear the risk that courts may decide that third parties do not 
infringe our IP rights. This may result in AstraZeneca losing exclusivity and/
or erosion of revenues. Details of proceedings involving non-infringement 
allegations, including so-called Section 505(b)(2) cases in the US can be 
found in Note 27 to the Financial Statements from page 182. 
Where we assert our IP rights but are ultimately unsuccessful, third  
parties may seek damages, alleging, for example, that they have been 
inappropriately restrained from entering the market. In such cases, we bear 
the risk that we incur liabilities to those third parties.
We also bear the risk that we may be found to infringe patents owned or 
licensed exclusively by third parties, including research-based and generic 
pharmaceutical companies and individuals. Infringement accusations may 
implicate, for example, our manufacturing processes, product 
intermediates or use of research tools. Details of significant infringement 
claims against us by third parties enforcing IP rights can be found in Note 
27 to the Financial Statements from page 182.
If we are not successful in maintaining exclusive rights to market one or 
more of our major products, particularly in the US where we achieve our 
highest revenue, our revenue and margins could be materially adversely 
affected. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in patent litigation, we may incur 
liabilities to third parties for damages incurred after enforcing our IP rights.
Managing or litigating infringement disputes over so-called ‘freedom to 
operate’ can be costly. We may be subject to injunctions against our 
products or processes and be liable for damages or royalties. We may 
need to obtain costly licences. These risks may be greater in relation to 
biologics and vaccines, where patent infringement claims may relate to 
discovery or research tools, and manufacturing methods and/or biological 
materials. While we seek to manage such risks by, for example, acquiring 
licences, forgoing certain activities or uses, or modifying processes to  
avoid infringement claims and permit commercialisation of our products, 
such steps can entail significant cost and there is no guarantee that they 
will be successful.

Price controls and reductions
Most of our key markets have experienced the implementation of various 
cost control or reimbursement mechanisms for pharmaceutical products.
For example, in the US, prices are being depressed through restrictive 
reimbursement policies and cost control tools such as restricted lists  
and formularies, which employ ‘generic first’ strategies and/or require 
physicians to obtain prior approval for the use of a branded medicine where 
a generic alternative exists. These mechanisms can be used by payers to 
limit the use of branded products and put pressure on manufacturers to 
reduce net prices. In addition, payers are shifting a greater proportion of the 
cost of branded medicines to the patient via out-of-pocket payments at the 
pharmacy counter. The patient out-of-pocket spend is generally in the form 
of a co-payment or, in some cases, a co-insurance, which is designed, 
principally, to encourage patients to use generic medicines. 
In Emerging Markets, governments are increasingly controlling pricing in the 
self-pay sector. 
A summary of the principal aspects of price regulation and how pricing 
pressures are affecting our business in our most important markets is set 
out in Pricing pressure in the Marketplace section on page 17 and opposite 
in the following risk factor.
Due to these pricing pressures, there can be no certainty that we will be 
able to charge prices for a product that, in a particular country or in the 
aggregate, enable us to earn an adequate return on our product 
investment. These pressures, including the increasingly restrictive 
reimbursement policies to which we are subject, as well as potential 
legislation that expands the commercial importation of medicines into the 
US, could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations. 
We expect these pricing pressures will continue, and may increase.

210 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Commercialisation and business execution risks continued Impact
Economic, regulatory and political pressures
We face continued economic, regulatory and political pressures to limit or 
reduce the cost of our products. 
In 2010, the US enacted the ACA, a comprehensive health reform law that 
expands insurance coverage, implements delivery system reforms and 
places a renewed focus on cost and quality. In terms of specific provisions 
impacting our industry, the law mandates higher rebates and discounts on 
branded drugs for certain Medicare and Medicaid patients as well as an 
industry-wide excise fee. Implementation of several health system delivery 
reforms included in the ACA has commenced and will continue until 2018. 
The ACA expands the patient population eligible for Medicaid and provides 
new insurance coverage for individuals through state and federally-
operated health insurance exchanges. In general, patients enrolled in the 
exchanges are subject to higher cost sharing obligations and may not have 
as robust access to prescription drugs as compared with patients enrolled 
in Medicare Part D or commercial plans. There will be ongoing scrutiny of 
the US pharmaceutical industry that could result in further government 
intervention and financial constraint. For more information, please see 
Regulatory requirements and Pricing pressure in the Marketplace section 
from page 16 and page 17 , respectively.
In the EU, efforts by the EC to reduce inconsistencies and improve 
standards in the disparate national pricing and reimbursement systems met 
with little immediate success as Member States guard their right to make 
healthcare budget decisions. The industry continues to be exposed in 
Europe to various ad hoc cost-containment measures and reference 
pricing mechanisms, which impact prices. There is a trend towards 
increasing transparency and comparison of prices among EU Member 
States. Recent controversy regarding the high price of a drug marketed  
by one of our competitors for chronic hepatitis C may provoke further EU 
collaboration and may eventually lead to a change in the overall pricing and 
reimbursement landscape. 
Concurrently, many markets are adopting the use of Health Technology 
Assessment (HTA) to provide a rigorous evaluation of the clinical efficacy  
of a product, at, or post, launch. HTA evaluations are also increasingly 
being used to assess the clinical effect, as well as cost-effectiveness, of 
products in a particular health system. This comes as payers and 
policymakers attempt to increase efficiencies in the use and choice of 
pharmaceutical products. 
Further information regarding these pressures is contained in Regulatory 
requirements and Pricing pressure in the Marketplace section from page 16 
and page 17 , respectively.
While new patients entering the US healthcare system due to the ACA may 
lead to a slight increase in prescription drug utilisation, it is too early to 
predict what the financial impact from newly covered individuals may be. 
Overall, we expect that our financial and other costs resulting from the 
ACA, many of which we are unable to accurately estimate, will far outweigh 
any increase in revenues. 
The continued disparities in EU and US pricing systems could lead to 
marked price differentials between markets, which, by way of the 
implementation of existing or new reference pricing mechanisms,  
increases the pricing pressure affecting the industry. The importation of 
pharmaceutical products from countries where prices are low due to 
government price controls, or other market dynamics, to countries where 
prices for those products are higher, is already prevalent and may increase. 
Increased transparency of net prices and strengthened collaboration by 
governments may accelerate the development of further cost containment 
policies (such as procurement or the comparison of net prices etc).

Abbreviated approval processes for biosimilars
While no application for a biosimilar has been made in relation to an 
AstraZeneca biologic, various regulatory authorities are implementing or 
considering abbreviated approval processes for biosimilars that would 
compete with patented biologics. 
For example, in 2010, the US enacted the Biologics Price Competition and 
Innovation Act within the ACA, which contains general directives for 
biosimilar applications. The FDA issued draft guidance in February 2012 on 
implementing an abbreviated biosimilar approval pathway. However, 
significant questions remain, including standards for designation of 
interchangeability and data collection requirements to support extrapolation 
of indications. In 2012, the FDA also implemented user fee programmes to 
support biosimilar product review and policy development. In Europe, the 
EMA published final guidelines on similar biologics containing MAbs and in 
May 2012, the first MAb biosimilar application was submitted with 
recommendation for approval made by the EMA. Notably, various 
jurisdictions have adopted either the EMA guidelines or those set forth by 
the WHO to enable biosimilars to enter the market after discrete periods of 
data exclusivity.
The extent to which biosimilars would differ from patented biologics on 
price is unclear. However, due to their complex nature, it is uncertain 
whether biosimilars would have the same impact on patented biologics  
that generic products have had on patented small molecule products. 
In addition, it is uncertain when any such abbreviated approval processes 
may be fully realised, particularly for more complex protein molecules  
such as MAbs. Such processes may materially and adversely affect the 
future commercial prospects for patented biologics, such as the ones that 
we produce. 
Increasing implementation and enforcement of more stringent anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation
There is an increasing global focus on the implementation and enforcement 
of anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation. 
For example, in the UK, the Bribery Act 2010 came into force in 2011. It has 
extensive extra-territorial application, and imposes organisational liability for 
any bribe paid by persons or entities associated with an organisation where 
the organisation failed to have adequate preventative procedures in place 
at the time of the offence. In the US, there has been significant enforcement 
activity in respect of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the SEC and DOJ 
against US companies and non-US companies listed in the US. China and 
other countries are also enforcing their own anti-bribery laws more 
aggressively and/or adopting tougher new measures. 
We are the subject of current anti-corruption investigations and there can 
be no assurance that we will not, from time to time, continue to be subject 
to informal inquiries and formal investigations from governmental agencies. 
In the context of our business, governmental officials interact with us in 
various roles that are important to our operations, such as in the capacity of 
a regulator, partner or healthcare payer, reimburser or prescriber, among 
others. Details of these matters are included in Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements from page 182.
We devote significant resources to the considerable challenge of 
compliance with this legislation, including in emerging and developing 
markets, at considerable cost. Investigations from governmental agencies 
require additional resources. Despite taking significant measures to prevent 
breaches of applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws by our 
personnel and associated third parties, breaches may result in the 
imposition of significant penalties, such as fines, the requirement to comply 
with monitoring or self-reporting obligations, or debarment or exclusion 
from government sales or reimbursement programmes, any of which could 
materially adversely affect our reputation, business or results of operations.

Any expected gains from productivity initiatives are uncertain
We continue to implement various productivity initiatives and restructuring 
programmes with the aim of enhancing the long-term efficiency of the 
business. However, anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these 
programmes are based on estimates and the actual savings may vary 
significantly. In particular, these cost reduction measures are often based 
on current conditions and cannot always take into account any future 
changes to the pharmaceutical industry or our operations, including new 
business developments or wage or price increases.
If inappropriately managed, the expected value of these initiatives could be 
lost through low employee engagement and hence productivity, increased 
absence and attrition levels, and industrial action. 
Our failure to successfully implement these planned cost reduction 
measures, either through the successful conclusion of employee relations 
processes (including consultation, engagement, talent management, 
recruitment and retention), or the possibility that these efforts do not 
generate the level of cost savings we anticipate, could materially adversely 
affect our business or results of operations.
Failure to attract and retain key personnel and failure to successfully engage with our employees
We rely heavily on recruiting and retaining talented employees with a 
diverse range of skills and capabilities to meet our strategic objectives.  
For example, the success of our science activities depends largely on our 
ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of high-quality researchers 
and development specialists. We face intense competition for well qualified 
individuals, as the supply of people with specific skills and significant 
leadership potential or in specific geographic regions may be limited. 
Our ability to achieve high levels of employee engagement in the workforce, 
and hence benefit from strong commitment and motivation, is key to the 
successful delivery of our business objectives.
The inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, in particular those 
in key scientific and leadership positions and those in our talent pools, may 
weaken our succession plans for critical positions in the medium term, may 
materially adversely affect the implementation of our strategic objectives 
and could ultimately impact our business or results of operations. 
Failure to engage effectively with our employees could lead to business 
disruption in our day-to-day operations, reduce levels of productivity and/or 
increase levels of voluntary turnover, all of which could ultimately adversely 
impact our business or results of operations. 
While we are committed to working on improving drivers of engagement, 
such as increasing our employees’ understanding of our strategy and our 
ongoing efforts to reduce organisational complexity, our efforts may be 
unsuccessful.
Failure of information technology and cybercrime
We are dependent on effective IT systems. These systems support key 
business functions such as our R&D, manufacturing, supply chain and 
sales capabilities and are an important means of safeguarding and 
communicating data, including critical or sensitive information, the 
confidentiality and integrity of which we rely on. The size and complexity of 
our IT systems, and those of our third party vendors (including outsource 
providers) with whom we contract, have significantly increased over the 
past decade and makes such systems potentially vulnerable to service 
interruptions and security breaches from attacks by malicious third parties, 
or from intentional or inadvertent actions by our employees or vendors.
Any significant disruption to these IT systems, including breaches of data 
security or cybersecurity, or failure to integrate new and existing IT systems, 
could harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our financial 
condition or results of operations. 
While we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and IT, we may 
be unable to prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could 
result in disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation, 
regulatory penalties, financial losses and/or other costs.
Significant changes in the business footprint and the implementation  
of the new IT strategy, including the setting up of captive offshore Global 
Technology Centres, could lead to temporary loss of capability while the 
changes are being implemented.
The inability to effectively back-up and restore data could lead to 
permanent loss of data that could result in non-compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations.
We and our vendors could be susceptible to third party attacks on our 
information security systems. Such attacks are of ever increasing levels  
of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide  
range of motives and expertise, including criminal groups, ‘hacktivists’  
and others. From time to time we experience malicious intrusions and 
computer viruses.

Commercialisation and business execution risks continued Impact
Failure of outsourcing
We have outsourced various business critical operations to third party 
providers. This includes certain R&D processes, IT systems, HR and 
finance and accounting services.
The failure of outsource providers to deliver timely services, and to the 
required level of quality, and the failure of outsource providers to co-operate 
with each other, could materially adversely affect our financial condition or 
results of operations. In addition, such failures could adversely impact our 
ability to meet business targets, maintain a good reputation within the 
industry and with stakeholders, and result in non-compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations.
A failure to successfully manage and implement the integration of IT 
infrastructure services provided by our outsource providers could create 
disruption, which could materially adversely affect our business or results  
of operations. 
In addition, failure to manage outsourcing or insourcing transition 
processes may disrupt our business. For instance, as we transition 
services that previously were outsourced to our service centre in Chennai 
(India), incumbent outsource providers may cease to continue to provide 
the same level of resources and quality of service.
Supply chain and delivery risks Impact
Manufacturing biologics
Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is complex and may 
require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms 
and facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose, with 
sophisticated quality assurance and control procedures.
Final market release of a biologic depends on a number of in-process 
manufacturing and supply chain parameters to ensure the product 
conforms with its safety, identity and strength requirements and meets  
its quality and purity characteristics. 
Biologics production facilities, especially for drug substance manufacture, 
are very specialised and can take years to develop and bring on line as 
licensed facilities. Predicting demand for certain classes of biologics, 
especially prior to launch, can be challenging. We expect that external 
capacity for biologics drug substance production will remain constrained 
for the next several years and, accordingly, may not be readily available for 
supplementary production in the event that we experience unforeseen 
need for such capacity.
Slight variations in any part of the manufacturing process or  
components may lead to a product that does not meet its stringent  
design specifications. Failure to meet these specifications may lead  
to recalls, spoilage, drug product shortages, regulatory action and/or 
reputational harm.
Risk continued
214 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Supply chain and delivery risks continued Impact
Difficulties and delays in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products
We may experience difficulties and delays in manufacturing our products, 
such as 
 > supply chain disruptions, including those due to natural or man-made 
disasters at one of our facilities or at a critical supplier or vendor
 > delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of 
existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for 
our products
 > inability to supply products due to a product quality failure or regulatory 
agency compliance action such as licence withdrawal, product recall or 
product seizure
 > other manufacturing or distribution problems, including changes in 
manufacturing production sites, limits to manufacturing capacity due to 
regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, or 
physical limitations or other business interruptions that could impact 
continuous supply.
Manufacturing, distribution and sales difficulties may result in product 
shortages and significant delays, which may lead to lost sales and 
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results  
of operations.
Reliance on third party goods and services
We increasingly rely on third parties for the timely supply of goods, such as 
raw materials (for example, the API in some of our medicines), equipment, 
formulated drugs and packaging, and services, all of which are key to our 
operations. Many of these goods are difficult to substitute in a timely 
manner or at all.
Unexpected events and/or events beyond our control could result in the 
failure of the supply of goods and services. For example, suppliers of key 
goods may cease to trade. In addition, we may experience limited supply of 
biological materials, such as cells, animal products or by-products. 
Furthermore, government regulations could result in restricted access to, 
use or transport of such materials. 
Third party supply failure could lead to significant delays and/or difficulties 
in obtaining goods and services on commercially acceptable terms. This 
may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results  
of operations. 
Loss of access to sufficient sources of key goods and biological materials 
or services may interrupt or prevent planned research activities and/or 
increase our costs. Further information is contained in Working with 
suppliers in Manufacturing and Supply from page 57 .
Legal, regulatory and compliance risks Impact
Adverse outcome of litigation and/or governmental investigations
We may be subject to various product liability, consumer commercial, 
antitrust, environmental, employment or tax litigation or other legal 
proceedings and governmental investigations. Litigation, particularly in the 
US, is inherently unpredictable and unexpectedly high awards for damages 
can result from an adverse verdict. In many cases, plaintiffs may claim 
compensatory, punitive and statutory damages in extremely high amounts. 
In particular, the marketing, promotional, clinical and pricing practices of 
pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which 
manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers and patients, are 
subject to extensive regulation, litigation and governmental investigation. 
Many companies, including AstraZeneca, have been subject to claims 
related to these practices asserted by federal and state governmental 
authorities and private payers and consumers, which have resulted in 
substantial expense and other significant consequences. Note 27 to the 
Financial Statements from page 182 describes the material legal 
proceedings in which we are currently involved.
Investigations (for example, under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or 
federal or state False Claims Acts described in further detail in Note 27 to 
the Financial Statements from page 182) or legal proceedings, regardless 
of their outcome, could be costly, divert management attention, or damage 
our reputation and demand for our products. Unfavourable resolution of 
current and similar future proceedings against us could subject us to 
criminal liability, fines, penalties or other monetary or non-monetary 
remedies, require us to make significant provisions in our accounts relating 
to legal proceedings and could materially adversely affect our business or 
results of operations.
215 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
Additional Information Additional Information
Legal, regulatory and compliance risks continued Impact
Substantial product liability claims
Pharmaceutical companies have, historically, been subject to large product 
liability damages claims, settlements and awards for injuries allegedly 
caused by the use of their products. Adverse publicity relating to the safety 
of a product or of other competing products may increase the risk of 
product liability claims.
Substantial product liability claims that result in court decisions against us 
or in the settlement of proceedings could materially adversely affect our 
financial condition or results of operations, particularly where such 
circumstances are not covered by insurance. For more information, see the 
Limited third party insurance coverage risk on page 219.
Failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules and regulations
Any failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations may result 
in civil and/or criminal legal proceedings being filed against us, or in us 
becoming subject to regulatory sanctions. Regulatory authorities have 
wide-ranging administrative powers to deal with any failure to comply with 
continuing regulatory oversight and this could affect us, whether such 
failure is our own or that of our contractors or external partners. Details of 
product liability claims against us can be found in Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements from page 182.
Failure to comply with applicable laws, including ongoing control and 
regulation, could materially adversely affect our business or results of 
operations. For example, once a product has been approved for marketing 
by the regulatory authorities, it is subject to continuing control and 
regulation, such as the manner of its manufacture, distribution, marketing 
and safety surveillance. For example, if regulatory issues concerning 
compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice or safety monitoring 
regulations for pharmaceutical products (often referred to as 
pharmacovigilance) arise, this could lead to loss of product approvals, 
product recalls and seizures, and interruption of production, which could 
create product shortages and delays in new product approvals, and 
negatively impact patient access and our reputation.
Failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to anti-competitive behaviour
Any failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations relating  
to anti-competitive behaviour may expose us to regulatory sanctions  
and/or lawsuits from governmental authorities and private,  
non-governmental entities. 
Certain of our commercial arrangements with generics companies,  
which have sought to settle patent challenges on terms acceptable  
to both innovator and generics manufacturer, may be subject to  
challenge by competition authorities.
Where a government authority investigates our adherence to competition 
laws, or we become subject to private party lawsuits (for example, the US 
Nexium settlement anti-trust litigation described in more detail in Note 27 to 
the Financial Statements from page 182), this may result in inspections of 
our sites or requests for documents and other information. Competition 
investigations or legal proceedings could be costly, divert management 
attention or damage our reputation. 
Unfavourable resolution of such challenges, investigations or legal 
proceedings against us could require us to change our commercial 
practice and could subject us to fines and penalties, third party damages 
actions and other sanctions. These could materially adversely affect our 
business or results of operations.
Environmental and occupational health and safety liabilities
We have environmental and/or occupational health and safety-related 
liabilities at some currently and formerly owned, leased and third party 
sites, the most significant of which are detailed in Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements from page 182.
While we carefully manage these liabilities, if a significant compliance issue, 
environmental, occupational health or safety incident or legal requirement 
for which we are responsible were to arise, this could result in us being 
responsible for compensation, fines and/or remediation costs. In some 
circumstances, such liability could materially adversely affect our business 
or results of operations. In addition, our financial provisions for any 
obligations that we may have relating to environmental or occupational 
health and safety liabilities may be insufficient if the assumptions underlying 
the provisions, including (for example) our assumptions regarding the 
portion of waste at a site for which we are responsible, prove incorrect or if 
we are held responsible for additional contamination or occupational health 
and safety-related claims.
Risk continued
216 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Legal, regulatory and compliance risks continued Impact
Misuse of social media platforms and new technology
We increasingly use the internet, social media, mobile applications and 
other forms of new technology to communicate internally and externally. 
The accessibility and instantaneous nature of interactions with such media 
may facilitate or exacerbate the risk of data leakages from within 
AstraZeneca or false or misleading statements being made about 
AstraZeneca, which may damage our reputation. As existing social media 
platforms expand and evolve, and new social media platforms emerge, it 
becomes increasingly challenging to identify new points of entry and to put 
structures in place to secure and protect information.
Inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could lead to the unauthorised 
or unintentional public disclosure of sensitive information (such as 
personally identifiable information on employees, healthcare professionals 
or patients, for example, those enrolled in our clinical trials), which may 
damage our reputation, adversely affect our business or results of 
operations and expose us to legal risks, as well as additional legal 
obligations. Similarly, the involuntary public disclosure of commercially 
sensitive information, such as trade secrets through external media 
channels, or an information loss could adversely affect our business or 
results of operations. In addition, negative posts or comments on social 
media websites about us or, for example, the safety of our products, could 
harm our reputation.
Economic and financial risks Impact
Failure to achieve strategic priorities or to meet targets or expectations
We may from time to time communicate our business strategy or our 
targets or expectations regarding our future financial or other performance 
(for example, the expectations described in Future prospects in the 
Financial Review on page 81, which we communicated to investors at  
our strategy update and our investor day in May and November 2014, 
respectively). All such statements are of a forward-looking nature and are 
based on assumptions and judgements we make, all of which are subject 
to significant inherent risks and uncertainties, including risks and 
uncertainties that we are unaware of and/or that are beyond our control.
Any failure to successfully implement our business strategy may frustrate 
the achievement of our financial or other targets or expectations and, in 
turn, materially damage our brand and materially adversely affect our 
business, financial position or results of operations.
There can be no guarantee that our financial targets or expectations will 
materialise on the expected timeline or at all. Actual results may deviate 
materially and adversely from any such target or expectation, including if 
one or more of the assumptions or judgements underlying any such target 
or expectation proves to be incorrect in whole or in part.
217 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
Additional Information Additional Information
Economic and financial risks continued Impact
Adverse impact of a sustained economic downturn
A variety of significant risks may arise from a sustained global economic 
downturn. Additional pressure from governments and other healthcare 
payers on medicine prices and volumes of sales in response to 
recessionary pressures on budgets may cause a slowdown or a decline in 
growth in some markets. In some cases, those governments most severely 
impacted by the economic downturn may seek alternative ways to settle 
their debts through, for example, the issuance of government bonds which 
might trade at a discount to the face value of the debt. 
In addition, our customers may cease to trade, which may result in losses 
from writing off debts, or the sustained economic downturn may 
unfavourably affect the spending patterns of the consumers of our 
products. 
We are highly dependent on being able to access a sustainable flow of 
liquid funds due to the high fixed costs of operating our business and the 
long and uncertain development cycles of our products. In a sustained 
economic downturn, financial institutions with whom we deal may cease to 
trade and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access monies 
owed to us without a protracted, expensive and uncertain process, if at all. 
More than 95% of our cash investments are managed centrally and are 
invested in collateralised bank deposits or AAA credit rated institutional 
money market funds. Money market funds are backed by institutions in the 
US and the EU, which, in turn, invest in other funds, including sovereign 
funds. This means our credit exposure is a mix of US and EU sovereign 
default risk and financial institution default risk.
While we have adopted cash management and treasury policies to 
manage this risk (see the Financial risk management policies section on 
page 81), we cannot be certain that these will be as effective as they are 
intended to be, in particular in the event of a global liquidity crisis. In 
addition, open positions where we are owed money and investments we 
have made in financial institutions or money market funds cannot be 
guaranteed to be recoverable. Additionally, if we need access to external 
sources of financing to sustain and/or grow our business, such as the 
debt or equity capital financial markets, this may not be available on 
commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in the event of a severe and/or 
sustained economic downturn. This may, for instance, be the case in the 
event of any default by the Group on its debt obligations, which may 
materially adversely affect our ability to secure debt funding in the future  
or our financial condition in general. Further information on debt funding 
arrangements is contained in the Financial risk management policies 
section on page 81.
Political and socio-economic conditions
We operate in over 100 countries around the world, some of which may be 
subject to political and social instability. There may be disruption to our 
business if there is instability in a particular geographic region, including as 
a result of war, terrorism, riot, unstable governments, civil insurrection or 
social unrest. For instance, our operational risks in Ukraine have increased 
due to growing political and economic uncertainty in the region. 
Deterioration of, or failure to improve, socio-economic conditions, and 
situations and/or resulting events, depending on their severity, could 
adversely affect our supply and/or distribution chain in the affected 
countries and the ability of customers or ultimate payers to purchase our 
medicines. This could adversely affect our business or results of 
operations. Broader economic developments, such as potential 
international sanctions and global oil price developments, could exacerbate 
this effect in the Ukrainian and Russian markets. 
Fluctuations in exchange rates
As a global business, currency fluctuations can significantly affect our 
results of operations, which are reported in US dollars. Approximately 40% 
of our global 2014 sales were in the US, which is expected to remain our 
largest single market for the foreseeable future. Sales in other countries are 
predominantly in currencies other than the US dollar, including the euro, 
Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. We have a growing 
exposure to emerging market currencies, some of which are subject to 
exchange controls, and these currencies, such as that of Venezuela, may 
be subject to material devaluations against the US dollar. Major 
components of our cost base are located in the UK and Sweden, where an 
aggregate of approximately 21% of our employees are based.
Movements in the exchange rates used to translate foreign currencies into 
US dollars may materially adversely affect our financial condition or results 
of operations. Additionally, some of our subsidiaries import and export 
goods and services in currencies other than their own functional currency, 
and so the financial results of such subsidiaries could be affected by 
currency fluctuations arising between the transaction dates and the 
settlement dates for these transactions. In addition, there are foreign 
exchange differences arising on the translation of equity investments in 
subsidiaries. 
Risk continued
218 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Economic and financial risks continued Impact
Limited third party insurance coverage
In recent years, the costs associated with product liability litigation  
have increased the cost of, and narrowed the coverage afforded by, 
pharmaceutical companies’ product liability insurance. To contain 
insurance costs in recent years, we have continued to adjust our coverage 
profile, accepting a greater degree of uninsured exposure. The Group has 
not held any material product liability insurance since February 2006. In 
addition, where claims are made under insurance policies, insurers may 
reserve the right to deny coverage on various grounds. For example, 
product liability litigation cases relating to Crestor and Nexium in the US are 
not covered by third party product liability insurance. See Note 27 to the 
Financial Statements from page 182 for details.
If we are found to have a financial liability due to product liability or other 
litigation, in respect of which we do not have insurance coverage, or if an 
insurer’s denial of coverage is ultimately upheld, this could materially 
adversely affect our business or results of operations. 
For more information, please see the Substantial product liability claims  
risk on page 216.
Taxation
The integrated nature of our worldwide operations can produce conflicting 
claims from revenue authorities as to the profits to be taxed in individual 
countries. The majority of the jurisdictions in which we operate have double 
tax treaties with other foreign jurisdictions, which provide a framework 
for mitigating the incidence of double taxation on our revenues and 
capital gains.
The resolution of these disputes can result in a reallocation of profits 
between jurisdictions and an increase or decrease in related tax costs, and 
has the potential to affect our cash flows and EPS. Claims, regardless of 
their merits or their outcome, are costly, divert management attention and 
may adversely affect our reputation.
If any of these double tax treaties should be withdrawn or amended, 
especially in a territory where a member of the Group is involved in a 
taxation dispute with a tax authority in relation to cross-border transactions, 
such withdrawal or amendment could materially adversely affect our 
business or results of operations, as could a negative outcome of a tax 
dispute or a failure by the tax authorities to agree through competent 
authority proceedings. See the Financial risk management policies section 
on page 81 for tax risk management policies and Note 27 to the Financial 
Statements on page 187 for details of current tax disputes.
Pensions
Our pension obligations are backed by assets invested across the broad 
investment market. Our most significant obligations relate to the UK 
pension fund.
Sustained falls in these asset values will strain pension fund solvency levels, 
which may result in requirements for additional cash, restricting cash 
available for strategic business growth. Similarly, if the liabilities increase 
due to a sustained low interest rate environment, this will reduce pension 
fund solvency ratios. The likely increase in the IAS 19 accounting deficit 
generated by any of these factors may cause the credit rating agencies to 
review our credit rating, with the potential to negatively affect our ability to 
raise debt. See Note 20 to the Financial Statements from page 162 for 
further details of the Group’s pension obligations.

222 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 2014 mandated biennial price cut. Strong 
demand in Japan continued for Nexium 
and Crestor , with sales increasing to 
$860 million (2013: $815 million; 2012: 
$665 million).
 > Emerging Markets sales increased by 
12% to $5,827 million (2013: $5,389 million, 
2012: $5,095 million), with sales growth in 
China of 22%. Volume growth on Brilinta, 
our diabetes and respiratory franchises, 
Nexium and Crestor , was partially offset 
by pricing pressure, predominantly in 
China and Asia Pacific.
2013 in brief
 > AstraZeneca was the second largest 
prescription-based pharmaceutical 
company in the US, with a 5.3% market 
share of US pharmaceuticals by sales 
value.
 > AstraZeneca was the ninth largest 
prescription-based pharmaceutical 
company in Europe, with a 2.9% market 
share of sales by value.
 > In the US, sales were down 9% to 
$9,691 million (2012: $10,655 million; 
201 1: $13,426 million). Loss of exclusivity 
on Seroquel IR in March 2012, as well as 
the impact of generic competition, notably 
on Crestor and Toprol-XL, was only 
partially offset by strong performance 
across our growth platforms, including 
Brilinta, Symbicort and our diabetes 
franchise, which increased by $225 million 
or 62%. In 2013, our diabetes franchise 
included a full calendar year of revenue for 
Bydureon, Byetta and Symlin. 
 > Sales in Europe were down 9% to 
$6,658 million (2012: $7 , 143 million; 201 1: 
$9,224 million). Key drivers of the decline 
were the ongoing volume erosion on 
Atacand, Seroquel IR, Nexium, Arimidex 
and Meronem following entry of generic 
competition and the negative price and 
volume impacts primarily related to 
government interventions. Seroquel XR 
faced a difficult year, with loss of market 
share, lower pricing and generic entries. 
These challenges were only partially offset 
by our growth platforms, including Brilique 
growth and the expansion of our diabetes 
offering through the Amylin franchise, as 
well as strong demand for Fluenz, 
particularly in the UK.
 > Established Rest of World sales were 
down 10%. Canada continued to be 
negatively impacted by generic erosion on 
Crestor and Nexium, with total sales down 
40%. Australian sales were also down as 
Crestor faced competition from generics. 
These trends were partially offset by 
growth in Japan, with sales up 4% to 
$2,485 million, due to strong demand for 
Nexium following the lifting of restrictions 
on length of prescriptions in October 2012.
 > Emerging Markets sales increased by 8% 
to $5,389 million (2012: $5,095 million), 
with sales growth in China of 19%.

US
AstraZeneca is the third largest prescription-
based pharmaceutical company in the US, 
with a 5.2% market share of US 
pharmaceuticals by sales value.
Sales in the US increased by 4% to 
$10, 120 million (2013: $9,691 million; 2012: 
$10,655 million), driven by an increase in 
diabetes franchise sales, aided by the 
acquisition of BMS’s 50% interest in the 
diabetes alliance, as well as strong 
performance across our growth platforms, 
including Symbicort and Brilinta offset by 
the continued impact of generic competition 
and lower Synagis sales due to new 
guidelines issued by the American Academy 
of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious 
Disease. Sales from our diabetes franchise 
increased by $644 million or 109% to 
$1,234 million.
Brilinta sales of $146 million increased 100% 
in 2014. Brilinta continued its momentum  
in the US, becoming the largest selling 
branded Oral Antiplatelet (OAP) in US 
hospital purchase volumes in September 
2014 and hospital discharge share for ACS, 
including both ST-Elevation and NSTE-ACS 
patients in the first half of 2014. Brilinta’s 
new-to-brand prescription share increased 
by 2.0 percentage points over 2013 to 8.2% 
in December 2014 and Brilinta achieved  
US branded leadership in OAP for the first 
time during the fourth quarter and in the 
December 2014 exit weekly share. Brilinta 
sales volume drivers included the closure  
in August 2014 of the PLATO investigation 
by the DOJ and gaining preference over 
clopidogrel in the American Heart 
Association and American College of 
Cardiology 2014 updated guidelines for the 
management of patients with NSTE-ACS. 
Growth rates in this Geographical  
Review are expressed at CER unless 
otherwise stated.
2014 in brief
 > AstraZeneca is the third largest 
prescription-based pharmaceutical 
company in the US, with a 5.2% market 
share of US pharmaceuticals by sales 
value.
 > AstraZeneca is the tenth largest 
prescription-based pharmaceutical 
company in Europe, with a 2.7% market 
share of sales by value.
 > In the US, sales increased by 4% to 
$10, 120 million (2013: $9,691 million; 2012: 
$10,655 million), driven by an increase in 
diabetes franchise sales, aided by the 
acquisition of BMS’s 50% interest in the 
diabetes alliance, as well as strong 
performance across our growth platforms, 
including Symbicort and Brilinta offset by 
the declines in revenue from Nexium, 
Seroquel IR and Synagis. Sales from our 
diabetes franchise increased by 
$644 million or 109% to $1,234 million.
 > Sales in Europe decreased by 1% to 
$6,638 million (2013: $6,658 million; 2012: 
$7 , 143 million). Key drivers of the decline 
were the ongoing volume erosion on 
Atacand and Seroquel XR following 
generic entry and the negative price and 
volume impacts primarily related to 
government pricing interventions. Crestor 
volumes declined 3% due to increased 
pressure from generic statins in a number 
of markets. Symbicort sales decreased to 
$1,462 million (2013: $1,502 million; 2012: 
$1,465 million) due to pricing pressure 
and the impact of Symbicort analogues. 
These challenges were partially offset by 
our growth platforms, including Brilique 
growth and the expansion of our diabetes 
portfolio following the acquisition of 
BMS’s interest in the joint diabetes 
alliance plus continued strong demand  
for Fluenz (2014: $70 million; 2013: 
$42 million; 2012: $3 million).
 > Established Rest of World sales 
decreased by 4% to $3,510 million (2013: 
$3,973 million; 2012: $5,080 million). 
Canada continued to be negatively 
impacted by erosion of Crestor and 
Nexium sales due to generic competition, 
with total sales down 1%. Sales in 
Australia were also lower due to generic 
competition to Crestor and Atacand. 
Sales growth in Japan declined by 3% to 
$2,227 million (2013: $2,485 million; 2012: 
$2,904 million), as a result of generic 
pressure on oncology products, Casodex 
and Arimidex, and the impact of the April 
223 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
Additional Information Additional Information
Geographical Review continued
rapidly growing GLP-1 market in December 
2014. Byetta achieved sales of $199 million.
The Farxiga launch in February 2014 
accelerated the growth of the SGLT-2 class 
of medicines by 1 15% post launch and grew 
the class prescribing base by 92%. By the 
end of December 2014, 170,807 patients 
were on Farxiga and Farxiga captured  
nearly one in three new SGLT-2 patient 
treatment decisions. The Xigduo XR launch 
in November 2014 is the first US approval  
of a once daily tablet combining an SGLT-2 
inhibitor and metformin HCl extended-
release and is an important addition to the 
diabetes franchise.
In 2014, sales of Synagis were down 19% 
to $499 million. A key driver of the decline 
was the newly issued guidelines from the 
American Academy of Pediatrics Committee 
on Infectious Disease that restricted patients 
eligible for preventive therapy with Synagis. 
FluMist Quadrivalent launched in the US  
in 2013 as the first and only FDA-approved 
nasal spray flu vaccine to help protect 
against four strains of influenza. FluMist 
revenues in the US were up 10% to  
$218 million (2013: $199 million; 2012:  
$174 million) driven in part by a new 
preferential recommendation published  
in August 2014 by the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices for 
use of live attenuated influenza vaccine in 
eligible children aged two to eight.
Nexium was the fourth most prescribed 
branded pharmaceutical in the US. Nexium 
sales declined 12% to $1,876 million (2013: 
$2, 123 million; 2012: $2,272 million) due 
primarily to volume erosion and pricing 
pressure. Nexium remains the branded 
market leader retaining significant 
prescription market share and volume within 
the proton pump inhibitor class. US sales 
benefited from the non-occurrence of a 
Nexium generic launch in 2014. However, 
we expect generic entry in the US in 2015.
The loss of exclusivity for Seroquel IR in 
March 2012 and unfavourable reserve 
adjustments for Medicaid liabilities and 
provisions taken on channel inventories 
resulted in negative sales for 2014 of 
$72 million (2013: negative $17 million; 2012:  
positive $697 million). The presence of 
generic competition has also impacted the 
prescription volume of Seroquel XR. Sales  
of Seroquel XR were down 1% to 
$738 million (2013: $743 million; 2012: 
$81 1 million) driven by lower volume. 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was 
enacted in March 2010, has had, and is 
expected to continue to have, a significant 
impact on our US sales and the US 
healthcare industry as a whole. In 2014, the 
overall measurable reduction in our profit 
before tax for the year due to discounts on 
branded pharmaceutical sales to Medicare 
Part D beneficiaries and an industry-wide 
excise fee was $714 million (2013: 
$557 million; 2012: $483 million). This 
amount reflects only those effects of the 
ACA that we know have had or will have  
a direct impact on our financial condition  
or results of operations and which we are 
therefore able to quantify based on known 
and isolatable resulting changes in individual 
financial items within our Financial 
Statements. There are other potential 
indirect or associated consequences of the 
implementation of the ACA, which continue 
to evolve and which cannot be estimated 
but could have similar impacts. These 
include broader changes in access to,  
or eligibility for, coverage under Medicare, 
Medicaid or similar government 
programmes. These could indirectly impact 
our pricing or sales of prescription products 
within the private sector. By their nature and 
the fact that these potentially numerous 
consequences are not directly linked to a 
corresponding and quantifiable impact on 
our Financial Statements, it is not possible 
to accurately estimate the financial impact  
of these potential consequences of the ACA 
or related legislative changes when taken 
together with the number of other market 
and industry-related factors that can also 
result in similar impacts. Further details on 
the impact of the ACA are contained in 
Pricing pressure in the Marketplace section 
from page 14 and in the Risk section from 
page 203.
Currently, there is no direct governmental 
control of prices for commercial prescription 
drug sales in the US. However, some 
publicly funded programmes, such as 
Medicaid and TRICARE (Department of 
Veterans Affairs), have statutorily mandated 
rebates and discounts that have the effect  
of price controls for these programmes. 
Additionally, pressure on pricing, availability 
and use of prescription drugs for both 
commercial and public payers continues  
to increase. This is driven by, among other 
things, an increased focus on generic 
alternatives. Budgetary policies within 
Crestor continued to demonstrate resilience 
in the highly competitive statin market, 88% 
of which is generic. Crestor achieved sales 
of $2,918 million (2013: $2,912 million;  
2012: $3, 164 million) and a total prescription 
share within the statin market of 9.4% in 
December 2014. Crestor sales in 2014 were 
in line with 2013 sales, with higher average 
prices contributing 4% due to one-time prior 
year adjustments, largely offset by volume 
declines of 4%. Crestor’s existing patient 
base remained solid, representing 95% of 
Crestor’s volume. Crestor’s Commercial/
Medicare preferred access was 84%  
at the end of 2014 (2013: 84%; 2012: 87%). 
In 2014, Crestor was the second most 
prescribed branded pharmaceutical in  
the US. 
Symbicort pMDI continued to deliver strong 
growth in the US, with sales up 23% to 
$1,51 1 million (2013: $1,233 million; 2012: 
$1,003 million), with a volume increase 
contributing 25% and prescription growth of 
30.6% versus 2013. Symbicort achieved a 
33. 1% total prescription share in the month 
of December 2014, up 6.8 percentage 
points over the month of December 2013  
in the ICS/LABA market. 
On 1 February 2014, we completed our 
acquisition of BMS’s 50% interest in our joint 
diabetes alliance. The acquisition gave us 
ownership of the IP and global rights  
for the development, manufacturing and 
commercialisation of the diabetes business, 
which includes Onglyza, Komboglyze, 
Kombiglyze XR, Farxiga/Forxiga, Xigduo, 
Xigduo XR, Byetta, Bydureon, Myalept  
and Symlin.
Onglyza/Kombiglyze XR revenues in  
the US were up 82% to $481 million (2013: 
$265 million; 2012: $237 million) primarily 
driven by the acquisition noted above, 
partially offset by lower average net  
price and prescription volume. The 
underlying prescription volume slightly 
declined as compared with 2013 as 
declines in prescription market share  
were partially offset by growth in the  
market for DPP-4 inhibitors.
Bydureon revenues in the US were 
$374 million. Bydureon achieved a 4.4% 
total prescription market share gain in  
2014 reflecting continued momentum of 
Bydureon with the launch of the Bydureon 
Pen in September 2014, with a total 
prescription market share of 20.7% of the 
224 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 XR and Atacand following generic entries 
resulted in a decrease in sales of 21% to 
$512 million (2013: $641 million; 2012:  
$960 million). Crestor sales declined 3%, 
with a 1% reduction in volumes and 2% 
reduction in prices as a result of increased 
competition from generic statins in a 
number of countries, including France and 
Italy. Government interventions continue to 
impact both price and volume negatively. 
Our growth platform sales partially offset 
these trends. Brilique sales reached  
$231 million (2013: $163 million; 2012: 
$57 million). Our diabetes franchise 
generated sales of $359 million (2013: 
$1 19 million; 2012: $50 million). Respiratory 
sales were negatively impacted by pricing 
pressure on Symbicort and the impact of 
Symbicort analogues, with sales declining 
to $1,462 million (2013: $1,502 million; 2012: 
$1,465 million), as volumes grew by 1%, 
while prices fell by 4%.
In Germany, sales increased by 5% to 
$693 million (2013: $657 million; 2012: 
$775 million), driven by strong growth 
across the diabetes portfolio, and the 
impact of our acquisition of BMS’s share of 
the global diabetes alliance. Total diabetes 
sales reached $108 million in 2014 (2013: 
$32 million; 2012: $1 1 million). Growth in 
diabetes was partly offset by the ongoing 
impact of market entries of generic versions 
of Atacand and Seroquel XR, as well as a 
Symbicort analogue. 
In the UK and Ireland, sales increased by 
3% to $832 million (2013: $766 million;  
2012: $764 million), driven by strong growth 
across the diabetes portfolio, including the 
impact of our acquisition of BMS’s share  
of the diabetes alliance. Diabetes sales 
reached $68 million in 2014 (2013: 
$27 million; 2012: $7 million) and Brilique 
sales grew to $30 million (2013: $18 million; 
2012: $4 million). The UK and Ireland 
experienced ongoing volume erosion on 
Seroquel XR following generic entries and  
a decline in Zoladex sales to $83 million 
(2013: $94 million; 2012: $100 million).
Sales in France decreased by 1% to  
$1,213 million (2013: $1,212 million; 2012: 
$1,314 million), driven largely by volume 
erosion on Atacand, Arimidex and Zoladex, 
following generic entries and subsequent 
government pricing interventions. Increased 
pressure from generic statins has adversely 
affected Crestor , with sales down 7% to 
$404 million (2013: $428 million; 2012: 
$424 million). France experienced growth of 
Seroquel XR in 2014 of 31%, with sales 
reaching $77 million (2013: $59 million; 2012: 
$37 million), Brilique with $30 million of sales 
(2013: $18 million; 2012: $2 million) and 
diabetes with $52 million of sales (2013: 
$20 million; 2012: $1 1 million).
Sales in Spain and Italy were down by 3%  
to $497 million (2013: $507 million; 2012: 
$510 million) and by 8% to $688 million 
(2013: $737 million; 2012: $777 million), 
respectively, mainly driven by generic  
entries and the implementation of volume 
prescription controls associated with 
existing and new austerity measures.
Established ROW
1
 
Established ROW sales decreased by 4%  
to $3,510 million (2013: $3,973 million; 2012: 
$5,080 million), driven by the continued 
impact of generic competition to Crestor, 
Nexium and Seroquel XR in Canada and 
volume erosion of Crestor and Atacand  
in Australia. Japan sales decreased 3%.  
The key products with sales growth in 
Established ROW in 2014 were Nexium, 
Symbicort, Brilinta, Byetta, and Onglyza.
Japan
Sales in Japan were $2,227 million, 
decreasing by 3% and negatively impacted 
on a reported basis by the revaluation of the 
Japanese yen (2013: $2,485 million; 2012: 
$2,904 million). Declining sales on Losec, 
Seroquel IR and other established oncology 
brands, as well as the impacts of the 
mandated biennial price cut and a recall of 
Nexium due to a packaging defect, were 
partially offset by continued strong 
performance from Nexium and Crestor. 
Nexium achieved sales of $358 million 
(2013: $278 million; 2012: $78 million). 
Crestor sales grew by 2%, retaining its 
position as the number one brand in the 
statin market in Japan. Symbicort sales 
grew by 30%, achieving a market share  
of 41.2%. 
Sales were also negatively impacted by 
higher than expected generic pressure for 
our non-promoted oncology products 
(principally Casodex).
Canada
Due to the full year impact of the ‘at risk’ 
launch of a generic version of Seroquel XR 
in Canada in the first quarter of 2013, and 
the continued impact from the loss of 
exclusivity of Crestor in April 2012 and the 
‘at risk’ launch of a generic version of 
Nexium in 201 1, Canadian sales decreased 
healthcare systems and providers, including 
the use of generics only formularies, and 
increases in patient co-insurance or 
co-payments, are the primary drivers of 
increased generics use. In 2014, 83.3%  
of prescriptions dispensed in the US were 
generic. While widespread adoption of a 
broad national price-control scheme in the 
near future is unlikely, increased focus on 
pharmaceutical prices and their impact on 
healthcare costs is likely to continue for the 
foreseeable future.
Rest of World
Sales performance outside the US in 2014 
was flat with sales of $15,975 million (2013: 
$16,020 million; 2012: $17 ,318 million) due  
to the ongoing impact of loss of exclusivity  
in 2014 of certain key products, competition 
from generic products and the continually 
challenging economic environment. This 
trend was partially offset by performance by 
our growth platforms, with Brilinta/Brilique 
up to $330 million (2013: $210 million; 2012: 
$70 million), our diabetes franchise up to 
$636 million (2013: $197 million; 2012: 
$86 million) and Symbicort up by 4% to 
$2,290 million (2013: $2,250 million; 2012: 
$2, 191 million). Emerging Markets delivered 
a strong performance, up 12% with sales  
of $5,827 million (2013: $5,389 million;  
2012: $5,095 million). 
Europe
AstraZeneca is the tenth largest 
pharmaceutical company in Europe, with 
a 2.7% market share of prescription sales  
by value. 
Despite a slight improvement in conditions, 
the macroeconomic environment remains 
challenging, with the ongoing impact of 
austerity measures leading to increased 
pressure on healthcare budgets. Most 
governments in Europe intervene directly  
to control the price, volume and 
reimbursement of medicines. Several 
governments have imposed price 
reductions and increased the use of generic 
medicines as part of healthcare expenditure 
controls. A number of countries are applying 
strict criteria for cost-effectiveness evaluations 
of medicines, which has delayed and 
reduced access to medicines for patients  
in areas of important unmet medical need. 
These and other measures all contribute  
to an increasingly difficult environment for 
branded pharmaceuticals in Europe. 
Total sales in Europe were down 1% to 
$6,638 million (2013: $6,658 million; 2012: 
$7 , 143 million). Volume erosion on Seroquel

the largest sales force among multinational 
pharmaceutical companies in China. The 
number of hospitals covered grew by 40%.
Other Emerging Markets
2
We continued to build our presence in 
Russia, with sales growing by 18% to  
$312 million (2013: $310 million; 2012:  
$314 million) from strong performance  
in the retail segment. To increase access  
to our medicines, we established patient 
affordability programmes in 27 regions. The 
Russian market grew by 10% during 2014, 
with AstraZeneca outperforming the market 
as a result of growth in retail market share, 
especially from Crestor, Faslodex and 
Symbicort. We have 550 clinical trial sites  
in 37 cities. Our new production facility  
in Vorsino is expected to commence 
commercial production in 2015.
The Latin American pharmaceutical  
market continues to grow. However,  
in many countries, growth is being 
predominantly captured by generics, 
branded generics and private label product 
offerings. Sales were up 8% to $1, 181 million 
(2013: $1, 188 million; 2012: $1,331 million) 
driven principally by Brazil, which grew by 
10% to $451 million (2013: $447 million; 
2012: $497 million), following successful 
launch of Forxiga and continued strong 
uptake of Brilinta. Sales in Argentina also 
grew rapidly by 36% and although Mexico 
has been impacted by penetration of 
generic products in the market, sales grew 
by 5% to $210 million (2013: $206 million; 
2012: $243 million), driven by the diabetes 
and respiratory growth platforms and  
as inventory held in the supply chain  
by customers stabilised following a 
reduction in 2013. 
In the Middle East and Africa, despite 
political challenges arising from the ‘Arab 
Spring’ revolutions of 2012 and broader 
political conflict, sales grew by 7%, driven  
by strong growth in Egypt, the Gulf states, 
several emerging markets in Africa as well 
as steady growth in Turkey. Sales were flat 
in South Africa and declined by 7% in Saudi 
Arabia as a result of generic entries and 
pricing interventions. Sales in Asia increased 
by 7% to $948 million (2013: $900 million; 
2012: $829 million) led by South Korea, 
where sales grew 8% to $314 million (2013: 
$280 million; 2012: $239 million) driven by 
Brilinta, our diabetes franchise and Nexium. 
Sales grew at double-digit rates in Vietnam, 
Malaysia, Indonesia and India, offsetting a 
modest decline in sales in Thailand by 3%  
to $79 million (2013: $87 million; 2012:  
$97 million) as a result of government 
interventions and generic competition  
to Crestor.
Launches in Emerging Markets in 2014 
included: Brilinta in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, 
South Africa and Venezuela; Forxiga in 1 1 
markets, including Brazil, Russia, Mexico, 
Argentina, South Korea and Malaysia; 
Bydureon in Colombia, Kuwait and South 
Korea; and Zinforo in Brazil and Mexico.
by 1% to $590 million (2013: $637 million; 
2012: $1,090 million). This decline was 
partially offset by performance by our 
diabetes franchise aided by our acquisition 
of BMS’s interest in the diabetes alliance 
and strong performance by Symbicort  
with sales up 8% to $159 million (2013: 
$146 million; 2012: $153 million).
Other Established ROW

Sales in Other Established ROW declined  
by 13% to $693 million (2013: $851 million; 
2012: $1,086 million). Sales in Australia 
declined by 13% to $658 million (2013: 
$817 million; 2012: $1,052 million) due to 
continued volume erosion on Crestor and 
Atacand following generic entries in 2013 
and pricing pressure on other mature 
brands (Seroquel and Arimidex). Nexium 
sales declined following generic entry in 
Australia in August 2014. 
Emerging Markets
In Emerging Markets, sales increased by 
12% to $5,827 million (2013: $5,389 million; 
2012: $5,095 million), which was principally 
driven by growth in China, Russia, Brazil 
and Argentina, and growth across a broad 
range of markets in our strategic growth 
platforms – Brilinta, and our diabetes and 
respiratory franchises.
In many of the larger markets, such as Brazil 
and Mexico, patients tend to pay directly for 
prescription medicines and consequently, 
these markets are at less risk of direct 
government interventions on pricing and 
reimbursement. In other markets, such as 
South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey, where 
governments pay for medicines, we are 
seeing continued efforts to reduce the cost 
of prescriptions in line with the efforts in 
Europe, Canada and Australia. 
China
Sales in China (excluding Hong Kong)  
grew by 22% to $2,242 million (2013: 
$1,840 million; 2012: $1,512 million). 
AstraZeneca remained the second largest 
pharmaceutical company in China during 
2014. We saw strong sales of Crestor and 
Symbicort, with sales growth of 47% and 
78% respectively. Nexium and Pulmicort 
also continue to grow rapidly. In 2013, 
Brilinta was launched in China, and we  
have made positive progress on the listing  
of Brilinta, Byetta and Onglyza into key 
hospitals. We continued to increase our

Responsible Business
 > Employee safety, health and wellbeing: 
promoting the safety, health and wellbeing 
of all our people worldwide as we 
continue to drive a high-performance 
culture and the achievement of our 
business goals (see page 64).
 > Working with suppliers: working only with 
suppliers who have standards consistent 
with our own as we increase our 
outsourcing to drive business efficiency 
(see page 57).
 > Community investment: making a positive 
contribution to our local communities 
around the world, through community 
support programmes consistent with 
improving health and promoting science 
(see page 65). 
While we monitor performance in each of 
these areas of our business, we have 
identified two areas of special focus: access 
to healthcare and the environment. In each 
case, we believe that we have both the 
capability and the responsibility to 
implement standards that accelerate our 
business strategy while delivering wider 
benefits to society.
A core element of our business strategy is 
value-creating business development 
activity that strengthens our pipeline and 
accelerates growth. This includes targeted 
acquisitions. When we acquire companies 
we aim to align standards of responsible 
business and incorporate the companies 
into the setting of targets and measurement 
of performance.
Benchmarking
As expectations of stakeholders evolve, we 
continue to engage with them and use the 
feedback to inform the development of our 
responsible business strategy and risk 
management planning.
We also use the insights we gain from 
external surveys to develop our approach in 
line with global best practice. As a member 
of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index since 
2001, we were once again listed in the 2014 
World Index (the top 10% of the largest 
2,500 companies). We also retained our 
listing on the DJSI STOXX – European Index 
(the top 20% of the 600 largest European 
companies) for the seventh year running 
(one of four pharmaceutical companies to 
do so out of 14 assessed). We achieved a 
total score of 79% (2013: 85%) compared 
with a sector best score of 87% (2013: 
86%). We increased individual scores for 
seven out of 24 criteria for 2014 (compared 
with eight out of 22 criteria in 2013) including 
customer relationship management, risk 
and crisis management, climate strategy, 
talent attraction and retention, corporate 
citizenship and philanthropy, stakeholder 
engagement, and addressing cost burden. 
While these scores are encouraging, we  
lost ground in some areas, such as 
corporate governance, marketing practices, 
innovation management, human capital 
development, social reporting, occupational 
health and safety, environmental reporting 
and bioethics. 
To better understand these lower scores, 
we commissioned an in-depth external 
benchmark survey and the analysis will be 
used to inform our improvement planning.
Responsible business governance
The SET is responsible for our responsible 
business framework and our Non-Executive 
Director, Nancy Rothwell, oversees 
implementation and reporting to the Board. 
Senior managers throughout the Group are 
accountable for operating responsibly within 
their areas, taking into account national, 
functional, and site issues and priorities. 
Line managers are accountable for ensuring 
that their teams understand the requirements 
and that people are clear about what is 
expected of them as they work to achieve 
AstraZeneca’s business goals.
Our Responsible Business Council (the 
Council) is chaired by our Vice-President, 
Corporate Affairs, and members include 
senior leaders from each relevant SET area. 
Its agenda is focused on driving long-term 
value creation by agreeing, among  
other things
 > responsible business priorities for the 
Group in line with strategic business 
objectives
 > managing and monitoring the annual 
process of setting responsible business 
objectives and targets, as well as 
reviewing performance against KPIs 
 > appropriate policy positions to support 
our objectives and reputation 
management.
In this section, we describe our approach to 
delivering business success responsibly. 
Summary information about our commitment 
and performance in key areas is integrated 
into the relevant sections of this Annual 
Report, while further information about these 
and other areas is available on our website, 
www.astrazeneca.com/responsibility.
Introduction
In the Strategy section from page 10, we 
describe our approach to creating value 
across the life-cycle of a medicine, our 
distinctive capabilities and our strategy. 
All these efforts are underpinned by our 
commitment to operating responsibly 
to ensure the future sustainability of the 
Company in a way that adds value for our 
stakeholders. To that end, our responsible 
business objectives are aligned to, and 
support the delivery of, our business 
strategy. Our responsible business 
framework is the vehicle for managing 
commitments that are agreed across the 
Group, taking account of external 
stakeholder insights and internal reputational 
risk assessment. 
The framework encompasses:
 > Bioethics: underpinning our accelerated 
drive for innovation with sound bioethics 
worldwide (see page 54). 
 > Access to healthcare: as we expand our 
geographic footprint, exploring ways of 
increasing access to healthcare for more 
people, tailored locally to different patient 
needs (see page 61). 
 > Diversity and inclusion: working to ensure 
that diversity in its broadest sense is 
reflected in our leadership and people 
strategies (see page 63). 
 > The environment: managing our impact 
on the environment, across all our 
operations, with a particular focus on 
carbon emissions, waste and water use 
(see page 58).
 > Patient safety: maintaining a strong focus 
on patient safety in everything we do, 
minimising the risks and maximising the 
benefits of all our medicines throughout 
R&D, and after launch (see page 54).
 > Sales and marketing: working to 
consistent global standards of ethical 
sales and marketing practices in all our 
markets as we work to restore growth 
(see page 61).
 > Human rights: continuing to develop and 
embed a consistent approach to human 
rights across our worldwide activities (see 
page 63).

228 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 Additional Information
Core gross margin in 2013 was 82.0%, 
0.5 percentage points lower than 2012 at 
CER (Actual: 0.4 percentage points) driven 
by changes in our product mix to lower 
margin products.
Core R&D expenditure in 2013 was up 1% 
at CER and Actual, as a result of absorbing 
higher costs from business development 
projects as well as investment in the growing 
number of late-stage trials. 
Core SG&A costs in 2013 were 7% higher 
than 2012 at CER (Actual: 6%), as a result of 
increased levels of expenditure in support of 
our growth platforms of Brilinta/Brilique, the 
diabetes franchise and Emerging Markets 
during 2013. SG&A costs also reflect a full 
year of costs associated with our expanded 
diabetes alliance with BMS on Amylin 
products entered into in 2012. The excise 
fee imposed by the enactment of US 
healthcare reform measures amounted 
to 2.7% (2012: 2.8%) of Core SG&A costs 
in 2013.
Core other income in 2013 was down 30% 
at CER and Actual, with 2012 benefiting 
from the sale of OTC rights for Nexium. 
The 2013 Core operating profit was down 
22% on a CER basis (Actual: 25%) to 
$8,390 million. Core operating margin in 
2013 was 32.6% of revenue, down 6.9 
percentage points at CER (Actual: 7 .3 
percentage points). The decline in Core 
operating profit was greater than the decline 
in revenue primarily due to expenditure 
associated with the Group’s growth 
platforms and strengthened pipeline.
The 2013 revenue decreased 6% on a CER 
basis and 8% on an Actual basis compared 
with 2012. The revenue decline was driven 
by a loss of exclusivity on brands including 
Atacand, Crestor, Nexium and Seroquel IR, 
which reduced revenue by $2.2 billion at 
CER. Our growth platforms of Brilinta/
Brilique, the diabetes franchise (which 
benefited from a full year of Amylin-related 
product sales), respiratory, Emerging 
Markets and Japan delivered an incremental 
$1.2 billion of revenue at CER in 2013. 2013 
revenue in the US was down 9% on a CER 
basis (Actual: 9%) with revenue in the Rest 
of World down 4% at CER (Actual: 7%). 
Emerging Markets sales increased by 8% at 
CER (Actual: 6%). Further details of our 
sales performance are contained in the

Financials (Prior year)
229 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
Additional Information Additional Information
Financials (Prior year) continued
mainly the result of the $1,758 million 
impairment of Bydureon, as well as the full 
year amortisation related to the Merck 
Second Option. 
Net finance expense in 2013 was 
$445 million (2012: $502 million). Interest 
payable on defined benefit pension scheme 
liabilities fell by $14 million, and there were 
fair value gains of $5 million recorded on 
long-term bonds in 2013, versus $10 million 
losses in 2012. Interest on long-term bonds 
for 2013 was $16 million lower than 2012.
The 2013 Reported taxation charge of 
$696 million (2012: $1,376 million) consisted 
of a current tax charge of $1,398 million 
(2012: $1,677 million) and a credit arising 
from movements on deferred tax of 
$702 million (2012: $301 million). The current 
tax charge includes a prior period current 
tax charge of $46 million (2012: credit of 
$79 million).
The Reported tax rate for 2013 was 21.3% 
compared with 18% for 2012. The Reported 
tax rate for the year ended 31 December 
2012 benefited from a $230 million 
adjustment to deferred tax balances 
following substantive enactment of a 
reduction in the Swedish corporation tax 
rate from 26.3% to 22%, and a $240 million 
adjustment in respect of prior periods 
following the settlement of a transfer pricing 
matter. Excluding these benefits, the 
Reported tax rate for 2012 was 24. 1%. 
Further details relating to movements in our 
taxation balances are included in Note 4 to 
the Financial Statements from page 145.
Total comprehensive income for  
2013 decreased by $3,947 million to 
$2,458 million. This was driven by the 
decrease in profit of $3,699 million,  
and a decrease of $248 million in  
other comprehensive income, which  
was principally due to the effects of 
movements in exchange rates on our 
consolidated results. 
Cash flow and liquidity – 2013
All data in this section is on a Reported 
basis. 
Cash generated from operating activities 
was $7 ,400 million for the year ended  
31 December 2013, compared with 
$6,948 million in 2012. Lower tax and 
interest payments partially offset the lower 
operating profit in 2013, after adjusting for 
impairments and non-cash costs, while 
working capital movements and a one-off 
pension fund contribution drove higher 
outflows in 2012. 
Investment cash outflows of $3, 1 12 million  
in 2013 (2012: $5,607 million) included 
$1, 158 million on completion of the 
acquisitions of Pearl Therapeutics, Omthera, 
Amplimmune and Spirogen, and 
$1,316 million for the purchase of other 
intangible assets. The 2012 comparative 
period included the cash outflows for the 
purchase of Ardea ($1, 187 million) and 
intangible assets associated with our 
collaboration with BMS on Amylin  
($3,358 million).
Net cash distributions to shareholders in 
2013 were $2,979 million, through dividends 
of $3,461 million partially offset by proceeds 
from the issue of shares of $482 million. 
At 31 December 2013, outstanding gross 
debt (interest-bearing loans and borrowings) 
was $10,376 million (2012: $10,310 million). 
Of the gross debt outstanding at 31 
December 2013, $1,788 million is due within 
one year (2012: $901 million). 
Net funds were $39 million at 31 December 
2013, an increase of $1,408 million due to 
the net cash inflow as described above.
Financial position – 2013
All data in this section is on a Reported 
basis.
In 2013, net assets decreased by 
$693 million to $23,253 million. The 
decrease in net assets is broadly as a result 
of the 2013 Group profit of $2,571 million 
being offset by dividends of $3,499 million.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment decreased 
by $271 million to $5,818 million in 2013. 
Additions of $816 million (2012: $772 million) 
were offset by depreciation of $906 million 
(2012: $1,023 million), impairments of 
$101 million (2012: $nil) and disposals  
of $82 million (2012: $224 million).
Goodwill and intangible assets
Our goodwill of $9,981 million at 31 
December 2013 (2012: $9,898 million) 
principally arose on the acquisition of 
MedImmune in 2007 and the restructuring 
of our US joint venture with Merck in 1998. 
Goodwill of $77 million arising on our 
acquisitions of Pearl Therapeutics and 
Core EPS was $5.05 in 2013, down 23% 
compared with 2012 at CER (Actual: 26%), 
and broadly in line with the decline in Core 
operating profit. 
Pre-tax adjustments to arrive at Core 
amounted to $4,678 million in 2013 (2012: 
$3,01 1 million). Excluded from Core  
results were: 
 > Restructuring costs totalling $1,421 million 
(2012: $1,558 million), incurred as the 
Group commenced the fourth phase of 
restructuring announced in March 2013. 
 > Amortisation totalling $1,591 million (2012: 
$1, 134 million) relating to intangible assets, 
except for IT-related amortisation charges. 
The increase was driven by a full year of 
amortisation arising from the amendment 
to the Merck exit arrangements and the 
expansion of our diabetes alliance during 
2012, as detailed in Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements from page 153.
 > New intangible impairment charges of 
$1,712 million (2012: $186 million), 
including $1,758 million against Bydureon, 
following sales performance below 
AstraZeneca’s commercial expectations at 
the time of entering into the expanded 
diabetes alliance in 2012, and $136 million 
following AstraZeneca’s decision not to 
proceed with regulatory filings for 
fostamatinib. Partially offsetting these 
charges was the impairment reversal of 
$285 million following the commencement 
in 2013 of the first of several Phase III 
clinical programmes for olaparib. The full 
historic carrying value of the asset has 
been restored to our balance sheet. 
Further details relating to intangible asset 
impairments are included in Note 9 to the 
Financial Statements from page 153.
 > Legal provisions and other adjustments of 
$46 million income (2012: $133 million 
charges) including an $18 million 
adjustment to the fair value of contingent 
consideration payable arising from our 
business combinations completed in 
2013, as detailed in Notes 19 and 24 to 
the Financial Statements on page 162 
and from page 170.
The 2013 Reported operating profit was 
down 51% at CER (Actual: 54%) to 
$3,712 million; Reported EPS was down 
55% on a CER basis in 2013 (Actual: 59%) 
to $2.04. The larger declines compared with 
the respective Core financial measures are 
230 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 on the acquisitions of Pearl Therapeutics 
($149 million), Omthera ($62 million), 
Amplimmune ($153 million) and Spirogen 
($168 million).
Provisions increased by $45 million in  
2013, including $771 million of additional 
charges recorded in the year, offset by 
$681 million of cash payments. Included 
within the $771 million of charges for 2013 
was $652 million for our global restructuring 
initiative and $23 million in respect of  
legal charges. Cash payments in 2013 
included $532 million for our global 
restructuring programme. 
Tax payable and receivable
Net income tax payable in 2013 increased 
by $523 million to $2,582 million, principally 
due to cash tax timing differences and an 
increase in accruals for tax contingencies. 
The 31 December 2013 tax receivable 
balance of $494 million comprised tax 
owing to AstraZeneca from certain 
governments expected to be received on 
settlements of transfer pricing audits and 
disputes and cash tax timing differences. 
Net deferred tax liabilities increased by 
$157 million in 2013.
Retirement benefit obligations
Net retirement benefit obligations  
decreased by $10 million in 2013.  
Employer contributions to the pension 
scheme of $369 million were offset by 
current and past service cost charges  
of $204 million, net financing costs of 
$79 million and exchange movements. 
Amplimmune, as detailed in Note 24 to the 
Financial Statements from page 170, was 
capitalised in 2013.
Intangible assets amounted to 
$16,047 million at 31 December 2013  
(2012: $16,448 million). Intangible asset 
additions were $3,217 million in 2013  
(2012: $6,916 million), including product 
rights acquired in our acquisitions of Pearl 
Therapeutics ($985 million), Omthera  
($526 million), Amplimmune ($534 million) 
and Spirogen ($371 million). Amortisation  
in 2013 was $1,779 million (2012: 
$1,296 million). Impairment charges in  
2013 amounted to $2,082 million (2012: 
$199 million) including a $1,758 million 
charge on our diabetes product Bydureon 
and a $136 million impairment charge 
following our decision not to proceed with 
regulatory filings for fostamatinib. These 
2013 impairment charges were partially 
offset by a $285 million impairment reversal 
following enrolment of the first patient in the 
first of several Phase III clinical programmes 
for olaparib, an impairment provision 
previously having been taken against this 
compound in 201 1. 
Further details of our additions to intangible 
assets, and recorded impairments, are 
included in Note 9 to the Financial 
Statements from page 153. 
Receivables, payables and provisions
Trade receivables decreased by $182 million 
to $5,514 million in line with lower revenues 
in 2013. 
Prepayments and accrued income 
increased by $1,988 million driven, 
principally, by an increase in prepayments 
following the modification of the royalty 
structure under our global licence 
agreement for Crestor , which was amended 
to include fixed minimum and maximum 
annual royalty payments to Shionogi.  
These future royalties were recognised 
within payables and as a prepayment. 
Prepayments also increased due to 
payments made to Moderna Therapeutics 
and Immunocore during 2013 on new 
research collaborations. 
Trade and other payables increased by 
$2,492 million in 2013 to $12,714 million, 
with increases in other payables of 
$2,277 million due to the recognition  
of future royalty payments on Crestor,  
as detailed above, and contingent 
consideration of $532 million recognised

 Includes Euroclear and ADR holdings.
At 31 December 2014, the Company had 
100,371 registered holders of 1,263, 143,338 
Ordinary Shares. There were 104,555 
holders of Ordinary Shares held under the 
Euroclear Services Agreement, representing 
1 1.6% of the issued share capital of the 
Company and approximately 249,000 
holders of ADRs, representing 9.6% of the 
issued share capital of the Company. Each 
ADR is equivalent to one Ordinary Share. 
With effect from 6 February 2015, Citibank 
N.A. (Citibank) succeeded JPMorgan  
Chase Bank (JPMorgan) as depositary  
of the ADRs. 
In 1999, in connection with the merger 
between Astra and Zeneca through which 
the Company was formed, the Company’s 
share capital was redenominated in US 
dollars. On 6 April 1999, Zeneca shares 
were cancelled and US dollar shares issued, 
credited as fully paid on the basis of one 
dollar share for each Zeneca share then 
held. This was achieved by a reduction of 
capital under section 135 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Upon the reduction of capital 
becoming effective, all issued and unissued 
Zeneca shares were cancelled and the sum 
arising as a result of the share cancellation 
credited to a special reserve, which was 
converted into US dollars at the rate of 
exchange prevailing on the record date. This 
US dollar reserve was then applied in paying 
up, at par, newly created US dollar shares.
At the same time as the US dollar shares 
were issued, the Company issued 50,000 
Redeemable Preference Shares for cash, at 
par. The Redeemable Preference Shares 
carry limited class voting rights, no dividend 
rights and are capable of redemption, at par, 
at the option of the Company on the giving 
of seven days’ written notice to the 
registered holder of the Redeemable 
Preference Shares.
A total of 826 million Ordinary Shares were 
issued to Astra shareholders who accepted 
the merger offer before the final closing 
date, 21 May 1999. The Company received 
acceptances from Astra shareholders 
representing 99.6% of Astra’s shares and 
the remaining 0.4% was acquired in 2000, 
for cash.
Since April 1999, following the merger of 
Astra and Zeneca, the principal markets for 
trading in the shares of the Company are 
the London Stock Exchange (LSE), the 
Stockholm Stock Exchange (SSE) and  
the NYSE. The table opposite sets out, for

Shareview
The Company’s shareholders with  
internet access may visit the website,  
www.shareview.co.uk, and register their 
details to create a portfolio. Shareview is  
a free and secure online service from the 
Company’s registrar, Equiniti Limited, which 
gives access to shareholdings, including 
balance movements, indicative share prices 
and information about recent dividends.
ShareGift
The Company welcomes and values all  
of its shareholders, no matter how many  
or how few shares they own. However, 
shareholders who have only a small number 
of shares whose value makes it uneconomic 
to sell them, either now or at some stage in 
the future, may wish to consider donating 
them to charity through ShareGift, an 
independent charity share donation 
scheme. One feature of the scheme is that 
there is no gain or loss for UK capital gains 
tax purposes on gifts of shares through 
ShareGift, and it may now also be possible 
to obtain UK income tax relief on the 
donation. Further information about 
ShareGift can be found on its website, 
www.sharegift.org, or by contacting 
ShareGift on 020 7930 3737 or at 17  
Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5AH. 
ShareGift is administered by The Orr 
Mackintosh Foundation, registered charity 
number 1052686. More information about 
the UK tax position on gifts of shares  
to ShareGift can be obtained from  
HM Revenue & Customs on its website,

The Unclaimed Assets Register
The Company supplies unclaimed dividend 
data to the Unclaimed Assets Register 
(UAR), which provides investors who have 
lost track of shareholdings with an 
opportunity to search the UAR’s database 
of unclaimed financial assets on payment of 
a small fixed fee. The UAR donates part of 
the search fee to charity. The UAR can be

Taxation for US persons
The following summary of material UK and 
US federal income tax consequences of 
ownership of Ordinary Shares or ADRs held 
as capital assets by the US resident holders 
described below is based on current UK 
and US federal income tax law, including the 
US/UK double taxation convention relating 
to income and capital gains, which  
entered into force on 31 March 2003  
(the Convention). This summary does not 
describe all of the tax consequences that 
may be relevant in light of the US resident 
holders’ particular circumstances and tax 
consequences applicable to US resident 
holders subject to special rules (such as 
certain financial institutions, entities treated 
as partnerships for US federal income tax 
purposes, persons whose functional 
currency for US federal income tax 
purposes is not the US dollar, tax-exempt 
entities, persons subject to alternative 
minimum tax, persons subject to the 
Medicare contribution tax on ‘net 
investment income’, or persons holding 
Ordinary Shares or ADRs in connection with 
a trade or business conducted outside of 
the US). US resident holders are urged to 
consult their tax advisers regarding the  
UK and US federal income tax 
consequences of the ownership and 
disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs  
in their particular circumstances. 
This summary is based in part on 
representations of JPMorgan and Citibank 
as depositaries for ADRs and assumes that 
each obligation in the deposit agreement 
among the Company and the depositaries 
and the holders from time to time of  
ADRs and any related agreements will be 
performed in accordance with its terms. The 
US Treasury has expressed concerns that 
parties to whom American depositary 
shares are released before shares are 
234 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014 rate of the relevant foreign currency on  
the date the dividend is received by the US 
resident holders, regardless of whether the 
dividend is converted into US dollars), and  
it will not be eligible for the dividends 
received deduction generally available to US 
corporations. If the dividend is converted 
into US dollars on the date of receipt, US 
resident holders of Ordinary Shares 
generally should not be required to 
recognise foreign currency gains or losses  
in respect of the dividend income. They may 
have foreign currency gain or loss (taxable 
at the rates applicable to ordinary income)  
if the amount of such dividend is converted 
into US dollars after the date of its receipt.
Subject to applicable limitations and the 
discussion above regarding concerns 
expressed by the US Treasury, dividends 
received by certain non-corporate US 
resident holders of Ordinary Shares or 
ADRs may be taxable at favourable US 
federal income tax rates. US resident 
holders should consult their own tax 
advisers to determine whether they are 
subject to any special rules which may  
limit their ability to be taxed at these 
favourable rates.
Taxation on capital gains
Under present English law, individuals who 
are neither resident nor ordinarily resident  
in the UK, and companies which are not 
resident in the UK, will not be liable for UK 
tax on capital gains made on the disposal  
of their Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless 
such Ordinary Shares or ADRs are held  
in connection with a trade, profession  
or vocation carried on in the UK through  
a branch or agency or other permanent 
establishment.
A US resident holder will generally recognise 
US source capital gains or losses for US 
federal income tax purposes on the sale or 
exchange of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in an 
amount equal to the difference between the 
US dollar amount realised and such holder’s 
US dollar tax basis in the Ordinary Shares or 
ADRs. US resident holders should consult 
their own tax advisers about the treatment 
of capital gains, which may be taxed at 
lower rates than ordinary income for 
non-corporate US resident holders and 
capital losses, the deductibility of which  
may be subject to limitation.
Passive Foreign Investment Company 
(PFIC) rules 
We believe that we were not a PFIC for US 
federal income tax purposes for the year 
ended 31 December 2014. However, since 
PFIC status depends on the composition  
of our income and assets, and the market 
value of our assets (including, among 
others, less than 25% owned equity 
investments), from time to time, there can be 
no assurance that we will not be considered 
a PFIC for any taxable year. If we were 
treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during 
which Ordinary Shares or ADRs were held, 
certain adverse tax consequences could 
apply to US resident holders.
Information reporting and backup 
withholding
Payments of dividends and sales proceeds 
that are made within the US or through 
certain US-related financial intermediaries 
may be subject to information reporting  
and backup withholding, unless: (i) the US 
resident holder is a corporation or other 
exempt recipient; or (ii) in the case of backup 
withholding, the US resident holder provides 
a correct taxpayer identification number  
and certifies that it is not subject to backup 
withholding. The amount of any backup 
withholding from a payment to a US 
resident holder will be allowed as a credit 
against the holder’s US federal income  
tax liability and may entitle the holder  
to a refund, provided that the required 
information is timely supplied to the US 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Certain US resident holders who are 
individuals (and under proposed US 
Treasury regulations, certain entities), may 
be required to report information relating  
to securities issued by non-US persons  
(or foreign accounts through which the 
securities are held), generally on IRS Form 
8938, subject to certain exceptions 
(including an exception for securities held  
in accounts maintained by US financial 
institutions). US resident holders should 
consult their tax advisers regarding their 
reporting obligations with respect to the 
Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
UK inheritance tax
Under the current Double Taxation (Estates) 
Convention (the Estate Tax Convention) 
between the US and the UK, Ordinary 
Shares or ADRs held by an individual 
shareholder who is domiciled for the 
delivered to the depositary (pre-release),  
or intermediaries in the chain of ownership 
between holders and the issuer of the 
security underlying the American depositary 
shares, may be taking actions that are 
inconsistent with the claiming, by US 
holders of American depositary shares,  
of foreign tax credits for US federal income 
tax purposes. Such actions would also be 
inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced 
tax rates, described below, applicable to 
dividends received by certain non-corporate 
US resident holders. Accordingly, the 
availability of the reduced tax rates for 
dividends received by certain non-corporate 
US resident holders could be affected by 
actions that may be taken by parties to 
whom ADRs are pre-released.
For the purposes of this summary, the term 
‘US resident holder’ means a beneficial 
owner of Ordinary Shares or ADRs that  
is, for US federal income tax purposes, a 
citizen or resident of the US, a corporation 
(or other entity taxable as a corporation) 
created or organised in or under the laws of 
the US, any state in the US or the District of 
Columbia, or an estate or trust, the income 
of which is subject to US federal income 
taxation regardless of its source.
This summary assumes that we are not, 
and will not become, a passive foreign 
investment company, as discussed below.
UK and US income taxation of 
dividends
The UK does not currently impose a 
withholding tax on dividends paid by  
a UK company, such as the Company.
For US federal income tax purposes, 
distributions paid by the Company to a US 
resident holder are included in gross income 
as foreign source ordinary dividend income 
to the extent paid out of the Company’s 
current or accumulated earnings and profits, 
calculated in accordance with US federal 
income tax principles. The Company does 
not maintain calculations of its earnings  
and profits under US federal income tax 
principles and so it is expected that 
distributions generally will be reported to US 
resident holders as dividends. The amount 
of the dividend will be the US dollar amount 
received by the depositary for US resident 
holders of ADRs (or, in the case of Ordinary 
Shares, the US dollar value of the foreign 
currency payment, determined at the spot 
235 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2014
Additional Information Additional Information
UK stamp duty reserve tax  
and stamp duty
A charge to UK stamp duty or UK stamp 
duty reserve tax (SDRT) may arise on the 
deposit of Ordinary Shares in connection 
with the creation of ADRs. The rate of stamp 
duty or SDRT will generally be 1.5% of the 
value of the consideration or, in some 
circumstances, the value of the Ordinary 
Shares. There is no 1.5% SDRT charge  
on the issue of Ordinary Shares (or, where  
it is integral to the raising of new capital,  
the transfer of Ordinary Shares) into the  
ADR arrangement. 
No UK stamp duty will be payable on the 
acquisition or transfer of existing ADRs 
provided that any instrument of transfer or 
written agreement to transfer is executed 
outside the UK and remains at all times 
outside the UK. An agreement for the 
transfer of ADRs will not give rise to a liability 
for SDRT.
A transfer of, or an agreement to, transfer 
Ordinary Shares will generally be subject  
to UK stamp duty or SDRT at 0.5% of the 
amount or value of any consideration, 
provided, in the case of stamp duty, it is 
rounded to the nearest £5.
Transfers of Ordinary Shares into CREST  
will generally not be subject to stamp duty 
or SDRT, unless such a transfer is made for 
a consideration in money or money’s worth, 
in which case a liability to SDRT will arise, 
usually at the rate of 0.5% of the value  
of the consideration. Paperless transfers  
of Ordinary Shares within CREST are 
generally liable to SDRT at the rate of 0.5% 
of the value of the consideration. CREST  
is obliged to collect SDRT from the 
purchaser on relevant transactions settled 
within the system.
Exchange controls and other 
limitations affecting security holders
There are no governmental laws, decrees  
or regulations in the UK restricting the 
import or export of capital or affecting the 
remittance of dividends, interest or other 
payments to non-resident holders of 
Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
There are no limitations under English law  
or the Articles on the right of non-resident or 
foreign owners to be the registered holders 
of, or to exercise voting rights in relation to, 
Ordinary Shares or ADRs or to be registered 
holders of notes or debentures of Zeneca 
Wilmington Inc. or the Company.
Exchange rates 
The following information relating to  
average and spot exchange rates used by 
AstraZeneca is provided for convenience:
purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in 
the US, and is not for the purposes of the 
Estate Tax Convention a national of the  
UK, will generally not be subject to UK 
inheritance tax on the individual’s death or 
on a chargeable gift of the Ordinary Shares 
or ADRs during the individual’s lifetime, 
provided that any applicable US federal  
gift or estate tax liability is paid, unless the 
Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part of the 
business property of a permanent 
establishment of the individual in the UK or, 
in the case of a shareholder who performs 
independent personal services, pertain to  
a fixed base situated in the UK. Where  
the Ordinary Shares or ADRs have been 
placed in trust by a settlor who, at the  
time of settlement, was a US domiciled 
shareholder, the Ordinary Shares or  
ADRs will generally not be subject to UK 
inheritance tax unless the settlor, at the  
time of settlement, was a UK national,  
or the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part  
of the business property of a permanent 
establishment of the individual in the UK or, 
in the case of a shareholder who performs 
independent personal services, pertain  
to a fixed base situated in the UK. In the 
exceptional case where the Ordinary Shares 
or ADRs are subject to both UK inheritance 
tax and US federal gift or estate tax, the 
Estate Tax Convention generally provides  
for double taxation to be relieved by means 
of credit relief.

Corporate Information
The Board may exercise all the powers of 
the Company to borrow money. Variation  
of these borrowing powers would require 
the passing of a special resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders.
All Directors must retire from office at  
the Company’s AGM each year and  
may present themselves for election or 
re-election. Directors are not prohibited, 
upon reaching a particular age, from 
submitting themselves for election  
or re-election.
Within two months of the date of their 
appointment, Directors are required to 
beneficially own Ordinary Shares of an 
aggregate nominal amount of at least $125, 
which currently represents 500 shares.
Rights, preferences and restrictions 
attaching to shares
As at 31 December 2014, the Company had 
1,263, 143,338 Ordinary Shares and 50,000 
Redeemable Preference Shares in issue. 
The Ordinary Shares represent 99.98%  
and the Redeemable Preference Shares 
represent 0.02% of the Company’s total 
share capital (these percentages have  
been calculated by reference to the closing 
mid-point US$/GBP exchange rate on 31 
December 2014 as published in the London 
edition of the Financial Times newspaper).
As agreed by the shareholders at the 
Company’s AGM held on 29 April 2010,  
the Articles were amended with immediate 
effect to remove the requirement for the 
Company to have an authorised share 
capital, the concept of which was abolished 
under the Companies Act 2006. Each 
Ordinary Share carries the right to vote  
at general meetings of the Company.  
The rights and restrictions attaching to  
the Redeemable Preference Shares differ 
from those attaching to Ordinary Shares  
as follows: 
 > The Redeemable Preference Shares  
carry no rights to receive dividends.
 > The holders of Redeemable Preference 
Shares have no rights to receive notices 
of, attend or vote at general meetings 
except in certain limited circumstances. 
They have one vote for every 50,000 
Redeemable Preference Shares held.
 > On a distribution of assets of the 
Company, on a winding-up or other return 
of capital (subject to certain exceptions), 
the holders of Redeemable Preference 
Shares have priority over the holders of 
Ordinary Shares to receive the capital 
paid up on those shares.
 > Subject to the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company  
has the right to redeem the Redeemable 
Preference Shares at any time on giving 
not less than seven days’ written notice.
There are no specific restrictions on  
the transfer of shares in the Company, 
which is governed by the Articles and 
prevailing legislation.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of shares  
that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of shares or that may result in restrictions  
on voting rights.
Action necessary to change the rights  
of shareholders
In order to vary the rights attached to any 
class of shares, the consent in writing of the 
holders of three-quarters in nominal value  
of the issued shares of that class or the 
sanction of an extraordinary resolution 
passed at a general meeting of such holders 
is required.
General meetings
AGMs and other general meetings, as  
from time to time may be required, where  
a special resolution is to be passed or a 
Director is to be appointed, require 21 clear 
days’ notice to shareholders. Subject to  
the Companies Act 2006, other general 
meetings require 14 clear days’ notice.
For all general meetings, a quorum of  
two shareholders present in person or by 
proxy, and entitled to vote on the business 
transacted, is required unless each of  
the two persons present is a corporate 
representative of the same corporation;  
or each of the two persons present is  
a proxy of the same shareholder.
Shareholders and their duly appointed 
proxies and corporate representatives are 
entitled to be admitted to general meetings.
Limitations on the rights to own shares
There are no limitations on the rights  
to own shares.

Substantially all of our properties are held 
freehold, free of material encumbrances

Important information for readers of this Annual Report
Inclusion of Reported performance, 
Core financial measures and constant 
exchange rate growth rates
AstraZeneca’s determination of non-GAAP 
measures together with our presentation of 
them within our financial information may 
differ from similarly titled non-GAAP 
measures of other companies.
Statements of competitive position, 
growth rates and sales 
In this Annual Report, except as otherwise 
stated, market information regarding the 
position of our business or products relative 
to its or their competition is based upon 
published statistical sales data for the  
12 months ended 30 September 2014 
obtained from IMS Health, a leading supplier 
of statistical data to the pharmaceutical 
industry. Unless otherwise noted, for the 
US, dispensed new or total prescription 
data and audited sales data are taken, 
respectively, from IMS Health National 
Prescription Audit and IMS National Sales 
Perspectives for the 12 months ended 31 
December 2014; such data is not adjusted 
for Medicaid and similar rebates. Except as 
otherwise stated, these market share and 
industry data from IMS Health have been 
derived by comparing our sales revenue 
with competitors’ and total market sales 
revenues for that period. Except as 
otherwise stated, growth rates are given  
at CER. For the purposes of this Annual 
Report, unless otherwise stated, references 
to the world pharmaceutical market or 
similar phrases are to the 54 countries 
contained in the IMS Health database, 
which amounted to approximately 96%  
(in value) of the countries audited by  
IMS Health.

accept or assume responsibility to any  
other person to whom this Annual Report  
is shown or into whose hands it may come 
and any such responsibility or liability is

time such statements are made, including 
information relating to risks and 
uncertainties. Although we believe that  
the forward-looking statements in this 
Annual Report are based on reasonable 
assumptions, the matters discussed in  
the forward-looking statements may be 
influenced by factors that could cause 
actual outcomes and results to be materially 
different from those expressed or implied  
by these statements. The forward-looking 
statements reflect knowledge and 
information available at the date of the 
preparation of this Annual Report and the 
Company undertakes no obligation to 
update these forward-looking statements. 
We identify the forward-looking statements 
by using the words ‘anticipates’, ‘believes’, 
‘expects’, ‘intends’ and similar expressions 
in such statements. Important factors that 
could cause actual results to differ materially 
from those contained in forward-looking 
statements, certain of which are beyond our 
control, include, among other things, those 
factors identified in the Risk section from 
page 203 of this Annual Report. Nothing in 
this Annual Report should be construed as 
a profit forecast.

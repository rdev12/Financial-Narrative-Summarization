Jewellery demand reduced 3% over the prior year 
but due to higher prices was a new annual record 
value of US$99 billion. In line with historical trends, 
India was the largest market for gold jewellery in 
201 1. However in the second half of 201 1, China’s 
jewellery demand outpaced that of India, and 
expectations are that it is likely to remain that way 
going forward.

Over the five years from January 2007, the 
price of gold rose from US$640 per ounce 
to US$1,564 per ounce. This is an increase 
of some 144% that reflects a period of 
sustained economic uncertainty that began 
with the banking crisis in 2008, and has 
continued since that time.
More recently this demand has reflected 
new economic developments such as 
inflationary concerns in emerging economies 
caused by rising commodity prices, US 
dollar devaluation resulting from quantitative 
easing, sovereign debt issues in the 
Eurozone and the periods of economic 
recession in most western economies. 
On 5 September 2011, the spot price for 
gold reached US$1,920 per ounce, a record 
nominal high. Over the course of the year, 
the gold price rose steadily from US$1,300 
per ounce in January 2011 to this peak in 
September, before seeing a decline to 
the year end price of US$1,564 per ounce 
as investors sought to realise profits. 
At the start of 2012, the gold price began 
recovering and by the end of January 2012 
had risen above US$1,700 per ounce. This 
was despite continued US dollar strength 
over the month of January. 
Historically, the gold price has been 
driven by demand in the jewellery sector, 
which has accounted for the majority of 
consumption. More recently, economic 
turbulence has led to an increase in 
demand for gold as an investment, either 
through direct ownership or through 
Exchange Traded Funds. 
The investment case for gold relates to its 
attractiveness as a ‘safe haven’, which 
retains its fundamental value in the face of 
falling asset values, as a hedge against 
currency inflation, and as a counterweight 
to perceived weakness in the US dollar. 
In 2011 gold demand increased marginally 
to US$206 billion, primarily driven by 
investment demand which increased 5% 
over the prior year. Strong demand for gold 
bars and coins was recorded in India, China 
and Europe. 
Jewellery demand reduced 3% over the 
prior year but due to higher prices was a 
new annual record value of US$99 billion.  
In line with historical trends, India was the 
largest market for gold jewellery in 2011. 
However in the second half of 2011, China’s 
jewellery demand outpaced that of India, 
and expectations are that it is likely to 
remain that way going forward.  07
Avocet Mining PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
2011 saw a net increase in investment  
in gold by central banks as purchases 
increased dramatically from 77 tonnes  
in 2010 to 440 tonnes in 2011. For many 
years prior to 2009, central banks had 
contributed to the gold supply in the market 
by selling their reserves of gold. This 
situation reversed in 2010, and in 2011 
purchases of gold by central banks were 
estimated to account for approximately 
10% of total demand. 
Partly as a result of reduced selling from 
central banks as well as a reduction in gold 
recycling, gold supply reduced by 4% to 
3,994 tonnes in 2011. This was despite 
mine supply reaching a record 2,810 tonnes 
– a 4% increase on 2010. 
Whilst views on the continued increase in 
gold prices in the short to medium term are 
varied, few gold market analysts foresee  
a significant reduction over this period.  
The majority of commentators have 
remained optimistic about the medium to 
long term prospects for gold, pointing to the 
fact that the key drivers of gold’s recent bull 
run have not changed, and show few signs 
of abating. Market consensus for the gold 
price is around US$1,800 per ounce in 
2012, and US$1,950 per ounce in 2013.

Chairman’s 
statement
I am pleased to report that over the course of 
201 1, the Company has made significant steps 
towards its strategy of becoming a leading West 
African gold mining and exploration company.  Avocet Mining PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2011

When I took over as Chairman in 
September 2010, I recognised that Avocet 
was a company that combined a solid 
history of gold production and exploration 
with some promising new assets in a 
developing region, under the management 
of an ambitious and energetic team. I am 
pleased to report that over the course of 
2011, the Company has made significant 
steps towards its strategy of becoming a 
leading West African gold mining and 
exploration company.
The decision to divest the Company’s 
South East Asian assets was bold, given 
the historic associations with the region, 
but clearly the right strategic call. The 
consideration received of US$200 million 
surpassed market expectations. The funds 
have given the Company’s balance sheet 
strength at a time when finance is not 
always easily obtained, and are being 
invested in the growth of the Company in 
West Africa. 
In July, the Company announced its 
intention to pay a maiden dividend of 
US$20 million per annum, to be paid as 
interim and final dividends. This reflects our 
confidence in the cash generating ability of 
the Inata Gold Mine in Burkina Faso and, by 
returning earnings to shareholders, sets 
Avocet apart from many peers, at a time 
when dividend payments are particularly 
welcome to investors. 
In December 2011, the Company 
successfully completed its move from the 
AIM Market to the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange. The Company 
is now listed on two regulated markets – 
Oslo and London with the latter being the 
primary listing – and it is expected that this 
will generate additional investor interest. 
The Company will be considered for 
inclusion in the FTSE 250 index in March 
2012 which should add to this interest. 
Looking ahead, we are undertaking studies 
into an increase in production from the Inata 
Gold Mine where significant increases in 
Mineral Resources and Reserves have 
recently been confirmed. 
In Guinea our exploration expenditure has 
been rewarded by a tripling in the Mineral 
Resources at Koulékoun. Discussions are 
taking place between our management and 
the Government of Guinea to establish a 
mutually satisfactory basis upon which any 
mine which we might establish in that 
country will operate and be taxed.
This year’s Annual General Meeting will  
be held at the offices of our brokers  
J.P. Morgan Cazenove on Wednesday  
3 May 2012. There will be an opportunity  
for shareholders to submit questions in 
advance, if they wish, to be dealt with 
during the AGM. The AGM circular 
enclosed with this report includes further 
details of the meeting, the resolutions to be 
proposed and the procedure for submitting 
questions ahead of the meeting.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
the entire Avocet team for their discipline 
and dedication towards achieving all of the 
Company’s stated 2011 objectives, and for 
their positive contribution in the countries 
in which we do business. Without the 
commitment of all the employees, the 
Company would not have been able to 
fulfil its strategic initiatives and deliver value 
to its shareholders. 
As stated last year, I remain positive about 
the outlook for the gold price in 2012 and 
about the Company’s continued success.

review
201 1 was a year of dramatic change for Avocet.  
In 2010 we embarked on a strategy to transform 
the Company into a leading West African gold 
mining and exploration company. By the end of 
201 1 we had achieved all of the objectives that we 
set eighteen months ago to realise this change.  Avocet Mining PLC

2011 was a year of dramatic change for 
Avocet. In 2010 we embarked on a strategy 
to transform the Company into a leading 
West African gold mining and exploration 
company. By the end of 2011 we had 
achieved all of the objectives that we set 
eighteen months ago to realise this change. 
During 2011, the environment in which the 
Company operates also saw dramatic 
change. Demand for gold continued to rise 
as global economic uncertainties persisted, 
with a record price of US$1,920 per ounce 
achieved in September 2011. The European 
debt crisis and continued speculation of 
quantitative easing in the United States 
reinforced gold’s position in the investment 
markets as a relative safe haven. Whilst 
the impact of higher prices achieved was 
certainly to our advantage, pricing pressures 
on input materials and services in the gold 
mining sector increased in line with the 
escalation in gold price. In particular, 
the strong rise in fuel prices, which have a 
general correlation to gold prices, significantly 
impacted production cash costs and 
profitability for the industry as a whole. 
The socio-political environment in West 
Africa remained broadly stable during 2011. 
The governments of both Burkina Faso and 
Guinea continue to be strong supporters of 
the gold industry as a catalyst for economic 
development. In Burkina Faso, a short 
period of social unrest occurred in late April, 
triggering a spike in retail fuel costs, food 
costs and other staples across the country. 
This social tension was exacerbated by 
strike action in the military over a wage 
dispute, which led to widespread strike 
action across the country, including at the 
Inata Gold Mine and most of the country’s 
other mines. Negotiations with our 
employees were concluded within a week, 
resulting in an acceptable wage increase 
and a peaceful return to work.
In September 2011, the Government of 
Guinea passed a new Mining Code into 
law, with the objective of ensuring a fair 
return from mining activities for the 
people of Guinea. The new Mining Code 
was intended to improve the financial 
transparency and environmental 
responsibility of mining companies, whilst 
promoting foreign inward investment. Many 
provisions in the previous 1995 Mining 
Code remained intact, including the 
Government’s existing 15% free carried 
interest in mining ventures. However, there 
were several material changes in the new 
code which are currently undergoing 
public review and scrutiny to calibrate their 
alignment to the mandate of ensuring a 
fair return from mining activities, whilst 
balancing the promotion and attraction of 
new investment in the sector in Guinea. 
Changes include an option for the 
Government to purchase an additional 
20% equity interest for cash; a maximum 
number and size of exploration permits to be 
held in specific commodities; and certain 
quotas to encourage the employment of 
Guinean nationals. Many observers in 
Guinea believe that amendments to the 
new Mining Code are likely to be made over 
the coming months to ensure optimum 
alignment to the mandate.

In August 2011, a sustainable development 
project was launched in partnership with 
local villages to recycle mine waste into 
usable items for the community.
As at November 2011, the Inata Gold Mine achieved in 
excess of six million man hours without injury since the

In November 2011, the Company announced its intention 
to move from AIM to seek admission to the Official List 
and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s Main 
Market. Trading on the Main Market commenced on  
8 December.
The company delivered increased production, doubled Mineral 
Reserves and increased Mineral Resources at the Inata Gold 
Mine. This was achieved whilst maintaining a solid safety record 
for its employees. In Guinea, the Mineral Resources for the Tri-K 
project rose to 2.24 million ounces. Avocet moved from AIM to 
the London Stock Exchange’s Main Market.
In addition to this, the Company has continued to support local 
community and environment projects including the waste 
management programme which you will read more about below.

Sale of South East Asian assets
US$200million
STRATEGIc DEVELo PMENTS
The first step towards growing the Company 
into a leading West African gold mining 
and exploration company was to focus 
the Company’s asset base exclusively on 
West Africa. 
In late December 2010 we announced the 
sale of our South East Asian assets to 
J&Partners for US$200 million. The sale 
was substantially completed by June 2011 
by which date US$170 million had been 
received. A further US$27 million of 
proceeds was received in September 2011 
bringing the total consideration received in 
2011 to US$197 million. A further US$2 
million was received on 16 February 2012, 
following the sale of a remaining exploration 
asset, for a total received of US$199 million. 
In April 2011, Avocet was informed that a 
law suit had been filed against it in the 
District Court of Jakarta, Indonesia by PT 
Lebong Tandai (‘PT LT’), Avocet’s former 
partner in a joint venture in Indonesia. The 
law suit relates to a challenge as to the 
legality of the sale of Avocet’s South East 
Asian assets. PT LT asserts that it is entitled 
to acquire all of these assets pursuant to an 
agreement allegedly entered into between 
PT LT and Avocet in April 2010. In 
November 2011, Avocet challenged the 
jurisdiction of the District Court to hear the 
law suit on the basis that PT LT and Avocet 
were obligated under the terms of their joint 
venture to settle any dispute through 
arbitration. In addition, Avocet challenged 
the court’s jurisdiction on the grounds that 
Avocet is not subject to the Indonesian 
courts as it has no presence in Indonesia. 
The District Court subsequently found in 
Avocet’s favour and dismissed the case.  
PT LT has since lodged an appeal to the 
Indonesian High Court against the District 
Court’s decision. Despite the appeal by  
PT LT, which may take several months, the 
Board of Avocet is encouraged that the 
District Court has ruled in Avocet’s favour in 
the first instance. The Board also remains 
confident that all the actions taken in 
respect of the transaction have been in 
accordance with prevailing rules and 
regulations and there are no grounds for 
any such legal action.
Having substantially completed the 
divestment of our South East Asian 
interests, developing and growing the 
Company’s assets in West Africa was and 
remains our key strategic objective.
In July 2011, the Board made a commitment 
to invest US$20 million per year over three 
years in exploration in the Bélahouro District 
to facilitate Mineral Resource development 
and Mineral Reserve replenishment. This 
commitment facilitated one of the largest 
exploration drilling programmes in the 
region over the course of 2011, and 
resulted in a significant increase of the Inata 
Mineral Resource to 3.46 million ounces. 
Furthermore, Inata’s Mineral Reserves were 
increased to 1.85 million ounces, equivalent 
to a life of mine of 12.5 years at current 
capacity and production profile of the Inata 
Gold Mine. Together with Mineral Resource 
increases at our Tri-K project in Guinea, 
the Company has seen Group Mineral 
Resources double to 6.26 million ounces 
over 2011. 
A scoping study was initiated in the third 
quarter of 2011 to assess how best to 
further increase the Inata Gold Mine’s 
production profile in the coming years. 
Based on the scoping study work to date, 
and the new larger reserve, the Company 
remains committed to an expansion 
targeted at 245,000 ounces of gold 
production per annum by the end of 2013. 
Following a period of lower recoveries 
during Q3 associated with processing 
carbonaceous ore, Inata’s strong fourth 
quarter indicated that the impact of carbon 
is not unduly affecting the mine’s 
performance. Although the study has not 
yet concluded, current indications are 
that the ability to process carbonaceous 
ore with high recoveries will increasingly 
add value throughout the life of mine, either 
in the form of a new plant or through 
expansion and modification of the existing 
plant. Further metallurgical test work is 
required over the coming months in order 
to determine the optimum processing 
methods, plant configuration and location.

Sale of South East Asian assets
US$200million
The opportunity exists while planning the 
expansion scenarios, to address the longer 
term issues that typically arise later in a 
mine’s life (processing harder rock, deeper 
pits, lower grade and more carbonaceous 
ore) by configuring a plant capable of 
maximising gold production from different 
ore types. The study has considered ore 
sources from mineralised areas within the 
Inata mine licence area, as well as potential 
mineralisation outside the mine licence 
area, including Damba, Pali, Ouzemi, Filio, 
Kourfadie and Dynamite and Miiliam on the 
Souma Trend. Emphasis has therefore been 
placed not only on maximising the potential 
of the existing Mineral Reserve, but also on 
being able to exploit new reserve additions 
within the large Bélahouro district. Potential 
process plant options considered by the 
scoping study have included a heap leach 
operation, expansion of the existing plant, 
construction of a new plant, and a 
combination of these. 
Early analysis showed that the heap leach 
option could prove to be a means of 
providing expanded production quickly and 
with relatively low capital expenditure, 
however in order for the heap leach option 
to be optimal as the first phase of 
expansion, it will have to be shown that 
sufficient quantities of low grade oxide 
material exist within the Inata Mine Licence 
Area. Expanding the existing plant also 
represents an opportunity to increase gold 
production at relatively low capex, but with 
most of the new pits being developed to 
the south or potentially at Souma in the 
east, haul distances and costs would be 
increased, while some modifications would 
also be required to allow the plant to fully 
exploit harder or more carbonaceous 
ore feed. The construction of a new plant, 
capable of processing all types of ore 
including carbonaceous material, may 
entai slightly higher capital expenditure but 
would provide more flexibility in terms of 
configuration and location, while optimising 
processing efficiency and gold production.
The Company’s expertise in dealing with 
carbonaceous ore is a key advantage. 
Resin-in-leach processing, as used in the 
Company’s former mine in Malaysia, could 
be considered for a new plant or as a 
modification to the existing plant. Expansion 
work will therefore require focused 
metallurgical test work, mineral distribution 
analysis and carbon modelling of the 
mineral resources and reserves in and 
around Inata during the remainder of the 
first half of 2012, with a view to determining 
the optimum expansion plant configuration 
and location by the middle of the year. The 
Company would then expect permitting and 
construction to take place in the remainder 
of 2012 and into late 2013, with start-up of 
expanded production likely to commence 
thereafter. Further updates on the Inata 
expansion will be made over the coming 
months as we progress through the study 
and test work.
In July of 2011, Inata’s gold hedge was 
restructured, with 20% of the hedge book 
being eliminated at a cost of approximately 
US$40 million, and the remaining position 
of 233,733 ounces being rescheduled over 
seven years. Deliveries are now 8,250 
ounces per quarter through to June 2018 at 
a price of US$950 per ounce as opposed 
to the initial schedule of 25,000 ounces per 
quarter at US$970 per ounce. As a result of 
the restructure, the proportion of Inata’s 
current annual production that is exposed 
to spot prices doubled from 40% to 
approximately 80%. 
In July 2011 the Company announced the 
adoption of a regular dividend policy. The 
Company’s policy is to pay dividends at an 
initial level of approximately US$20 million 
per annum, one third as an interim dividend 
and two thirds as a final dividend. This level 
of payment strikes a balance between 
returning profit to shareholders and being 
able to invest in the growth of our business. 
An interim dividend of 2.1 pence per share 
was paid on 30 September 2011. The 
Board has proposed a final dividend of 4.2 
pence per share, which would give a total 
dividend for the year of 6.3 pence per 
share, which is expected to result in an 
aggregate payment for the year of US$20.0 
million in line with the stated dividend policy. 
This final dividend is subject to shareholder 
approval at the Annual General Meeting on 
3 May 2012, and if approved, will be paid on 
1 June 2012 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 11 May 2012. 
In view of the Company’s many strategic 
accomplishments, the Avocet Board took a 
decision in the third quarter to seek 
admission to the Official List of the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange. This 
admission was duly granted and trading on 
the London Stock Exchange commenced 
on 8 December 2011. Avocet remains listed 
on the Oslo Børs in Norway, where over 
35% of its shares are held, however the 
Company’s primary listing is now in 
London. Avocet’s shares are expected to 
be included in the FTSE 250 Index at the 
next inclusion date of 7 March 2012. Avocet Mining PLC

EXPLoRATI oN REVIEW
During 2010 the Company set itself a target 
of doubling the size of the Mineral Reserve 
at the Inata Gold Mine, based on successful 
increases in the mine’s Mineral Resource. 
Our other strategic exploration objective 
has been to advance the Koulékoun gold 
project in Guinea towards a feasibility study. 
In addition to these objectives, the 
Company’s longer term growth aspirations 
are being supported by the development of 
a pipeline of prospects in the surrounding 
permits in both Burkina Faso and Guinea. 
During 2011, Avocet spent US$34 million 
on exploration in West Africa. To facilitate 
further growth, a decision was made in July 
of 2011 to invest US$20 million per annum 
in exploration expenditure in Burkina Faso 
and a similar amount in Guinea. 
Following a successful exploration campaign 
in 2011, the Group’s Mineral Resource base 
in West Africa has now increased to 6.26 
million ounces, an increase of 165%, or 
nearly 4 million ounces, compared with the 
2.38 million ounces at the time of the Wega 
Mining acquisition in 2009. Mineral Reserves 
at Inata have doubled in the same timeframe, 
despite mining depletion of 337,000 ounces.
At Inata, the Company drilled 47,400 metres 
of reverse circulation (RC) and 33,300 
metres of diamond (DD) and RC with 
Diamond tail drill holes in the calendar year. 
This programme resulted in the doubling of 
the Inata Mineral Resource by the end of 
the year with Measured and Indicated 
Mineral Resources of 57.3Mt @ 1.45 g/t Au 
containing 2.68 million ounces and Inferred 
Mineral Resources of 17.8Mt @ 1.36 g/t Au 
containing 0.78 million ounces gold. 
The Mineral Resource grew at depth, 
particularly at Inata North, and through the 
discovery of parallel zones within the Inata 
Trend and new zones of mineralisation on 
the parallel east-west Minfo Trend to the 
south. The latter is particularly important, as 
the discovery of the Minfo East prospect 
along the Minfo Trend highlighted the 
potential for significant mineralisation along 
a longer strike length than previously 
appreciated. In addition, current knowledge 
indicates the presence of a parallel zone of 
mineralisation approximately 70 metres to 
the north, which could result in a reduction 
in current stripping ratios if both zones can 
be mined from a single pit.
Exploration work continued throughout the 
year in the broader Bélahouro region, where 
Avocet holds exploration licences covering 
over 1,634 square kilometres. Scout drilling 
of the Pali and Filio prospects identified 
additional mineralised targets that will be 
further developed in 2012. 
Early in 2011 a helicopter-borne geophysical 
VTEM survey was undertaken across the 
Tri-K block of permits in northeast Guinea. 
The survey identified a number of 
conductive anomalies at Kodiafaran and in 
the Koulékoun District, as well as two large 
bodies of granite that appeared to have 
gold mineralisation focused on their 
margins namely Kodiéran and Gbinli. These 
conductive and resistive anomalies pointed 
to a number of targets that will be followed 
up with drilling in 2012. 
Over the remainder of the year 33,900 
metres of RC and 15,400 metres of DD 
drilling at Koulékoun were completed. The 
result of this drilling was an increase in the 
Mineral Resource by 175% to 1.83 million 
ounces. Koulékoun is now defined by 
Indicated Mineral Resources of 21.6Mt @ 
1.44 g/t Au containing 1.00 million ounces 
gold and Inferred Mineral Resources of 
22.6Mt @ 1.15 g/t Au containing 0.83 million 
ounces gold. Drill results also indicated 
that the Mineral Resource is hosted in a 
40–80m thick zone of north-northwest-
striking porphyry dyke. This primary ore 
body has been drilled over a strike length 
of 2,000 metres and to a vertical depth of 
350 metres and has proven to be broad 
and tabular in structure. Resource grades 
occur over a strike length of 950 metres 
and the mineralisation is open at depth. 
The porphyry is cut by a northeast-striking 
structure and gold grades are locally higher 
in the pipe formed by the intersection of this 
structure with the porphyry. The structure 
adds Mineral Resources in the hanging wall 
to the main porphyry, which will reduce the 
amount of waste in an open pit and reduce 
the stripping ratio.
Over the year 18,000 metres of RC drilling 
were undertaken at Kodiéran, which 
identified a maiden Inferred Mineral 
Resource of 7.3Mt @ 1.79 g/t Au containing 
0.41 million ounces gold. New resource 
candidates at Fowaro and Kourounin were 
also identified. Scout drilling of 10,400 
metres RC at Balandougou intersected gold 
mineralisation that requires follow up drilling 
in 2012. 19

oPERATI oNS REVIEW
The Inata Gold Mine is 220 km north of the 
capital of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou on 
the edges of the Birimian greenstone belt. 
The mine is owned by Société des Mines 
de Bélahouro SA (SMB) of which Avocet 
owns 90% and the government of Burkina 
Faso the remaining 10%. 
After the Inata Gold Mine’s first full year of 
production in 2010, mining continued to 
ramp up in 2011. A decision was reached 
in late 2010 to increase the plant capacity 
from 287 tonnes per hour to 340 tonnes 
per hour and to increase mining capacity 
to deliver the necessary ore feed to achieve 
as much. The expansion in plant capacity 
was successfully implemented and the 
target processing rate was reached on 
schedule in the third quarter of 2011 with 
commissioning of the third mining fleet 
during the same quarter. From an initial 
overall mine capacity of approximately 
12Mt per annum in early 2010, this had 
risen to approximately 30Mt per annum 
during the fourth quarter of 2011. As well as 
allowing ore mining to match the increased 
plant throughput, the increased mining 
rates in 2011 allowed the mine to handle 
the higher stripping ratios demanded by 
the Mineral Reserve increase announced 
in September 2010. Combined with 
good plant availabilities, the feed rate of 
340 tonnes per hour meant that tonnes 
processed were 40% higher than the 
prior year at 2.5 million tonnes.
The increase in milling capacity was 
matched by the addition of a second elution 
column in the final recovery circuit. This 
facility will not only reduce the operational 
risk posed by having a single line circuit, 
but more importantly improves the carbon 
management and regeneration capacity as 
well as minimising the gold in circuit at any 
point in time. 
In addition to focusing on plant capacity, 
considerable effort has been made during 
2011 to reduce plant maintenance costs 
and improve plant availabilities. Several 
initiatives have been undertaken, 
particularly with regard to re-engineering 
high wear areas of the plant. These have 
been successfully implemented and the 
average availability for the year was 89% 
after taking the industrial action work 
stoppages in May into account.

Considerable investment also took place 
during the year to reduce the risk to 
operations by reviewing our stock of 
critical spares and all reasonable measures 
have now been undertaken to ensure the 
high levels of availability are maintained 
going forward.
A similar process was adopted in the Heavy 
Duty Maintenance section with regards to 
the maintenance of the mining fleet. This 
area benefited from the construction of new 
workshops which have not only had a 
positive impact on availabilities, but also 
now facilitate the planned maintenance 
component rebuild schedule. The 
combination of a sound maintenance 
philosophy and modern condition 
monitoring techniques has enabled the lives 
of several major components to be safely 
extended with considerable cost saving 
benefits.
Mining during the first half of the year was 
primarily from the Inata North but by 
September 2011 this starter pit had 
essentially been depleted and, 
consequently, the prime source of ore since 
then was and will continue to be from the 
Inata Central pit. This was supplemented by 
ore from the Inata Far South pit, where 
mining commenced in the fourth quarter 
of 2011. The stripping of the Sayouba and 
Inata South pits will commence in March 
and October 2012 respectively. 
In 2011 head grade dropped to 2.26 from 
2.66 g/t Au in 2010. As the Mineral Reserve 
grade is 1.70 g/t Au, head grades will trend 
towards this average over the longer term. 
Resources at Minfo Trends are higher 
grade, which when converted to Mineral 
Reserves are expected to have a positive 
impact on the life of mine grade. 
During the second half of the year, 
especially in the third quarter, processing  
of a high proportion of carbonaceous  
ore from deeper in the Inata North pit 
impacted recoveries, and this, together  
with lower head grades and higher plant 
throughput rates meant that gold recoveries 
reduced from 94% in 2010 to 91% in 2011. 
The mine’s geology department is 
compiling a carbon model for the Inata Gold 
Mine to better understand the location and 
impact of carbon in the ore body. Studies 
are also underway to optimise plant 
recoveries and to mitigate preg-robbing. 
Together with the commissioning of a 
gravity circuit and additional carbon 
regeneration capacity in early 2012, these 
measures will ensure optimal recoveries 
going forward, as will Avocet’s experience 
in managing carbonaceous ore in South 
East Asia. 
In total, the Inata Gold Mine currently has 
three operating open pits that allow for 
flexibility to blend ore optimally, thereby 
facilitating stable recovery rates and 
production, as well as to reschedule its 
mining plan in response to marketplace 
dynamics. The number of pits will increase 
to at least six under the current mine plan; 
thus providing greater scheduling and 
blending opportunities going forward.
Cash costs for the year at US$693 per 
ounce were below revised guidance and 
were competitive in an environment of 
significant cost pressures affecting the 
whole sector. Costs rose from US$533 per 
ounce in the first quarter to US$773 per 
ounce in the fourth. Higher fuel costs were 
a key factor, with increases in mining and 
plant activity levels exacerbated by rising 
fuel prices. The fuel price increase reflected 
an underlying increase in global oil prices 
and the decision taken mid-year by the 
Government of Burkina Faso that value 
added tax on fuel would no longer be 
recoverable. As well as Inata’s direct fuel 
consumption, higher fuel prices also 
drove up freight costs of goods delivered 
to site. Higher mining rates resulted in a 
proportional increase in maintenance costs, 
and the higher labour rates introduced as a 
result of the industrial action taken in May 
of 2011 also impacted upon overall costs. 
Royalties rose as a direct result of higher 
spot prices as well as a higher proportion of 
gold sold at spot prices following the hedge 
restructure in July. On a cost per ounce 
basis, unit costs were also driven higher by 
lower grades and recoveries.
Cash costs for the year at 
US$693 per ounce were

Chief Executive’s review continued
Where possible, costs were actively 
managed with a number of operational 
improvements. Specifically, automated 
cyanide dosing introduced during the 
second half of 2011 reduced cyanide 
consumption in the order of 20%, and a 
similar saving is expected through the 
introduction of automated lime dosing in 
the second half of 2012. Significant cost 
reductions are also anticipated through the 
introduction of a fuel-based cooling system 
for the powerhouse, which will improve the 
efficiency of the generators, and this is 
expected to be on line by mid-2012.
Of particular importance to Avocet, is the 
excellent safety performance that we have 
achieved subsequent to the acquisition of 
the Inata Gold Mine. In late November, the 
Inata Gold Mine achieved the significant 
milestone of six million man hours worked 
injury free. This achievement was the 
result of ongoing vigilance and proactive 
measures taken to maintain high level of 
staff training and awareness. However, 
a lost time incident occurred in late 
December 2011, when an operator 
sustained a sprained ankle while 
dismounting from an excavator following 
a fire in the excavator. While it is regrettable 
that an incident occurred, the injury 
occurred after the operator had followed 
standard safety processes by activating the 
equipment’s fire suppression system, thus 
minimising the fire hazard to himself and 
disruption to mining operations. Avocet Mining PLC

During 2011 the focus in Burkina Faso was 
on increasing Inata’s plant capacity to 340 
tonnes per hour and adding mining 
capacity to support this higher throughput. 
During 2012 the mine’s operations team will 
be firmly focused on operating and cost 
efficiencies. Several operational projects 
are now being progressed that will directly 
impact on reagent and fuel consumption 
and consequently reduce operating costs. 
In addition a business process review was 
initiated during 2011 to optimise Inata’s 
business systems, including its supply chain. 
Reduced purchase prices, consolidated 
logistics and optimised inventory levels are 
among the anticipated benefits. 
In Burkina Faso, the Company’s project 
team, including those responsible for 
successfully completing Inata’s construction 
and commissioning, will advance Inata’s 
expansion plans, with an initial emphasis 
on comprehensive metallurgical test work. 
Once complete, the results of this analysis 
will determine the optimal expansion plan 
which will be progressed immediately into 
construction. 
In 2012, the exploration activities in Burkina 
Faso will include geochemical auger and 
aircore drilling of geophysical anomalies 
surrounding the Inata Gold Mine and along 
the Souma Trend. The Company will follow 
up priority prospects with RC and DD 
drilling later in the year to develop new 
Mineral Resources. In the meantime, 
considerable drilling is required to expand 
the identified zones of mineralisation in the 
Inata Mine licence area, particularly in the 
south of the area where the intersection 
between the Inata and Minfo Trends 
requires further development. Souma 
remains a quality candidate for further 
growth in Mineral Resources that will be 
drilled once the many targets near Inata 
have been tested. In Guinea, Avocet will 
conduct geochemical aircore drilling of 
geophysical anomalies at Kodiafaran and 
in the Koulékoun District. Kodiéran and 
Balandougou will be the subject of further 
drilling programmes to develop and 
increase their Mineral Resources. Both 
the Burkina Faso and Guinea exploration 
programmes are expected to provide a 
base of Mineral Resource expansion in 
2013 that will directly support Avocet’s 
future production growth.
With Koulékoun advanced to a sufficient 
scale to warrant a feasibility study into 
developing a mine, and in view of the recent 
mining code changes, the senior executive 
group from Avocet, along with its key 
advisors, held discussions in Conakry 
during January 2012 with the highest levels 
of the Guinea government. The discussions 
were focused on a mutual exchange of 
information, at which Avocet provided an 
update on its projects in Guinea and both 
parties discussed the new mining code. 
At the Government’s invitation, Avocet has 
subsequently tabled a number of areas of 
the new mining code that require clarity 
and definition, as well as areas that require 
consideration for change. While uncertainty 
continues to exist on how the mining 
code may develop and how it will be 
implemented, these discussions confirmed 
the Government’s desire to attract inward 
investment, while balancing the needs of 
the Guinean people. Avocet anticipates 
receiving clarity in the new mining code, 
as well as confirmation of the process for 
achieving a fiscal stability agreement in the 
coming months. If a satisfactory stability 
agreement can be achieved by the middle 
of 2012, we intend to progress Koulékoun 
into a definitive feasibility study, a 
comprehensive exercise that is expected 
to take a full twelve months to complete. 
Construction is therefore likely to take a 
further twelve months, which indicates 
targeted first gold in late 2014. We intend 
to provide regular updates to shareholders 
throughout the process. 
This past year will go down in Avocet’s 
history as a transformational one, but also a 
very successful one. Our success reflects 
the dedication and commitment of the 
Avocet team, and I would like to thank all 
Avocet employees for their contribution to 
our achievements this year. I look forward 
to 2012 being an equally successful year, 
and another stepping stone towards our 
long term objective of becoming a leading 
West African gold mining and exploration 
company.

Health and safety review
The health and safety of employees is of 
paramount importance to Avocet, and is  
one of the guiding principles of our business. 
Avocet recognises that employees represent 
the Company’s most valuable resource and 
that they have a right to work in a safe and 
healthy environment. 
In order to ensure safety is embedded 
throughout the business, Avocet has 
established an Occupational Health & 
Safety Committee at Inata made up of 
elected representatives from each 
department, and a second, the 
Management Safety Committee, made up 
of department Managers and chaired by 
the General Manager of each business unit. 
Both committees meet monthly to discuss 
all aspects of safety, and remedial action is 
taken on safety issues in the workplace. 
Inata’s Management Safety Committee will 
in turn report to the Health, Safety and 
Environment (HSE) Committee of Avocet’s 
Board of Directors. This committee was 
established during 2011 to solicit guidance 
and counsel that appropriate systems are in 
place to deal with the management of 
health and safety matters (see page 45 in 
the Corporate Governance section). This 
includes reviewing policies and procedures, 
assessing serious incidents, establishing 
appropriate and timely responses, and 
ensuring ongoing compliance with Burkina 
Faso law and regulations, and international 
best practice. The HSE Committee meets 
at least four times a year and is chaired by 
Gordon Wylie. Its other members are Mike 
Donoghue, Barry Rourke and Russell Edey.

Avocet’s management takes responsibility 
for ensuring that their workplaces do not 
pose a hazard to their employees’ short or 
long term health. At the Inata Gold Mine, 
the three primary health risks are that of 
malaria, infections from parasites and 
respiratory tract infections. 
During 2011, efforts to reduce the number of 
cases of malaria continued successfully with 
the total number of incidences down 54% on 
2010. This reflected regular insecticide 
spraying of the plant and living quarters, as 
well as an improved awareness amongst 
employees, to reduce their exposure to 
mosquitoes, and providing of prophylactic 
sprays and mosquito nets. As a result the 
incidence of malaria amongst employees is 
noticeably lower than the national average. 
Parasitic infections remain a cause for 
health concern in this remote part of 
Burkina Faso in which the Company 
operates. A biannual programme providing 
de-worming medication to all staff reduced 
the percentage of employees with recorded 
The health and safety of employees is of 
paramount importance to Avocet, and is  
one of the guiding principles of our business. 
infestation from 82% when the Inata Gold 
Mine was acquired, to 58% in 2011. Further 
campaigns are planned in 2012 to reduce 
this still high incidence.
Working in the Sahel region of Africa brings 
risk of respiratory tract infections due to the 
high levels of dust that naturally occurs in 
the region. To mitigate this risk, the mine 
has a programme of dust suppression 
through surface water spraying, particularly 
in areas of high mining traffic such as the 
pits and roads. In 2011, a dome was 
constructed to cover the fine ore stockpile. 
This dome protects the stockpile from wind 
and contains dust generated by conveyor 
discharge, and has therefore contributed 
significantly towards reducing overall site 
dust levels.
HIV/AIDS infection rates are relatively low in 
Burkina Faso compared to many sub-Saharan 
countries and even more so in the remote 
area of the Inata Gold Mine. Avocet 
management is acutely aware of the impact 
on HIV infections levels that a remote and 
transient mining workforce on a new supply 
route can have. As such, a voluntary HIV 
testing programme was launched in August 
2011 at the Inata mine site. Approximately 
15% of employees and contractors on site 
were tested in the last four months of the 
year and testing is ongoing. Avocet Mining PLC

Avocet’s safety track record has been 
achieved by adhering to a set of basic 
rules, in particular by ensuring that:
 
Procedures and work practices are 
regularly reviewed and updated; 
Personal protective equipment is correctly 
maintained and properly used; 
Safety is viewed as a measure of 
individual, departmental and site 
performance and is therefore considered 
in determining overall remuneration; 
Employees are adequately trained for jobs 
to which they are assigned; 
Positive encouragement is given toward 
safety awareness and initiatives; 
All incidents are promptly reported, 
investigated and remedial action taken; 
Regular workplace inspections and audits 
are conducted; and 
Regular safety meetings are held at all 
levels. 
Wo RKPLAcE SAFET y
At the heart of Avocet’s safety management 
at the Inata Gold Mine is a system of regular 
and comprehensive training programmes, 
underpinned by rigorous safe working 
procedures. 
Avocet strives to ensure that a culture of 
continuous improvement exists across all 
work locations, which it promotes through 
the use of hazard identification systems and 
individual departmental audits. All Avocet 
employees, contractors and visitors 
undergo safety inductions on arrival at site. 
Avocet’s health and safety managers 
investigate all incidents, accidents and near 
misses, with the focus being on identifying 
root causes to ensure these are eliminated 
or controlled. Operations supervisors are 
then provided with training on these leading 
indicators to allow them to proactively 
manage safety in the workplace. After 
supervisory training, Inata’s safety 
department continues to work alongside 
supervisors to ensure safety regulations are 
fully adhered to.
The success of this safety programme is 
reflected in the fact that Inata’s mine site 
employees and long term contractors had a 
number of achievements during 2011. Most 
notably on November 23 the milestone of 
six million man hours without a lost time 
injury was passed. Unfortunately a lost 
time injury occurred shortly afterwards 
in December 2011. Avocet is dedicated 
to replicating its world class safety 
performance in 2012 and beyond. 
During 201 1, efforts to 
reduce the number of 
cases of malaria 
continued successfully 
with the total number of 
incidences down 54%  
on 2010. Avocet Mining PLC

Environmental activities 
review
The environmental impact of Avocet’s 
mining activities is evaluated and managed 
with a comprehensive Environmental 
Management System that was established 
in 2010. This system ensures compliance 
with all relevant national regulations and 
international best practice. To this end, 
Avocet continues to maintain close 
working relationships with the Ministry of 
Environment in Burkina Faso as well as 
other regulatory authorities. Management 
submit regular reports of onsite activities to 
the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of 
Mines, as well as receiving site inspections.
Environmental training and education is 
recognised as an important component 
in minimising any adverse impact mining 
might have on the environment. All 
employees and contractors undertake an 
environmental induction programme and 
an ongoing programme of training is in 
place to cover environmental issues. 
Environmental monitoring is carried out 
in accordance with an approved 
Environmental Management Plan. These 
monitoring activities include the testing 
of water quality (including potable water, 
ground water and surface water for 
chemical residue presence) and air quality 
(including reviews of dust, noise, vibration 
and gas emissions). In 2010 an environment 
control laboratory for the chemical analysis 
of environmental samples was established 
at the Inata mine site to allow samples to be 
tested on site. Some 180 water samples 
and over 100 dust samples were collected 
and sent to this as well as other external 
laboratories in the year for analysis against 
a wide array of parameters. The results 
obtained were compared to national and 
international standards as well as our 
own data baseline. In 2011 the sampling, 
analysis and results identified no adverse 
impacts related to mining. 
Ecological monitoring is also carried out 
and during 2011 a fauna inventory 
programme was initiated with the view to 
determining the impact of mining activities 
on wildlife as well as proposing solutions to 
minimise any such impacts. The inventory 
covered entomological, ornithological and 
mammalian species. It is apparent from the 
findings of this inventory that fauna species 
and numbers within the mine fence line 
have been increasing since the baseline 
study of the area was undertaken in 
2008. Recommendations issued from 
the inventory have been taken into account 
in the Environmental Management Plan. 
Restoration and rehabilitation have been 
key components of the Environmental 
Management System throughout the life 
of the Inata Gold Mine. During 2011 over 
12,000 trees of various native species 
were planted and over 50 hectares of 
disturbed and fragile land were restored. 
An alternative method of stabilising 
disturbed land using native grasses is 
also undergoing testing. Avocet’s 
objectives for 2012 are to continue to 
increase the number of trees planted 
and land recovered, and to create a fertile 
area of vegetation for each of the local 
villages. In addition to the rehabilitation 
of vegetation, during the course of 2011, 
Avocet rehabilitated two defunct cyanide 
leaching pits, previously used by artisanal 
miners. In collaboration with the Ministry 
of Environment, as well as local authorities, 
these dangerous treatment sites were 
depolluted with the removal of 
contaminated water and soil. These were 
subsequently deposited in the Inata Gold 
Mine’s tailings dam.
On 1 December 2011, Avocet became a 
signatory to the International Cyanide 
Management Code for the Manufacture, 
Transport and Use of Cyanide in the 
Production of Gold (‘Cyanide Code’). The 
Cyanide Code is a voluntary industry code 
of best practice for gold mining companies 
using cyanidation mill tailings and leach 
solutions and was developed under 
the guidance of the United Nations 
Environmental Programme and is 
implemented by the International Cyanide 
Management Institute. The objective of 
the Cyanide Code is to ensure the safe 
transport and management of cyanide and 
to assist in the protection of human health 
and the reduction of environmental impacts. 
Avocet’s mining operations in Burkina Faso 
will undergo independent audit to ensure 
compliance with the Code. 
On 29 July 2011 one of Avocet’s suppliers 
had an incident on the road to Inata, when 
a vehicle carrying cyanide overturned into a 
water course on the down stream side of a 
reservoir wall. A team from Inata promptly 
mobilised to assist the supplier and regional 
authorities in their response to the incident, 
and Avocet requested of the authorities that 
the area downstream be cordoned off until 
the recovery of the containers had been 
completed. Elevated cyanide values were 
recorded in the immediate vicinity of the 
incident, but these dissipated immediately 
upon recovery of the containers, and 
Inata’s environmental management team 
conducted water tests over a period of 
several weeks thereafter. Neither people 
nor livestock were injured or harmed as a 
result of the incident.
Avocet’s waste management programme 
was developed with an emphasis on the 
reduction of physical waste and where 
possible the recycling of any waste 
generated on the Inata mine site. Recycling 
is undertaken in partnership with local 
communities where recycling programmes 
provide jobs and incomes. In 2011, 17 new 
villages joined this programme. Between 
the participating villages approximately 
3,400 cubic metres of recyclable waste,  Avocet Mining PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
27
including lime bags, metal and plastic 
drums and wood were converted by local 
artisans to goods for local use in 2011.  
The objective for 2012 is to extend the 
programme to regional towns and to make 
the programmes self-sustaining by virtue  
of the income generated. Local participation 
in and awareness of physical waste 
management is continuously promoted to 
encourage communities to reduce their 
physical waste. Following the celebration  
of the World Environment Day at the Inata 
mine site, a waste collection ceremony was 
organised at the local Sona village with the 
widespread participation of villagers. 
In September 2011, a water purification 
system was installed at the Inata mine site 
for the provision of potable water. The use 
of bottled water on site was subsequently 
discontinued. This initiative cut the mine 
site’s physical waste generation down 
dramatically by removing the need for the 
recycling of some 500,000 plastic bottles 
per annum. In addition, the elimination 
of the need to transport this quantity of 
bottles from their point of supply has 
reduced the carbon footprint of both mine 
and employees. 
For the treatment of all waste that cannot 
be recycled, a standardised incinerator was 
installed in 2011. The incineration of this 
waste eliminates the need for it to be 
transported to a local dumping facility as 
well as the need for a waste landfill to be 
established at the Inata mine site. Since its 
construction, 52% of all non-recyclable 
waste has been incinerated.
Ecological monitoring is 
carried out. During 201 1 
a fauna inventory 
programme was initiated 
with the view to 
determining the impact of 
mining activities on wildlife 
as well as proposing 
solutions to minimise  
any such impacts. Avocet Mining PLC

Community relations review
The Inata Gold Mine is located in the north 
of Burkina Faso close to the Mali border 
where, prior to the construction and 
operation of the mine, local communities 
were predominantly pastoral, and the 
economy was based on subsistence 
farming. The communities in these areas 
are well established with a history dating 
back over 900 years. 
In 2010, Avocet created a foundation to act 
as the vehicle for its community based 
projects in Burkina Faso. The Fondation 
Avocet pour Burkina (Foundation) is 
governed by representatives of Avocet 
– Avocet’s subsidiary in Burkina Faso 
Société des Mines de Bélahouro SA (SMB) 
and local community leaders. The 
Foundation liaises with local communities 
and provides funding for select educational, 
health and other projects submitted by 
these communities and jointly identified as 
priorities between the SMB management 
and local community representatives. The 
Foundation is funded by SMB and following 
an initial contribution of US$140,000 by 
Avocet, ongoing payments are made by 
SMB at a rate of US$1 per ounce of gold 
produced. The day to day running of the 
Foundation is done by SMB’s Community 
Relations department, which is responsible 
for all communication with local 
communities and for the promotion of their 
sustainable social and economic 
development. 
In 2011, the Community Relations 
department placed particular emphasis 
on developing and enhancing relations in 
the region and with various government 
agencies. Regular monthly meetings with all 
community spokespersons and officials as 
well as regular visits by management into 
the local communities, promoted dialogue 
and improved relations. Broader 
governmental relations were enhanced with 
the hosting of visits from the Ministries of 
Agriculture, Mining, Water Resources and 
Environment. 
The Foundation led a number of corporate 
social responsibility initiatives in 2011, with 
its major projects focused on health, 
education, and clean water programmes.
The promotion of good health in the 
communities that it serves is one of the 
Foundation’s key objectives. During 2011 
the Foundation donated an ambulance to 
the Arbinda community some 30 km from 
the mine site. This provides the community 
with rapid access to the hospital facilities 
in Djibo and in 2011 transported over 40 
patients to its hospital. The Foundation 
also funded the building of a health and 
social wellness centre in Filio Village. 
A well-established network of government 
healthcare clinics is in place in rural Burkina 
Faso. The services provided by this network 
are supplemented by the SMB medical 
staff who conducts weekly visits to village 
clinics, rotating through each of the villages 
on a regular basis. During 2011, over 1,000 
patients were seen by SMB medical staff. 
These visits are coordinated with an 
ongoing programme of education for local 
communities on how to minimise risk of 
infection and diseases. As a result of 
relatively higher levels of employment 
around the Inata mine site, the population 
in this region is growing at a greater than 
average rate and this is placing strains 
on the existing medical infrastructure. 
For 2012, the Foundation is therefore 
considering the construction of a new 
government healthcare clinic, which would 
be built by the Foundation and maintained 
and run by the government. 
The promotion of basic education is also of 
key focus area of the Foundation. There are 
nine schools in the villages surrounding the 
Inata mine site that receive regular supplies 
from the Foundation. Donation of school 
kits to 839 children of all ages was made at 
the start of the 2011 academic year and 
educational visits for school children to the 
mine are also regularly arranged. 
As part of Avocet’s commitment to 
environmental education and rehabilitation, 
a school garden was developed at the 
Filio school. The garden was constructed 
by the children themselves with material 
provided by Avocet and the hope is that 
environmental education will start at this 
level. The school building was renovated 
at the same time and solar electricity 
panels installed. 
Easy access to potable water supply 
promotes good health and is an ongoing 
initiative of the Foundation. Water supplies 
to local communities benefited from the 
installation by the Foundation of two hand 
pumps and three solar pumps along with 
the rehabilitation of existing hand pumps 
throughout the course of 2011. 
SMB undertook a number of initiatives in 
2011 with regards to local employment and 
promotion of business opportunities for the 
communities surrounding the Inata mine 
site. These initiatives have resulted in an 
increased level of openness, transparency 
and understanding between the Company 
and the communities. Avocet and its 
contractors are the main source of 
permanent direct employment in the area 
around the Inata mine site, and wherever 
possible, Avocet procures supplies from 
local businesses. This is expected to create 
further, indirect employment as supporting 
enterprises develop to service the operation 
and its employees. Avocet has encouraged 
its contractors to follow these same 
principles.  29

2 During 2009 the Company changed its year end from March to December and reported a nine month period ended  
31 December 2009. In view of this change in year end in 2009 and short reporting period, the Company has provided 
unaudited comparatives for the twelve months ended 31 December 2009. 
REVENUE
Group revenue for the year was US$280.6 million compared with US$254.6 million in 2010. 
2010 results included a full year of revenue from the Company’s South East Asian mines, 
which were sold in June 2011. However, in 2011 this was offset by two major factors: first, 
ounces sold at Inata were significantly higher in 2011, as the mine benefited from the ramp 
up and debottlenecking work that was undertaken in the previous year; and second, 
average realised gold prices in 2011 were US$1,333 per ounce, a 13% increase compared 
with 2010. Higher realised prices partly reflected the restructure of Inata’s hedge in July 2011.

Unit costs at Inata increased from US$531 per ounce in 2010 to US$693 per ounce in 2011. 
The beneficial effect of higher gold production on unit costs per ounce of gold produced was 
more than offset by the impact of higher tonnes mined and processed, lower grades, and 
increases in input costs, notably increased labour rates and diesel prices, which were 
exacerbated by VAT on fuel, at 18%, becoming non-recoverable during 2011.

The Group reported a profit before tax of US$115.1 million in the year ended 31 December 
2011, compared with US$33.5 million in the year ended 31 December 2010. 
The 2011 profit figure included a number of exceptional items including gains on disposal 
of the Group’s non-core South East Asian assets totalling US$92.5 million, a gain on 
disposal of shares held in Avion Gold Corporation of US$9.0 million, the US$39.8 million 
cost of restructuring Inata’s hedge position in July 2011, and the US$3.1 million cost of 
listing on the Main Board of the London Stock Exchange. The results for 2010 included  
net exceptional gains of US$0.2 million, including the costs of listing on the Oslo Børs 
(US$2.4 million), offset by gains on disposal of a number of the Company’s non-core 
assets (US$2.6 million). 
Before exceptional items, profit before tax for the year ended December 2011 was 
US$56.4 million compared with US$33.4 million for the year ended December 2010, 
principally reflecting higher gold prices and the increase in production at Inata. 
TAXATIoN
The Group’s taxation charge amounted to US$10.0 million in 2011, analysed as follows:

10,020 15,337
The tax charge in Burkina Faso represents a deferred tax charge as a result of the 
accelerated capital allowances on assets related to the construction of the Inata mine, as 
well as an adjustment to reflect the increase in Inata’s tax rate to 27.5%, as from 2013 it is 
not expected to benefit from the reduced tax rate enjoyed in the first three years of activity 
in accordance with the country’s mining convention. 
Financial review continued
The Group reported a 
profit before tax of 
US$1 15. 1 million in the 
year ended 31 December 
201 1, compared with 
US$33.5 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2010. Avocet Mining PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2011

The tax charge in Avocet Mining PLC reflects the write off of deferred tax assets following 
a reassessment of recoverability, subsequent to the decision to sell the Group’s assets in 
South East Asia, and withholding tax suffered on dividends received from a subsidiary.
The taxes in Malaysia and Indonesia reflect the tax charges on profits generated in those 
countries prior to their sale. 
EBITDA
EBITDA represents operating profit before depreciation/amortisation, interest and taxes,  
as well as excluding any exceptional items in the period. It is not defined by IFRS but is 
commonly used as an indicator of the underlying cash generation of the business. 
EBITDA increased from US$86.3 million in 2010 to US$100.3 million in 2011, an 
improvement of 16%. This reflected improvements to gross profit as described above.

A total cash inflow of US$55.7 million was reported for the year ended 31 December 2011. 
Despite higher EBITDA, net cash generated by operations, before interest and tax, was 
slightly lower, due to working capital movements, principally associated with increased 
mining and processing activity levels at Inata. At 31 December 2011, the Group had cash 
of US$105.2 million, debt of US$29.0 million and net cash of US$76.2 million, compared 
with a net debt position at 31 December 2010 of US$28.5 million.

DEPREc IATIoN
The Group’s depreciation charge reduced from US$48.0 million in the year ended  
31 December 2010 to US$39.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2011. Depreciation  
at Inata increased from US$32.5 million to US$38.9 million, driven by an increase in gold 
production and continued investment in capex since first gold was poured in December 2009.

Exploration activity in West Africa increased significantly in 2011 with accelerated drilling 
programmes taking place in Guinea and in Burkina Faso. In addition to the US$31.9 million 
of deferred exploration expenditure (compared with US$9.9 million in 2010) shown in the 
cash flow statement within investing activities, a further US$1.8 million exploration support 
costs were expensed within other cost of sales during the year. 
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment in West Africa totalled US$47.3 
million. Significant investments in the year included the purchase of a third mining fleet 
(US$14 million), extension of the tailings storage facility (US$10 million), plant 
enhancements (US$9 million), barrage enhancements (US$6 million), and site buildings 
(US$5 million). 
In light of the agreement to sell South East Asia, which was signed in December 2010 
and largely completed in June 2011, exploration and capital expenditure in Malaysia 
and Indonesia was restricted to levels required to ensure the assets were transferred 
in good order.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have to prepare the financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs). Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss 
of the Company and group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
•	 state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
In so far as each of the Directors is aware: 
•	 there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and
•	 the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken 
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
 
To the best of our knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
•	 the management report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
In this, my first full year as chairman of Avocet, I should like to 
outline the approach that has been adopted towards corporate 
governance by myself and my colleagues on the Board, and to 
underline the importance attached not only to compliance with  
our regulatory requirements but also to achieving best practice  
in these areas. 
The Board is aware that it is accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders and wider stakeholders for the corporate governance 
of the Group. We are fully committed to acting in the interests of 
our shareholders, but also to ensuring we maximise the benefits  
of the Company’s operations to its broad range of stakeholders, 
including the communities in which we operate, our employees 
and their families, and national governments. 
Since its listing on the Oslo Børs in June 2010, Avocet has been 
required to comply with the guidelines of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code), or explain its reasons for non-
compliance. The move to the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange (LSE) has not changed that requirement; however the 
Company has recognised that the move brings with it an increase 
in focus on standards of corporate governance. 
In response, the Company has instigated a number of specific 
improvements, including the following:
•	 The creation of two new Board Committees: the Technical 
Committee; and the Health, Safety and Environment 
Committee; 
•	 The announcement of the intention to recruit two new Independent 
Non-executive Directors to strengthen the overall balance of skills 
and knowledge on the Board, particularly in technical areas  
and in experience of corporate governance (in which regard 
Gordon Wylie, was appointed on 22 February 2012); 
•	 The adoption of new policies, including a Code of Conduct and 
Ethics, an Anti-bribery policy, and a Sharedealing Code; and
•	 The adoption of the policy that all Directors put themselves 
forward for re-election by the shareholders at each AGM.
A full set of mandates for the Board, and its Committees, are 
available for view at the Company’s website www.avocetmining.com
In addition, we have reviewed and refreshed the way in which we 
as a Board assess our performance, and in particular have aligned 
this evaluation more closely with the guidelines of the Financial 
Reporting Council. In 2012, it is our intention to follow this up with 
an external assessment.

Annual Report and Accounts 2011
42
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2011 and in the 
preparation of this Annual Report and these Accounts, the 
Company has complied with the main and supporting principles 
and provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code as 
described in the following sections of this Report save in respect 
of the matter of the chairmanship of the Remuneration 
Committee, as discussed on page 44.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of the 
Company on behalf of the shareholders. The objective of the 
Company is to create long term value for shareholders, and the 
Board is responsible for delivering that objective by governing the 
Company and its subsidiaries. The Board is responsible for 
approving the Company strategy and policies, for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company, and is the ultimate decision-making 
body of the Group in all matters except those that are reserved 
for specific shareholder approval. 
The Board consists of two Executive Directors who hold the key 
operational positions in the Company and six Non-executive 
Directors, who bring a breadth of experience and knowledge. 
The Company has stated its intention to increase the Board 
membership to nine by recruiting two new Non-executive 
Directors in the early part of 2012. On 22 February 2012, G Wylie 
was appointed to the Board as a Non-executive Director.
The Board meets at least every three months and is supplied 
with appropriate and timely information. In 2011, the Board met 
nine times. Where appropriate, the Board invites external 
advisers and/or senior management to attend meetings to 
discuss matters where their expertise may be beneficial. 
 
The responsibilities of RP Edey as Chairman include those 
contained in the Supporting Principles to paragraph A.3 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, namely for providing leadership 
to the Board, ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role 
and setting its agenda; ensuring that adequate time is available 
for discussion of all agenda items, ensuring that the Directors 
receive accurate, timely and clear information; ensuring effective 
communication with shareholders; promoting a culture of

openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution to 
the Board of Non-executive Directors in particular; and ensuring 
constructive relationships between the Executive and Non-
executive Directors.
BOARD INDEPENDENCE
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires that the board of all 
companies (other than small companies) be made up of at least 
50% Independent Non-executive Directors (NEDs). The Company 
believes RP Edey, BJ Rourke, G Wylie and MJ Donoghue to be 
independent. In addition, the Company believes R Pilkington to be 
independent, in spite of circumstances that may indicate 
otherwise, specifically that he has served as a Board member for 
more than nine years. The Company believes that his character 
and judgement outweigh these considerations.
The remaining Non-executive Director, H Arnet, is acknowledged 
to be non-independent by virtue of his employment as Chief 
Executive Officer of Datum AS, a major shareholder of the 
Company. 
The Chairman of the Board is RP Edey, and the Chief Executive 
Officer is BA Richards. The Board has named RA Pilkington as the 
senior independent Non-executive Director.

BOARD PERFORMANCE
Each year, the Board undertakes a formal process to evaluate its effectiveness, and that of the Board Committees and individual 
Directors, consisting of an internal review of the Board’s performance against the guidelines of the Financial Reporting Council on Board 
effectiveness. The results of this self-assessment were collected in October 2011, and the findings discussed at the 14 December 2011 
Board meeting, as well with individual Board members to discuss specific development areas. 
It is the intention that this evaluation process be undertaken by an external facilitator on a three yearly basis, in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance guidelines.
BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS
There were nine Board meetings, six Audit Committee meetings, four Remuneration Committee meetings, and one meeting of the 
Nomination and Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Committees in the year. Attendance at these meetings of the Board by the 
relevant Board members is set out below:

The Technical and HSE Committees were formally established in October 2011. The HSE held its first meeting on 14 December 2011, 
while the Technical Committee was not formally convened before the end of the year. Prior to the establishment of these Committees, 
matters reserved for their review were covered by the Board and senior management.
BOARD COMMITTEES
While the Board retains responsibility for making key decisions, it also delegates other matters to various standing Committees.  
The purpose of this is to allow a more focused discussion on specific matters which would benefit from a forum outside the main  
Board, with a different balance of skills, experience and independence from its members. 
During the year, the Board undertook a review of its Committees, and as a result introduced two new formal Committees (the Technical 
Committee and the HSE Committee), while refreshing the mandates for all Committees. The membership and mandates for all 
Committees are available on the Company’s websites www.avocetmining.com.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
Purpose
The Nomination Committee was established to review the structure, size and composition (including the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience) of the Board and its Committees, and to review succession planning for the Board and senior management. 
It is also responsible for monitoring the on-going performance of the Board and its Committees. The Nomination Committee reports and 
makes recommendations to the Board in respect of any action required in these matters.
Composition
The Nominations Committee must consist of not less than three Non-executive Directors. Its members, and chairman, are to be 
determined by the Board. The current membership of the Committee comprises RP Edey (Chairman), H Arnet, RA Pilkington,  
MJ Donoghue, BJ Rourke and G Wylie. 
Operations
The Nomination Committee meets at least once a year, or more frequently as required. In 2011, it met once, particularly to discuss the 
Board composition in the context of the Group’s growth strategy, and its move to the Main Board of the London Stock Exchange. A key 
outcome of this meeting was to recommend the recruitment of two new independent Non-executive Directors, in order to enhance overall 
independence of the Board, and to provide a balance of skills among the Board members. 
Responsibilities
The Nomination Committee has the following responsibilities:
•	 to review and report on the composition of the Board and its Committees;
•	 to review and report on the performance of the Board and its Committees;
•	 to make recommendations as to changes to the Board and its Committees, including the nomination of Chairman of the Board, 
chairmen of each Committee and senior independent non-executive; Avocet Mining PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
44
•	 to ensure succession planning for executive Directors and 
senior managers;
•	 to review the overall leadership needs of the Group, including 
involving external advisers to facilitate this review and to assist 
with succession;
•	 to monitor appointments to the Board, and ensure compliance 
with statutory, legal, and other regulatory requirements; and
•	 to make recommendations to the Board considering any 
matters that might call into question the suitability of Directors 
or senior managers to continue in their roles.
The Nomination Committee is also responsible for ensuring 
compliance with the principles of B.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, specifically with regard to the need for 
candidates to be considered on merit, against objective criteria 
and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board, 
including gender. It is also responsible for satisfying itself that 
plans are in place for orderly succession for appointments to  
the Board and to senior management, so as to maintain an 
appropriate balance of skills and experience within the company 
and on the board and to ensure progressive refreshing of  
the board.
During the year, the Board identified that its balance of skills would 
be strengthened by an additional Non-executive Director with 
technical skills. External consultants were engaged to assist in the 
process of identifying a number of candidates, and examining their 
skills and experience against the current Board composition. As a 
result, G Wylie was appointed to the Board on 22 February 2012. 
The Board has initiated a search for an external candidate to  
take over the responsibility as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee to ensure compliance with provision D.2.1 of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
Purpose
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of the 
Directors and Executive Committee members, and sets the scale 
and structure of their remuneration with due regard to the interests 
of the shareholders and the overall performance of the Group.  
The Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to 
the Board concerning the Company’s overall philosophy and 
policy with respect to executive remuneration, bonuses and 
incentive arrangements including share and option awards, 
compensation payments and pension rights.
Composition
The Remuneration Committee must consist of not less than three 
Non-executive Directors. Its members, and chairman, are to be 
determined by the Board. The current membership of the 
Committee comprises RP Edey (Chairman), H Arnet, RA 
Pilkington, MJ Donoghue, BJ Rourke and G Wylie. 
The Company acknowledges that the UK Corporate Governance 
Code provision D.2.1 states that the chairman of the Board should 
not also be the chairman of the Remuneration Committee. In view 
of his experience, the Company feels it is appropriate for RP Edey  
to occupy this role. However, a search has been initiated for an 
appropriate external candidate to take over these responsibilities 
as early in 2012 as is practicable. 
Operations
The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice a year, or more 
frequently as required. In 2011, the Remuneration Committee met 
four times. As well as regular reviews of the remuneration levels of 
Executive Directors and senior managers, the Remuneration 
Committee also made the following recommendations to the 
Board during the year:
•	 the adoption of a revised set of short and long-term 
remuneration schemes (details of which can be found in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 57);
•	 the recommendation to the shareholders of the adoption of a 
revised employee share option scheme, to replace the scheme 
that had been originally established in 1999; and
•	 the approval of bonus payments to executives and senior 
management in respect of the sale of the Company’s South 
East Asian assets (see page 54).
Responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the following 
matters:
•	 to review the performance objectives and determine and agree 
the appropriate levels of remuneration for the Executive 
Directors, and the EXCO of the Company;
•	 to determine the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, 
Non-executive Directors, as well as Chairmen and members of 
all Board Committees, subject to the condition that no person 
shall participate in discussions relating to his or her own 
remuneration;
•	 to review the design and management of Group salary 
structures and incentive schemes, and to ensure proper 
authorisation for any awards made under such schemes;
•	 to review the recommendations of the Chief Executive of the 
Company as to the grant of share awards and other bonuses, 
and to approve such awards as appropriate; and
•	 to review and approve the Remuneration Report in the Avocet 
Mining PLC Annual Report.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Purpose
The Audit Committee reviews the principles, policies and practices 
adopted in the preparation of the financial statements of Avocet 
Mining PLC and its subsidiaries, as well as ensuring any other 
formal announcements relating to the financial performance of the 
Group comply with relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for assisting the Board in 
discharging its responsibilities with respect to the integrity of the 
Company’s financial statements, the effectiveness of the systems 
of governance, risk management and internal control, and 
monitoring the effectiveness and independence of the external 
auditors. It also reviews the requirement for an internal audit 
function within the Group. 
Composition
The Audit Committee must consist of not less than three Non-
executive Directors. The Audit Committee is chaired by BJ Rourke, 
and also comprises RA Pilkington and H Arnet. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code stipulates that at least one of the members of 
the Audit Committee must have recent and relevant financial 
experience. The Company believes that all members have such 
Report on corporate governance

Annual Report and Accounts 2011
45
experience, in particular BJ Rourke, who served for 17 years as an 
audit partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
Operations
The Audit Committee is required to meet twice a year, but in 
practice meets more frequently. In 2011, for example, the 
Committee met on six occasions. In addition to its members, the 
Audit Committee also routinely invites the Group’s auditors, the 
Finance Director, and other Board members to attend its meetings 
as required. 
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee reviews and monitors the integrity of the 
Group financial statements and press releases, as well as any 
other formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial 
performance. As part of this review, it focuses in particular on 
areas of judgement, appropriateness of policies, going concern 
matters, and any other areas it identifies as risks (eg on the 
grounds of materiality or uncertainty). 
In addition, the Audit Committee reviews plans for, and the 
conduct of, the Group’s external audit, receiving the report of the 
auditors, and thereby monitoring not only the performance of the 
Company’s internal finance teams but also that of the auditors 
themselves. On consideration of the performance of the external 
auditors (Grant Thornton UK LLP), the Audit Committee concluded 
that it was appropriate to recommend their re-appointment to the 
shareholders at the AGM on 3 May 2012. 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing the internal 
controls of the Company, and assessing the requirement for an 
internal audit function. The Audit Committee concluded that the 
key activities of an internal audit function (including a review of 
internal controls) were being undertaken by the finance team, and 
that in view of the size of the organisation, a separate internal audit 
team was not appropriate. 
It is also responsible for monitoring the appropriateness of the 
Group’s anti-bribery policies, particularly in light of the UK Bribery 
Act 2010, which came into force in July 2011. 
TECHNICAL COMMITTEE
Purpose
The purpose of the Technical Committee is to provide assurance 
to the Board as to the operational performance and operating risks 
of the Company, with particular regard to those areas where 
technical understanding is required (including exploration, mining, 
development, construction, security, and supply chain 
management).
Composition
The Technical Committee consists of MJ Donoghue (Chairman),  
G Wylie, BA Richards (Chief Executive Officer), PA Flindell 
(EVP Exploration) and RQ Gray (EVP Operations, West Africa). 
The Committee’s mandate requires that the chairman be a  
Non-executive Director with technical expertise, and MJ 
Donoghue has significant experience in running mining 
operations over a long career. 
Operations
The Committee meets at least four times a year, or more frequently 
as required. The Committee was formally established as a Board 
Committee in October 2011, prior to which it operated in the 
capacity of an unofficial Board Committee (although its members 
were the same, and its remit in line with that set out in its formal 
mandate) . Its establishment as a Board Committee was intended 
to formalise its role, and the Committee was strengthened by the 
addition of a new independent Non-executive Director with 
technical experience, G Wylie, who was appointed in February 
2012. The Committee did not formally meet in 2011, however there 
were several meetings of its predecessor during the year. 
Responsibilities
The Technical Committee is responsible for reviewing and 
assessing all operating activities of the Group. This includes 
assessing risk management processes, undertaking regular site 
visits and liaising with teams on the ground, reviewing strategic 
planning and reporting, ensuring legal, environmental and 
regulatory compliance, and making recommendations to the 
Board on all matters where technical understanding is required.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT (HSE) COMMITTEE
Purpose
The HSE Committee was established to provide the Board with 
assurance that the appropriate systems are in place to deal with 
the management of health, safety, environmental, and community 
relations matters. Previously, significant issues in this area were 
dealt with by the Board itself. The HSE Committee was established 
in October 2011 in order to formalise a separate forum exclusively 
for the purpose of reviewing such matters. 
Composition
The HSE Committee comprises G Wylie (Chairman),  
MJ Donoghue, BJ Rourke, and RP Edey. 
Operations
Following its establishment in October 2011, it met for the first time 
in December 2011. Going forward, the HSE Committee is 
expected to meet at least four times a year.
Responsibilities
The HSE Committee’s particular responsibilities include the 
following:
•	 to establish and review the Group’s policies with respect to 
health, safety, environmental, and community relations matters;
•	 to ensure adequate procedures and responses are in place to 
deal with accidents, fatalities, or other serious medical, 
environmental, or safety issues;
•	 to monitor and review the performance of the Group with 
regard to health, safety, environmental, and community 
relations matters, and to ensure compliance with relevant local 
and international regulations;
•	 to review and investigate any serious accidents and deaths that 
occur in connection with any Group employees, contractors, 
consultants, suppliers, or agents operating on behalf of Avocet, 
which may take place on or off Group sites, in order to establish 
cause and recommend further actions as may be required; 
•	 to monitor the quality and frequency of reporting of health, 
safety, environmental and community relations matters; Avocet Mining PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
46
•	 to maintain awareness of all regulatory changes, and to ensure 
the Board is aware of relevant material changes, in health, 
safety, environmental and community relations matters;
•	 to report to the Board with regard to any health, safety, 
environmental and community relations matters that should be 
brought to its attention; and
•	 to review and approve the Group Health, Safety and 
Environment and Community Relations disclosures within the 
Annual Report, or other relevant publications.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
No Director has any service contracts, consultancy agreements or 
other such arrangements with a notice period in excess of one 
year.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors regularly review the liquidity of the Company, and as 
part of the review of quarterly financial results, management are 
required to submit a cash forecast in order to allow the Board to 
determine formally whether they view as appropriate the continued 
application of the ‘going concern’ basis for the Company’s 
financial results. As part of this review, key variables are sensitised 
(for example the gold price), and the impact not only on the cash 
balance but also on any banking covenants is also tested (in 2011, 
this included the covenants related to the Macquarie Bank Limited 
project finance facility at Inata). 
This review therefore happens at least four times each year, and 
more frequently where required. During 2011, an additional review 
of going concern was required as part of the Board’s statement 
contained within the Main Board listing prospectus, attesting to 
the adequacy of the Group’s working capital over the coming  
18 months. 
Based on the above reviews, the Board has approved the going 
concern basis for the 2011 financial statements. 
AUDITORS
A resolution to re-appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditors will 
be proposed at the AGM.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The Board regularly reviews the provision of non-audit services 
from its auditors. The Board is satisfied that the provision of 
non-audit services by Grant Thornton UK LLP is compatible with 
the general standard of independence for auditors and does not 
give rise to any conflict of interest. During the year, the Company 
engaged Grant Thornton UK LLP to act as reporting accountant 
with respect to the application for listing on the Main Board of the 
London Stock Exchange. This work was undertaken by a team, 
and led by a partner, that operated separately from the audit team, 
and the Company was therefore satisfied that the independence of 
Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditors was not compromised.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is ultimately responsible for maintaining a sound system 
of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the 
Company’s assets, in which it looks to the recommendations of 
the Audit Committee. Such a system is designed to manage, but 
may not eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. 
There are inherent limitations in any control system and, 
accordingly, even the most effective system can provide only 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. However the Board is comfortable that the 
internal control systems provide sufficient assurance as to the 
safety of the Company’s assets and the value of the Group’s 
operations as a whole.
In accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on 
Internal Control, an ongoing process has been established for 
identifying, evaluating and managing risks faced by the Company. 
This process has been in place throughout the year and to the 
date of approval of these financial statements and includes the 
following features:
•	 key risks to and impact of these on the Group’s business are 
reviewed and considered by the Directors;
•	 the Board reviews these key risks as part of the budget 
approval process;
•	 Executive Directors, and senior finance staff, visit each 
operation regularly, when these key risks are reviewed and 
actions taken as necessary;
•	 control procedures have been communicated to operations’ 
management who review local procedures for Group 
compliance;
•	 the head office finance function visits each operation to review 
local financial controls and compliance with Group procedures 
and report to the Audit Committee; 
•	 the chairman of the Audit Committee undertakes a site visit 
each year to oversee in person the adequacy of control 
procedures in place; 
•	 the Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of the internal 
controls in operation during the year, and reports to the Board, 
to enable the Board to perform its own review of the 
effectiveness of these controls;
•	 the Group has a comprehensive system for financial reporting. 
The Board approves the annual budget and life of mine 
forecasts. Monthly results are reported against budgets and 
variances analysed. Great importance is placed on the 
monitoring and control of cash flows, and cash forecasts are 
reported to the Board (including as part of the Going Concern 
review);
•	 as part of the year end external audit, management has 
requested that the auditors prepare a management letter on 
their findings with regard to the internal financial controls. This 
is reported to, and reviewed by, the Audit Committee;
•	 the Audit Committee review the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements on a quarterly basis, with particular focus being 
placed on areas of judgement and risk, and make a 
recommendation to the Board prior to results being approved 
for announcement. Monthly consolidated financial statements 
are also sent to the full Board for review;
•	 the external auditors periodically carry out a review of the head 
office’s internal financial controls and report to management 
and the Audit Committee;
•	 the Board approves all long term currency, commodity and 
interest rate hedging, along with all significant capital 
investment projects and debt facilities; and
Report on corporate governance

Annual Report and Accounts 2011
47
•	 the Chairman and the executive Directors meet on a regular 
basis to discuss the management of the Group and review any 
business risk and actions necessary. 
EMPLOYEES
Regular meetings are held with employee representatives to 
discuss strategies and the financial position of the Group and their 
own business units. The Group is committed to providing equal 
opportunity for individuals in all aspects of employment.
During 2011, national workers at the Inata Gold Mine underwent a 
ten-day strike. Their demands centred around improved working 
conditions and pay. Following negotiations with management, the 
strike was called off and work resumed, with revised terms that 
were satisfactory to employees and management. 
Senior management are conscious of the sensitivities around 
working in a developing nation, and the obligations the Company 
has to its communities and national employees. Avocet is 
committed to developing its national staff, through training 
programmes and on-the-job learning, not only as part of its 
partnership with the countries in which it operates, but also for 
sound business reasons. However maintaining good relationships 
remains a key challenge, and progress is constantly monitored by 
the Board and its Committees.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company values the views of its shareholders and recognises 
their interest in the Company’s strategy and performance, Board 
membership and the quality of its management teams. It holds 
regular meetings with, and presents to, its institutional and private 
shareholders to discuss its objectives. The Company also regularly 
meets, with the help of its brokers, institutions that do not currently 
hold shares in the Company, to inform them of its objectives.
The AGM is a forum for communicating with institutional and 
private investors, and all shareholders are encouraged to attend 
and participate. The Chairmen of the Board Committees are also 
available to answer questions, along with the Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director (RA Pilkington). Separate resolutions are 
proposed on each issue so that they can be given proper 
consideration and there is a resolution to approve the Annual 
Report and Accounts, and to approve the Remuneration Report. 
The Company counts all proxy votes and will indicate the level of 
proxies lodged on each resolution, after it has been dealt with by a 
show of hands.
The Company operates and regularly updates its website  
(www.avocetmining.com) with shareholder information. 
The Company has engaged the services of Buchanan 
Communications to assist in its financial public relations strategy.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board is responsible for the management of the Company on 
behalf of the shareholders. The objective of the Company is to 
create long term value for shareholders, and the Board is 
responsible for delivering that objective by governing the Company 
and its subsidiaries.
In so doing, the Board is responsible for understanding the risks 
faced by the Company and determining the risk appetite of the 
Company. The Board ensures these risks are managed 
appropriately, in order to draw a balance between safeguarding 
the assets and interests of the Company and maximising its 
exposure to sustainable growth and profitability. The Board and 
senior management regularly monitor areas of risk. Senior 
management regularly visits operations to understand site-specific 
risks as well as to assess local political, fiscal and legal risks. In 
this regard, the Group maintains a strict policy of compliance with 
local laws and regulations, and community issues (including health 
and safety, community development, and environmental 
responsibility) are at the forefront of strategic and operational 
decision-making.
Although the Board retains responsibility for managing the overall 
risk of the Group, certain specific risk areas are delegated to 
Committees as follows:
•	 Financial risks and internal financial controls are reviewed by 
the Audit Committee;
•	 Health, Safety and Environmental risks are monitored by the 
HSE Committee; and
•	 Technical Operating risks are overseen by the Technical 
Committee.
The key risks that relate to the Group have been set out below, 
categorised as follows:
•	 Economic risks
 – Risks associated with changes in the markets in which it 
operates
•	 Operational risks
 – Risks relating to the operation of the mines and exploration 
projects
•	 Country risks
 – Country-specific risks related to Burkina Faso, Guinea, and 
any other countries in which Avocet may do business
•	 Other risks
 – Other significant risks not covered by the above categories. Avocet Mining PLC

Risk Comment Business 
Impact
Mitigation
Economic risks
Exposure to a 
fall in gold 
prices 
Avocet’s revenue is dependent on the market 
price of gold for all unhedged gold sales. 
High Avocet maintains a policy of exposure to the 
spot gold price but has forward sales contracts 
covering approximately 20% of its production 
until 2018 (at a price of US$950 per oz.). 
Exposure to a 
strengthening in 
local currency 
rates
Avocet realises US dollars for all of its gold 
sales, and reports its results in US dollars. 
The Company has some exposure to the West 
African CFA, and the Guinean Franc, being the 
local currencies of Burkina Faso and Guinea 
respectively, in which many of its costs are 
denominated.
Low The Company continually monitors fluctuations 
in currency rates, and may on occasion purchase 
short term currency hedges (although did not do 
so in 2011). It is Avocet’s policy to minimise the 
value of cash held in non-US dollar currencies. 
Exposure to 
unfavourable 
movements in 
purchase prices 
of input 
materials 
The Company is exposed, both directly and 
indirectly, to the purchase price of diesel, steel, 
and reagents used in gold production.
Moderate The Company seeks to minimise its usage of 
input materials. It also monitors commodity 
prices constantly and considers whether 
hedging might be appropriate. No hedging was 
entered into during 2011.
Exposure to 
increases in the 
market prices of 
the equipment 
and services it 
uses
Avocet is subject to increases in the market 
prices for services and equipment (eg mining 
contractors, drilling, tyres, vehicles, etc). During 
2011, a gold price-led boom in mining activity 
led to increased demand for related services, 
and sector-wide price increases were seen.
Moderate The Company seeks to negotiate the best 
possible rates for all services and products it 
receives, taking into account not only price, but 
service quality and reliability. 
Risk Comment Business 
Impact
Mitigation
Operational risks
Exposure to 
mining hazards
The Company is exposed to a number of risks 
and hazards typically associated with mining – 
eg pit wall failure, adverse weather, and 
mechanical breakdowns.
Moderate Avocet’s operational teams regularly monitor 
mining risks, and report to the Technical 
Committee, who are responsible, on behalf of 
the Board, for ensuring appropriate measures 
are in place for anticipating, and responding to, 
such matters.
Reliability of 
Mineral 
Resources and 
Mineral 
Reserves 
The calculation of Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves involves significant 
assumptions and estimates that may prove 
inaccurate, including gold price assumptions. 
Moderate Avocet’s Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserve 
estimates are prepared either by in-house staff or 
by third party consultants who have considerable 
experience and are certified by appropriate 
bodies such as JORC and NI43-101. The 
Technical Committee is responsible for ensuring 
the appropriate controls are in place to provide 
assurance that Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserve estimates are appropriately prepared. Avocet Mining PLC

Country risks
Exposure to 
political and 
social risks in 
Burkina Faso 
and Guinea
Avocet’s main assets are located in Burkina 
Faso and in Guinea, and the Company is 
therefore exposed to any adverse changes in 
the political and social situations in those 
countries. 
Moderate The Board closely monitors the political and 
social situations in the countries in which it 
operates, drawing on internal and external 
advisors. 
Exposure to 
changes in 
fiscal and 
regulatory 
regime
In addition to political/social risks, Avocet is 
exposed specifically to changes in the mining, 
labour and tax codes in Burkina Faso and 
Guinea, which may result in a more challenging, 
or costly, operating environment.
Moderate Avocet is committed to acting in partnership with 
all stakeholders, including the governments and 
communities of the countries in which it 
operates. It regularly meets government 
ministers to discuss fiscal and regulatory 
matters and to ensure the Company and its 
shareholders’ interests are well represented.

Impact
Mitigation
Other risks
Portfolio risk of 
having a single 
operating asset
Since the sale of Avocet’s South East Asian 
assets, the Company is reliant on a single 
revenue-generating asset (Inata). Any factors 
that affect production at Inata will consequently 
have a significant impact on Group results.
Moderate It is the Company’s policy to pursue growth 
opportunities through organic means (in Guinea, 
as well as through expansion at Inata itself), as 
well as reviewing acquisition opportunities which 
can be shown to be value accretive.
Litigation Avocet is the subject of legal action initiated by 
its former partner in Indonesia, with regard to 
the sale of various Indonesian entities in 2011. 
Moderate 
(with low 
probability)
The District Court of Jakarta, Indonesia recently 
dismissed the case, accepting Avocet’s claim 
that the Indonesian courts do not have 
jurisdiction over the dispute.
PT LT has appealed this ruling, but the Company 
is confident that all the actions taken in respect 
of the transaction have been in accordance with 
prevailing rules and regulations and there are no 
grounds for any such legal action. 
Licence 
administration
Avocet holds a number of exploration and 
mining licences. These licences normally 
include conditions for ongoing operation (eg 
minimum spend levels) and require periodic 
renewal. Renewals are not normally 
guaranteed.
Moderate Avocet maintains good relations with the 
appropriate authorities and management are 
responsible for ensuring conditions are adhered 
to and renewal applications submitted in good 
order.  Avocet Mining PLC

This report is presented to shareholders by the Board and provides information on Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 
December 2011. A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 3 May 2012, inviting them to consider and 
approve this report. This report complies with the requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) regulations 2008 and the UK Corporate Governance Code.
PERFORMANCE
The chart shows Avocet’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) compared with the FTSE All Share Index and FTSE Gold Mines Index over the 
five year period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011. The FTSE Gold Mines Index has been chosen as it comprises companies 
who are operating in the same sector as Avocet and are exposed to broadly similar risks and opportunities. In addition, the FTSE All 
Share Index has been chosen as an appropriate general index of UK equities.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Avocet’s remuneration policies, as well as specific awards for Directors and senior managers, are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. Details of this Committee’s purpose, composition, operation and responsibilities are set out on page 44.
The Chief Executive Officer attends meetings at the invitation of the Committee to provide guidance as appropriate on the impact of 
remuneration decisions and on the performance of senior executives; he does not attend when his own remuneration is discussed. The 
Company Secretary also attends. During the course of the year, the Committee was advised by Kepler Associates. Kepler Associates do 
not provide any other services or advice to the Company.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided, other than as shareholders, or any day to day 
involvement in running the business. All Directors are required to submit to the Board on an annual basis a declaration of their interests, 
and to seek approval from the Board, whenever these interests change, to ensure that such changes do not cause a conflict in the 
interests of the individual in his capacity as a member of the Board.

REMUNERATION POLICY
The Company operates within a competitive environment and its performance depends on the individual contributions of the Directors 
and employees. Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain executives of the calibre necessary to 
manage the Company’s operations and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value. The performance of the Executive Directors is 
assessed by the Committee and taken into account when determining their remuneration.
In common with many companies at a similar stage of development, Avocet has a competitive approach to executive remuneration.  
The total remuneration for the Executive Directors and other senior executives consists of five main elements, as follows:

During the year, the Committee proposed no change to the incentive schemes summarised above, that were reviewed and approved in 
the Company’s last Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2011, and believes that the Company continues to offer remuneration 
arrangements which motivate and retain the executives who are critical to the success of the Company, and to align their interests with 
those of shareholders.

COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION
The elements that comprised the remuneration package for the Executive Directors during 2011 are set out below.
Salary and benefits
Executive Directors’ basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee. In setting salaries the Committee considers 
pay levels and practices at Avocet’s principal competitors as well as FTSE-listed companies of a similar size. The Committee also takes 
into account pay and conditions across the Group when setting base salaries for the Executive Directors. No increases are proposed for 
2012. During 2011, the base salary levels were £300,000 for BA Richards, and £250,000 for AM Norris. 
Benefits (including pension contributions)
The Company offers medical cover to all its key employees, as well as additional benefits (such as gym membership).
In addition, in 2011, the Remuneration Committee approved a Defined Contribution Pension Scheme to be implemented in 2012,  
with a minimum employer pension contribution for UK employees (including Executive Directors) of 3% of base salary, together with an 
opportunity for employees to contribute up to 6% of their salary, which would be matched by additional employer contributions giving a 
maximum total combined pension contribution of 15% of salary (with a maximum cost to the Company of 9% of the UK base salary cost).
Annual Incentive
The Executive Directors may earn an annual incentive of 50% of salary for target, up to a maximum of 75% of salary. Awards of up to 
62.5% of salary are determined with reference to a scorecard of stretching corporate objectives aligned to the Company’s business 
strategy. For 2011, this included EBITDA, gold production, reserves and resources and specific strategic milestones. The outcome 
against the scorecard is then adjusted up or down by between 0 and 20% based on performance against personal/strategic objectives.
The Company operates bonus deferral for Executive Directors. Under this plan, 50% of any annual incentive award in excess of £30,000 
is mandatorily deferred into Avocet shares. These deferred shares may vest after a further one-year holding period, subject to continued 
employment. The remainder of any earned bonus is paid in cash after the year end.
Award opportunities to Executive Directors will remain unchanged for 2012 and the operation of the Annual Incentive will be broadly 
similar.
Long Term Incentive Plans
The long term incentive plans currently comprise:
(a) The Performance Share Plan (the PSP) 
Performance share awards, being conditional awards granted as shares or nil-cost options, are awarded to key executives (including 
Executive Directors). Performance share awards will not vest unless the Company’s TSR performance over the three year performance 
period is at least at the median of a comparator group comprising companies operating in the same sector, whereby the award will vest 
as follows: 
TSR position of the Company relative to the comparator group Percentage of shares which vest
Below median 0%
At median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Between 25% and 100% on a straight-line basis
Upper quartile and above 100%
Awards are made to eligible employees including Executive Directors on a discretionary basis. 
The PSP was first introduced during the year, following approval by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 
2011. It is the intention that awards be made annually, shortly after the release of the previous year’s full year results, and that the 
performance periods be based on three calendar years. 
No awards were made during 2011, as the scheme was introduced part way through the year. Awards for the year ended December 2011 
will therefore be made shortly after the announcement of the Group’s full year results, at the same time as the 2012 awards. The 
performance period for the 2011 awards will be 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013, while the performance period for the 2012 awards 
will be 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014. Under the rules of the PSP, shares do not vest for continuing employees under these 
schemes until three years after the grant of the awards, therefore any shares released under both of these awards will not be transferred 
to participants before February 2015.

(b) The Share Option Plan (the Option Plan) 
The Option Plan was also introduced in 2011. Options may be awarded to employees with an exercise price per share equal to the market 
value of a share at the time of grant. Options awards for the first cycle only will vest in three equal tranches over the three years from 
grant. The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that underlying performance has been sufficient for the options to vest. 
Subsequent grants of options will cliff vest after three years, subject to performance.
For 2011, BA Richards was awarded 184,838 options with an exercise price of 219.33p (an option award with a fair value of 75% of salary) 
and the FD was awarded 100,000 options with an exercise price of 219.33p (an option award with a fair value of 37.5% of salary). The 
aggregate of awards under this plan to any individual within a single financial year may not exceed 200% of salary except in exceptional 
circumstances, subject to Remuneration Committee approval.
SERVICE CONTRACTS – EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executive Directors currently have employment contracts which may be terminated by the Company or employee with twelve months of 
notice. No other payments are made for compensation for loss of office.
LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT – CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Chairman and other Non-executive Directors each have a formal letter of appointment setting out their duties and responsibilities. 
These letters are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. 
Chairman’s fees 
It is the Company’s policy that the Chairman should be remunerated on a competitive basis and at a level which reflects his contribution 
to the Group, as assessed by the Board. Details of his fees can be found in the Total Remuneration of Directors below.
Non-executive Directors’ fees
The Board as a whole, with the benefit of independent professional advice, determines Non-executive Directors’ fees, although  
Non-executive Directors do not vote on any increases of their own fees. Fees are set to reflect the responsibilities and time spent by  
the Directors on the affairs of the Company. For 2011, the basic fee for Non-executive Directors was set at £40,000 with an additional 
£10,000 for the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Details of actual Non-executive Directors’ fees received during the year can be  
found in the Total Remuneration of Directors Summary overleaf. Avocet Mining PLC

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST (EBT) AND UK SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN (SIP)
The Company has established an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) and a UK Share Incentive Plan (SIP). 
The EBT, which is administered by independent trustees, is funded by Avocet and holds shares that may be used, on the 
recommendation of the Remuneration Committee and at the discretion of the trustees, exclusively for the settlement of employee share 
awards. Shares released in this manner may be for the settlement of awards made under the Share Bonus Plan, Performance Share 
Plan, Deferred Bonus Plan, or to satisfy the exercise of share options, as well as previous discretionary share bonus awards. Restricted 
shares may be held in the EBT prior to release. 
The SIP is a plan that allows UK tax residents to benefit from share awards under favourable taxation terms, subject to restrictions. Any 
awards made under this plan must be made under terms consistent with UK taxation requirements. 
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the following restricted share allocations and releases were made under the EBT:

SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
In 2011, the Company introduced a new scheme – the Share Option Plan. Prior to 2011, the Company awarded share options under an 
older scheme, originally introduced in 1999. All new awards are to be made under the newer scheme, however outstanding awards under 
the older scheme are still valid, and may be exercised at the appropriate time, providing the relevant performance conditions are satisfied 
(specifically the requirement for growth in the Company’s net assets per share, and returns to shareholders, through share price increase 
and dividends, to be in excess of at least half of the companies in the FTSE Gold Mines Index). 
The share options held by the Executive Directors under either of these schemes during the year were as follows:

SHARE PRICE MOVEMENTS DURING 2011
The mid-market closing price of the Company’s shares at 31 December 2011 was £1.85 (31 December 2010: £2.37). The highest and 
lowest trading prices of the Company’s shares during the year were £2.87 and £1.78 respectively.
DILUTION
Taking account of all shares newly issued as a consequence of incentive schemes over the ten-year period to 31 December 2011 plus 
outstanding equity awards under all the Company’s equity schemes, where new issue shares may be used to satisfy their exercise, 
potential dilution is less than 10% of the issued ordinary shares.

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings; the Group financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations as 
adopted by the European Union at 31 December 2011.
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for share based payments that are fair 
valued at the date of grant and other financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. The accounting policies applied in 
these financial statements are unchanged from those used in the previous annual financial statements. 
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (Revised 2007) requires presentation of a comparative statement of financial position as at the 
beginning of the first comparative period, in some circumstances. Management considers that this is not necessary in these financial 
statements as the 31 December 2010 statement of financial position is the same as previously published. 
Certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements involve the use of judgement and/or estimation. Judgements, 
estimations and sources of estimation uncertainty are discussed in note 2.
The parent company financial statements in notes 36 to 57 present information about the Company as a separate entity rather than about 
the Group, and have continued to be prepared under UK GAAP as permitted by the Companies Act 2006.
Accounting standards not yet in issue
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new accounting standards, and amendments to, or interpretations of, 
existing standards have been published but are not yet effective. The Group has not early adopted any of these pronouncements. The 
new standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements are as follows 
(effective dates stated below are for accounting periods commencing on or after those dates):
•	 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2015) 
•	 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (effective 1 January 2013) 
•	 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (effective 1 January 2013) 
•	 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (effective 1 January 2013) 
•	 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement (effective 1 January 2013) 
•	 IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised June 2011) (effective 1 January 2013) 
•	 IAS 27 (Revised), Separate Financial Statements (effective 1 January 2013) 
•	 IAS 28 (Revised), Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (effective 1 January 2013) 
•	 Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets – Amendments to IFRS 7 (effective 1 July 2011) 
•	 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets – Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes (effective 1 January 2012) 
•	 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income – Amendments to IAS 1 (effective 1 July 2012) 
•	 Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IFRS 7 (effective 1 January 2013) 
•	 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32 (effective 1 January 2014) 
•	 Mandatory Effective Date and Transition Disclosures – Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 (effective 1 January 2015) 
•	 IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine (effective 1 January 2013)
The Directors anticipate that all the above pronouncements, where relevant, will be adopted in the Group’s financial statements for the 
year beginning 1 January 2012 and will have little impact on the Group’s accounting policies or results.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed future cash forecasts, with particular reference to the Company’s debt servicing obligations and associated 
covenants as well as its capital investment plans at Inata, and have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources 
to meet its commitments and to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
2. Ju DGements in applyin G accountin G policies an D sou Rces o F estimation unce Rtainty
Certain amounts included in the financial statements involve the use of judgement and/or estimation. These are based on management’s 
best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to prior experience. However, judgements and estimations 
regarding the future are a key source of uncertainty and actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. 
Information about judgements and estimation is contained in the accounting policies and/or other notes to the financial statements. The 
key areas are summarised below:
Functional currencies
Identification of functional currencies requires a judgement as to the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
companies of the Group operate. This is based on analysis of the economic environments and cash flows of the subsidiaries of 
the Group.
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2011 Avocet Mining PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Deferred exploration expenditure
The recoverability of exploration amounts capitalised within intangible assets is assessed based on a judgement about the feasibility of 
the project and estimates of its future cash flows. Future gold prices and operating costs are sources of estimation uncertainty. The 
Group periodically makes judgements as to whether its deferred exploration expenditure may have been impaired, based on internal and 
external indicators. Any impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows.
Carrying values of property, plant and equipment
The Group periodically makes judgements as to whether its property, plant and equipment may have been impaired, based on internal 
and external indicators. Any impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows. 
Deferred stripping costs
The recoverability of deferred stripping costs is assessed based on the projected future cash flows of the project. The Company does not 
anticipate deferring any stripping costs from its current operations.
Deferred tax
Estimates of future profitability are required when assessing whether a deferred tax asset may be recognised.
Mineral resources and mineral reserves
Quantification of mineral resources requires a judgement on the reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. Quantification of 
mineral reserves requires a judgement on whether mineral resources are economically mineable. These judgements are based on 
assessment of mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors involved, in accordance 
with the Canadian National Instrument NI 43-101 and the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and 
Metallurgy, Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia (‘JORC code’). These factors are a source of uncertainty and 
changes could result in an increase or decrease in mineral resources and mineral reserves. This would in turn affect certain amounts in 
the financial statements such as depreciation and closure provisions, which are calculated on projected life of mine figures. 
Inventory valuations
Valuations of gold in stockpiles and in circuit require estimations of the amount of gold contained in, and recovery rates from, the various 
work in progress. These estimations are based on analysis of samples and prior experience. A judgement is also required about when 
stockpiles will be used and what gold price should be applied in calculating net realisable value; these are both sources of uncertainty.
Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental provisions
Such provisions require a judgement on likely future obligations, based on assessment of technical, legal and economic factors. The 
ultimate cost of environmental remediation is uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors, including changes to 
the relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques and changes to the life of mine.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
Judgements are made as to whether a past event has led to a liability that should be recognised in the financial statements or disclosed 
as a contingent liability. Quantifying any such liability often involves judgements and estimations. These judgements are based on a 
number of factors including the nature of the claim or dispute, the legal process and potential amount payable, legal advice received, 
previous experience and the probability of a loss being realised. Each of these factors is a source of estimation uncertainty.
Acquisitions and disposals
Accounting for acquisitions requires an estimation of the fair value of assets acquired and consideration paid, including deferred 
consideration. These estimations are based on the condition and useful lives of assets, future gold production, and the projected cash 
flows generated. Projections of future gold production are a source of estimation uncertainty in calculating deferred consideration. 
Non-current assets and liabilities classified as held for sale and discontinued operations 
When the Group intends to sell a group of assets (a disposal group), and if sale within 12 months is judged to be highly probable, the 
assets and liabilities of the disposal group are classified as ‘held for sale’ and presented separately in the statement of financial position. 
The judgement as to whether the completion of a sale is considered to be highly probable is based on the circumstances and facts 
available at the time of classification. A disposal process is dependent on a variety of potential events that are outside of the control of 
the entity.
Capitalisation of pre-commercial mining costs and revenue
All costs and revenues at Inata between 1 January and 31 March 2010 related to the testing and development phase, prior to the 
commencement of commercial operations. Therefore, these costs and revenues have been capitalised as part of mining property, plant 
and equipment. From 1 April 2010, all revenues and operating expenses in respect of mining operations at Inata have been recognised in 
the income statement.  Avocet Mining PLC

Recoverability of VAT
Recoverability of the VAT receivable in Burkina Faso is assessed based on a judgement of the validity of the claim and, following review by 
management, the carrying value in the financial statements is considered to be fully recoverable.
Forward contracts for sale of non-financial items – own use exemption
The Group has entered into forward contracts for the delivery of gold at a fixed amount and price per quarter. The forward contracts are 
deemed to be outside of the scope of IAS 39, as exempted by IAS 39.5, on the basis that they are for own use, and gold produced will be 
physically delivered to meet the contractual requirement in future periods. Following the disposal on 24 June 2011 of the Company’s two 
producing mines in South East Asia, the forward contracts were restructured to buy back approximately 20% of the forward contracts 
and extend the delivery profile of the remaining ounces outstanding, with the result that the hedged proportion of production from the 
Company’s one remaining producing mine, Inata, was reduced from approximately 60% to approximately 20%. Management has 
reviewed the transaction and concluded that the contract remains outside the scope of IAS 39 on the basis that a one-off settlement, in 
response to the changing operational profile of the Group following the disposal of South East Asian assets, does not represent a 
practice of net settlement such that the contracts should be treated as financial instruments under IAS 39. 
The original forward contract arrangement comprised a single contract containing a series of delivery obligations and corresponding 
rights to receive cash. As part of the restructure of the forward contracts, an element was settled for cash, however it is considered that 
this does not preclude the residual contract deliveries from being eligible for the own use exemption under IAS 39.5. It has been judged 
that the legal form of there being a single contract rather than the arrangement being structured as multiple contracts should not affect 
the accounting conclusion.

The Group financial statements consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings using the acquisition accounting 
method. On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiary’s identifiable assets and liabilities which exist at the date of acquisition are 
recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition on that date. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired are included from the 
date of acquisition. In the event of the sale of a subsidiary, the subsidiary results are consolidated up to the date of completion of the sale. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured by the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed 
at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition where the acquisition completed prior to accounting periods 
commencing 1 January 2010. For any acquisitions occurring after 1 January 2010, the costs of acquisition will be recognised in the 
income statement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of the 
acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired the difference is recognised directly in the income 
statement as a gain. Goodwill acquired at the time of the acquisition is reviewed annually to assess whether impairment of the carrying 
value is required.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to equity. All other transactions, 
balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated, unless the unrealised loss provides 
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items include the impairment of 
deferred exploration expenditure, the cost of restructuring forward contracts, and material profit or losses on disposals. 
Segmental reporting 
An operating segment is a component of the Group engaged in exploration or production activity that is regularly reviewed by the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) for the purposes of making economic decisions. The CODM is considered to be the Board 
of Directors and Executive Committee. The Group’s operating segments are geographic by location of the Group’s assets, as this is 
how they are reviewed for performance and resource allocation. The Group’s current geographical segments are UK and West Africa. 
Malaysia and Indonesia have been represented as discontinued operations since 31 December 2010. The Group does not report 
geographic segments by location of customer as its business is the production of gold which is traded as a commodity on a 
worldwide basis.

Foreign currency translation
1. Functional and presentational currency
The functional currency of the entities within the Group is the US dollar, as the currency which most affects each company’s revenue, 
costs and financing. The Group’s reporting currency is also the US dollar.
2. Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at reporting 
period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement. 
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are charged/credited to other 
comprehensive income and recognised within other reserves in equity.
Revenue
Revenue is the fair value of the amount receivable by the Group for goods supplied. Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of 
ownership pass to the purchaser, which occurs when confirmation of the sale is received from the purchaser. VAT and similar local taxes 
and trade discounts are excluded.
Goodwill and deferred consideration
Goodwill is the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities 
acquired. Goodwill arising is capitalised and is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances 
indicated that the asset may have been impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill is allocated to cash generating units. 
Intangible assets
All costs associated with mineral exploration including those incurred through joint venture projects are capitalised within non-current 
intangible assets pending determination of the project’s feasibility. If an exploration project is deemed to be economically viable based on 
feasibility studies, the related expenditures are transferred to property, plant and equipment and amortised over the life of the mine on a 
unit of production basis. Where a project is abandoned or is considered to be no longer economically viable, the related costs are 
written off.
Property, plant and equipment
Mining and milling plant and equipment, consisting of buildings, machinery, vehicles and fixtures and fittings, are depreciated over the 
shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the life of the mine. Mining property for mines in production, including closure costs, are 
depreciated on a unit of production basis over the life of the mine. Residual values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and 
changes are accounted for over the remaining lives.
Treasury shares
Treasury shares are held at cost, and are deducted from equity. Any gain or loss on the sale or transfer of treasury shares is recognised in 
the statement of changes in equity. 
Own shares 
Own shares are held in the EBT and SIP, and are recorded at cost, and deducted from equity. Any gain or loss on the sale or transfer of 
these shares is recognised in the statement of changes in equity.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
The Group carries out a review at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication that the above assets are 
impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated based on future cash flows, in order to determine 
the extent of impairment. Future cashflows are based on estimates of the life of mine reserves together with estimates of future gold 
prices and cash costs. Goodwill is assessed on the basis of separate cash generating units. Goodwill and deferred exploration costs are 
tested for impairment at least annually.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. An impairment is recognised immediately as an 
expense. Where there is a reversal of the conditions leading to an impairment, the impairment is reversed as income through the income 
statement. Impairments relating to goodwill are never reversed.
Inventories
Inventories comprise consumables, work in progress and finished goods. Consumables are valued at average cost. Consumables and 
finished goods are held at the lower of cost less a provision for obsolescence, and net realisable value. Work in progress consists of ore 
in stockpiles that is valued at the lower of average production cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price less any applicable selling expenses. Avocet Mining PLC

Financial assets
Financial assets are classified into the following specific categories which determine the basis of their carrying value in the statement of 
financial position and how changes in their fair value are accounted for: at fair value through profit and loss, available for sale financial 
assets, and loans and receivables. Financial assets are assigned to their different categories by management on initial recognition, 
depending on the purpose for which the investment was acquired. The designation of financial assets is re-evaluated at every reporting 
date at which a choice of classification or accounting treatment is available.
Available for sale financial assets are included within non-current assets unless designated as held for sale in which case they are 
included within current assets. They are carried at fair value at inception and changes to the fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income; when sold the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified 
through the income statement.
Trade and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rates. 
Derecognition of financial instruments occurs when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire or are transferred 
and substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. An assessment for impairment is undertaken at least 
annually at each balance sheet date whether or not there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets 
is impaired.
Interest and other cash flows resulting from holding financial assets are recognised in profit and loss when received, regardless of how 
the related carrying amount of financial assets is measured.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand, demand deposits and short term highly liquid investments and are measured at 
cost which is deemed to be fair value as they have short term maturities.
Leases
Finance leases are recognised as those leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Assets held under 
finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in liabilities at the fair value of the lease, or if lower at 
the present value of the lease payments. They are depreciated over the term of the lease or their useful economic lives, whichever is the 
shorter. The interest element (finance charge) of lease payments is charged to the income statement on a constant basis over the period 
of the lease. 
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement in the period 
on a straight line basis. The Company does not act as a lessor.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities include bank loans and overdrafts and trade and other payables. In the statement of financial position these items are 
included within Non-Current liabilities and Current liabilities. Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual agreements giving rise to the liability. Interest related charges are recognised as an expense in Finance costs in the income 
statement unless they meet the criteria of being attributable to the funding of construction of a qualifying asset, in which case the finance 
costs are capitalised. 
Trade and other payables and loans are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised costs using the 
effective interest rate, less settlement payments.
At 30 June 2011, the Company had sold forward 299,401 ounces of gold. During July 2011, the Company bought back 58,432 ounces 
which reduced the hedged proportion of Inata’s production. The remaining forward sales are deemed to be outside the scope of IAS 39 
on the basis that they are for own use, and gold produced will be delivered into these contracts in future periods. Further information is 
provided in note 2. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs that are incurred in respect of the construction of a qualifying asset are capitalised where the construction of an asset 
takes a substantial period of time to be prepared for use. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
and reported in finance costs.

Income taxes
Current income tax liabilities comprise those obligations to fiscal authorities in the countries in which the Group carries out mining 
operations and where it generates its profits. They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the financial period 
and the country to which they relate. All changes to current tax assets and liabilities are recognised as a component of the tax charge in 
the income statement. 
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. This involves the comparison of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with their respective tax bases. However, deferred tax is not 
provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a 
business combination or affects taxes or accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided for in full; deferred tax assets are recognised when there is sufficient probability of utilisation. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Pension obligations
The only defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Group relates to a former US subsidiary undertaking which is no longer part of 
the Group. Accordingly full provision has been made for outstanding post retirement benefits. The liability recognised in the statement of 
financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, 
together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The DBO is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method or an accepted equivalent in the USA, and independent assumptions. The 
present value of the DBO is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of 
the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are not recognised as an expense unless they exceed 10% of the obligation. The amount exceeding this 10% 
corridor is charged or credited to the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses within 10% of the obligation are disclosed separately.
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Other provisions are recognised when the present obligations arising from legal or constructive commitment, resulting from past events, 
will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources from the Group which can be estimated reliably. Provisions are measured at the 
present value of the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence available at the 
balance sheet date. All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the 
development or ongoing production of a mining property. Such costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other site 
preparation work, discounted to their net present values, are provided for in full as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises and 
can be quantified. On recognition of a full provision, an addition is made to property, plant and equipment of the same amount; this 
addition is then charged against profits on a unit of production basis over the life of the mine. Closure provisions are updated annually for 
changes in cost estimates as well as for changes to life of mine reserves, with the resulting adjustments made to both the provision 
balance and the net book value of the associated non-current asset.
Share based payments
The Group operates equity-settled share based compensation plans for remuneration of its employees, which may be settled in cash 
under certain circumstances.
All employee services received in exchange for the grant of any share based compensation are measured at their fair values. These are 
indirectly determined by reference to the share based award. Their value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of any 
non-market vesting conditions.
All share based compensation is ultimately recognised as an expense in profit and loss with a corresponding credit to retained earnings, 
net of deferred tax where applicable. Where share based compensation is to be cash settled, such as certain share based bonus 
awards, the corresponding credit is made to accruals or cash. 
If any equity-settled share based awards are ultimately settled in cash, then the amount of payment equal to the fair value of the equity 
instruments that would otherwise have been issued is accounted for as a repurchase of an equity interest and is deducted from equity. 
Any excess over this amount is recognised as an expense. Avocet Mining PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
72
3. accountin G policies CONTINUED
If vesting periods or other vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate 
of the number of share options expected to vest. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of share 
options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. No adjustment to the expense recognised in prior periods is made if fewer share 
options are ultimately exercised than originally estimated.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, up to the nominal value of the 
shares issued, are reallocated to share capital with any excess being recorded in share premium.
Non-current assets and liabilities classified as held for sale and discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and represents a 
separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major 
line of business or geographical area of operations; or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
The results from discontinued operations, including re-classification of prior year results, are presented separately in the 
income statement. 
The disclosures for discontinued operations in the prior year relate to all operations that have been discontinued by the reporting date for 
the latest period presented.
When the Group intends to sell a non-current asset or a group of assets (a disposal group), and if sale within 12 months is judged to be 
highly probable, the assets of the disposal group are classified as held for sale and presented separately in the statement of financial 
position. Liabilities are classified as held for sale and presented as such in the statement of financial position if they are directly associated 
with a disposal group.
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amounts immediately prior to their classification as held for 
sale and their fair value less costs to sell. However, some held for sale assets such as financial assets or deferred tax assets, continue to 
be measured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for those assets. No assets classified as held for sale are subject to 
depreciation or amortisation subsequent to their classification as held for sale.

Disposal of discontinued operations to J&Partners L.P.
On 24 June 2011, Avocet completed the sale of its main South East Asian assets, namely its 100% interest in the Penjom gold mine in 
Malaysia and its 80% interest in PT Avocet Bolaang Mongondow (PT ABM), which owns the North Lanut mine and Bakan project in North 
Sulawesi, Indonesia, for proceeds of US$170 million. In the third quarter of 2011, Avocet announced that further sales had been 
concluded, namely PT Avocet Mining Services, Avocet Mining (Malaysia) OHQ Sdn. Bhd, its 75% interest in PT Gorontalo Sejahtera 
Mining, and its 60% in interest in PT Arafura Surya Alam. The combined gross proceeds for the disposals completed in the third quarter 
of 2011 were US$27 million. All of the sales completed in 2011 were originally announced on 24 December 2010.
In accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, all of the assets and liabilities of the 
Indonesian and Malaysian operations, apart from cash, were treated as a disposal group from the date of the announcement of the sale 
on 24 December 2010, and were disclosed separately in the statement of financial position at 31 December 2010 and 31 March 2011, 
and the remaining entities at 30 June 2011 and 30 September 2011. As the transaction was on a cash free debt free basis, the cash held 
by entities held for sale was classified as continuing operations rather than discontinued operations. Prior to the reclassification, 
management reviewed the carrying values and recognition of assets and liabilities respectively, and no adjustments were required to 
measure assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Since 24 December 2010, the date on which the 
criteria for being held for sale were met, no depreciation has been charged in the Group financial statements for the Malaysian and 
Indonesian assets, in accordance with IFRS.
The results of the disposal group are presented separately in the consolidated income statement and the segmental analysis, and 
comparative income statements are represented on this basis, as required by IFRS.
The profit on disposal of the entities sold during 2011 is presented below in note 5a.  
Completion of one of the last two exploration assets occurred on 16 February 2012 for proceeds of US$2 million. Completion of the final 
exploration asset remains subject to local approvals. It is expected that completion of this disposal, along with the finalisation of working 
capital adjustments in respect of those entities already disposed of, will take place in Q1 or Q2 2012.
Disposal of discontinued operations to Golden Peaks Resources Limited 
During the period, Avocet completed the sale of PT Arafura Mandiri Semangat (‘PT Arafura’) and PT Aura Celebes Mandiri (‘PT ACM’) to 
Reliance Resources Limited, a company owned by Golden Peaks Resources Limited (‘Golden Peaks’). Consideration was in the form of 
7.9 million Golden Peaks shares. Golden Peaks is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. PT Arafura and PT ACM held non-core 
exploration projects in Indonesia. The carrying value of the assets was included in the balances of the disposal group held for sale at  
31 December 2010. Further details of the profit on disposal are included in note 5d.

at that date, which are subject to review and finalisation as part of the completion accounts, are expected to be US$17.3 million,

The share based payment expense is in relation to share options and share based bonuses for key management personnel. Included in

to 2010. The share based bonuses reflect awards made in accordance with the Company’s share bonus plan. The awards arose as a 
result of the Company’s share price appreciation, relative to the FTSE Gold Mines Index, over two periods: 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 
and 1 April 2010 to December 2010. Owing to the Company’s change in year end, awards for both of these periods fell into the income 
statement of 2010, while the nine months ended 31 December 2009 did not include an annual remuneration period end, and no awards 
were made during this period.

During the year, Avocet disposed its entire holding of shares in Avion Gold Corp (‘Avion’) for cash consideration of US$16.5 million. The 
Avion shares were acquired as consideration for the disposal of the Houndé group of licences in 2010. The shares were recorded in the 
statement of financial position at fair value, with movements in fair value recognised in equity, in accordance with IAS 39. On the disposal 
of the shares, accumulated gains previously recognised in equity were transferred to the income statement and recognised in the profit 
on disposal.
Avocet disposed of all of the shares it held in Dynasty Gold Corp in June 2010, and completed the disposal of all of the shares it held in 
Monument Mining in November 2010. These financial assets had been accounted for as available for sale investments in accordance with 
IAS 39, and were recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value, with movements in fair value recognised in equity. On 
disposal of the shares, accumulated losses previously recognised in equity were transferred to the income statement and recognised in 
the loss on disposal.
Disposal of non-core exploration licences or entities
Avocet completed the sale of PT Arafura and PT ACM to Reliance Resources Limited, a company owned by Golden Peaks Resources 
Limited (‘Golden Peaks’). Consideration was in the form of 7.9 million shares in Golden Peaks, a company listed on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange, and US$0.2 million in cash. The shares are recognised at fair value. PT Arafura and PT ACM held non-core exploration 
projects in Indonesia, and the carrying value of the intangible assets were included in the balances of the disposal group held for sale at 
31 December 2010. Further details are provided in note 5d. Avocet Mining PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2011

In the comparative period Avocet completed the disposal of Houndé group of licences in exchange for 10,300,000 shares in Avion Gold 
Corporation (Avion). An exceptional gain on disposal of US$5.1 million was realised. The shares in Avion were held as an available for sale 
asset until their disposal in 2011. 
Profit on disposal of subsidiaries
Profit on disposal of subsidiaries relates to the profit on disposal of the majority of Avocet’s South East Asian assets. Further details of the 
profit on disposal are included in note 5a. 
Restructure of hedge
On 27 July 2011, Avocet announced the restructure of the forward contracts for delivery of gold bullion (‘the hedge’). The restructure 
consisted of eliminating 58,432 ounces under the forward contracts at a cost of US$39.8 million and extending the delivery profile of the 
remaining ounces by four years to June 2018. Further details are provided in note 25.
Disposal of Merit Mining Corporation and profit on redemption of debenture
On 13 November 2009, Avocet announced that it had entered into a conditional agreement with Infinity Gold Mining Inc. (‘Infinity’) to sell 
its entire interest in Merit Mining Corporation (‘Merit’), a non-core subsidiary acquired as part of the Wega Mining takeover. Although the 
agreement represented a binding commitment by Infinity to acquire 100% of Avocet’s interest, completion of the transaction was 
conditional on a number of future events and payments, which did not occur. At 31 December 2009, approximately US$1.0 million had 
been received, which was non-refundable in the event that the sale was not completed. Following the fair value review of all Wega Mining 
assets, the book value of these assets at acquisition had been adjusted to US$1.0 million, and the disposal therefore gave rise to no profit 
or loss. 
During 2010, the agreement with Infinity lapsed due to completion conditions being unfulfilled. In November 2010, Avocet completed the 
disposal of its entire interest in Merit, to a different party, realising an exceptional gain on disposal of US$1.8 million. 
During 2010 Merit repaid a debenture to Wega Mining AS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Avocet. At the time of the acquisition of the Wega 
group it was not considered likely that Merit would have the resources to settle the debenture. Following the investment of approximately 
C$16 million in Merit by Hong Kong Huakan Investment Co Ltd, the repayment was possible, and the gain of US$3.1 million has therefore 
been classified as exceptional. 
Expenses of listing on the London Stock Exchange
In view of the Company’s strategic developments, the Board took the decision to seek admission to trade on the London Stock Exchange 
Main Market, as the best platform to support the Company’s growth. This admission was duly granted and trading on the London Stock 
Exchange commenced on 8 December 2011. As a non-recurring and significant item, the cost of this listing has been disclosed as 
exceptional.
Expenses of listing on Oslo Børs
On 16 June 2010 Avocet announced its successful listing on Oslo Børs. Costs of the listing were treated as exceptional costs in the 
period, within finance items as the listing was accompanied by a small equity raise. These included US$1.8 million of Stamp Duty Reserve 
Tax costs following the transfer of existing Avocet shareholders from the UK registration system to the Norwegian VPS share registration 
system.

The goodwill related to the disposal group held for sale (note 5) and therefore the carrying value at 31 December 2010 was included in the

All costs and revenues at Inata between 1 January and 31 March 2010 related to the testing and development phase, prior to the 
commencement of commercial operations. Therefore, these costs and revenues were capitalised as part of mining property, plant and 
equipment. From 1 April 2010, all revenues and operating expenses in respect of mining operations at Inata have been recognised in the 
income statement. 
The transfer to disposal group assets held for sale represented the net book value of the assets which were subject to the agreement for 
sale of all of Avocet’s South East Asian assets (note 5). The net book values for Malaysia and Indonesia, totalling US$62.0 million at 
31 December 2010, were included in the balance of the disposal group held for sale at 31 December 2010, and were subsequently 
disposed of during 2011. 
The addition in respect of closure provisions reflects increases during the year of anticipated closure liabilities at the Group’s operations. 
On the recognition or increase of a provision, an addition is made to property, plant and equipment of the same amount. The cost of this 
addition is charged against profits on a unit of production basis over the life of the mine. The total charge to the income statement for 
continuing operations for the year ended 31 December 2011 in respect of mine closure provisions is US$0.4 million (2010: US$0.3 million 
for continuing operations) which is included in the Group’s depreciation charge. Avocet Mining PLC

Additions during the year relate to shares in Golden Peaks Resources Limited, a company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The 
shares were acquired as consideration for the disposal of two of the Group’s assets in South East Asia. Further details are provided in 
notes 5d and 10.
Other financial assets disposed of during the year represented the Company’s interest in Avion Gold Corporation (note 10). 10,300,000 
Avion shares were acquired in the prior year as consideration for the disposal of the Houndé group of licences (note 10). This 
shareholding did not enable Avocet to exercise significant influence over the activities of Avion. Therefore, the shares were accounted for 
as an available for sale financial asset and were measured at fair value, with gains or losses on re-measurement recognised in equity.
Other financial assets disposed of during the prior year represented the Company’s interests of 19% in Dynasty Gold Corporation and 
15% in Monument Mining Limited, both companies listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada. These investments were accounted 
for as other financial assets rather than equity accounted as associates, on the basis that the Company was not in a position to exercise 
significant influence over the activities of, and had no Board representation in, either company. 
On disposal, accumulated losses previously recognised in equity were recognised in the income statement as an exceptional loss 
(note 10).

At 31 December 2011 the Group had deferred tax liabilities of US$14.6 million in relation to continuing operations. This liability relates to 
temporary differences on Inata mine development costs and property, plant, and equipment.
In 2010 deferred tax liabilities of US$4.1 million in relation to temporary differences on property, plant and equipment at Penjom were 
transferred to liabilities of the disposal group held for sale. 
The movement in equity in 2010 related to deferred tax previously recognised in equity on the revaluation to fair value of investments held 
in Monument Mining and Dynasty Gold Corp (note 10). The investments were sold during 2010 and all historic revaluations, and deferred 
tax thereon, were reversed through equity and recognised in the income statement.

Inata project finance facility
The Company acquired, through its takeover of Wega Mining in 2009, a US$65 million project finance facility with Macquarie Bank 
Limited. Interest on the loan is calculated at market rates (LIBOR) plus a margin. The weighted average interest on the loan during the 
year was 5.4% (31 December 2010: 5.8%). Interest costs incurred during the period of construction of the Inata Gold Mine were 
capitalised as a construction cost. A total of US$1.5 million was capitalised in 2010. From 1 April 2010, when commercial mining 
operations commenced, no further interest costs were capitalised. 
US$24 million (31 December 2010: US$12 million) of repayments were made during the year under the terms of the facility agreement. 
US$24 million is due during 2012, and this amount is presented within current liabilities, with the remainder due during 2013.
The facility is secured primarily on the Inata Gold Mine and various assets within the Wega Mining group of companies. There is no cross 
guarantee to the parent, nor to other Avocet companies. 
Corporate revolving facility
In September 2009, the Company entered into a US$25 million corporate revolving facility with Standard Chartered Bank. The 
US$25 million drawn under the facility was repaid on 24 June 2011 following the substantial completion of the sale of the Company’s 
South East Asian assets. The facility was secured on the Penjom assets. 
Interest on the loan was calculated at cost of funds plus a margin. The weighted average interest on the loan during the period was 5.1% 
(2010: 4.9%).
Finance lease liability 
In 2009, an agreement was entered by an Avocet subsidiary with Total Burkina SA for the provision of fuel and lubricants to the Inata Gold 
Mine. Included in this agreement were terms relating to the construction of a fuel storage facility located on the Inata site. The 
construction and commissioning of the facility was completed during 2011. The cost of the construction work would initially be borne by

Total Burkina SA, and then recovered from Inata over the subsequent seven years. Management has assessed that the terms of this part 
of the agreement represent a finance lease under IAS 17 and therefore have recognised the liability on the balance sheet and capitalised 
the cost of the fuel storage facility in Property, Plant and Equipment.

Mine closure provisions represent management’s best estimate of the cost of mine closure at its operation in Burkina Faso. It is estimated 
that approximately 30% of the restoration costs in respect of Inata will be incurred throughout the operating life of the mine, and 
approximately 70% from 2024 onwards. In accordance with the Group accounting policy, the amounts and timing of cash flows are 
reviewed annually and reflect any changes to life of mine plans. 
The provision for post retirement benefits represents the Directors’ best estimate of costs following the closure of a US subsidiary no 
longer owned by the Group. The above amount represents a full provision for the liability, based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 
1 January 2012. The main assumptions used by the actuary were as follows:

Gain/(loss) on disposal of financial assets through income statement 8,990 (7,341)
Gold produced from the Inata Gold Mine during the year was sold both at spot and into the Company’s hedge book. A total of 164,026 
ounces of gold were sold, of which 88,157 ounces were sold at spot (at an average realised price of US$1,590 per ounce), while 75,869 
ounces were delivered to meet forward contracts (at an average realised price of US$965 per ounce). 
Had spot prices been 10% lower in the period, profit would have decreased by US$13.0 million (31 December 2010: US$9.7 million); had 
prices been 10% higher, profit would have increased by US$13.0 million (31 December 2010: US$9.7 million).
Following the substantial completion of the disposal of Avocet’s South East Asian assets on 24 June 2011, the Group announced the 
restructuring and partial buy back of the forward contracts on 27 July 2011, with the result that the hedged proportion of production from 
its one remaining producing mine, Inata, was reduced from approximately 60% to approximately 20%. The restructure consisted of 
eliminating 58,432 ounces under the forward contracts at a cost of US$39.8 million and extending the delivery profile of the remaining 
ounces by four years to June 2018. At 31 December 2011 214,500 ounces remained, with physical deliveries contracted at 8,250 ounces 
per quarter until June 2018, at a forward price of US$950 per ounce. The first physical deliveries under the restructured hedge took place 
in July 2011.
At 31 December 2011 these forward contracts represented a mark–to–market liability of US$141.4 million based on a gold price of 
US$1,575 per ounce at that date. However, the forward contracts are considered to be outside of the scope of IAS 39, on the basis that 
they are for own use and gold produced will continue to be physically delivered to meet the contractual requirement in future periods, and 
therefore no value is reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the remaining contracts, as allowed by the exemption conferred 
by IAS 39.5. The restructuring of the contracts, as a response to the significant change in the Group’s production profile following the 
disposal of the Penjom and North Lanut mines, has not changed the nature or purpose of the contracts, which continue to be held for 
own use, nor does it represent a practice of net settlement.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. In order to 
minimise this risk the Group endeavours only to deal with companies which are demonstrably creditworthy and this, together with the 
aggregate financial exposure, is continuously monitored. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the value of the outstanding amounts 
as follows:

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is considered to be small as the counterparties are all substantial banks with high credit ratings. 
The maximum exposure is the amount of the deposit.
Liquidity risk
The Group constantly monitors the cash outflows from day to day business and monitors longer term liabilities to ensure that liquidity is 
maintained. At the balance sheet date the Group’s financial liabilities were as follows:

Interest rate risk arises from the Group’s long term variable rate borrowings which expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. This 
risk is partially offset by cash held at variable rates. 
An increase in interest rates of 100 basis points in the period would have resulted in additional interest costs of US$0.6 million in the year 
(31 December 2010: US$0.8 million).

The Group may be exposed to transaction foreign exchange risk due to its transactions not being matched in the same currency. The 
Group currently has no currency hedging in place.
In Burkina Faso, local currency payments account for approximately 55% of total payments. The Burkina Faso CFA, which has a fixed 
exchange rate to the Euro, weakened by 5% against the US dollar in the year. It is estimated that without the weakening CFA profit would 
have been US$3.5 million lower. 
There is no material difference between the fair values and the book values of these financial instruments.
Measurement of fair value
The Company measures the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position in accordance with the fair 
value hierarchy. This hierarchy groups financial assets and liabilities into three levels based on the significance of inputs used in measuring 
the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or 
indirectly (ie derived from prices); and
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Available for sale financial assets were valued in line with Level 1, based on quoted market prices of the shares.

The Group’s capital management objectives are to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide an adequate 
return to shareholders. 
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the debt: equity ratio, based on external debt divided by total equity, and on its ability to 
service its debt. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and 
the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares, 
adjust dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, or seek additional debt finance.
The Group has complied with debt covenants in respect of maintaining certain debt to equity ratios.

Exercise prices are determined using the closing share price on the day prior to the option grant.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous five years. The 
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non–transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of US$1.9 million related to share based payment transactions during the year (US$8.6 million in 
the year ended 31 December 2010). Of the US$8.6 million recognised in 2010, US$1.5 million was cash settled.

shares is included within transaction cost of disposal, as presented in note 5c, being the purchase price of £2.37 per share, as noted 
above. At 31 December 2011, the Company held 652,964 Treasury shares.
The acquisition reserve arose on an acquisition from the issuing of 14,000,000 ordinary shares of the Company on 12 November 2002 at 
the market price of 16p per share compared with the previous nominal value of 25p. The reserve was created following independent legal 
advice. The reserve was transferred to retained earnings in June 2011.
31. c ontin Gent liabilities
There were no contingent liabilities at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010.
In April 2011, Avocet was informed that a law suit had been filed against it in the District Court of Jakarta, Indonesia by PT Lebong Tandai 
(‘PT LT’), Avocet’s former partner in a joint venture in Indonesia. The law suit relates to a challenge as to the legality of the sale of Avocet’s 
South East Asian assets. PT LT asserts that it is entitled to acquire all of these assets pursuant to an agreement allegedly entered into 
between PT LT and Avocet in April 2010. In its law suit, PT LT has claimed damages totalling US$1.95 billion, comprising US$450 million 
loss in respect of an alleged on-sale by PT LT of part of the assets, US$500 million loss in respect of financing arrangements allegedly 
entered into by PT LT, and US$1 billion for loss of reputation. In November 2011, Avocet challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court to 
hear the law suit on the basis that PT LT and Avocet were obligated under the terms of their joint venture to settle any dispute through 
arbitration. In addition, Avocet challenged the court’s jurisdiction on the grounds that Avocet is not subject to the Indonesian courts as it 
has no presence in Indonesia. The District Court subsequently found in Avocet’s favour and dismissed the case. PT LT has since lodged 
an appeal to the Indonesian High Court against the District Court’s decision. Despite the appeal by PT LT, which may take several 
months, the Board of Avocet is encouraged that the District Court has ruled in Avocet’s favour in the first instance. The Board also 
remains confident that all the actions taken in respect of the transaction have been in accordance with prevailing rules and regulations 
and there are no grounds for any such legal action.
As any financial settlement is considered to be remote, this matter does not constitute a contingent liability, however the matter is 
disclosed in these financial statements to replicate statements already made by the Company.

Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Company an obligation to pay more tax 
in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency
The Company’s financial statements have been reported in US dollars as the dollar is considered to be the Company’s functional 
currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
38. pRioR yea R aDJustment on aDoption oF FR s 26
Previously, as a company listed on AIM, the Company was not required to adopt FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement (FRS 26). As a result of the Company listing on the Main Board of the London Stock Exchange, the adoption of FRS 26 is 
now required, with retrospective application. The adoption of FRS 26 has resulted in an adjustment to the prior year financial statements 
to reflect the measurement of investments in available for sale financial assets at fair value, with re-measurement to fair value being 
recognised in equity. Previously, such investments were recognised at cost less any provision for impairment. The effect of the prior year 
adjustment is to reduce opening shareholders’ funds at 1 January 2010 by US$1.9 million. There is no change to shareholders’ funds 
previously reported at 31 December 2010 as the investments were disposed during 2010. Note 53 of these financial statements presents 
the financial effect of the change in accounting policy. The Company accounting policy is now in line with the Group policy for Financial 
Instruments under IAS 39, as disclosed in the Group financial statements.

As explained in note 38, the accounting policy for investments in other financials assets has been changed as a result of the Company’s 
listing on the London Stock Exchange. The change in accounting policy has required a prior year adjustment to restate the opening 
balance at 1 January 2010, the details of which are explained in note 38.
Additions in the year relate to the receipt of 7.9 million Golden Peak shares in consideration for the sale of two Indonesian subsidiaries,  
PT Arafura Mandiri Semangat (‘PT Arafura’) and PT Aura Celebes Mandiri (‘PT ACM’) to Reliance Resources Limited, a company owned 
by Golden Peaks Resources Limited (‘Golden Peaks’). Golden Peaks is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The investment has been 
classified as available for sale and is therefore measured at fair value, with movements in fair value being recognised in equity.
Other financial assets disposed of during the prior year represented the Company’s interests of 19% in Dynasty Gold Corporation and 
15% in Monument Mining Limited, both companies listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada. These investments were accounted 
for as other financial assets rather than equity accounted as associates, on the basis that the Company was not in a position to exercise 
significant influence over the activities of, and had no Board representation in, either company.

In April 2011, Avocet was informed that a law suit had been filed against it in the District Court of Jakarta, Indonesia by PT Lebong Tandai 
(‘PT LT’), Avocet’s former partner in a joint venture in Indonesia. The law suit relates to a challenge as to the legality of the sale of Avocet’s 
South East Asian assets. PT LT asserts that it is entitled to acquire all of these assets pursuant to an agreement allegedly entered into 
Notes to the c ompany financial statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2011 Avocet Mining PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
105
between PT LT and Avocet in April 2010. In its law suit, PT LT has claimed damages totalling US$1.95 billion, comprising US$450 million 
loss in respect of an alleged on-sale by PT LT of part of the assets, US$500 million loss in respect of financing arrangements allegedly 
entered into by PT LT, and US$1 billion for loss of reputation. In November 2011, Avocet challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court to 
hear the law suit on the basis that PT LT and Avocet were obligated under the terms of their joint venture to settle any dispute through 
arbitration. In addition, Avocet challenged the court’s jurisdiction on the grounds that Avocet is not subject to the Indonesian courts as it 
has no presence in Indonesia. The District Court subsequently found in Avocet’s favour and dismissed the case. PT LT has since lodged 
an appeal to the Indonesian High Court against the District Court’s decision. Despite the appeal by PT LT, which may take several 
months, the Board of Avocet is encouraged that the District Court has ruled in Avocet’s favour in the first instance. The Board also 
remains confident that all the actions taken in respect of the transaction have been in accordance with prevailing rules and regulations 
and there are no grounds for any such legal action.
As any financial settlement is considered to be remote, this matter does not constitute a contingent liability, however the matter is 
disclosed in these financial statements to replicate statements already made by the Company.

waRnin G to sha Rehol DeR – boile R Room scams
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders or potential shareholders have received unsolicited phone 
calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders, 
offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. These operations are commonly 
known as ‘boiler rooms’. These ‘brokers’ can be very persistent and extremely persuasive, and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services 
Authority (FSA) has reported that the average amount lost by investors is around £20,000.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. If 
you receive any unsolicited investment advice, FSA advice for UK investors is to check that the brokers are properly authorised by the 
FSA before proceeding by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/register/ and contacting the firm using the details on the register. To report the matter 
to the FSA, call +44 845 606 1234 or visit www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/consumerinformation. Avocet Mining PLC

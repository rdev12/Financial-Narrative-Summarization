CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The programme of actions
introduced by the executives
continues to produce
improvements in performance. 
In addition to cash generation 
the focus has been on improving
labour efficiency , raw material
usage, distribution and asset
utilisation resulting in net debt
being reduced by nearly 50%. 
Further initiatives are currently
being introduced to maintain
momentum.
Lord Sheppard
Chairman
Key Strategic Strengths
The Group has continued to build on the excellent progress achieved 
since 2001 delivering further sales and profit growth. This is especially
pleasing in a year when the industry has experienced more than its usual
competitive pressures. 
Our commitment to innovative solutions across all facets of the business 
has again ensured success. The strength of our business emanates from the
consistency and relevance of our strategy: focus on Private Label household
and personal care, innovate, support and develop with our major customers,
emphasis on customer service and maintaining industry-leading management
skills and experience. All elements of the strategy have contributed to this
year’ s strong performance.
Continuing Improvement in Performance
The programme of actions introduced by the executives continues to
produce improvements in performance. In addition to cash generation 
the focus has been on improving labour efficiency , raw material usage,
distribution and asset utilisation resulting in net debt being reduced by 
nearly 50%. 
Further initiatives are currently being introduced to maintain momentum. 
Dividend Policy
The Group is committed to making progressive, sustainable increases to 
the dividend paid to shareholders, taking account of the medium-term
requirements of the business. In view of the very strong performance 
during the year , the low level of debt and our confidence in the future, 
we are recommending a final dividend of 2.8 pence per share to be paid 
on 26 November 2004. The total dividend will be 4.0 pence per share, 
in line with the pre close announcement, a 38% increase over last year .

Innovation in product development
We use our technological, manufacturing and marketing
expertise to react rapidly to new marketplace developments
and provide retailers with Private Label alternatives that 
cost-effectively match the performance of globally branded
products. This helps them strengthen consumer trust in their
brands to grow share, margins and loyalty in emerging and
mature markets across Europe. The last year has seen many
such innovations in many countries, sharing expertise across
the Group for mutual gain.
Share Repurchase
In addition to the increased dividend, the Board is seeking approval from
Shareholders to purchase up to 10% of the share capital of the Company .
Board
The company has undertaken a thorough review of all aspects of Corporate
Governance including the recent changes to the UK Combined Code. 
The membership of the Board and Board Committees, together with their
terms of reference have been comprehensively reviewed and updated 
where necessary . The contractual notice period for all executive directors 
has been amended to one year . All non-executives will be subject to annual
re-election by shareholders at the AGM. The executive directors will be
subject to re-election at two yearly intervals.
Aerosol Products Limited (APL)
The aerosol joint venture, based at Hull, once again has improved its
performance.
Last year , we reported that customer confidence was at higher levels, and
new business gained. This momentum continued during the year , resulting 
in further sales and profit growth for the joint venture. Since the year-end, 
as a result of this improved performance, McBride has purchased all the
equity interests of our joint venture partners. This investment is expected 
to be earnings enhancing in the current year .
Customer Relations
Being a supplier of Private Label means that we are directly affected by the
economic and competitive forces experienced by retailers. We are only able
to succeed by being more responsive to and, when necessary , proactive
with, our retail customers than other suppliers. We use our technical,
manufacturing and marketing expertise to react rapidly to new marketplace
developments and provide retailers with Private Label alternatives that cost
effectively match the performance of globally branded products. This helps
our retail customers strengthen consumer trust in their brands to grow share,
margins and loyalty in emerging and mature markets across Europe. The last
year has seen many such innovations in many countries, sharing expertise
across the Group for mutual gain.
Workforce
The current trading environment means that the business has to ensure that
it operates at the lowest cost of supply consistent with effective competitive
performance. A number of difficult decisions had to be taken by the business
during the year to maintain our competitive edge.
It is therefore with pride and gratitude that I give recognition to the
outstanding commitment of our staff during the year for their contribution
towards a third year of excellent results.
Current T rading
These results again demonstrate the continuing strength of McBride. Whilst
market conditions remain competitive, sales gains in Continental Europe 
and continuing operational improvements across the Group have further
improved profitability . Cash flow is strong and a substantial reduction in debt
has again been achieved. Since the year-end trading has been satisfactory .

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Capitalising on market
opportunities.
Developing new channels such 
as the convenience sector , growing
margins with value-added ranges
and converting niche products to
mass-market status are all factors
that ensure our continued market
leadership in the UK. In Continental
Europe, we are gaining strongly
from the retailer concentration and
growth in the discount sector that
are driving Private Label forward 
in many countries, with significant
scope for further penetration. 
In Central and Eastern Europe we
are excellently positioned to help
retailers reach the 75 million new
consumers of the combined EU
accession and candidate nations. 
SALES TO EUROPE AND THE REST 
OF THE WORLD ACCOUNTED FOR 58% 
OF McBRIDE’S TURNOVER
58% 
Mike Handley
Chief Executive
It is pleasing to report another year of growth in sales, profits and cash
generation, which has enabled us to reduce the Group’ s net debt by 
almost 50% to £31.4 million.
The focus on exploiting the growth of Private Label in the recently 
enlarged EU market, maintaining our Private Label leadership in the UK, 
and improving our operational cost base have all contributed to this 
excellent performance.
These results are especially impressive against the background of intense
retail competition and price focus in all markets, whether in Continental
Europe’ s reaction to Hard Discount growth or in the UK market’ s reaction 
to the Morrison take-over of Safeway . 
By achieving our objectives of improving shareholder value through profit
growth and reduced external debt, the financial robustness of the Group 
has been reinforced.
Sales
Overall sales for the Group were £501.3 million compared with 
£486.8 million for the previous period which have been restated in line 
with FRS 5 – Application Note G. Sales growth of 3.0% was driven by 
our Continental European business, which reported local sales of over 
a400 million for the first time.
The strong performance of our Continental European business now means
that sales outside the UK account for 58% of Group turnover . This growth
was underpinned once again by a good performance in France assisted by
strong growth from our Italian business.
McBride is also expanding its sales in both the Nordic countries and 
the large German Private Label market, where it has a sales office. It is 
also pleasing that the investments made in our manufacturing facility in
Poland since it was acquired in 1998, combined with our existing facilities
throughout the Group, have improved McBride’ s ability to compete
effectively in terms of quality and price into these markets, and the 
accession countries of Central Europe. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 09
RECORD SALES OUTSIDE 
THE UK
£290.8 
MILLION
UK sales by destination at £210.5 million were broadly in line with last year’ s
£212.1 million reflecting real volume growth offset by selling price deflation.
Further analysis of sales compared with last year is given in the Finance
Director’ s Report.
Profit 
At £35.1 million, the Group’ s operating profit before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items was up 12.9%. The Group’ s continuing focus on
variable and fixed costs led to improved operational effectiveness and asset
utilisation enabling McBride to counteract adverse pressures on selling prices.
The record sales of our European business also underpinned its operating
profit to £16.5 million (excluding £3.3 million exceptional item) from 
£12.9 million last year an increase of 27.9%. 
Cash
One of the most significant achievements of the Group’ s performance since
December 2000 has been cash generation and the dramatic lowering of net
debt. This has been achieved by focus on cash management and teamwork
throughout the business. Interest charges have been reduced significantly by
improved treasury management and the lower level of debt, which stood at
£31.4 million at June 2004 compared with £61.1 million in June 2003.
Capital expenditure increased to £17.3 million (2003 – £10.6 million) with
investments following the closure of Estaimpuis Industrial and Institutional
factory and its conversion to a household facility , the closure of the Breda
factory in The Netherlands and expenditure at Ieper and Estaimpuis to
facilitate the transfer of its production, plus tablet capacity expansion in
Barrow and Moyaux.
Private Label
Private Label increased its market share in six of the seven core European
markets according to The PLMA ’ s (Private Label Manufacturers Association)
2004 International Private Label Y earbook. The UK is still the largest market
in Europe for Private Label with over 40% volume share across all grocery
categories. A separate review of the Nordic markets showed Private Label
gains in all countries. 
The key factors that are influencing Private Label growth include retailer
concentration and expansion across borders, the growth of the hard
discount format and the expansion of the full service hypermarket across
Europe. The new accession countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Poland,
Czech Republic and Hungary are among the fastest growing Private Label
markets according to AC Nielsen.
The enlargement of the EU on 1 May 2004 added 75 million new
consumers in the accession countries to the existing 378 million consumers
providing exciting opportunities for McBride to support Private Label growth.
McBride regards this enlarged market as an exciting opportunity to support
its major customers as they develop and expand their retail estates.
In the more mature UK market consumers are still attracted to the quality
and value proposition of Private Label. Volume sales and market share across
many categories continues to grow although price competitiveness among
retailers and its deflationary effect has caused some loss of value share in
many sectors. 
Overall Private Label remains a growth sector of the European retail 
grocery market and those categories like household and personal care 
have even more development potential in the longer term because the
Private Label share of these categories lags behind the all commodity 
share in the vast majority of countries. 
Getting more from existing assets
By concentrating on increasing the productivity of our
manufacturing plants, production lines and employees, 
we are growing our turnover without the need for major
investment. There is still potential for further gains, 
but the closure of our Breda site in The Netherlands and 
the transfer of capacity to other sites demonstrates the
effectiveness to date of our drive for increased efficiency.
NET DEBT REDUCED OVER THE
YEAR TO £31.4 MILLION
£31 .4 MILLION McBride plc Annual Report 2004 10
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
UK
The recently restructured UK retail grocery market continues to be very
competitive as the top 4 retailers compete for market share. As a number 
of major retailers have entered and are developing the growing convenience
sector , the availability of their Private Label ranges is expanding to more
consumers. Whilst the household Private Label share lags behind the all
commodity share, its volume share reached 34% in May 2004 which 
means UK consumers buy the Private Label option in 1 in every 3 purchases. 
The shelf price deflation referred to above, however , resulted in a slight 
value share reduction from 23.6% to 23.2%.
Both laundry products and machine dish wash enjoyed between 1 and 
2% volume growth and in the latter category Private Label now accounts 
for more than half of all sales in the UK.
In laundry and household cleaner new product development, McBride
continues to lead the field; successfully launching a new laundry sachet
concept with unique tamper evident packaging, fruit extract based cleaners
as well as a new dishwashing spray incorporating McBride’ s powerblaster
formulation.
Keeping pace with the changing retail environment our Clean ‘n Fresh 
range of household and laundry products was successfully launched into 
the independent convenience sector resulting in an 11.3% sales uplift in 
the year .
Another first for McBride UK, was the use of national TV advertising for 
the Surcare Sensitive range of laundry products. In the UK 75% of women
believe they have sensitive skin and Surcare is the strongest brand in this
niche sector . Sales of Surcare in 2003-04 were up 25% on the previous 
year and the range was extended into personal care.
The UK personal care business had another successful year growing sales
and profits in the face of continuing competitive pressure. Initiatives with
both Private Label and brand developments including the extension of
Surcare resulted in a number of contract gains for the business.
APL
Last year we reported that the joint venture had returned to profit. 
I am pleased to confirm that the restructuring of the business that was
introduced in the first half of 2003 continues to deliver benefits. APL
generated £1.6 million at the operating profit level up 60% versus last 
year (McBride share £0.8 million, £0.5 million in 2003).
APL again was able to win both retail and contract volume, which resulted 
in sales of £33.0 million (McBride’ s share £16.5 million compared with 
£15.1 million last year). This is a tremendous result for the joint venture
reflecting the effort and teamwork in rebuilding customer confidence in 
the business. We are therefore pleased to announce that as of 6 September
2004 McBride purchased all the equity shareholdings of our joint venture
partners in APL. We look forward to the benefits of APL being 
a full member of the McBride Group. 
Continental Europe
Our Continental European (McBride CE) sales are centred on the core
Western European members of the EU primarily France, Spain, Italy , 
The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany as well as Poland. The headquarters
are based in Belgium on the French border and the production sites are in
France, Belgium, Spain and Italy .
The core markets display all the same competitive features as the UK 
with the added dimension of a much more developed hard discount sector . 
The dual dynamic of hard discount store openings and multiple retail
consolidation has put in place all the key factors that facilitate Private Label
growth i.e. big retailers, simplified fascias, centralised sourcing, distribution
and range control. Against this background, all commodity Private Label and
in particular household and personal care continue to increase market share.
In almost every European country Private Label increased its market share 
in the last 12 months according to research by AC Nielsen on behalf of 
the PLMA.
The CE team in McBride continues to work assiduously on broadening 
and deepening its relationships with Continental Europe’ s leading retailers.
Working together to improve the Private Label offering in household and
personal care products throughout Europe continues to be mutually
beneficial for our retail customers and McBride. An essential part of
customer focus is our commitment to maintaining its competitive cost
structure and, as a result, the underperforming production units in 
Belgium and The Netherlands were closed in the period. 
McBride CE sales reached a record Euro 400 million in the year for the 
first time with our Belgian factory at Ieper reporting record sales of over 
Euro 100 million driven by the buoyancy of the Private Label market in 
Europe. Overall reported sales by destination in Continental Europe were 
£286.7 million (£271.0 million) up 5.8%, with sales in local currency up 1.7%.
Intersilesia’ s retail sales were up 0.9% in local currency on the previous 
year resulting from the combination of a highly competitive Polish market
compensated by the successful development of our Polish factory as the
manufacturing hub for Central Europe. The company is successfully gaining
business not only in adjacent Central European markets but also in
Scandinavia and Baltic countries. 
Our steady progress in building a sustainable business platform in Hungary
and the Czech Republic continues with sales growth of 33% in Hungary 
and 17% in the Czech Republic.

International – Rest of World
McBride International has responsibility for all markets outside the pre 
May 2004 EU territories with the majority of its sales in Central & Eastern
Europe, the core of which is Intersilesia in Poland. Rest of World covers all
markets outside Europe. As part of our development strategy for Central &
Eastern Europe, McBride is at an advanced stage of opening a sales office 
in Moscow having recently established a local subsidiary McBride Russia Ltd
to build on our existing position in the growing Russian market.
Recent successes for Private Label contracts have been gained in both
Denmark and Norway with further business from our Polish factory assisting
the development in the region. 
Against the backdrop of a strong Euro and Sterling it is pleasing to report
that McBride International were still able to deliver an 10.8% increase in sales.
Operations
A key element which sets McBride apart from its peer group Private Label
competitors is the quality and scale of its manufacturing asset base
throughout Europe comprising a network of 15 factories, in 6 countries
including the APL joint venture in the UK. This strength is becoming
increasingly recognised by our customers especially given our reputation 
for Private Label development, speed of response and expertise in supply
chain and manufacturing.
During the year the closure of our Dutch factory was announced. The closure
of the factory and transfer of production to more cost-effective sites within
the Group was achieved without disruption to the service and products
delivered to our customers. 
As reported in last year’ s Annual Report, the Industrial and Institutional
products factory on the Estaimpuis site in Belgium was closed during the
year and a modern household cleaner and toilet care production facility has
been created in the existing buildings of the old factory . This major project
was excellently and professionally managed on time and within budget.
Production sites are focussed on product technologies and we therefore
have 2 laundry powder factories, 2 aerosol factories, 2 personal care
factories and 9 household liquids factories. The number of household 
liquids sites is a direct consequence of the need to avoid the transport 
costs of shipping products over large distances. 
This year £17.3 million of capital was invested in the business compared 
to £10.6 million in 2002-03. The increase was in part driven by the need for
new capacity in areas such as PET bottles in Europe and autodishwashing
tablets but a certain proportion related to capacity additions required to
enable the transfer of production from Breda to other factories in 
the Group.
The Group is continuing to identify areas for improving operational
performance. Our continuing focus on asset utilisation, line productivity and
efficiency through inter-site comparisons and benchmarks enables us to
continue to attack our cost base. The Group believes it will be able to further
improve throughput providing opportunities to reduce the asset base of the
company whilst at all times ensuring that customer service levels are not
compromised.
Our information systems and collaborative working with customers and
suppliers has enabled stock levels to be lowered despite increases in sales
turnover and volume whilst maintaining customer service.
Business Development
The niche and minor brand portfolio of McBride aimed at selective retail
sectors has been an important area of development for the Group alongside
our core business of retailer Private Labels. 
Last year the Surcare niche brand range of laundry and cleaner products 
was extended with new varieties and the introduction of a personal care
range resulting in 36% sales growth.
Our Clean ‘n Fresh range was extensively redesigned to meet the growing
UK convenience sector and resulted in an 11% sales growth over the year .
The Hard Discount retailers are a large Private Label sector requiring 
cost-effective suppliers, and this has been the subject of a detailed review 
by the business. Recent contracts have been won and continuing efforts are
underway to expand our sales to the Hard Discount sector in our home
markets as well as in Germany . 
McBride is still an active exporter of products from Western Europe into
Central and Eastern Europe. During the year , however , powder and cream
cleaner production equipment was transferred to Poland for local production
and reduced distribution and complexity . It is planned to continue this trend
as sales grow in the region.
Contract manufacturing volume was impacted by the exit from the 
Industrial and Institutional business in Belgium. A number of new 
customer contracts have been gained within McBride core business 
sectors of household and personal care products providing good 
prospects for longer term volume opportunities.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
Purchasing
2003-04 has been a year of uncertainty in the feedstock markets driven
primarily by the uncertainties in the Middle East and Venezuela and the
resulting upward trend in oil prices, which has impacted a number of
downstream raw materials. The Group Purchasing Director and his team
have had a challenging but successful year minimising the impact of these
price movements on McBride’ s input costs. 
Measures to mitigate raw material cost pressures include the joint
technical/purchasing project reported last year . In addition other factors 
that have helped withstand selling price deflation and input price include
purchasing longer on certain materials, a weaker US Dollar , weaknesses in
other commodities and improvements in manufacturing efficiencies. 
Planning
We are now in the third year of the Group Strategic plan, having 
achieved a number of key goals in terms of sales growth outside the UK,
and improvements in profit, working capital, cash flow and net debt
reduction across the Group. These improvements have been realised
through organic growth and internal cost control. 
A full review and update of the markets in which we operate and our key
performance indicators (KPI’ s) which underpin the plan was undertaken
during the year . 
T wo of the main outputs from the review included the decision to close 
the Breda factory in The Netherlands and also the decision to establish a
sales office in Russia in line with our plans to identify new growth markets. 
The next phase of our planning process will investigate the opportunities
available to the company to further accelerate growth through the
examination of expansion into new geographic markets and in-filling
product ranges whether organically or by acquisition.
Social & Ethical Policy
It has always been the Group’ s practice to set standards of performance and
behaviour in the way we run the business. This goes beyond financial and
operational aspects into how we behave with those in whose communities
we operate and how we treat each other as colleagues. This year we have
brought together all our best practices and formalised them as policy . This is
an area where we will endeavour to improve our awareness and performance
with, we believe, positive commercial effects. Our exhaustive benchmarking
against best practice in the area of Corporate Governance has led us to
update several of our policies and procedures as well as the design of a
formal “whistleblowing” policy to enable employees to speak in confidence
about issues of real concern that may affect the performance of the business.
Sustainable development
McBride has produced its first Corporate Sustainability Report which will 
be issued separately to this year’ s Annual Report, building on the Corporate
Social Responsibility section in past Annual Reports and includes a more
detailed description of our policies and activities in these vital areas. Our
approach to managing the business is focussed on clear and measurable
KPI’ s, most of which benefit from a common sense approach to the drivers
of sustainable development.
For instance increasing yields and reducing waste, more efficient use of
energy , light weight packaging, controlled dosage formats e.g. tablets and
sachets, elimination of half full vehicles etc, are all ways of reducing variable
costs which simultaneously are less harmful to the environment. Even lower
overheads and stock require fewer buildings resulting in less heating and
lighting energy consumption.
At McBride we practice sustainable development by being business efficient
thereby running a good, efficient, effective and profitable business.
We are committed across Europe to the aims and requirements of the
A.I.S.E. Charter on Sustainable Development, in whose creation we have
been closely involved. The Charter requires participating companies to
develop and implement policies, procedures, indicators and output covering
the management of economic, social and environmental activities.
As Board members of A.I.S.E. (The European Detergents Industry Association),
the Group fully supports the Detergent Industry Charter on Sustainable
Development.
Health Safety and Environment
The Group’ s documented policies and procedures across the diverse
businesses that operate in six countries with differing legal frameworks are
well conceived. In the UK RoSPA is used to audit safety management, and
we are pleased to report improved ratings at all UK sites assessed during
2003-04 with some sites reaching outstanding performance. Investors in
People is used to ensure our approach to training and development is of
good professional standard. This year’ s upward trend in lost time incidents
(L TI’ s) reverses the 4 prior years’ continuous reduction. Investigations into 
the causes of this disappointing performance is part of our continuous
improvement programme.

FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
The focus on cash generation,
asset utilisation and consistently
improving profits continues. A
further significant reduction in debt
has brought about a more optimum
capital structure, and shareholder
dividends continue to grow.
Miles W Roberts
Finance Director
The continuing focus on operational efficiencies, asset utilisation and 
cash generation are reflected in the results for the year . Profit before tax
excluding the £3.3 million exceptional item improved to £33.5 million 
(2003 – £26.2 million), net debt reduced to £31.4 million (2003 – £61.1 million)
whilst the pre-tax return on average capital employed increased from 19.6% 
to 22.9% and to 25.4% excluding exceptionals. This focus, particularly on
underperforming assets, has resulted in the closure of the production 
facility based in Breda, The Netherlands which will be completed before 
December 2004. In addition the Industrial and Institutional Products (I&I)
factory in Belgium was closed during the current year .
T urnover improved over the previous year by £14.5 million to £501.3 million
including £9.2 million relating to favourable currency movements. At constant
exchange rates, turnover grew by 1.1%; this reflects the growth in the core
Private Label business by 2.2% partly offset by lower contract manufacturing
sales resulting from the closure of the I&I business. The components of the
growth in the core business were the continuing increase in Continental
European sales, up 5.9%, partially offset by a decline in UK sales of 2.2%,
largely the effect of price deflation. 
Group operating profit, before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation,
improved to £35.1 million (2003 – £31.1 million) due to an improved 
Gross profit, from higher sales, and broadly flat overheads. 
On a yearly average basis, the Euro appreciated 4% against Sterling from
the year ending June 2003 to the year ending June 2004. The effect of the
stronger Euro on the consolidated Operating Profit is not significant since 
the favourable impact of the translation into Sterling of the Continental
European activities is largely offset by an adverse impact on UK operations
which incur some Euro denominated costs. 
The Group’ s net interest receivable was £1.8 million (2003 – £0.6 million).
This improvement mainly resulted from higher receipts from Aerosol
Products Limited, the Group’ s joint venture, following its improved financial
performance. Interest payable fell to £2.5 million (2003 – £4.2 million)
largely due to lower levels of net debt, improved borrowing margins and 
the benefit from the interest differential on forward contracts taken out to
hedge the Group’ s net asset exposure against movements in certain foreign
currency exchange rates. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 14
The contribution from Aerosol Products Limited improved to £0.5 million
(2003 – £0.1 million).
The taxation charge for the year of £9.9 million equates to a 31.8%
effective rate based on profit before tax excluding goodwill and the joint
venture contribution. This rate reflects the mix of mainstream rates 
applying throughout the Group. 
Earnings per share, before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation,
improved by 22.7% to 13.5p (2003 – 11.0p). 
As anticipated in last year’ s Annual Report, capital expenditure has risen 
to £17.3 million (2003 restated – £10.6 million). However , the increase
includes £3.5 million relating to the closure of the Breda plant, the
underlying level of expenditure is in line with the average for the previous
three years and remains substantially below depreciation as asset utilisation 
is improved. 
Net debt continued to reduce significantly during the year , from 
£61.1 million at June 2003 to £31.4 million at this year end, in spite of 
an increased dividend and higher capital expenditure. Net working capital
levels continued to reduce reflecting the continuing improvement in 
stock management and better supplier payment terms partly offset 
by an increase in debtors. 
Gearing, interest cover and Net Debt/EBITDA ratios all continued to 
improve this year versus 2003, to 34% (2003 – 78%), 43.4x (2003 – 8.3x)
and 0.62 (restated 2003 – 1.13 ). 
T o align with FRS 5 – Application note G, which was issued in November
2003, turnover is now stated net of sales discounts and rebates. Previously
these were accounted for within Administrative Costs. Prior periods have
been restated with the impact on 2003 being a £18.2 million reduction in
turnover from £505.0 million to £486.8 million. There is no impact on
operating profit. 
A further accounting policy change relates to fixed assets where ancillary
moulding equipment is now accounted for as a fixed asset, having previously
been treated as stock which was amortised, with the charge included in
Administrative costs. Prior periods have been restated with the impact on
the 2003 balance sheet being a net tangible fixed asset increase and
associated stock decrease of £2.2 million. There is no impact on 
operating profit. 
Breda Plant Closure
On 23 April 2004 the Group announced that it was closing its factory in
Breda, The Netherlands and transferring production to other Group plants. 
This decision was taken to improve overall capacity utilisation and 
operating efficiency . 
A once-off exceptional charge of £3.3 million, relating to redundancy costs,
has been included in this year’ s results although the payments will not be
made until after June 2004. Additionally , capital expenditure of £5.0 million
will be incurred relating to the production transfer of which £3.5 million was
spent by June 2004. £1.0 million of property disposal proceeds are expected
in 2005-06. 
T reasury Management
In the autumn of 2002 a five year committed multi currency revolving 
credit facility of £90 million along with a two-and-a-half year £20 million
committed non-recourse invoice selling facility were negotiated to meet
medium term funding requirements. As consistent strong cash flow has
reduced the Group’ s funding requirements the above facilities have been
voluntarily reduced to £65 million and £10 million respectively . In addition
the margins have been renegotiated down from between 85bp and 
130bp previously to between 60bp and 90bp depending on the Group’ s
financial performance.
T o meet short term requirements to manage working capital the Group 
also has access to uncommitted short term money market lines and other
borrowing facilities. 
All borrowings and foreign exchange activities undertaken as a result of
underlying trade transactions are with approved financial instruments. The
majority of currency exposures arising from trade transactions were covered
during the year as they arose. Since the year end, the Group has taken
forward foreign exchange contracts to cover expected currency transactional
and translational exposures during the year to June 2005. No transactions of
a purely speculative nature are undertaken.
Currency and Interest Rate Risk
The Balance sheet is fully hedged with non-sterling net assets matched
against net liabilities on a currency by currency basis through the use of
forward currency contracts. The Group does have some Sterling/Euro
exposure on future profits as referred to above. A decision has been 
taken to hedge this through the use of forward currency contracts. 
Interest rate costless collars are in place to hedge overall interest 
rate exposure. 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The Group is required under European legislation to prepare their
consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS for accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005. The adoption of IFRS will first
apply to the Group’ s financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2006.

30.2 McBride plc Annual Report 2004 15
A project team has been set up to achieve a smooth transition to IFRS. 
A high level review of the differences between IFRS and current accounting
policies has been performed, and the impacts of convergence are currently
being reviewed. The wider implementation aspects are also being assessed,
including how changes resulting from IFRS will be communicated to 
the market.
The key impact areas on net profit and shareholders’ funds, based on 
the work to date, are expected to be due to differences in accounting for
deferred tax, pensions, research and development, share based payments,
goodwill and fixed assets. The presentation of the Group’ s financial
statements, along with the disclosures, will also be affected.
Aerosol Products Limited (APL)
Following substantial operational and financial restructuring in June 2002,
APL has improved its financial performance. The Group’ s share of APL ’ s 
pre tax profit was £0.5 million (2003 – £0.1 million). 
At the year end, APL was a joint venture, held in the Group’ s consolidated
accounts at a net liability of £1.2 million (2003 – £1.7 million). 
On 6 September 2004 the Group acquired the entire equity interests of its
joint venture partners in APL for a consideration of £1.0 million. In addition, 
the June 2002 restructuring deferred £2.0 million of consideration until 
July 2005; this payment has been brought forward to 6 September 2004.
Following this transaction, it is expected that APL will be treated as a 100%
subsidiary in the Group’ s consolidated results for June 2005. 
Systems
The Group’ s primary financial and operating systems are based on SAP 
which is operated at all main operating units. Additional applications creating 
an increasingly integrated environment have continued to be rolled out. 
The SAP systems cover most aspects of manufacturing, stock, delivery 
and financial control and are an integral part of the business. SAP is a key
business tool in the Group’ s continuing focus on asset utilisation and
production cost efficiencies.
Going forward the focus of systems development will be on asset
management, production planning and logistics.
Accounting Policy changes
Note 1 to the Financial Statements provides details of two changes in
accounting policy that have been made.
Pension Accounting
The Group continues to account for pensions in accordance with 
Statement of Accounting Practice 24 (SSAP 24). An actuarial valuation of
the UK defined benefit scheme as at 31 March 2003 was undertaken in 
the year; this showed a deficit of £4.0 million to cover liabilities resulting
from past service. Under SSAP 24 this liability will be recovered over 13 
years which is the average remaining service life of the current members.
The Company contribution rate for future service will not change from 
that incurred over the last few years. 
Under FRS 17 rules, the valuation of the scheme at June 2004 showed 
gross assets amounting to £39.0 million (2003 – £32.9 million) and the
liabilities to £49.0 million (2003 – £47.7 million) leaving a shortfall of 
£7.0 million (2003 – £10.4 million) after taxation. Some of the reasons 
for the difference with SSAP 24 include different valuation dates and
assumptions for the discount rate used to calculate scheme liabilities. 
Earnings and Dividends
The weighted average number of shares in issue during the year was
177,666,200. Earnings per share was 11.4p, up 11.8% on 2003 which
itself had risen 46.3% on the previous year (excluding 2002 goodwill 
write off).
The recommended final dividend, payable on 26 November 2004, has 
been declared at 2.8p, representing a 33.3% increase on 2003, which 
itself had risen 50% on 2002. This final dividend together with the interim
dividend brings the full year to 4.0p, a 37.9% increase over last year’ s 2.9p.

Corporate Governance
The Company recognises the importance of high standards of Corporate Governance and has continued to endorse the principles set out in The Combined
Code on Corporate Governance, as issued in June 1998 (‘The Code’). The Company regularly and actively reviews its level of compliance with The Code and
has complied throughout the period under review with the provisions of Section 1 of The Code, except in regard to the length of the Chief Executive’ s
Service Contract. However , subsequent to the year end the contractual notice period has been amended from 24 to 12 months.
The Company has also taken account during the period of the Reports published by Sir Derek Higgs and Sir Robert Smith which have prompted changes 
to the UK Combined Code on Corporate Governance. Whilst the Company has no obligation to report on the application of the new Code this year ,
significant steps have already been taken to ensure compliance with the terms of the new Code and, accordingly , the Company has made certain additional
disclosures in this year’ s Report in advance of the requirement to do so.
The Board of Directors
The directors who held office during the year and continue to hold office, together with their biographical details are shown on pages 16 and 17.
At the end of the year to 30 June 2004, the Board comprised seven directors with two additional non-executive directors having been appointed with effect
from 1 September 2003. There are two executive directors, the Chairman and four non-executive directors. 
Whilst the Board considers all its non-executive directors to be independent in character and judgement, and having no relationships or circumstances 
which could affect their judgement, it is recognised that under the new Code, the Chairman and Mr H T alerman are not deemed to be independent due 
to their length of service. In this regard, except where otherwise explained, they have resigned their positions on Board Committees where independence 
is recommended.
The Board’ s strong non-executive element continues to be based on each non-executive director being independent of management. Between them, 
the non-executive directors bring a broad range of relevant experience and independent judgement to the Group and their wide ranging experience and
backgrounds ensure that they can debate and constructively challenge management in relation to both the development of strategy and performance
against the objectives set out by the Board. The non-executive directors have undertaken some specific training relevant to their duties. Induction
programmes are undertaken by newly appointed members of the Board including site visits and strategic and operational presentations by senior executives.
The non-executive directors have been appointed for their specific areas of expertise and knowledge, which can bring complementary skills to the Board. 
The role of senior independent non-executive director has been reviewed and, recognising that Mr H T alerman has been a director for more than nine years,
the position has now been assumed by Mr C D Smith.
The Company’ s Articles of Association require one third of the directors to stand for re-election every year . The directors retiring by rotation at the Annual
General Meeting are Mr C D Smith and Mr M W Roberts, who, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. Since the last report, all the non-executive
directors and the Chairman agreed to submit themselves for annual re-election to allow shareholders to have a regular opportunity to reassess the
composition of the Board. This also recognises the provisions of the new Code in seeking annual re-election of any non-executive directors who have served
more than nine years on the Board. Accordingly , Lord Sheppard, Mr H T alerman, Mrs C A Bogdanowicz-Bindert and Mr R A Lee shall retire at the Annual
General Meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 25
Board Proceedings
The Board recognises its responsibility to represent and promote the interests of shareholders and its accountability to shareholders for the performance 
and activities of the Group. At the same time, the Board recognises the responsibility of the executive directors to manage the Group’ s activities. The Board
has approved a revised Schedule of Matters specifically reserved to it for decision. This Schedule recognises that in certain situations, the Board’ s decision 
will be subject to shareholder approval. The Schedule aims to ensure that the Board maintains ultimate control over strategy , significant investment 
and capital expenditure, capital structure, corporate actions, mergers and acquisitions, litigation and regulatory proceedings and financial reporting and
internal control matters. Delegation to management is on a structured basis and the tasks of monitoring executive actions and reviewing operational issues
are delegated to the Chief Executive who oversees the management of the Group’ s business activities, and to Board Committees. Any matter requiring 
a decision by the Board is supported by a paper analysing all relevant aspects of the proposal and every opportunity is provided for full discussion 
by all members of the Board. 
The Board meets formally at least six times a year at about two-monthly intervals and will meet further as necessary to consider specific matters. Attendance 
by individual directors at meetings of the Board and at meetings of sub-committees on which they serve is set out in the table shown below on page 26.
In accordance with the provisions of The Code, there is a clear division of responsibilities between the independent non-executive Chairman and the 
Chief Executive.
Under the non-executive Chairman and supported by the Chief Executive there is an open style of management and free flow of information between the
executives and non-executives which is a strong feature of the Board’ s effectiveness. This ensures comprehensive reviews at Board meetings and regular
contact between meetings. The Board regularly reviews its strategic planning, investment and acquisition proposals and ongoing performance against
budget. Board papers are prepared and issued about a week prior to each Board meeting to enable the directors to give due consideration to all matters 
in advance of the meeting. Directors are free to take independent professional advice if necessary at the Company’ s expense.
Sub-Committees
Sub-Committees of the Board have been established with Charters which detail their composition, activities and duties. They also define the extent of the
authority delegated to each Sub-Committee. The Charters have been updated to accord with the provisions of the new Code and to revise the composition 
of the Sub-Committees. Copies of the Charter terms of reference, activities, roles and responsibilities of the Board Committees are available on the Group’ s
website at www.mcbride.co.uk.
• Audit Committee – the Committee operates in accordance with a Charter that determines its terms of reference. The Committee currently comprises 
Mr C D Smith as Chairman and two other independent non-executive directors, Mr R A Lee and Mrs C A Bogdanowicz-Bindert. The Committee members
normally serve for a period of not less than three years and a quorum of the Committee is two members. There are a minimum of three meetings per
annum and the Committee is authorised by the Board to investigate any activity within its terms of reference. The business of the Committee takes full
account of The Code and is responsible for reviewing, on behalf of the Board, the Group’ s accounting and financial policies and disclosure practices, its
internal controls and the nature, results, recommendations and services of the external auditors. A report of the activities of the Audit Committee during
the year ended 30 June 2004 is included on page 29.
• Remuneration Committee – this Committee also operates in accordance with a Charter that defines its terms of reference and is responsible for the
review of remuneration policies for the executive directors, key senior managers and for reviewing management development matters within the Group.
The Committee comprises a Chairman, Mr H T alerman, and the three independent non-executive directors, Mr C D Smith, Mrs C A Bogdanowicz-Bindert 
and Mr R A Lee. Although Mr T alerman has served on the Board for more than nine years, the Board believe that, in the interests of continuity and given 
Mr T alerman’ s experience, he should retain Chairmanship of the Committee. The Chief Executive is invited to attend the Committee meetings on all
matters except those relating to his own remuneration. 
The Committee does not formally retain remuneration consultants but seeks professional advice from external advisers as and when required. 
The Committee meets at the request of any member but at least once in each financial year and a quorum is now three members. The members of the
Committee have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committee’ s decisions. They have no conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships with the executive directors nor from being involved in the day-to-day business of the Company . A full report of the Remuneration
Committee is set out on pages 30 to 34.
• Nomination Committee – this Committee’ s Charter also defines its terms of reference. The Committee is responsible for reviewing the structure, size 
and composition of the Board as well as considering and recommending the nomination of candidates for appointment as executive or non-executive
directors to the Board. The Committee is also responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the continuation in service of any director who 
has reached the age of 70. Members of the Committee are not involved in matters affecting their own positions. In this regard, Lord Sheppard is now 
over the age of 70 and the remaining members of the Committee have recommended his re-election to the Board subject to approval by the shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting. 
During the year , two new independent non-executive directors have been appointed to the Board. The appointees were selected from a pool of
candidates from a variety of backgrounds. All members of the Board had the opportunity to meet the candidates prior to their appointment. 
The membership of the Committee has subsequently been revised and now comprises Lord Sheppard as Chairman together with all the non-executive
directors – Mr C D Smith, Mr H T alerman, Mrs C A Bogdanowicz-Bindert and Mr R A Lee, as well as the Chief Executive, Mr M Handley . The Committee
meets as appropriate but at least once per annum and the quorum is now three members, at least two of whom shall be independent non-executive
directors.
The Chairmen of the Committees, or in their absence an alternate, attend the Annual General Meetings of the Company to respond to any shareholder 
questions on the activities of the Committees.
In addition, the following Standing Committee has been established to consider trading, financial and operational matters across the Group. This Committee
meets twelve times per annum.
Group Executive Committee – this Committee is chaired by the Chief Executive, and comprises the Group Finance Director , the Managing Directors 
of the geographically based operating companies, the Business Development Director , the Group Purchasing Director , and the Personnel Director . Other
members of the senior management teams are invited to attend as may be deemed appropriate. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 26

Relationship with Shareholders
The Board places considerable importance on the maintenance of good communications with institutional shareholders. Meetings with analysts and
institutional shareholders are held on a regular basis at the time of the Interim and Final results. These provide the opportunity for shareholders to assess the
Company’ s performance and prospects and to explore the Company’ s approach to Corporate Governance matters. The Board keeps shareholders regularly
appraised of the performance of the Company through the Annual Report and Accounts, regular announcements to the London Stock Exchange and, 
at the half year , an Interim report is published. The Annual General Meeting provides an opportunity for any shareholder to ask questions and the Chairman
provides a statement on the current trading conditions. All proxy votes are declared after the show of hands on each Resolution tabled to the Annual
General Meeting. The Company responds throughout the year to correspondence received from individual shareholders on a wide range of issues and 
also participates in a number of surveys and questionnaires submitted by a variety of institutional/representative bodies.
The Board, and in particular the non-executive directors, are kept informed of investors’ views through distribution and regular discussion of analysts’ and
brokers’ briefings. Both the Chairman and the senior independent director are available in the event of shareholder concerns which cannot be addressed
through management.
Internal Control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’ s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. It is designed to manage rather than
eliminate risk and to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the assets are safeguarded against unauthorised use or material loss and that
transactions are properly authorised and recorded. Following the detailed Group-wide internal audit project undertaken during part of last year and this year ,
a formal review process has been established to ensure that all internal control and risk management matters are reviewed on a regular basis. The Executive
directors are responsible for implementing the risk management strategy and for ensuring that an appropriate framework is in place to ensure effective
operation of the strategy across the Group. Progress is overseen by the Audit Committee with an annualised consolidated review of the risk profile of the
Company being undertaken to identify any major risk exposures and to consider any appropriate mitigating actions. 
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing risks faced by the Company which has been in place for the
year under review. The Board has concluded that the key risks appear to be well managed and there are no major cost implications or timing or effort
required to correct any issues which have been identified. The key corporate risks identified include loss of a customer , continued price erosion, protection 
of the Private Label market share, sensitivity to input material price fluctuations, and management of the supply chain to ensure satisfactory and cost effective
customer service.
The internal control system, which accords with the T urnbull Guidance, embraces all business risks, including financial, operational and strategic and
incorporates a full review of compliance controls and risk management across the Company . This system is operated as an integral part of organisation of
executive responsibilities and accountabilities. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 27
Internal Control continued
The main features are:
• The Board meet once a year for a two-day conference to consider and develop the corporate strategy .
• A 3-year strategic planning process is in place with the objective of continuing to improve the existing business through sales growth, operational 
efficiency , asset utilisation, cost control and staff participation. These plans are discussed by the Board and are subject to regular assessment, updating 
and follow-up.
• The Group organisation has well defined management responsibility and reporting lines. The Chief Executive and Finance Director meet monthly with the 
UK and CE senior management teams to review progress on financial, commercial, operational, supply chain, personnel, health, safety and environmental 
as well as regulatory and legal compliance matters.
• There is a comprehensive annual budgeting system with ultimate approval by the Board. Financial performance of the subsidiaries is monitored centrally 
and updated forecasts are prepared and challenged on a regular basis. A formal process for ensuring that key risks affecting all the Group’ s operations 
are identified and assessed on a regular basis, together with the controls in place to mitigate these risks.
• There are well-defined policies relating to personnel issues and subsidiaries report regularly on health, safety and environmental matters. The Board 
regularly reviews overall performance.
• The Audit Committee meets regularly to review internal reports and reports from the external auditors.
• Authorisation and control procedures have been developed for expenditure on capital projects. Those for operating costs and contractual commitments 
have been reviewed.
• Area and functional business risk reviews are undertaken regularly with any high risk areas retained under the remit of the Audit Committee. Mitigating 
controls and actions are identified with progress assessed at regular intervals.
• The effectiveness of the Group’ s internal controls is monitored through a self-audit programme which has been introduced following the full review 
of all operational, financial and strategic risks and controls by an independent auditor during part of last year and this year.
• The Group’ s external auditors add a further independent perspective on certain aspects of the internal financial control system as a result of their work.

Directors’ Responsibility for the Preparation of Financial Statements
The Companies Act 1985 requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company and the Group at the end of the year , and of the profit and loss for that period. In preparing financial statements, the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures, disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to assume that the Group will continue in business.
The directors consider that in preparing the financial statements on pages 38 to 57 the Group has used appropriate accounting policies, consistently 
applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have
been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Annual Reports and the Financial Statements published on the Group’ s website.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud
and other irregularities. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 28
DIRECTORS’ REPORT

operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group has, therefore, continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Charitable Donations

Terms of Reference
The Committee is governed by a Charter which has been revised to reflect the provisions of the new Code. This was adopted by the full Board on 23 July 2004.

Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee has a policy for the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors which has been designed to give consideration 
to the provisions of The Code and aims to ensure that packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive directors 
and senior executives of the right calibre. The key principles of the policy are set out below.
The Committee is committed to keeping its policy under regular review and, in this context, it has commissioned an exercise from independent consultants,
Watson-Wyatt, to advise on the development of the most appropriate structure for executive directors’ packages for the future. This is in line with the
Committee’ s commitment to take account of changes in the trading environment and in remuneration practices. It is intended to carry out a similar exercise
for other senior executive positions.The objective is to give detailed consideration to the Company’ s strategy as it impacts on the remuneration policy for
executive directors and other key senior executives. The aim will be to ensure that members of the executive management of the Company are provided
with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are rewarded in a fair and responsible manner for their individual contributions to 
the success of the Company . This will involve establishing incentive schemes which are in line with best practice, providing a strong link to individual and
company performance and promoting alignment of interests between employees and shareholders. T otal remuneration will be benchmarked against
competitive as well as market rates. In particular , the Committee will be reviewing the balance between fixed and variable elements of remuneration. Future
incentives may include the establishment of alternative long term incentive plans. The criteria to be determined are expected to be linked to market practice
and pre-determined key performance indicators linked to company and individual performance.
T otal Remuneration
The performance of the executive directors and key members of senior management is evaluated as a pre-cursor to setting their annual remuneration and
awards of share options. The aim is to provide packages which take account of individual performance whilst remaining sensitive to pay and employment
conditions elsewhere in the Company and externally . This is especially the case when determining annual salary increases. 
Current packages typically comprise a mix of performance and non-performance-related elements. Basic salary and benefits-in-kind are the elements 
of non-performance-related remuneration. This element is reviewed annually with levels set by reference to appropriate external market data. Variable
remuneration consists of two fundamental elements: annual cash bonus and discretionary share options. These incentives are performance-related and
represent a significant part of the executive directors’ total potential remuneration. Bonuses represent a short-term performance-related element of
remuneration with payments linked to annual business targets. Grants of share options represent longer-term performance-related elements of
remuneration. However , given the Company’ s low gearing, it has not been considered beneficial to grant any new share options during the year . The
Committee is currently considering alternative forms of long term incentive for executive directors and key senior managers. The Committee’ s policy is 
to seek to ensure that consideration is given to guidelines issued by institutional investors as well as to developing market practice, and to align executive
directors’ incentives with shareholder interests.
The remuneration of the Chairman and the non-executive directors is determined by the Board as a whole taking account of market rates based on
independent advice as deemed necessary . Individual directors do not participate in the decisions concerning their own remuneration.
Base Salaries
The base salaries of executive directors and senior executives are reviewed annually taking into account individual experience, performance and responsibilities
as well as pay awards made to other employees, and benchmarking against remuneration for similar positions. The Remuneration Committee consults 
with the Chief Executive and pays due regard to his recommendations for other executives. The Committee also has access to professional advice as may 
be deemed necessary from inside and outside the Company . Salaries are paid monthly in arrears by bank transfer . McBride plc Annual Report 2004 31
Annual Bonus
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that senior executives are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group. For the year to 
30 June 2005 there is therefore a significant bonus element of up to 60% of basic pay to executives’ remuneration. Bonuses, which are non-pensionable,
are linked to the achievement of the Group’ s annual budget that has been approved by the Board. Only for results in excess of the budget are bonuses
earned at the higher levels. Bonuses of between 30% and 50% were paid to the Group’ s executives and senior managers in respect of the year ended 
30 June 2004.
Share Options
Whilst the directors are not required to hold any qualification shares, the Remuneration Committee believes that share ownership by management serves 
to strengthen the link between their personal interests and those of shareholders. Acquisition of shares in the Company has therefore been encouraged
during the year and details are shown in the table on page 27. Whilst the executive directors and senior executives are eligible to participate in the Company’ s
share option schemes, no new grants of executive share options were awarded during the year due to the Company’ s low gearing. Details of existing share
options held by the executive directors are shown on page 33.
The Committee’ s policy is for option grants to be limited to twice annual basic salary . In exceptional circumstances, options in excess of two times salary may
be granted. It is not the Committee’ s policy to grant executive share options at a discount. Awards vesting under the share option schemes are not pensionable.
Under the executive share option schemes, participants are granted options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company for a consideration payable on
exercise equal to market value at the time of grant. No consideration is payable for the grant of an option. The proportion of the shares under option which
may vest is subject to the achievement of performance targets over a performance period set by the Remuneration Committee. All schemes have a ten-year
life span and are exercisable after three years from the date of grant, subject to satisfaction of performance conditions, until ten-years after the date of grant.
On future issues of share options, the Committee shall pay due regard to the rules of the scheme and will review the relevance of the performance criteria
and have regard to market practice and relevant guidance. The performance criteria applied to previous grants of options are shown on page 34. These
criteria were selected by the Committee taking account of contemporaneous market practice under which the majority of schemes set targets linked to
growth in EPS exceeding that in the RPI and measured over three financial years.
The 2002 share scheme rules incorporate provisions to allow the Company , at its discretion, to transfer its National Insurance Contributions (NICs) liability 
to individual grantees. During the year ended 30 June 2004, the directors updated the rules of the 2002 Company Share Option Plan to reflect the provisions
of the Finance Act 2003. 
Directors’ Service Contracts
In line with the recommendations of The Code Mr M Handley’ s contract has been amended reducing the notice period from two years to one year . 
His contract therefore stipulates 12 months’ notice by the Company and 12 months’ notice by the director . No compensation was given for this change.
Mr M W Roberts’ contract stipulates 12 months’ notice by the Company and 12 months’ by the director . All directors’ contracts are available for inspection
at the Annual General Meeting.
Executive Directors
The service agreements provide for the executive directors to provide services to the Company on a full-time basis. The agreements contain, in addition 
to remuneration terms, details of holiday and sick pay entitlement, restrictions and disciplinary matters.
The agreements contain restrictive covenants for periods of 6 months post employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Group’ s
customers, suppliers and employees and indefinitely with respect of confidential information. In addition, they provide for the Group to own any intellectual
property rights created by the directors in the course of their employment. The Company allows the executive directors to hold non-executive positions
outside the Company .
The Committee recognises the explicit provisions of The Code for compensation commitments to be stipulated in directors’ service contracts in regard to early
termination. The current practice is not to include such provisions in order to enable the Committee to respond appropriately to particular circumstances.
However , the Committee will keep this practice under review. In the event of termination of an executive director’ s contract, the Committee’ s policy would be
to deal fairly with such cases whilst at the same time taking a robust line in minimising any compensation. 
Other Benefits
The Company pays into defined contribution pension schemes on behalf of Mr M Handley and Mr M W Roberts based upon basic salary at 50% and 35%
respectively . In addition, both directors enjoy similar benefits to many other employees of the Group including private medical insurance, a fully expensed 
car and life assurance cover . McBride plc Annual Report 2004 32

Non-Executive Directors
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but renewable letters of appointment. The intention is that the non-executive directors will
normally be appointed for an initial period of three years. They may subsequently be invited to serve for further three year periods. Any appointment for
more than nine years in total will, in any event, be subject to annual shareholder approval.
The non-executive directors will be subject to re-election by the shareholders on an annual basis. Their appointments may be terminated without
compensation in the event of them not being re-elected by shareholders or otherwise in accordance with the Company’ s Articles of Association. The fees 
for the non-executive directors are set by the full Board and are determined by reference to fees paid by other companies of similar size and complexity 
and reflect the amount of time the non-executive directors are expected to devote to the Group’ s activities during the year . The non-executive directors
receive a basic fee. A supplementary fee is paid to Committee Chairmen and to the Senior Independent non-executive director to reflect their additional
responsibilities. No element of their fees is performance-related and they are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive schemes. Their services 
do not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits. Details of the non-executive directors’ shareholdings and emoluments are shown on pages 27 and 33.

Share Option Schemes continued
The performance criteria relating to the various grants of executive share options are as follows:
1995 Executive Share Option Scheme
Options are exercisable at any time from 3 years after the date of grant to 10 years after the date of grant. Performance conditions require that, in 
the 3 financial years prior to that in which options are to be exercised, EPS must have increased at an average annual rate of 3% in excess of the RPI.
1995 International Executive Share Option Scheme (Unapproved)
Performance is measured by comparing EPS reported for the financial year ended 30 June 2001 with EPS reported for the financial year ending 30 June 2004.
Under these criteria, options will not vest at all unless growth in earnings per share exceeds the increase in RPI over the same period by 3% per annum, 
at which level only one half of the options will vest. For performance above this level, options will vest on a rising scale, with full vesting only if growth in
earnings per share exceeds the increase in RPI by at least 5% per annum. If the minimum performance criteria have not been achieved, the options lapse. 
T o the extent that the performance criteria are only partially met, the options lapse in part.
2002 Unapproved Discretionary Share Option Scheme
Performance is measured by comparing EPS reported for the financial year ended 30 June 2002 with EPS reported for the financial year ending 30 June 2005.
Under these criteria, options will not vest at all unless growth in earnings per share exceeds the increase in RPI over the same period by 3% per annum, 
at which level only one half of the options will vest. For performance above this level, options will vest on a rising scale, with full vesting only if growth in
earnings per share exceeds the increase in RPI by at least 5% per annum. If the minimum performance criteria have not been achieved, the options lapse. 
T o the extent that the performance criteria are only partially met, the options lapse in part.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Social, Environmental and Ethical (“SEE”) performance review 
McBride places considerable importance on compliance with, not only environmental standards, but also on improving ethical standards and social
performance. Although the three parts of the business (UK, CE and Poland) operate separately , they are increasingly coming together in terms of common
policies and procedures and approaches. The executive directors consider health, safety and environmental matters with the local senior management teams
on a monthly basis. Experiences, best practice and the impact and consequences of new legislation are shared across the Group. 
In terms of risk identification and management, SEE matters are included in the overall risk and control framework of the Business Risk review process
outlined on pages 26 and 27. The Group’ s success depends on the ability to service customers at the right price, with the right quality and on time. The
Group’ s risk assessment process has identified the following key areas which necessitate close focus: nurturing our new product development processes;
management of our supply chain; containment of costs; protection of our assets; and development of our employees. Appropriate control measures are in
place and are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that these remain relevant and to identify the need for any new action points to be introduced.
The Group considers legislative compliance as the minimum operating standard. Where possible, we strive to surpass the minimum standard and operate
using best available techniques. Continuous improvement plans are in place at all manufacturing facilities to ensure that legislative compliance is maintained
throughout the business. Verification of compliance with applicable legislation and regulations is a primary element of the Group’ s policy and regular checks
are undertaken internally of existing and forthcoming rules and appropriate measures are planned to comply . In addition, the Group has senior management
representation on various T rade Associations and complies with Industry Association guidelines.
Full crisis management procedures have been documented and continue to be reviewed on a six monthly basis to ensure that effective communication 
and reporting channels exist in the event of any adverse event. In addition, disaster recovery plans are in place and are revised annually to ensure that, in the
event of a serious incident, the sites are able to respond in a timely manner to minimise any adverse impact to either the Company or its stakeholders.
For the first time, the Group has published a Sustainable Development Report (the “Report”) covering activities at all the McBride plc sites. The report reflects
the Group’ s commitment to the concept of sustainable development recognising that this represents an intrinsic element of running a good, efficient,
effective and profitable business. It sets out the Group’ s policy and approach to such matters, as well as including information about the extent of compliance
by the Group and recording its achievements during the year . The Group recognises the importance of minimising waste, maximising efficient use of its
assets, manufacturing safe products and supporting and developing its employees, all of which serve to benefit consumers and local communities as far 
as possible. In this context, £1.2 million has been spent during the year on health, safety and environmental improvement projects across the Group.
As a member of the AISE, the Group actively contributes towards the development of the AISE Sustainable Development Charter and follows other voluntary
agreements between the detergent industry and the European Commission. 
Set out below is a precis of some of the key messages incorporated within the Sustainable Development Report in relation to health, safety , environmental,
social and community activities. More detailed information on the activities, data, objectives, compliance status and achievements are included in the Report
itself. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 35
Environmental 
The Group recognises the importance of protecting the natural environment via prudent use of resources and waste minimisation. This is recognised by 
the structure of environmental responsibility throughout the organisation. By appointing CE, UK and international Managing Directors, the Chief Executive
ensures that responsibility is held at the highest level. Each manufacturing operation has management who are responsible for environmental issues. In
addition, central functions provide help and advice and monitor the internal operational performances by auditing both the manufacturing facilities and the
management systems. The use of environmental key performance indicators assists with the monitoring of eco-efficiencies and with the identification of
trends and improvements. 
It is the Group’ s intention to introduce its Environmental Management System (EMS) to all manufacturing sites. Over 90% of sites already have EMS in place
and three have been certified to ISO 14001. The Group’ s environmental policies underpin the commitment to environmental protection through initiatives 
to drive down energy consumption; to reduce waste in all processes; to minimise and control the discharge to water and air , to select employees who are
committed to operating in an ethically and socially responsible manner; to adopt staff training and awareness measures; and to regularly monitor EMS and
performance.
The Group also recognises the importance of understanding and managing the aspects of bio-diversity that are affected by our operations. The biggest
impact on the environment is waste water from the manufacturing processes. None of our sites send untreated waste water directly to the natural
environment and all waste water is treated in order to make it compatible with its receiving environment. The only significant process emissions to air relate
to propellant gas emissions from the aerosol filling processes. The main threat from production sites on the land lies in the potential pollution of soil due to
leaks. Appropriate control measures are in place to minimise these risks and details are included in the Report. Emissions to land are controlled by following
the waste hierarchy of Minimise, Re-use, Recycle, Recover and Dispose, as well as following the requirements of relevant EU Directives. Waste levels are fully
recorded and monitored against each parameter .
With regard to environmental performance, two of the key objectives have been the reduction of energy and water consumption. Y ear on year usage of
energy and water has increased due to increased production levels. However , utilisation has also improved as a result of increased efficiencies and awareness.
Eco-efficiencies for water consumption and generation of carbon dioxide increased for the second year in succession. In CE, water consumption has reduced
by 28% over the past four years. Closure of the Breda plant in the Netherlands and the I&I facilities in Belgium have significantly reduced emissions and both
have beneficial impacts going forward.
Health and Safety 
Management of health and safety is an important part of the overall management of activities in the Group. Detailed health, safety and environmental
reports are prepared by the operating companies each year and submitted to the Board for review and regular monitoring of controls takes place on at 
least a quarterly basis by the local operating company management teams with a full business risk review undertaken on an annual basis.
The development and implementation of a health and safety management system specific to the needs of the company continues to be a key focus of
activity . A detailed health and safety management system is already well established in the UK. In CE the emphasis has been on integration of safety ,
environment and quality systems. The two major parts of the Company have a similar structure and organisation with the Human Resource Directors of 
CE and UK having responsibility for health, safety and environmental matters. Each site has a health and safety manager who either have, or are working
towards, qualifications required by local legislation. All receive internal training to ensure that McBride standards are adhered to. All sites have a system in
place for the provision of occupational health services. Systems are in place at all sites to manage health and safety based on risk assessment and compliance
with local legislation and health and safety policies. Policies are translated into internal standards for each site and site action plans are developed to cover
specific issues and needs. Health and safety training is a constant activity at all sites. In particular , a Competency Based T raining package has been developed 
in the UK during the year in response to needs identified in behavioural and opinion surveys. In CE, training is standardised to a general level for a range 
of subjects but because of local language and legislation differences, this has to be tailored to meet site specific needs. 
Internal audits of health and safety management processes are carried out. In addition, in the UK, an independent audit by RoSPA every two years gives 
a score for each site and a list of recommendations which have been used to improve safety performance. Scores have increased on each occasion and 
sites are currently rated “Good” or “Excellent” showing clear progress in the management of safety . In CE, Ieper meets OHSAS 18001 standards and a gap
analysis has been completed for Delphia with plans for certification next year . Rosporden’ s safety management system has been audited and approved twice
by the authorities under COMAH. All accidents and major incidents are reported internally and are fully investigated to determine appropriate corrective and
preventative measures. Reports to official authorities follow local legislative reporting requirements. For the Group, the number of accidents/incidents
worsened slightly year on year although the rate of seriousness fell particularly in CE. In the UK, the increase in number is primarily accounted for by minor
accidents. As part of its continuous improvement processes, the Group will evaluate the reasons for the increases and take appropriate actions to identify 
any corrective actions and any additional training needs as required. 
A policy on product safety was agreed for the whole company during the year . Guidelines are in operation for product safety , covering raw material use 
and product assessments, legal labelling and packaging requirements, and claim support when these have safety implications. There is also specific guidance
in place on child safety aspects of product packaging and design. Full support is provided to customers on product safety , packaging and labelling issues.
Products are fully assessed before launch through technical evaluations and occasionally using consumer test panels. Any complaints are acknowledged
within 48 hours of receipt and all are fully investigated to determine the cause. During the year there have been no non-compliances with regulations
concerning customer health and safety and no fines or penalties were incurred. Animal testing continues to be a major issue for retail customers and
consumers. The Group has a policy of not testing products on animals or requesting testing of products or ingredients by any supplier or third party . Work 
is already under way to implement the changes introduced by the new Detergent Regulations published by the EU in 2004. In addition, in the UK, “The
Green Claims Code” is also respected. Human safety is assessed for all household products under the requirements of the Dangerous Preparations Directive
and for personal care products under the Cosmetic Products Directive. 
Environmental impacts are assessed for all products and products involving risks to the environment will not be sold. The impact of transportation during
the distribution of products is also recognised and we do ensure that vehicles are loaded and utilised as efficiently as possible. The impacts of the finished
products in use on emissions to water , air and land are also assessed on an individual product basis in accordance with appropriate Directives and
Regulations with particular focus on the use of bio-degradable alternatives as they become available. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 36

Community
The Group actively considers the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and has many initiatives which aim to contribute positively to the
local area wherever possible. Apart from being a significant employer in most areas, the Group also supports economic regeneration, gives advice to smaller
companies, supports local community and education communities and gives financial assistance to community efforts. Examples of activities include the
provision of health and safety advice; work experience placements; interview training; careers advice; promoting literacy and numeracy; employees acting 
as Board members for a number of organisations.
The Group also recognises the importance of maintaining good relationships with the local community . Site General Managers are actively encouraged to
maintain positive relationships, wherever appropriate, with local authorities and regulatory bodies. Where facilities are located in or near to residential areas,
the site management have established neighbourhood schemes to provide a vehicle for local concerns to be heard and to ensure that due recognition is 
paid to ensuring that there is no unnecessary nuisance caused to residents. Charities in the locality of the Group’ s facilities benefit from charitable donations
and employees regularly offer their services either through volunteer offices or through mentoring activities with local schools and other bodies. For the past
three years, the UK has donated redundant product to the Communication Workers Union Humanitarian Aid charity .
In the UK, a close relationship has been built with several local universities and the company continues to offer bursaries and scholarships to undergraduate
students which often results in active recruitment and partnership/development opportunities. The Company provides a number of short and long-term
industrial placements. The award winning Childcare scheme, established in partnership with a local Council has continued to run during the year . The Group
has membership of Business in The Community (BiTC) and runs a Charitable T rust which focuses on educational grants and donations to other charities. For
the year ended 30 June 2004, the Charitable T rust made financial contributions of £17,661. Separately , employees themselves raised over £12,740 for charity . 
Ethical Conduct
The Group expects its employees to operate against high ethical standards in areas such as adherence to all legislative and regulatory guidelines, in its
business relationships and as regards human rights. Unethical behaviour is not acceptable and written policies on harassment, equality and wellbeing are in
place to ensure that employees behave in an appropriate manner . Established standards of operating with suppliers and customers are in place covering, for
example, the prohibition of giving and receiving bribes and gifts. Supplier audits also address issues of environmental as well as social and ethical conduct.
The Group’ s Social and Ethical policy provides a practical set of guidelines for employees to ensure they exercise acceptable standards of behaviour in all 
their business dealings. The policy is issued on an annual basis to all relevant employees and procedures are being developed to introduce audits against
compliance with the objective of ensuring consistent implementation of the policy . A Whistleblowing policy has also been developed during the year .
Customers
As a major supplier of product to the Retailers, the Group recognises the importance of ensuring that there is no adverse impact on the reputation of 
its customers.
It is fundamental to the ethos of the Group that the social impacts of its products, their safety , quality and availability must satisfy the requirements of its
customers and their consumers. We are committed to providing quality and reliable service to our customers and customer service is the primary operational
goal across the Group. Measurement of customer service levels on a daily basis is a key area of focus. In addition, customer consultation and maintenance 
of good relationships with customers is of paramount importance across all activities of the business, not only in the Commercial field, but also as regards
Logistics and Product and T echnical Development.
Employees
The Group recognises that its employees are a valuable asset and particular emphasis is placed on involving employees wherever possible. It is acknowledged
that team working is invaluable in helping to deliver the Company’ s goals. The Group’ s strategy and business plans are shared with senior managers who 
are responsible for cascading down information as appropriate within the organisation.
A two-year rolling programme of opinion surveys by site has been in place for more than ten years to monitor employee satisfaction levels on a regular basis.
The Group has made further progress on developing its training and development policies, and introducing appraisals for all employees, as well as ensuring
that all employees receive regular briefings. Extensive training programmes are underway in support of systems developments. The Group has also continued
to develop its Wellbeing and Capability policies. All parts of the UK have Investor in People accreditation and in some cases have been re-accredited in the 
last 12 months. Partnership or Works Councils (joint management/employee consultation groups) operate at all UK facilities. During the year , the Burnley site
received a further Business Excellence Award as winner on the Leadership subsection.
Employees are encouraged to become shareholders through participation in the McBride Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and some employees are
also able to participate in the Group’ s achievements through performance-related bonus schemes and Executive Share Option Schemes. All site-based
employees have local incentive schemes relating to site performance.
During the course of the year , the Group employed an average of 4,022 people of whom 1,997 were employed in the UK. It is the Group’ s policy to ensure
equal opportunity in recruitment, selection, promotion, employee development, training and reward policies and procedures in compliance with legal
requirements. The Group also places great emphasis on establishing and maintaining a safe working environment for its employees. It is a key objective to
ensure that successful candidates for appointment and promotion are selected taking account of individual ability , skills and competencies without regard to
gender , race, religion, disability or sexual orientation. Full and fair consideration is given to the employment and opportunities for training and development
of people with disabilities according to their skills and capacity . Where employees become disabled in the course of their employment, they will continue to
be employed, wherever practicable, in the same job or , if this is not practicable, every effort is made to find and to provide appropriate retraining. Where the
Group finds it necessary to undertake a restructuring programme, every effort is taken to ensure that compulsory redundancies are minimised, and relevant
support and guidance is provided as appropriate. Decisions are communicated, employees are consulted and implications for individuals are duly considered.
The Group is committed to employee consultation by way of briefings, listening groups, information bulletins and Company newspapers. In addition, all
parts of the business now issue a monthly local core brief for employees. On a six-monthly basis, the Chief Executive holds senior management conferences
to ensure that all staff are aware of the business performance and to provide a clear definition of the Group’ s goals and expectations. This also presents 
the opportunity for the Chief Executive to reiterate the Group’ s vision, strategy , values and business objectives for the Group. This communication process is
cascaded down through the Group with the local UK and CE senior management teams holding similar conferences to communicate the local goals, targets
and values across the rest of the business. In addition, the operating company management teams regularly visit each of the sites and are available for open
questioning from employees. Most sites are actively engaged in involvement initiatives to help to ensure that all employees understand and relate to the
business goals. Open days are held at many sites to allow employee families to see the environment in which their family members work. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 37
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF McBRIDE PLC
We have audited the financial statements on pages 38 to 57. We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described 
as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a body , in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the company’ s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’ s report and for no other
purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’ s members
as a body , for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the directors’ remuneration report. As described on page 27, this includes responsibility for
preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our responsibilities, as independent
auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority , and by our
profession’ s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the
group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement on page 24 reflects the company’ s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review
by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’ s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’ s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the corporate governance statement and the unaudited part of the directors’
remuneration report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’ s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at 30 June 2004 and of the profit of the group
for the year then ended; and
• the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies
Except where referred to below, the following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with the items that are considered material to 
the Group’ s financial statements. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards. The particular accounting
policies adopted by the directors are described below, except that the directors have invoked the true and fair over-ride when reporting the value of
investments, as fully explained in note 13 to these accounts.
The phased adoption of FRS 17 – Retirements benefits involves significant disclosure changes to both the profit & loss account and balance sheet. The
Accounting Standards Board have deferred full implementation to periods starting on or after 1 January 2005. The company is required and continues to
apply SSAP 24 – Accounting for pension costs for reporting profit and loss and balance sheet items and in addition provides the additional FRS 17 disclosure
under the transitional requirements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of McBride plc and all its subsidiary undertakings. These financial statements are made
up to 30 June 2004.
On the acquisition of a business, including an interest in an associated undertaking, fair values are attributed to the Group’ s share of the separable assets.
Where the fair value of consideration given and associated costs exceed the fair values attributable to these assets, the difference is treated as goodwill and
capitalised in the balance sheet in the year of acquisition.
The results and cash flows relating to a business are included in the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated cash flow statement from 
the date of acquisition and up to the date of disposal.
T urnover
During the year the accounting policy for the treatment of sales discounts and rebates has been amended. Discounts and rebates have in 2004 been
accounted for as a reduction in revenue, having been previously treated as an administrative cost. This accounting treatment is consistent with FRS 5 –
Application Note G (issued November 2003) and in the directors’ opinion more fairly reflects the nature of these transactions. T urnover represents the
amounts, net of discounts and rebates, excluding value added tax, derived from the provision of goods and services to third party customers during the
period.
Goodwill
For acquisitions of a business, purchased goodwill is capitalised in the year in which it arises and is amortised in equal installments over its useful economic 
life up to a maximum of 20 years.
The profit or loss on the disposal of a business includes the attributable amount of any goodwill relating to that business not previously charged through 
the profit and loss account.
Capitalised goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included within intangible fixed assets. In accordance with FRS 10, the value of goodwill will be subject to
review at the end of the first financial year following acquisition and may be subject to review at the end of the accounting period in which events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill that arose on businesses acquired prior to the introduction of FRS 10, in the year commencing 1 July 1998 will remain written off to reserves. In the
event of subsequent disposal of any of these businesses, the attributable goodwill, will be charged or credited in the profit and loss account in determining
the profit or loss on sale. A credit of an equal amount to reserves ensures that there is no impact on shareholders’ funds.
Fixed assets and depreciation
During the year the accounting policy for the treatment of ancillary moulding capital equipment has been amended. This has, in the current year , been
accounted for as a fixed asset, having been previously treated as stock which was amortised, with the charge included in administrative costs. In the directors’
opinion this accounting treatment more fairly reflects the nature of these transactions.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets by equal installments over their estimated useful
economic lives as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings – life of lease
Plant and machinery – 8 to 10 years
Computer equipment (including software) – 3 to 5 years
Motor vehicles – 4 years
Moulding equipment – 3 to 5 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction. Where an estimate of the useful lives of assets is revised, the remaining
net book value at the date of revision is written off over the revised estimated useful life.
Investments
In the consolidated accounts, the Group accounts for its subsidiaries in accordance with FRS 2. The Group’ s share of its investment in Aerosol Products
Limited is shown as 50% of the net liabilities.
Stocks
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods purchased for resale, standard
cost adjusted for current purchase pricing is used. For work in progress and finished goods manufactured by the Group, cost is taken as production cost
which includes an appropriate portion of attributable overhead. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less all further costs to completion 
and all relevant marketing, selling and distribution costs. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 43
T axation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment 
of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences which have arisen
but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Foreign exchange
T ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the 
profit and loss account.
For consolidation purposes, the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the closing exchange rates. The profit and loss
accounts and cash flows of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange during the period. Exchange differences arising on these
translations are taken to reserves, net of exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings.
Leases
Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their useful lives. The interest element is charged to the 
profit and loss account over the term of the contract. Operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the
operating lease.
Pensions
The Group operates two material defined benefit pension schemes for UK employees, both of which are closed to new employees, the Robert McBride
Pension Fund, which was closed to new employees in July 2001 and the Robert McBride Barrow Site Retirement Benefit Scheme. There is also a defined
contribution scheme for new employees who are not eligible for the defined benefit schemes.
The assets of all the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The regular cost of providing defined
benefits are charged to profit in accordance with SSAP 24, Accounting for pension costs, over the period benefiting from employee service. The notes 
to the accounts contain additional information as required by FRS 17 – Retirement Benefits, under the transitional rules. Variations from regular cost are
spread over the remaining service lives of employees in the schemes. The pension cost is assessed by independent qualified actuaries. 
Financial instruments
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts. All instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing 
underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Group’ s risk management policies. Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are
recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
T ransactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction, unless matching forward foreign exchange
contracts have been entered into, in which case the rate specified in the relevant contract is used. At the balance sheet date unhedged monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research and development is charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which it is incurred. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 44

restated to reflect this change resulting in a revenue reduction of £18.2 million for 2003. There is no impact on Group operating profit.

10 Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per share
Earnings per ordinary share is calculated on profit after tax and minority interest in accordance with FRS 14.
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share for the year ended 30 June 2004 is based on 177,666,200 ordinary shares of 10 pence each which is the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year (2003 – 177,639,197).
Fully diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all dilutive
potential ordinary shares. The company has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares, those share options issued whose market price and exercise
price is less than the average price of the Company’ s ordinary shares during the year and shares allocated to an approved Save As Y ou Earn scheme.

been restated to reflect this change resulting in increases in fixed asset cost of £13.8 million, depreciation of £11.6 million and net book value of £2.2 million,
and associated decrease in stock of £2.2 million.
There was no significant movement in the Company’ s tangible fixed assets which were £0.1 million at 30 June 2004 (2003 – £0.1 million). McBride plc Annual Report 2004 49

The investment in McBride Euro Finance Limited is Euro denominated and has been financed by an equal Euro loan. Both loan and investment are revalued.
In the year ending 30 June 2003, the business assets of McBride Aircare Limited were transferred to Robert McBride Limited. Both companies are ultimately
wholly owned subsidiaries of McBride plc. The cost of the Company’ s investment in that subsidiary undertaking reflected the underlying fair value of its 
net assets and goodwill at the time of acquisition. No adjustment has been made to the combined carrying value of the Company’ s investments in these
subsidiaries or reflected in the Group’ s financial statements. Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985 requires that the investment be written down and that
the amount be charged as a loss in the Company’ s profit and loss account. However if the adjustment were made the directors consider that as there has
been no loss to the Company it would fail to give a true and fair view of the Company’ s profit and loss. The trade and assets have simply been transferred
from one wholly owned subsidiary to another . Therefore, the directors consider that this policy is necessary to present a true and fair view as 
to the Company’ s trading performance and have invoked the true and fair override for the presentation of these financial statements.
Set out below are the principal subsidiary undertakings of the Group whose results are included in the Group financial statements as at 30 June 2004. The
share capital of these undertakings, comprising ordinary shares, is wholly owned by the Group with the exception of Intersilesia McBride Polska Sp Z.o.o.
which is 85% owned by the Group. All subsidiaries incorporated in Great Britain are registered in England and Wales.
The main business activity of the operating subsidiaries involves the manufacture and distribution of household and personal care products. A full list of
subsidiaries is filed with the Registrar of Companies.

The assets of the plans are held in separately administered trusts. Pension plan assets are managed by independent professional investment managers. 
The actuarial valuation noted above takes into account the impact of changes to Advanced Corporation T ax in the UK that took effect from 2 July 1997.
Other than the pension schemes described above, the Group does not operate any form of post retirement benefits.
The actuarial value of the assets of the UK defined benefit scheme represented approximately 90% of the liabilities for the benefits that had accrued to
members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. This scheme has been closed to new entrants (See FRS 17 – Retirement Benefits below).
An actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme, using the projected unit method, was undertaken on 31 January 2004 which showed a pre-tax
deficit of £4.0 million for past service. This deficit is spread over the average remaining service life of the members, thirteen years, on a percentage of pay
basis, consistent with SSAP 24. This method results in the current service cost in respect of the closed scheme increasing as the members of the scheme
approach retirement. The main financial assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were rate of increase in salaries 4.5%, inflation 2.8% and investment
return 6.8%. McBride plc Annual Report 2004 53

FRS 17 – Retirement benefits
As required under FRS 17 – Retirement Benefits, the Group has adopted the new disclosure guidelines that were issued in November 2000. 
The objective of the new FRS is to reflect at fair value the assets and liabilities arising from an employer’ s retirement benefit obligations, to better reflect 
the operating costs of providing those benefits and to ensure adequate disclosure of these items.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes. Within the UK, it operates the Robert McBride Pension Fund, which is a defined benefits scheme,
and also defined contribution schemes. T ogether these schemes cover most of the Group’ s UK employees. In addition, the Group operates a number
of smaller pension schemes in Continental Europe that are devised in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
In line with many other companies, the Directors of McBride have considered the potential uncertainty and long term cost to the Group of continuing 
to offer a defined benefits pension scheme. Accordingly , in 2002 the Board closed, to new entrants, the Robert McBride Pension Fund and established 
a new defined contributions scheme for UK employees.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefits scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2003. The results of that valuation have been projected to 
30 June 2004 and then updated based on the following assumptions:
2004 2003 2002
Rate of increase in salaries 4.00% 4.00% 4.25%
LPI increases for pensions in payment 2.80% 2.40% 2.50%
Liability discount rate 6.00% 5.40% 5.75%
Inflation assumption 3.00% 2.50% 2.75%
Revaluation of deferred pensions 3.00% 2.50% 2.75%
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered,
may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

30 Contingent liabilities
The Group has a contingent liability of £1.2 million arising from the purchase agreement that entitles the minority interest holder of Intersilesia McBride
Polska Sp. Z.o.o. to request the purchase of shares at a valuation, derived by formula, based upon business performance. Intersilesia has performed well
against the criteria. As a result, the valuation has reached its contractual limit of £1.2 million. There remains uncertainty as to when the minority interest
holder will exercise the right to sell the minority stake, but in any event, the Group acknowledges a contingent liability of £1.2 million.

Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest based on short term interbank rates (predominantly LIBOR, with some EURIBOR and Base Rates) (see notes 16
and 17).
Excess sterling cash generated in the UK is recycled internally to the European operations to repay external borrowing and the currency and interest rate
effects are corrected by currency swaps.
T o manage the interest rate risk exposure to Euro borrowings the Group is using interest rate costless collars (Euro 20.0 million at June 2004) which 
mature between 1 July 2004 and 20 June 2005 and which have floors of 2.0% and caps of 2.72%-2.95%.

Currency risk management - monetary assets and liabilities
The Group’ s buying and selling activities occur mainly within the same currency zones, so there is relatively little trading currency exposure. The Group’ s policy
is to cover all such currency exposure. The table below, however , is required to show net external exposure by business area and is not able to include the
effect of internal offsetting cover .
The net monetary assets/(liabilities) that are not denominated in their functional currency are shown below. Gains or losses arising from these exposures will
be recognised in the profit and loss account. The amounts in the tables take into account the effect of forward contracts used to manage these exposures.

Currency risk management - net asset exposure
As indicated on page 14 of the Financial Review, it is the objective of the Group to minimise currency risk by hedging its currency exposure. The Group
operates significant trading assets in continental Europe, denominated in Euros and other European currencies. Although trading activities take place mainly
within each currency area, the Group has significant exposure to movements in exchange rates on net assets. In order to hedge these exposures the Group
arranges foreign currency funding, both internal and external, and uses forward contracts to hedge the remaining net exposure to foreign currency
assets.The net asset exposure and the effect of the rolling forward contracts is shown below.

20 Acknowledgments McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 01
All good businesses are sustainable.
By minimising waste through careful management and recycling, they
reduce their impact on the environment at the same time as lowering
operational costs.
Maximising the efficient use of their assets helps contain the consumption of
resources while enabling increased productivity at little or no additional cost.
By listening to and supporting the local, national and Europe-wide communities
where they operate, they benefit the lives of people while ensuring their
own views and plans are given fair consideration.
Providing a safe working environment and career development opportunities
for their staff encourages the loyalty that reduces recruitment costs, minimises
the potential for costly industrial action and provides the benefits of an
experienced, stable workforce.
Manufacturing safe, attractive products that improve the quality of life for
consumers creates commercial demand that generates income and profitability .
Introducing convenient products such as concentrated washing powders
and washing up liquids, measured dosage products such as tablets and
sachets, are examples of sustainability in design requiring less materials and
packaging, reduced shelf space and transport costs.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S MESSAGE
Mike Handley
Chief Executive
In short, what is good for the environment and society is also good for
business and shareholder returns. This is the approach of McBride, where the
essential components of sustainability are fundamental aspects of how we
are organised and how we work.
We are playing a leading role in the development and launch of the
A.I.S.E. Charter on Sustainable Development and are working towards its
aims. The Charter requires participating companies to develop and
implement policies, procedures, indicators and output covering the
management of their economic, social and environmental activities.
This is McBride’ s first corporate sustainability report, building on the
Corporate Social Responsibility section in past annual reports with a 
more detailed description of our policies and activities in these vital areas.
It represents a base line from which we will develop targets for improvement
for inclusion in future reports. It is also our first significant output in line with
the principles of the A.I.S.E. Charter , and is testimony to our commitment to
sustainable development as an intrinsic element of running a good,
efficient, effective and profitable business.
Mike Handley
Chief Executive, McBride plc
September 2004 McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 02
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
McBride plc is a large and complex manufacturing and distribution company ,
operating across national boundaries from the UK in the west to Poland 
in the east. It manufactures in six countries, but delivers products to many
more, meaning it faces important environmental, safety and social issues
across a diverse and varied geographical and cultural region.
This report highlights the main issues the Company is addressing as 
part of its ongoing bid for continuous improvement in achieving sustainable
development.
From the innovation of new products, through the protection of our
natural environment via prudent use of resources and waste minimisation,
to the welfare and development of our greatest asset – our people – we are
committed to sustainable development. 
Our achievements in 2003-04 include:
Environmental Protection
• Eco-efficiency data for 2003-04
1,666 kg production per GJ energy (1,618, 2002-03 +2.8%)
1,127 kg production per m
3
water (1,065, 2002-03 +5.8%%)
4,824 kg production per m
3
effluent (4,768, 2002-03 +1.2%)
16,755 kg production per te CO
2
equivalents (16,523, 2002-03 +1.5%) 
• Eco-efficiencies for water consumption and generation of carbon dioxide
increased for the second year in succession. 
• In McBride Continental Europe (CE), the eco-efficiency on water
consumption has improved by 28% over the past four years. 
• More than 90% of our manufacturing sites have Environmental
Management Systems in place, and four have been certified to ISO 14001.
• Closure of the Breda plant in The Netherlands and I&I facilities in Estaimpuis,
Belgium, have significantly reduced emissions and will have beneficial
impacts going forward.
Social Responsibility
• Health and safety is monitored in terms of accident rates and frequency ,
which increased from 1.48 last year to 1.71 per one hundred thousand
hours worked across the whole company . 
Although it is disappointing to report an increase in the level of lost-time
accidents for 2003-04, it is against a background of an improving trend 
over the last four years and improving independent review of our policies
and procedures.
McBride, as part of its continuous learning systems, will evaluate the
reasons for the increase and take action or identify training needs as
required. Plans are in place at each site to continue improving safety
performance and culture.
• £1.2 million was spent on Health, Safety and Environmental 
improvement projects.
• Full support is provided to customers on product safety , packaging 
and labelling.
• We made contributions to the work of A.I.S.E., the European Trade
Association for soap, detergents and cleaning products, on HERA 
(Human and Environmental Risk Assessment) and on developing 
the Charter on Sustainable Development.
• Throughout the last year only one manufacturing incident, a spill in 
the now closed factory in The Netherlands, incurred a fine. Some 
non-compliance in Europe with transport regulations also resulted in
small fines. Some minor spills occurred but these were without
significant environmental impact.
McBride – the Company
McBride is the leading supplier of Private Label household cleaning
and toiletry products for Europe’ s largest retailers.
In the year 2003-04, McBride generated over £500 million in 
sales through its three trading divisions in the UK, Continental 
Europe and Central & Eastern Europe. It made an operating profit of
£35.1 million during the same period, the third successive year of 
significant growth.
The company’ s approach to achieving such commercial success and
sustainable development are based on the same principles – delivering
the right product in the right quantity to the right place at the right time.
Eliminating waste, in production, materials and other resources is at 
the heart of this approach, using the simplest possible means of meeting 
the individual demands of multinational retailers across Europe. While
the sophistication of the company’ s operations has grown vastly since 
its foundation in 1927, this attitude has been there since the beginning
when its business was delivering bleach to customers’ doorsteps in 
north Manchester .
T oday’ s McBride employs more than 4,000 people in 15
manufacturing sites across six European countries, from the UK to
Poland. Between them, they produce full ranges of laundry, 
household cleaning, toiletry and aerosol products.
McBride staff, including the most senior levels, are involved in
developing the Sustainable Development Charter of the A.I.S.E., the
European trade association representing manufacturers of soaps,
detergents and cleaning products. This voluntary code of practice will
provide the benchmark for McBride’ s sustainable development activities
across all markets and company sites.

INTRODUCTION
This report covers the sustainable development activities of all McBride plc
manufacturing sites. Information from Poland is currently limited to data for
key performance indicators (KPIs). 
There is a commitment within the Company to operate within the sustainable
development context, wherever possible minimising our impacts and
benefiting consumers and local communities. This is evidenced by the 
£1.2 million spent during the year on health, safety and environmental
improvements.
Our concept of sustainability follows that of the Brundtland Commission 
( …development to meet our needs without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs). At McBride, we are committed
to this concept.
T o this end, we will conduct our business in a manner which respects 
human life and the environment. We will strive to contribute to the social and
economic welfare of the local communities in which we operate. We also
recognise that by taking voluntary action in this area we are helping to protect
and develop our own business.
We will achieve these goals by:
• developing and manufacturing products that are safe for intended use
and are efficacious
• minimising the environmental impact of products in manufacture, 
use and disposal where changes can be agreed with our customers
• providing stable growth and employment and contributing to the social
and economic life of the local communities in which we operate
• minimising any negative impact of our activities on local communities 
• understanding and communicating the impacts, risks and benefits of 
our business, and engaging stakeholders in making improvements in 
all aspects of sustainable development 
• investing in projects which support the principles of sustainable
development and working with our industry to improve the sustainability
performance of key product groups
We have focused largely on health, safety and environment in this report
since performance is measurable and data is available in these areas. 
Other areas, such as product-related information and social and community
activities are summarised briefly. The three parts of the business (CE, UK 
and Poland) operate separately but are increasingly integrating in terms of
common policies and approaches. The development and implementation of
a health & safety management system specific to the needs of our
company continues to be a key focus of activity . In CE the emphasis is on
integration of safety , environment and quality systems. (In environmental
management we have set our target on having sites certified to ISO 14001.
At present one UK site and two CE sites and our Polish factory have
certification.)
This report is compiled based on the information currently collated and
available within the company . Account has been taken of the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 2002.
UTILITIES
Energy
Most global energy production comes from burning fossil fuels (i.e. coal, gas
and oil) which depletes the natural stock of these non-renewable resources.
Burning fossil fuels produces a variety of emissions, including nitrogen oxides
(NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx), which contribute to low-level air pollution
and acid rain. Fossil fuel combustion also produces greenhouse gases such 
as carbon dioxide (CO
2
) and methane (CH
4
). These gases are generally
accepted as being responsible for causing global warming. The impact on
the environment of greenhouse gases is referred to as the ‘Global Warming
Potential’ (GWP) and is commonly expressed in terms of CO
2
equivalents
which are detailed on page 10, Environmental Performance – Emissions
to air .
In 2003-04 McBride used a total of 710,008 G-Joules of energy in its
production operations (up from 692,546 GJ last year). This was supplied 
in three forms, electricity , gas and fuel oils.
The ratio of fuels used were very similar to last year:
• Electricity = 65.0%
• Gas = 26.2%
• Fuel Oils = 8.8%
Since production in 2003-04 was higher , the total consumption of energy
used per tonne of production was 0.60GJ, which equates to 1.67 tonnes 
of production per GJ of energy , up from 1.62 last year , a 3% improvement
in energy usage. All energy entering the business was used for manufacturing
purposes including blow moulding and ancillary functions such as heating,
lighting and the operation of administrative equipment in offices. 
Reduction of energy consumption is one of our key objectives, and many
initiatives are already underway to cut energy use at our sites. Common
initiatives such as increasing employees’ awareness of the need for energy
efficiency and the introduction of energy-efficient lighting have helped to
improve energy use across the Group. 
During 2003-04, five UK sites participated in an energy survey in the form 
of a four-day consultancy visit funded from the Climate Change Levy with
the objective of finding ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Four of 
the five sites used the same consultant to ensure consistency . The survey
recognised that some good work had already been undertaken but provided
a new benchmark for each site and identified ways of reducing emissions 
by reducing energy consumption.

Water
Water is a resource that is often undervalued. Only ~2.5% of the finite
supply of global water is fresh, and the majority of this is frozen in glaciers
and ice caps, or is too remote for human use. Across the world, the amount
of fresh water used continues to rise year on year in order to support the
more rapidly growing economies and populations. McBride recognises the
need to operate in a manner that will help to maintain an indefinite supply
of water by not exceeding nature’ s capacity to renew that quantity . No water
is directly withdrawn from or directly returned to Ramsar-listed wetlands.
T otal water supplied to the business was 1,049,124 m
3
(1,052,176 last year).
This comprised 825,146 m
3
of supplied water and 223,978 m
3
water
abstracted under licence from boreholes. The use of water as both a raw
material in production and as a means for cooling and sanitising resulted in 
a measurement of eco-efficiency of 1,127 kgs production per m
3
of water .
Again, the increased production means that this figure is better than the
1,065 kgs/m
3
of last year .
A project initiated at the Middleton site during 2002-03 reuses water that 
has been warmed by passage through a heat exchanger in a manufacturing
process which requires heated water . Further improvements this year have
increased efficiency to around 85%.
In McBride CE, eco-efficiency on water use has increased by 28% over the
last four years. 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF
MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS
Policy and arrangements
It is the intention of McBride to introduce our Environment Management
System (EMS) to all manufacturing sites. Over 90% of sites already have 
EMS and are making progress toward ISO 14001 certification, although 
the rate of progress will vary according to site needs and resource. Four 
sites are currently certified to the ISO standard (Ieper Household, Ieper
Personal Care, Bradford and Strzelce Opolskie). 
Our environmental policies affirm our commitment to the consideration 
of environmental issues and the minimisation of environmental impacts in
our business decisions, manufacturing processes and product development
programmes.
This is achieved by:
• driving down energy consumption through initiatives on process plant,
ongoing investment in energy efficient equipment and by raising
employee awareness of the need for energy conservation
• reduction of waste in all processes from the specification of incoming raw
materials, the use of materials on site and the transmission of materials
into the supply chain in the form of packaging. Where waste is
unavoidably created, we take steps to manage the disposal in the most
appropriate manner giving full consideration to environmental issues
including segregation of waste for reuse, recovery and recycling
• recognising the importance of minimising and controlling the discharge 
of liquid and atmospheric effluents from our sites. Where appropriate,
discharges will be monitored and controlled to comply with legislation 
and consent agreements, and to minimise any detrimental effect further
down the waste-handling chain
• employing, where possible, purchasing procedures that favour the choice
of suppliers who are committed to minimising the impact of their
operations on the environment and who operate in an ethically and
socially responsible manner
• ensuring that staff and contractors are made aware of their environmental
responsibilities at work
• management systems and audits that are used regularly to monitor and
enhance environmental performance
Structure of environmental functions
McBride recognises the requirement to manage all aspects of the business to
minimise the impacts of its operations on the environment. This is represented
in the structure of environmental responsibility throughout the organisation. 
By appointing CE, UK and International Managing Directors, the CEO
ensures that accountability and responsibility is held at the highest level. 
Each manufacturing operation has a manager , in either a full or part role,
who is responsible for environmental issues. In addition to this, manufacturing
operations are supported by Central functions that provide help and advice,
and monitor the internal performance of operations by auditing both the
manufacturing facilities and the management systems. The development
and use of environmental key performance indicators (KPIs) enables the
Central functions to monitor eco-efficiencies and identify trends in
improvements.

last year’s 1,065 kilograms. McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 8 McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 08
Expenditure and investment
A substantial proportion of the annual budget is invested in maintaining 
and improving HS&E issues. In 2003-04 the expenditure was £1.2 million 
1for improvement projects including:
• High efficiency lighting at the Bradford site 
• Barrow and Burnley blowmould interlock guarding
• Middleton Bleach Effluent Plant, caustic soda dosing and 
emergency lighting
• LPG storage, firebreak wall and deluge systems at Hull
• Improvement of wastewater facilities at Rosporden
• Estaimpuis raw material handling to reduce exposure
• Sallent – fire protection measures including compartmentation
• Ergonomic equipment at all CE sites
Compliance
McBride considers legislative compliance as the minimum operating standard.
Where possible, McBride strives to surpass the minimum standard and to
operate using best available techniques (BAT s). 
In 2003-04 there were two incidents that resulted in fines from the
environmental regulators. A spillage of detergent from our Breda
manufacturing plant in The Netherlands resulted in a fine, and a further 
fine of €10,000 was imposed for a breach of wastewater consent levels. 
We announced we were ceasing production at the Breda site in 2003-04.
A number of formal warnings and cautions have been administered for
minor incidents in Belgium, France and Spain, and a formal caution was
received from a utility company in the UK.
Continuous improvement plans are in place at all manufacturing facilities to
ensure that legislative compliance is maintained throughout the business.
The Seveso Directive (COMAH – Control of Major Accidents and Hazards)
has been revised meaning that more sites come under its control. Rosporden,
Moyaux and Hull are already covered by the directive but Estaimpuis and
other sites may be affected when the changes are enacted in local legislation.
Biodiversity
Biodiversity is the variety of life at all levels. From simple cells, through
individual species to complete eco-systems, biodiversity is the basis of the 
life support systems on which we all depend. Worldwide, biodiversity is
being lost at an alarming rate. Pollution, land use, climate change, species
introduction and the unsustainable use of natural resources all have a global
impact on the biodiversity of our world.
McBride recognises the need to understand and manage the aspects 
of biodiversity that are affected by our operations, both during the
manufacture and the use of our products in order to minimise the impacts 
of these operations on biodiversity as a whole.
Impact of production sites on water
The biggest impact on the environment is via wastewater from the
manufacturing processes. None of our sites sends untreated wastewater
directly to the natural environment. All wastewater is treated in order 
to make it compatible with its receiving environment.
UK
Hull – wastewater is tankered to a treatment facility 
Barrow, Burnley – wastewater released to public sewer , leading to treatment
works under consent limit permit
Bradford, Middleton – physico-chemical treatment of wastewater before
release to public sewer leading to treatment works
Bampton – practically zero emissions to water due to the specific processes.
The small amounts released go to public sewer
CE
At Rosporden, the water is subjected to a physico-chemical treatment before
release to public sewers, where it is treated in a biological treatment plant
before release into surface water .
Four sites – Sallent, Solaro, Ieper Household and Ieper Personal Care – have a
biological treatment plant on site. T reated water is then released into public
sewers where it is treated by the public biological treatment plant before
release into surface water .
T wo production sites – Moyaux and Etain – have practically zero emissions 
to water due to the process used. The small amounts released go to the
public sewer .
Estaimpuis has a biological treatment plant on site. Output is sent directly 
to surface water .
In Poland, wastewater is tankered to a public wastewater treatment facility . McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 9 McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 09
Impact of production sites on air
There are no process emissions to the air except for propellant gas emissions
from aerosol filling process in Hull and Rosporden, and can-crushing plants.
These emissions have been monitored at Rosporden, where they were found
to be below permit levels. A plan for further reductions will have to be
presented to the authorities in the future.
There are small levels of process emissions to air (VOCs) from the Middleton
site bottle printing process, which have been reduced to levels below those
which require a local authority permit.
Other emissions to air come from diffuse sources, including heating
installations and evaporation of raw materials.
Impact of production sites on the terrestrial environment
The main threat lies in the storage of the materials used for production 
and the potential pollution of soil due to leaks. T o avoid this, all materials 
are stored on surfaced ground and bulk materials are kept under retention 
in vessels that are regularly inspected. Soil investigations (historical) have
been undertaken during the year at Etain, Estaimpuis and Guesnain (a
storage warehouse for export sales) and surveys have been updated at Ieper ,
household and personal care sites. Surveys of UK sites will be carried out as
part of the IPPC permit application.
Environmental Performance
Emissions to water
64.7% of effluent is sent to treatment works under consent permits, 
and 35.2% is released directly to surface water after in-house treatment.
Emissions of effluents to water totalled 245,159 m
3
(235,012 last year),
which gives an eco-efficiency measure of 4,824 kgs production per m
3
effluent (up from 4,768 last year). All effluent is treated before release to
surface water , either in-house or by downstream treatment works.
74.3% of effluent is treated by in-house biological treatment plants, 9.7% 
is sent to public sewer under consent for treatment, 15.9% is treated by 
in-house physiochemical plants and 0.1% is collected for external treatment.
Emissions to land
By following the waste hierarchy of primarily Minimise, Re-use, Recycle,
Recover and finally Dispose, we consider the best options for waste disposal
in every case. Careful consideration is taken when assessing the nature 
of waste. By following the requirements of the Hazardous Waste Directive
(HWD, Council Directive 91/689/EC), waste is segregated into Hazardous
and Non-Hazardous categories and specific disposal routes are taken.
T otal waste = 12,145 tonnes (up from 11,225 last year)
Waste to landfill total = 4,324 tonnes (up from 3,776 last year)
Kgs production per tonne of waste = 97,378 kgs (102,079)
Kgs production per tonne of waste to landfill = 273,511 kgs (303,453)
Re-used, recycled and recovered material = 7,821 tonnes (7,449)
Kgs production per tonne re-used and recycled = 151,216 kgs (153,825)
Much of the increase in waste is from Barrow and is a result of the loss of a
major outlet for the reuse of out of specification powder . Efforts are currently
being made to minimise the quantity of out of specification material
generated during production thereby conserving resources. Our objective
is to minimise waste generation and to recover as much waste as possible –
this is currently being achieved to a greater extent in Belgium and France
than in other countries where landfill is more prevalent.

We’ve achieved an annual cost
saving of some £70,000 through 
an effluent improvement project at
Middleton, which has also reduced
environmental impact by 80% – 
an excellent demonstration of the
commercial significance of good
environmental practice. The effluent
treatment plant at Bradford is
working at record efficiency levels
and has created savings of £35,000
since its installation. Hull operates a
low effluent process but increased
production and improved washout
procedures further increased
efficiency . 10 McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 10
Giving something back
At our Bradford site, some 50% of any liquid waste we generate is processed
for safe disposal in the drains. In the past, the remainder was sent to 
a waste transfer station and ultimately to a landfill site. Now, however, 
it is increasingly being mixed with organic waste and treated to create
compost for use on farmland. Effectively this involves the creation of artificial
soil to return nutrients to the earth.
Emissions to air
Oxides of Sulphur and Nitrogen are widely believed to be responsible for
contributing to acid rain and low-level air pollution. These gases are formed
during the process of burning fossil fuels that provide much of the energy
that McBride uses, either directly on sites (gas and fuel oils for heating) or
indirectly at the power plants that supply electricity .
Combustion engines in transport also burn fossil fuels. McBride uses
contractors for the vast majority of its haulage who operate highly efficient,
modern fleets of low-emission vehicles. In addition to distribution, McBride
employees’ travel requires consideration. Company cars, train and aircraft
travel all have an environmental impact. We do not have a suitable matrix 
for the calculation of the environmental impacts caused by these sources 
but we realise the importance of addressing these issues and encourage 
the use of video conferencing where possible to reduce the amount of 
travel between sites.
Ozone Depletion – small quantities of CFCs are being gradually phased 
out from cooling systems as they are either replaced or renewed.
CO2 emissions
70,587 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents were generated in 2003-04
from energy used in manufacturing processes (up from 67,823 last year ,
again reflecting increased energy use associated with increased production).
Eco-efficiency expressed in litres (or kilos) of production per tonne
of carbon dioxide equivalents is used as an indicator to measure
improvements in energy efficiency . This was 16,775 kgs of production
per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, up from 16,523 last year . Carbon
dioxide equivalent production is an indication of greenhouse gas emissions
to atmosphere, based on energy usage and standard conversion factors.
Achievements in the environmental area
• Bradford achieved certification to ISO 14001 in UK.
• An independent survey of spillage potential was carried out at all UK sites.
Many of the recommendations made have already been actioned.
• All CE sites have updated permits covering all activities.
• T wo CE sites have ISO 14001 certification and gap analysis are planned at
other sites to identify actions to be developed for certification.
• Sewer plans were updated at all CE sites and a study was done to identify
all potential points of pollution of soil and groundwater . Action plans were
developed to address these points over a period of three years; the main
arising issues have already been addressed.
• In CE, a survey of wastewater treatment plants produced a list of
improvements. Many of the points on the action plans have already 
been actioned.
• Strezelce Opolskie in Poland has ISO 14001 certification.
World Environment Day
‘The United Nations’ World Environment Day is being used by McBride to
raise awareness among staff and management of ecological issues both in
the workplace and at home. A stand in one of our reception areas highlights
the key contributions that individuals can make to improved environmental
performance, and a series of competitions is held including suggestion
schemes to harness the commitment and enthusiasm of our people.

Our activities marking World Environment Day 2004
included a number of environmental projects in and
around our Middleton site in partnership with United
Utilities, the Environment Agency , the Mersey Basin
Campaign and Groundwork T rust. Clearing invasive
species from the banks of the River Irk, planting trees
and shrubs in the locality and clearing an overgrown
pond in McBride Park (below), all to benefit both the
local community and our own employees – past,
present and future. 
The World Environmental Day stand at Bradford
(below), utilises the ideas from our team of enviro-reps 
to promote energy efficiency in the workplace and 
at home.
Waste recycling doesn’t always involve reuse in
industrial processes. In a project with a school local to

a large mural out of waste materials (left), which now
hangs there in our Information Systems department. McBride plc Annual report 2004 12 McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 12
PRODUCTION RELATED HEALTH
AND SAFETY
Policy and arrangements
Health and Safety organisation
Management of health and safety is an important part of the overall
management of activities in McBride. The two major parts of the company
have a similar structure and organisation, with the Human Resource Directors
of CE and UK having responsibility for health, safety and the environment
managing central teams that co-ordinate activities. Each site has a health
and safety manager in a full or shared role. These managers have, or are
working towards, qualifications required by local legislation, and have also
receive training required by internal McBride standards.
All sites have a system in place for the provision of occupational health,
either via a contract with a doctor or via full or part-time in-house health
nurses. The level of resource depends on local legal requirements and the
relative risk base of each facility . Both parts of the business have their own
H&S policy , which covers all health and safety activities. These policies are
translated into internal standards for each site and are documented and
incorporated into management systems. 
Management systems 
A system is in place in all sites to manage health and safety based on risk
assessment and compliance with legislation and health and safety policy .
All sites develop action plans based on central objectives and standards as
well as site-specific issues and needs. These action plans are agreed between
site and central management, defining the work to be undertaken in the
areas of risk assessment, equipment and procedures as well as ensuring that
the necessary resources are available. Action plans are constantly updated.
Audit
Internal audits of activities and legislative compliance are carried out by site
and by central functions on a regular basis. In addition, UK sites have been
audited every two years by independent auditors from RoSPA (Royal Society
for Prevention of Accidents). Three rounds of audits have been completed
for all sites except one. Scores have increased on each occasion, and are
currently rated good or excellent, showing clear progress in the management
of safety . 
In CE, Ieper Household is certified to OHSAS 18001 and a gap analysis has
been completed for Delphia with plans for certification next year .
Rosporden’ s safety management system has been audited and approved
twice by the authorities under COMAH. It will be audited annually .
Reviews, meetings and reports 
Regular reviews are held at sites as well as centrally to check progress 
of action plans, new developments and site risks and to determine further
objectives. A management review is held annually at McBride CE and
McBride UK level to review overall performance and strategy , to evaluate
if the system meets the needs and to plan actions for improvement.
T raining
Health and safety training is a constant activity at all sites. 
We have recently completed the preparatory stages of a major Competency
Based T raining initiative across the UK, designed to improve safety at work
by adding to the awareness and skills of staff throughout the organisation.
This is now in its implementation phase, rolling across the company to
ensure consistently high standards in all our sites. 
The Competency Based T raining (CBT) work was undertaken primarily by
Sheryl Navin, H&S Manager from Bradford while on secondment to central,
although all safety managers were involved in developing, training and
approving the work. Bob Armstrong, from Barrow, also used his publishing
skills in editing and formatting the finished articles. 
The project was commissioned in response to needs identified in behavioural
and opinion surveys, the requirement for consistency between sites and for
some standard of competency to be demonstrated after training. All 22
chapters of the health and safety manual, including permits to work, were
identified as topics for training. 
In CE, training is standardised to a general level for subjects such as
housekeeping, work permits and safety awareness. Because of local
language and legislation differences, it has to be tailored to meet specific 
site needs. Common training has also been prepared on planned inspections
and housekeeping, and several sites have done training on chemical risks
and emergency preparedness. McBride plc Annual report 2004 13 McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 13
Safety performance
Accidents/incidents 
All accidents and major incidents are reported internally , and are fully
investigated to determine appropriate corrective and preventive measures.
Investigations are discussed with all those concerned, communicated
internally on site and in the formal joint health and safety committees. 
All accidents are reported to official authorities following the local legislative
reporting requirements (reporting requirements differ per country). This year’ s
results include the Strzelce Opolskie factory in Poland for the first time.
At a Group level we follow up incidents that result in more than three days’
lost working time (L TI). We registered 149 accidents of over three days lost
this year , representing a total of 18,881 hours lost on a total of 8,670,291
hours worked (0.2%). This is an increase of 23% (excluding the five accidents
in Poland) versus last year , where 117 accidents with 17,586 man-hours lost
were recorded. 
In the UK, the increase in number (56 up from 35 last year) and frequency is
primarily accounted for by minor accidents, and is comparable to the rise in
employer liability claims for minor injuries. Of lost time accidents, 66% were
due to bruising or strains. Increased training and better accident investigation
and reporting will help to address this problem. In CE accidents increased
from 82 to 88 (now including the temporary workers who were not
included in past years). When the increase in hours worked was taken into
account, the frequency of accidents was actually lower than last year with
rate of seriousness and risk rate showing a big fall. This year shows the
lowest number of hours-lost frequency and risk rate for the past four years.
In Poland accidents were up from one to five.
Frequency rate
Over the whole company the number of L TIs per 100,000 of hours worked
showed a gradual improvement over three years, but there was an increase in
the past year from 1.47 to 1.72. 
Risk rate
This is the square root of the frequency rate multiplied by the rate of seriousness,
indicating the risk of having an accident and the severity of the accident. 
This indicator also shows a slight worsening from last year, although the 
rate of seriousness fell slightly for the whole group and more significantly 
for CE alone.
T raining
During the year 7,480 hours of H&S training were given, representing almost
0.1% of all hours worked throughout the Group.
The Safety index in McBride CE
In CE, a safety index quantifies performance and is used to monitor progress
in each site on five different indicators: Housekeeping, Accidents/near misses,
Personal Protective Equipment use, Inspection and HSE Promotion.
The continuing trend of improvement is illustrated below.

Compliance
Verification of compliance with applicable legislation and regulations is a
primary requirement of our policy . A regular check is done internally of existing
and forthcoming rules and appropriate measures are planned to comply . 
Local authorities also check health and safety performance of sites, although
frequency varies and the advice given at that time is seen as a means for
improvement. No fines or prosecutions were received for non-compliance 
of sites.
However , at the Aerosol Joint Venture site in Hull, an employee complaint
about noise resulted in a visit from the HSE inspector . Despite a full external
audit in advance of the forthcoming regulations, an Improvement Notice was
served on the site because it was felt that adequate training and implementation
of the action plan from the survey had not been put in place quickly enough.
T raining has been completed and actions are underway .
Achievements in Health & Safety
In addition to maintaining and developing general safety standards and
practices across the group, the following key improvements have also 
been made:
• T raining packages for 22 topics, many at three levels of knowledge 
have been prepared to standardise H&S training at UK sites
• UK accident investigation forms were revised and reprinted to 
accommodate requirements of lawyers and insurers handling employer 
liability claims, as well as the internal need to investigate accidents 
thoroughly to avoid recurrence
• Noise surveys were conducted at each UK site (except Bradford where 
changes to factory layout need to be completed first). Action plans have 
been developed to facilitate compliance with the new Physical Agents – 
Noise 17th Directive when it comes into force in 2005)

Spanish and Italian sites
Policy and arrangements
Policies for consumer safety
A policy on product safety was agreed for the whole company during the
year . Guidelines are in operation for product safety , covering raw material
use and product assessments, legal labelling and packaging requirements,
and claim support when these have safety implications. We also have
specific guidance on child safety aspects of product packaging and design.
While these guidelines are applied to all products, occasionally they may be
superseded by external forces, such as when customers, retailer or contract,
impose their own requirements.
Policies related to customer satisfaction
Since most of our products are sold through retailers we have little direct
contact with consumers and do not systematically measure satisfaction.
Products are assessed before launch in technical evaluations and occasionally 
in consumer test panels. 
However , we do handle complaints on our own products for some retailers,
and monitor complaint activity in others. Complaints are acknowledged
within 48 hours of receipt and all are fully investigated to determine cause. 
Animal testing continues to be a major issue for retail customers and
consumers. We have a policy of not testing products on animals, or
requesting testing of products or ingredients by any supplier or third
party . Many of our retail customers operate fixed cut-off dates for testing 
of raw materials and these are respected. We do not have our own cut-off
date, but use the same raw materials and therefore the same cut-off in 
all products. The only exception is where contract customers require us to
use their own specified raw materials in their products, regardless of last 
test dates.
PRODUCT RELATED HEALTH, SAFETY
AND ENVIRONMENT
A product’s environmental impact is far from over
once it has left our factories. We apply great care to
maximise the efficiency of our distribution activities,
based on advanced technology-based supply chain
strategies that ensure our vehicles carry full loads to
reduce the number of journeys made and travel the
shortest possible distance. McBride plc Annual report 2004 15 McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 15
Compliance
Legal compliance on product safety and labelling
No non-compliances with regulations concerning customer health and
safety were identified during the year . No fines or penalties were incurred.
Voluntary Codes of Practice, product labels or awards
A voluntary agreement between the detergent industry and the European
Commission in 1989 on labelling of detergents and cleaning products
(89/542/EEC) has been followed on all affected products as if it were
legislation. Banded information on the presence of certain types of
ingredient is given on the product label to help consumers make informed
purchasing decisions. This agreement has now been incorporated into the
new Detergent Regulations published by the EU in 2004. Work is already
underway to implement the changes introduced by the new regulations 
in time for the October 2005 enforcement date.
In the UK, a government publication ‘The Green Claims Code’ is also
respected. It requires that all environmental claims for products are specific,
supportable, relevant and not misleading to the consumer .
The European T rade Association for soap, detergents and cleaning products,
A.I.S.E., is in the course of finalising a second voluntary code for its members
(the first was the Code of Good Environmental Practice which concluded 
in 2002-03). The A.I.S.E. Sustainable Development Charter incorporates
projects on sustainable design (product safety assurance and consumer
product information) and sustainable use. McBride staff are active in the
production of this charter and will implement its requirements once it is fully
launched. One aspect incorporated into the product safety element of the
Charter is the joint A.I.S.E./CEFIC HERA initiative (Human and Environmental
Risk Assessment), which has been active for several years. Again, McBride
has contributed resources to the work of this important project, which aims
to conduct risk assessments on the use of all key materials in detergent and
cleaning products and make them available to the public via the internet.
Many materials are already assessed, peer-reviewed and publicly accessible.
Safety impacts
Human safety is assessed for all household products under the requirements
of the revised Dangerous Preparations Directive (99/45/EC) and for personal
care products under the Cosmetic Products Directive (76/768/EEC and
amendments). Products involving risks to human safety will not be sold.
Raw materials and novel delivery systems are also assessed. This is
especially the case for air care products which can present new problems
and possibilities for increased human and accidental exposure. Safety
assessments cover these aspects as well as conventional toxicity calculations.
While we make every effort to ensure that our products are legally compliant,
we are aware that safety is also about the perceptions of our consumers and
the organisations that advise and inform the public. We therefore monitor
issues raised by organisations such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and
consumer groups, and respond to their concerns wherever possible. 
Environmental impacts
Environmental impacts are assessed for all household products under the
requirements of the revised Dangerous Preparations Directive (99/45/EC).
Products involving excessive risks to the environment will not be sold.
While we do our best to minimise the environmental impacts of our
manufacturing operations, we are also aware that our products continue 
to have environmental impact after leaving our factories. 
Emissions to Water
The majority of our products end up in the aquatic environment via the
drainage system following use in the kitchen or bathroom. In each case the
individual product is assessed for its impact using the Dangerous Preparations
Directive for identifying environmental hazards to the aquatic environment,
and the product labelled accordingly . Surfactants, the major ingredients, 
are biodegradable and meet at least the legal standards, but most are
significantly more biodegradable than legally required. These standards 
are about to change with the introduction of the European Detergent
Regulations 2004, which impose higher limits. We have already checked
that our suppliers can meet the new requirements.
For other ingredients, we ensure that use of poorly biodegradable organic
components is kept to the minimum possible for product effectiveness 
and replaced whenever more biodegradable alternatives become available.
Emissions to air
While the major impact of our products is on water , we also have emissions to
air from aerosols and in the form of volatile components such as perfumes.
This is an area less well developed in the regulations than toxicity to the
aquatic environment.
Emissions to land
Packaging waste in landfill sites is a major problem in the UK, with landfill
sites becoming scarce and costs for disposal increasing. This gives extra
impetus to the need to reduce packaging wherever possible and to use
recycled material. Work continues to minimise impacts while maintaining
containers which safely hold the product for its lifetime.
Resource use
Consumer products use up the earth’ s resources by their very nature, in
chemicals, packaging, and energy for manufacture and transport. In the
development of new products, significant improvements have been made 
in reduction of inorganic excipients in laundry products.
Since 1997, the volume of chemicals used in laundry products has been
reduced – by 23% in the case of powders and 12% in tablets. More
advanced formulations, including enzymes that enable stain removal 
at lower temperatures – typically 40°C rather than 60 or even 90 – are
reducing the energy consumed in each wash to lower the use of raw
materials and control emissions again conserving resources.
The nature of many of our products means they enter
the aquatic environment following consumer use in 
the kitchen or bathroom. We therefore ensure that their
major ingredients, surfactants, are significantly more
biodegradable than required by existing legislation 
and that they can meet the more rigorous standards
due to be introduced in the European Detergent
Regulations 2004. McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 16
At all sites, dialogue is maintained with the local community. In many
instances, where the community is very close to site boundaries, the contact
is regular and frequent, with problems discussed and resolved, and changes
notified and agreed. In all cases, complaints are logged, monitored and
action taken to address the issues. 
Permits are required for many sites in order to continue manufacturing 
under national legislation. When applications are made for permits, impact 
on the surrounding area, including the community , is considered. Any adverse
impact would result in refusal of the permit or conditions to remove or
reduce the impact.
While the Company actively considers the impact of its operations on the
surrounding community it also has many initiatives which aim to contribute
positively to the local area wherever possible. Apart from being a significant
employer , we also support economic regeneration, give advice to smaller
companies, support local community and educational initiatives, and give
financial assistance to community efforts and local charities. Examples of
activities include:
• Giving health and safety advice under the good neighbour scheme.
• Providing extensive work experience placements for students in both 
the UK and overseas.
• Providing interview training and practice for students.
• Advising local schools on careers.
• Arranging projects with local schools. This has included a project where 
a local school used waste materials to construct a large mural, which now
hangs in the Information Systems Department in Middleton. The pupils
who worked on this project also received small recognition items for their
work and the school received a cash donation.
• Central promotion of the introduction of literacy and numeracy classes 
for staff needing assistance, throughout the whole Company .
• Gifts of product to support local fundraising events.
We provide the independent Chair of the Rochdale ‘Children Schools 
and Families’ Partnership set up under the Government White Paper, 
‘Every Child Matters’. This Partnership is developing new and innovative
approaches to integrated child welfare, and is a key part of the Local
Authority strategy. 
T wo members of staff are Board members of the unique Real Deal, 
a not-for-profit community employment agency based in Manchester 
that seeks real jobs for local people.
We also have a board member of the Rochdale Borough Chamber , and 
of the Rochdale Development Agency , providing specific personnel and
organisational advice. We have a member of the fundraising committee 
for Springhill, a local hospice in Rochdale, and we sponsor this body in its
efforts to raise funds. We have a governor on the board of a local nursery 
in Rochdale, which has successfully defended itself against closure. 
We support the Interface programme at the three Manchester universities 
to assist ethnic minorities into employment.
We provide eight bursaries and three scholarships to Salford University students
who combine high academic abilities with financial need, complementing
this support with work placements at McBride. Those children of employees
who continue their studies beyond the age of 18 are also eligible for bursaries
under a scheme that alternates each year between our business on mainland
Europe and in the UK.
The company is sponsor of the Rochdale Childer Scheme, to recognise
special achievement by otherwise disadvantaged primary school pupils. 
The scheme involves financial sponsorship and a connection with the 
school to offer other support where requested. We continue to sponsor 
the Middleton Festival.
Staff are active in raising money for charities throughout the organisation,
with financial and publicity support being provided by the company to help 
a wide range of activities across Europe and the UK.
SOCIETY AND COMMUNITY
Our Childcare scheme, which we run in partnership 
with Rochdale Council, provides employees with advice
and support on any kind of childcare issue, as well as a
subsidised play scheme through a number of nurseries
during the school holidays. A national award winner ,
it is widely recognised as an example of best practice.
This scheme was also used to organise a Christmas
card competition for children of employees, with prizes
in age categories and the winning designs used on the
cards we sent to our customers and contacts also
advertising the Childcare scheme. McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 17
Charitable support
For the past three years McBride UK has been donating redundant products
to the annual aid trips organised by Communication Workers Union
Humanitarian Aid (CWUHA, registered Charity Number 1078312). They
have been making aid trips as a charity since 1995 and have helped people
in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Croatia and lately Moldova. Their work
has been recognised in the European Parliament and by UK government.
This charity works very closely with Everychild and has been instrumental in
getting adoption introduced into Moldova, as previously children were
commonly abandoned. 
An aid convoy sets off in September each year and usually takes just 
under three weeks to get there and back. The convoy usually consists 
of ten 7.5 tonne post office lorries, each filled with aid for hospitals, mother
and children centres, social assistance centres and reception and allocation
centres. The convoy that went last year included incubators, ECG machine,
an operating table, wheel chairs, nappies, syringes, washing powder , bleach,
washing up liquids, food, clothes, surgical gloves, bedding, beds, paper ,
crayons, freezers and teddies. McBride has donated products to the convoy
for the past three years.
In September 2004, one of our employees, Ian Sykes from Middleton, will
be driving a vehicle in this year’ s convoy to T ransnistria. The vehicle will be 
full of McBride products – washing powders, bleaches, washing up liquids,
shower gels, shampoo, toothpaste and deodorants. 
As well as giving stock to CWUHA, we also donate to other charities such as
a hospice in Rochdale, a woman's refuge in Burnley and a charity 
in Bradford that helps with under-privileged children.
McBride CE has provided support locally to the kidney department of 
Heilig Hart Ziekenhuis Roeselare in Belgium and has provided support for
Capusude Campre and Zimbru Romania, Russia Child Aid and Guatemala
Viviron En Amor . Rosporden has contributed to its twin village in Guinea
Bissau. The Company also provides household products for local charities
and social benefit organisations such as Poverelo in Belgium.
Children Challenging Industry
Schools in Bradford in West Y orkshire participate in a scheme called Children
Challenging Industry , in which Y ear 5 and 6 (10 to 12 year-olds) students
study topics including plastics, colour and water . Five classes of 30 children
have visited our blow-moulding, manufacturing, filling and laboratory
facilities. This participation was an important factor in our receipt of an
award from the Bradford Education Business Partnerships for an outstanding
contribution to linking education and business This work is sponsored by the
Chemical Industry through Y ork University .
Working together
In Ieper one employee is a board member of a local technical school 
as well as being on the steering committee of T echnon, a two yearly event
aimed at bringing industry and education closer together .
T o encourage continued best practice in Health & Safety , we sponsor an
annual award for the best student project at the Manchester College of 
Arts & T echnology . This year’ s winner was Marc Wilacy , Health & Safety Officer
at Y our Communication Ltd for his study of the Health & Safety culture at 
a medium-sized telecommunications company .
The Earth Centre Challenge
In March, a group of McBride managers and supervisors attended a 
team-building exercise at the Earth Centre near Doncaster – a visitor
attraction and educational centre where people learn about environmental
awareness and sustainability. Exercises to promote and test ingenuity
included negotiating a complex obstacle course carrying water , building 
a shelter for public use and creating an interactive attraction replicating 
the planet’ s water cycle. McBride plc Sustainability Report 2004 18

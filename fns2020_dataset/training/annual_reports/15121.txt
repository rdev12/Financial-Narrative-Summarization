2 Chairman’s statement
for the year ended 31 May 2008
In the 12 months to 31 May 2009 the Company achieved a number of strategic and operating milestones
although this was against the background of a severe global recession and a sustained reduction of output within
the automotive industry. The key milestones were:
● The award of a multi-year contract with Mov’it GmbH, a leading supplier of high performance brake systems
within the European aftermarket, which is forecast to yield revenues of £300,000 to £400,000 per annum in
future years.
● ISO 9001 qualification. 
● Completion of the CVIST manufacturing project which provides the capability of the carbon infiltration of
discs in house and contributes to the reduction in manufacturing costs of approximately 20% for an
automotive brake disc.
● A further £100,000 contract from MBDA the European leader in missile and rocket technology.
There were disappointments as well and these resulted from the very sharp decline in business confidence during
the final months of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. In February 2009, we signalled that the Company’s
revenues for the full year would fall short of the market expectations that were set in August 2008 and that the
principal cause of the revenue reduction was a prospective fall in orders from our automotive customers. The
Company has now met its revised expectations for revenues and operating losses for the full year. Business in
the year was considerably higher than budget from the aerospace and defence market sectors and this provides
the Company with a platform for growth despite the continued low levels of business expected from the
automotive sector during the remainder of 2009 and most of 2010.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
In the 12 months to 31 May 2009, revenue was £679,284 (2008: £508,111). This represents an increase of 34%
over the prior year.
At 31 May the Order Book, representing confirmed orders, was £166,370 (2008: £302,124). The reduction in
the order book level over the period is mainly due to the reduction in business from the automotive sector,
however, the Order Book had grown to £308,108 by 5 August 2009. The Order Book does not reflect orders not
yet placed with regards to the annual, multi-year supply contracts the Company has signed during 2008 with
MBDA for rocket components; for carbon-ceramic brake automotive discs with Mov’it or for the supply of carbon
brake discs with a leading European brake systems group.
Losses after taxation for the 12 month period were £840,740 (2008: £594,065). These include a non cash charge
of £94,424 (2008: £56,609) relating to share based payments under IFRS 20.
Earnings per share for the year was a loss of 4.42p (2008: 3.33p).
Capital Expenditure in the period was £71,428 (2008: £142,599).
The Company had a Cash balance of £404,275 (2008: £1,112,719) at 31 May 2009 and it has no borrowings.
Shareholder Funds at 31 May 2009 were £1,026,523 (2008: £1,722,839).

DEVELOPMENTS
The Company has progressed sufficiently far in the application of its technology that it now has a number of
global based customers operating in each of its main end user markets: Aerospace & Defence; High Performance
Automotive and the Automotive Race Market.
A number of these clients are either evaluating the Company’s technology for license or are purchasing brake
discs or rocket components for their development programmes or for commercial use. 
To facilitate the management of the operations and to ensure its core Intellectual Property (IP) is fully protected,
the Company has created four wholly owned operating subsidiaries. The IP and the management is held within
the Group plc company and the technology is licensed down to each subsidiary. This means that Licensing 
and Commercial supply agreements within each subsidiary are kept separate and the Group can now consider
the sale of one or more of its subsidiaries should the opportunity arise. The new Group structure commenced 
1 June 2009.
PEOPLE
Mr. Julio Faria, one of the founder directors, left the board during December 2008 and now has sold the majority
of his shareholding in the Company. We wish him well for the future.
OUTLOOK
The Group is focussed on achieving new business wins in the aerospace and defence markets whilst it recognises
that business from the automotive brake sector will remain subdued until well into the second half of 2010. The
Chief Executive’s report describes the opportunities in each of the main user markets and there is good reason
to be confident that we shall report improved results in the 2010 financial year.
Management has reduced the overhead base by an estimated £200,000 p.a going forward and the Company has
received initial notice from the DTI that it has been awarded another multi year development grant which will
reduce overheads further and improve cash flows.
The Company secured a fundraising of £410,000 net of expenses during July 2009. The issue of 4,516,580 new
ordinary shares at 10 pence per share will take place on 13 August 2009. This will be used to assist with working
capital needs over the next 24 months.
Whilst forecasting accurately can be difficult in these economic conditions, the board is cautiously optimistic
that it can increase business revenues and reduce losses in the 2010 financial year ending 31 May 2010 and
work towards breaking even in cash terms.

4 Chief executive’s report
for the year ended 31 May 2008
AUTOMOTIVE
High performance and Race car brake systems
Following the sharp economic decline within the automotive market, income from the automotive sector has
remained steady year on year with growth in overall turnover being achieved in other areas, as described below.
As a result, sales to automotive customers represented 65% of total turnover compared to 84% in 2008.
The Company has three main automotive contracts:
● Supply of ceramic discs to Mov’it GMBH – a leading European aftermarket brake system supplier. 
● Supply of carbon fibre brake discs to a global automotive brake system supplier.
● Supply of ceramic discs to Koenigsegg Automotive – supplier of high performance super cars.
Sales to Koenigsegg have remained strong; however revenue from the other two contracts, both with forecasted
annual revenues of £300,000-£400,000, has been significantly below the company’s initial expectations in 
July 2008. 
The Company recognises that trading conditions for the Company’s current automotive contracts will remain
difficult well into 2010. 
In addition to the Company’s existing contracts the Company continues to work to bring in new business,
receiving new orders from a US brake system supplier which has won the contract to supply approximately 20
prototype vehicles for the next generation of US military transport vehicle.
AEROSPACE
The company continues to work on development programmes with two aircraft brake system suppliers.
Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems (MABS) has been and remains a key partner of the £1.34 million, three year
collaborative R&D project funded by the UK Technology Strategy Board (formerly the DTI). This project is being
led by Surface Transforms.
The second development programme is with a US brake system supplier that supplies both commercial and
military aircraft principally in US markets. The Company and the customer are pleased with both the pace of
development and the technical advances made during the last 12 months, with the Company progressing
through a number of key technical milestones. 
It is always very difficult to predict the adoption of new technologies and the aerospace market is no different.
The Company expects the development programme with the US supplier to continue to progress, with the focus
on the development and commercialisation of the company’s proprietary carbon ceramic technology.
DEFENCE
Rocket Components
Surface Transforms carbon ceramic technology is uniquely positioned to deliver affordable, high performance (in
terms of extended life and reduced mass) rocket components.
During the last 12 months the company has seen the level of interest increase significantly, with the defence
sector providing more than 25% of the group’s revenues during the financial year. 
We have successfully completed year one of a three year development programme with MBDA, a world leading
missile manufacturer jointly owned by BAe Systems, EADS and Finmeccanica. The £150,000 contract of over
three years generated some positive results and lead to additional revenues from MBDA including an additional
contract in excess of £100,000 to further investigate and accelerate the development. We are also pleased that
the company has been officially awarded the year two contract with MBDA and continues to work closely with
MBDA who recognise the potential for the carbon ceramic technology and are focused on the development of
the material for use in its range of products. 
Surface Transforms plc

5 Chief executive’s report
continued
The company has signed a new contract for £75,000 over 3 years with the UK MoD (Ministry of Defence). The
programme although small is strategically important to the MoD with Surface Transforms technology offering the
potential of affordable, high performing ceramic composite components for the future. 
In addition the award of a £200,000, 2 year development contract with Microturbo, a world leading turbojet
engine manufacturer, for the development of carbon ceramic components for turbojet engines further recognises
the potential for use of the materials in demanding environments which require affordable solutions.
The company expects the defence sector to continue to make a significant contribution to the group revenues
going forward.
OPERATIONS
Affordability is a key requirement for all of our chosen markets, particularly with the current economic pressures
the world is facing. The development and commissioning of CVIST, the carbon vapour infiltration process plant
has been completed and has reduced the cost to manufacture a ceramic brake disc by 20%.
The operations team successfully achieved ISO 9001 accreditation in September 2008. An important milestone
for the business in terms of continuous improvements and a prerequisite to truly operating in our chosen market. 
In the autumn of 2008 the management recognised the change in trading conditions in the automotive sector
and took steps to reduce its operational cost base by £200,000. The savings came from two areas. Some non-
recurring costs associated with achieving ISO accreditation and bringing the CVIST plant online as well as a
reduction in production resources to reflect the reduced demand in two of our main automotive contracts.
PEOPLE
The company has a strong senior management team who have shown tremendous commitment and maturity
during the last 12 months.
The blend of skills, experience and determination within the team means we are well placed to continue the
good progress made to date.
I would like to thank all my colleagues for their dedication over the past year.

6 Directors’ report
for the year ended 31 May 2008
The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2009.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
The principal activity of the Company during the year was the development and manufacture of carbon fibre
reinforced ceramic products (CFRC) for aircraft brake, automotive brake and rocket component applications.
BUSINESS REVIEW
A review of the Company’s activities during the year is dealt with in the financial review section of the
Chairman’s statement on pages 3 and 4.
KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
As in previous years the principal risk faced by the Company is considered to be the speed at which our
customers and potential customers adopt the new ceramic disc technology. Indications in the automotive area
are that the technology continues to be well received and is being adopted over an increasing number of
vehicles. This risk is constantly assessed by monitoring the level of enquiries and orders for both the Company
and industry wide. In addition the Company faces the continuing uncertainty created by the current economic
climate, particularly within the automotive sector.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Directors continue to monitor the business internally with a number of performance indicators: order intake,
sales output, profitability and manufacturing cost of automotive discs. The company has met its revised
performance targets in each of these areas – please see Chairman’s report for more details:
● Turnover £679,284 (2008: £508,111)
● Losses after taxation £840,740 (2008: £594,065) 
● Order Book of £166,370 (as at 31 May 2009)
● Completion of the CVIST process for carbon infiltration so reducing the unit cost of an automotive disc by
20 per cent.
The Company produces an annual business plan and full monthly forecasts detailing sales, profitability and cash
flow to help monitor business performance going forward.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
The Board aims to continue with its corporate strategy which is to exploit its technologies in carbon fibre
reinforced ceramics by:
● establishing contract development opportunities and collaborations with national and multi-national
customers in the aerospace and automotive industries; and 
● expanding commercial sales of CFRC products.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The majority of the Company’s staff are employed in research activities which are concentrated on the ongoing
identification of new products and applications for carbon fibre reinforced ceramic friction and non-friction
materials. 
PROPOSED DIVIDEND AND TRANSFER TO RESERVES
The loss for the year after taxation amounted to £840,740 (2008: £594,065). The directors do not recommend
the payment of a dividend.

11 Statement of directors’ responsibilities
in respect of the annual report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the Annual Report in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable
law.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that
period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
● make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
● state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
● prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain
the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information
included on the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of

17 Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 May 2009
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Surface Transforms plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the EU.
The financial statements were approved by the board on 12 August 2009.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and
under the historical cost convention, as modified for financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the
income statement.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these financial statements.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which the directors believe to be
appropriate. The Company incurred a net loss of £840,740 during the year however the directors are
satisfied, based on detailed cash flow projections, that sufficient cash is available to meet the Company’s
needs as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of signing the accounts. Revenues are expected
to continue to increase in the coming years resulting in the company becoming profitable in due course.
In addition the Company has secured a fundraising of £410,000 net of expenses during July 2009. The issue
of new ordinary shares at 10 pence per share will take place on 13 August 2009.
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect future development,
performance and position are set out in the Chairman’s statement on pages 3 and 4 and the Director’s report
on pages 7 to 9. In addition, note 19 to the financial statements includes the group’s objectives, policies
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial
instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The directors believe that the group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the
current uncertain economic outlook. After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Company and has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and
accounts.
Share based payments
The share option programme allows employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value is
measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model,
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is
only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Intangible assets and amortisation
Expenditure on patents is capitalised and amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over the useful
economic life of seven and a half years.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for
as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Leases in which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased
asset are classified as finance leases. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount
equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of
the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses. Lease payments are
accounted for as described below.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of
each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives
are as follows:
Plant and machinery – 12.5%-20% per annum
Fixtures and fittings – 15% per annum
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum
Leasehold improvements – Over life of lease
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the
functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on
translation are included in the income statement.
Leases
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part
of the total lease expense.
Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding
liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Government grants
Revenue grants are credited to the profit and loss account, and included within other operating income, so
as to match them with expenditure to which they relate.
Post retirement benefits
The Company does not operate a pension scheme, but does contribute to specific employees’ personal
pension schemes. The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable
to employees personal pension schemes during the accounting year.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible and the Company intends and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to
complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Company can measure reliably
the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. No research costs met the
criteria for capitalisation in the current or preceding years.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In determining the cost of raw materials
and consumables the purchase price is used. For work in progress, cost is taken as production cost, which
includes an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred or
accelerated arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of certain items for taxation
and for accounting purposes. 
Deferred taxation is provided for in full at the tax rate which is expected to apply to the period when the
deferred taxation is expected to be realised, including on tax losses carried forward. 
Deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Research and development tax credits are recognised on a cash received basis as a reduction in the current
tax payable as this is when the tax credit is considered recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits
repayable on demand.
New standards and interpretations that have been endorsed, but which are not yet effective and not early
adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year
ended 31 May 2009 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements:
New standards relevant to the Company
IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” introduces the “management approach” to segment reporting. IFRS 8, which
becomes mandatory for the Company’s 2010 financial statements, will require the disclosure of segment
information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Company’s Chief Operating Decision
Maker in order to assess each segment’s performance and to allocate resources to them. Currently the
Company considers revenues to be generated via a single business segment (see Note 2).
Amended standards relevant to the Company
Revised IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” (2007) introduces the term total comprehensive
income, which represents changes in equity during a period other than those changes resulting from
transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. Total comprehensive income may be presented in
either a single statement of comprehensive income (effectively combining both the income statement and
all non-owner changes in equity in a single statement), or in an income statement and a separate statement
of comprehensive income. Revised IAS 1, which becomes mandatory for the Company’s 2010 financial
statements, is expected to have a significant impact on the presentation of the financial statements. The
Company plans to provide total comprehensive income in a single statement of comprehensive income for
its 2010 financial statements.
Amendment to IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations” clarifies the
definition of vesting conditions; introduces the concept of non-vesting conditions; requires non-vesting
conditions to be reflected in grant-date fair value; and provides the accounting treatment for non-vesting
conditions and cancellations. The amendments to IFRS 2 will become mandatory for the Company’s 2010
financial statements, with retrospective application and is not expected to have a significant impact on the
financial statements.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Revenue
Revenue comprises income derived from the supply of carbon fibre structures and carbon fibre reinforced
ceramic products. Revenue is recognised on transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards of
ownership, generally this will be when goods are despatched to the customer. Turnover excludes value
added taxes.
Contractual arrangements exist with specific customers which set selling prices and target volumes for
future periods. The revenue derived from specific purchase orders raised against these contracts is
recognised in a consistent manner to that described above.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other
receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest rate risk
The Company finances its operations through cash. Cash resources are invested to attract the highest rates
for periods that do not limit access to these resources.
Liquidity risk
With regard to liquidity, the Company’s policy has throughout the year been to ensure that the Company is
able at all times to meet its financial liabilities as and when they fall due.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not already apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The
estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying
amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable.
Provision to write inventories down to net realisable value
The Company makes provisions for obsolescence based on historical experiences and management
estimates of future events. Actual outcome could vary significantly from these estimates.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Research and development expenditure
The board considers the definitions of research and development costs as outlined in IAS 38: Intangible
assets when determining the correct treatment of costs incurred. Where such expenditure is technically and
commercially feasible, the Company intends and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to
complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Company can measure reliably
the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset it is treated as development expenditure and capitalised
on the balance sheet.
In considering whether an item of expenditure meets these criteria, the Board applies judgement. During
the year all such expenditure has been expensed to the income statement on the grounds that it relates to
feasibility studies to identify new applications for the technology or methods of improving the production
process. As the technical feasibility of this work is unknown at the time the costs are incurred, none meet
the criteria for capitalisation during the current or previous year.
2 ANALYSIS OF TURNOVER
Revenue and loss on ordinary activities before taxation is wholly attributable to the principal activity of the
Company, namely the development and manufacture of reinforced ceramic products. As all products are
similar in nature and are manufactured using a single production facility, the board have reassessed the
segmental breakdown of the business during the year and consider that all revenue falls under a single
business segment as defined by IAS 14.
The following additional information is presented solely to assist the reader in understanding the
performance of the Company in the year.
Revenue by type of end user is analysed as follows:
2009 2008
££
Automotive 241,157 345,464
Defence and aerospace 236,279 83,798
Automotive Racing 201,848 78,850
679,284 508,111
All sales are serviced by a single production facility. As such, net assets, liabilities, additions to property,
plant and equipment, loss before tax and depreciation cannot be attributed to specific categories.
Revenue by geographical destination is analysed as follows:
2009 2008
££
By geographical market: 
United Kingdom 296,821 138,074
Rest of Europe 375,365 353,964

relating principally to tax losses which the company can offset against future taxable profits from the same
trade.
The deferred tax asset has not been recognised in the accounts because it is not possible to assess whether
there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences
can be deducted.

17 RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES
The results of the Company include no material transactions with related parties in the current or preceding
year.
18 LOSS ON ORDINARY SHARES
The calculation of basic loss per ordinary share is based on the loss for the financial year divided by the
weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Losses and number of shares used in the calculations of loss per ordinary share are set out below:
Basic 2009 2008
££
Loss after tax (840,740) (594,065)
Weighted average number of shares 19,030,748 17,828,562
Loss per share (4.42p) (3.33p)
The calculation of diluted loss per ordinary share is identical to that used for the basic loss per ordinary
share. This is because the exercise of options would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share
from continuing operations and is therefore not dilutive under the terms of IAS33.
19 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company’s policies with regard to financial instruments are set out within the accounting policies note.
The risks arising from the Company’s financial assets and liabilities are set out below with the policies for

A ten percent weakening of the pound against the US Dollar and the Euro at 31 May 2009 would have an
equal and opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis all other variables remain constant. 
Price Risk
The Company aims to minimise its exposure to supplier price increases and customer price decreases by
offsetting reciprocal supplier and customer arrangements.
Credit Risk
The Company operates a closely monitored collection policy.

Assumptions used in the valuation of share based options
In calculating the fair value of the share based payment arrangements the Company has used the Black
Scholes method. The fair value of the share options granted in 2009 and the assumptions used of their fair
value on the date of grant were as follows:
Weighted Average Assumptions 2009 2008
Fair Value per share option 14.83p n/a*
Share price on date of grant 18.42p n/a*
Exercise Price 18.42p n/a*
Share options granted in the year EMI 1,344,527 n/a*
Share options granted in the year Unapproved 276,438 n/a*
Expected Volatility 100% n/a*
Exercise Pattern (years) 3-10 years uniformly n/a*
Expected dividend yields 0% n/a*
Risk free rate of return 5% n/a*
*No share options were granted in the year to 31 May 2008
The fair value of the share options is applied to the number of options that are expected to vest which takes
into account the expected and actual forfeitures over the vesting period as a result of cessation of
employment.
Expected volatility was determined by assessing the Company’s historic data and the market the Company
operates in.

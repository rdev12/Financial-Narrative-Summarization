CRAIG MAYO
factory manager
Craig has been with the Company
since it was formed in 1994.
During this time Craig has been
promoted to Section Leader, Shift
Manager, Production Manager and
most recently to Factory Manager
at the Shadsworth Bakery.
05 chairman’s statement It is with great pleasure that we are
presenting our fifth successive record
turnover, profit and earnings per share
since becoming a public company in
August 1998 and further progress towards
our objective of becoming the second
largest cake supplier in the UK. This is
a particularly notable achievement
considering the range of raw material price
increases which affected the input costs of
food manufacturers during the year. The
key highlights this year have been:
❖ Turnover and operating profit each
growing by 35%, underlining our
continuing growth in market share.
❖ Organic growth is nearly three times
greater than the increase in overall
market.
❖ The first full year of Soreen (2003: 3
months) which has delivered
improved profits and has enhanced
the Group’s profile with its customer
base.
❖ In January 2004 we completed the
acquisition of Farmhouse Bakery
Holdings Limited (‘Hoppers’) which
manufactures high quality cakes,
with a particular emphasis on
Christmas products. Since
acquisition, sales volumes have built
strongly.
❖ All our businesses have responded
positively to the impact of increased
raw material prices which affected
the food industry.
❖ The winning of the Disney licence for
small cakes reflects our growing
reputation in the marketing of
licensed products.
❖ Our continuing focus on and
success in product innovation is of
increasing importance in a
competitive marketplace.
Results
Turnover increased by 35.4% to £69.6
million (2003: £51.4million). Profit before
tax, excluding amortisation of goodwill,
increased 35.6% to £5.0 million (2003:
£3.7million) and adjusted earning per
share increased 7.6% to 38.2p (2003:
35.5p). Profit before tax increased 30% to
£3.9 million (2003: £3.0million) and basic
earnings per share increased 4.6% to
27.5p (2003: 26.3p).
Following the purchase of Hoppers for £5
million and capital expenditure throughout
the Group, the Group had net debt of
£19.8 million as at 7 May 2004 (2003:
£12.0 million) excluding any contingent
consideration, resulting in gearing of 94%
(2003: 64%).
Your Board is pleased to propose a final
dividend of 3.7p (2003: 3.3p) per share
making a total for the year of 5.55p
(2003: 5p). Subject to approval at the
Annual General Meeting, the final dividend
will be paid on 17 September 2004 to
those shareholders on the register at 20
August 2004.
Strategy
The Board has a stated objective of
becoming the number two supplier in the
UK cake market and the number one
private label supplier. This objective will
only be achieved by continued organic
growth through a combination of product
development, sector expertise and strong
customer relations, all of which are at the
heart of the Inter Link culture. As in the
past, this will be combined with well
targeted acquisitions.
Our objective of being the number two
supplier must be combined with the
generation of higher levels of profit. We
will endeavour to achieve this by
systematically reducing our manufacturing
costs through a combination of improved
buying of raw materials and packaging,
earnings enhancing capital expenditure
projects and strong manufacturing
controls. The improved operating margins
this year are evidence of our success in
this area. 
Trading
During the year our sales growth
excluding our last two acquisitions,
Soreen Limited and Farmhouse Bakery
Holdings Limited, has increased by 11%
which is tangible evidence of our ability to
achieve organic growth well above the
increase in the market overall.
In addition to this organic growth, the
Board has an excellent record of
acquiring and successfully integrating
complementary businesses. In January
2004 the Group acquired Hoppers, which
manufactures a range of cakes with a
strong emphasis on Christmas lines,
particularly mince pies. The acquisition of
Hoppers has enabled the Group to gain a
foothold in the significant Christmas
market for cake products, particularly
premium mince pies. This company has
historic sales of £12.5 million and also
has strong growth opportunities.
Staff
We continue to strengthen the
management teams by bringing in new
skills to the Group and are delighted to
report that internal promotions have filled
two senior management posts at factory
level. All our employees have worked
hard, with the commitment and team spirit
essential to produce the excellent results
announced today.
Prospects
The Group continues to win opportunities
to strengthen its business with its major
customers. Significant increased demand
for Hoppers' Christmas products has
required the investment at Shadsworth
Bakery, Blackburn in one of the most
automated and efficient production lines
in Europe. This will be making products
from September 2004.
Since the year end we have launched 3
new lines under the Disney brand and 24
under private label and we are very
encouraged by initial sales. Our factories
have been exceptionally busy and in the
first eight weeks sales show 16% growth
like for like and 31.2% including Hoppers.
This provides us with considerable
confidence for the year ahead.
Jeremy Hamer
Chairman

06 Strategy
In order to achieve strategic objectives,
and to be in the best position to meet
the changing needs of the consumer, we
have continued in our quest to grow
organically and consolidate our position
through acquisition. With nine successful
acquisitions since our formation in 1994,
we have significantly raised the profile of
the Group and our reputation with
customers, and created a strong,
balanced portfolio of private label,
branded and licensed products,
supporting our aim of becoming a
supplier of increasing importance to the
major retailers, wholesalers and
independents.
The Market
(TNS data 52 w/e 28 March 2004) 
The total cake market (ambient and
chilled) is showing steady growth in
value terms of 3.8%. This growth has
been driven by an increase in average
price and a shift towards premium
products within the market, thus
heightening our focus on improving
product quality and added value. In-
store Bakery goods represent 14.3% of
the ambient cake market in value terms
and this too has seen 6% growth year
on year. Healthy cakes now account for
2.4% of the ambient cake market and
this sector is growing rapidly at 18.5%
year on year. In a congested
marketplace, innovation has become the
key to achieving growth, with the private
label sector outperforming most brands
in value terms. This year, the Group
Innovations Team has continued to work
closely with key retailers to develop new
and exciting private label ranges.
Sales
The Group has seen excellent results
this year, with turnover increasing by
35.4% to £69.6m (from £51.4m in
2003). Double-digit organic sales growth
of 11% complements the success of
Hoppers and Soreen. By continuing to
focus all our commercial efforts on the
cake sector, and by supporting and
developing our 8 bakeries, we will
continue to provide the manufacturing
expertise within the sector that our wide
customer base demands.
Acquisition Update
In January 2004 we were pleased to
announce the purchase of “Hoppers”,
based in Herne Bay, Kent. An
established business, owned and
managed by 6 generations of the
Hopper family, the company has a well-
deserved reputation for the production of
high quality cakes with a strong
emphasis on Christmas lines, particularly
premium mince pies. The acquisition
was extremely well received by the
07 chief executive’s review “We have significantly raised the profile
of the group and our reputation, having created
a strong balanced portfolio of private label,
branded and licensed products.”

AMANDA SHERRATT
director of technical
services
Amanda joined Inter Link Foods
seven years ago. Amanda’s role
involves managing the technical
staff at each site to ensure that
food safety standards meet the
stringent requirements of the
Group and its customers.
08 trade, such that Hoppers products are
now in demand from most of the major
retailers and orders for mince pies this
Christmas are forecast at more than
double last year’s. Together with a
heightened focus on new product
development to counterbalance its
seasonal manufacturing bias, we are
confident that with the support of Inter
Link Foods, the business is now well
positioned to capitalise on its
considerable potential for further growth.
The acquisition of Soreen, producer of
the number one malt loaf brand, in
February 2003 has also helped to
deliver strong profits and provided the
Group with a significant foothold in the
branded arena. We are delighted with
the benefits that this purchase has
brought to the Group.
Operations
In operational terms, our continued focus
is to become an even lower cost
operator, by improving productivity,
efficiency, quality and value. As such, we
will continue to invest to achieve this
objective across the Group. In response
to the significant growth in demand for
Hoppers products, Shadsworth Bakery
in Blackburn is preparing to install one of
the most automated production lines in
Europe. This £2.6million investment will
be the Group’s largest capital project to
date exceeding in value four of our
acquisitions. It will allow the site to
produce quality products efficiently, at
more than double current levels of
output. Furthermore, additional
investment has been made at all our
Bakeries to improve productivity and
also to ensure quality is consistently
improving.
Summary
This year is the 10th anniversary of the
birth of the Company, so it is extremely
pleasing to be recognised as the “Most
Entrepreneurial Company” by our peers,
through the Entrepreneur Magazine
Awards. Since flotation in August 1998,
our sales have increased 709% from
£8.6million to £69.6million, and this
year’s profit before tax and amortisation
stands at £5 million, some twelve times
larger than six years ago just before
flotation. With the support of a
committed management team and a
successful growth model, Inter Link
Foods is in its strongest position yet to
achieve its strategic objectives, and I am
confident in our ability to achieve long-
term shareholder growth.

NEIL WATSON
mixing section leader
Neil has worked at Soreen Bakery
for over 30 years. During his time,
he has carried out many roles. Neil
said “Soreen is a much loved
British brand, since I joined the
business we have seen a great
deal of technological advancement
and many new products have
been added to the range. To this
day, there is no other company
that can make a malt loaf like
Soreen.”
10 Trading Results for the Year
The Group has achieved an increase in
sales of 35.4% to £69.6 million. Profit
before tax and goodwill amortisation is
£5million and profit before tax is £3.9
million, both of which are up over 30%.
Adjusted earnings per share has
increased by 7.6% to 38.2 pence,
whilst basic earnings per share has
increased by 4.6% to 27.5 pence. The
percentage increase in earnings per
share reflects the shares that were
issued in February 2003 increasing the
weighted average number of shares in
issue in the year.
The Group’s operating profit (excluding
the impact of goodwill amortisation) has
increased to 8.5% from 8.2% last year.
This is particularly encouraging as this
year has seen significant increases in
certain ingredient prices.
Working Capital
The Group’s working capital
requirement, excluding the impact of
Hoppers, has increased by £1.3 million
largely due to an increase in stocks of
£1.1 million. This reflects the increasing
product range, and the Group’s
purchasing policy for packaging and
fruit which is designed to lower costs.
The acquisition of Hoppers will have an
impact on our working capital pattern.
With the increased emphasis on
seasonal business the Group will have
a larger stock build from August to
October than previously experienced,
resulting in a peak working capital
requirement at the end of October.
Acquisition
The share capital of Hoppers was
acquired in January 2004 for £5 million.
The transaction was financed by new
loan facilities of £5.3 million.
Balance Sheet
The Group continues to strive to
reduce costs in all areas of the
business by investing in plant and
machinery. As a result, last year £3.3
million was invested across all facilities
in the Group. Projects included a new
in-store bakery line, and a continuous
mixing system. Net assets have
increased by £2.4 million generated by
retained profits and the proceeds from
shares issued on the exercise of
options by employees. Net debt has
increased by £7.8 million to £19.8
million as a result of the acquisition of
Hoppers and financing capital
expenditure. As a result, gearing has
increased to 94% (2003: 64%).
Interest 
The Group uses interest rate swaps to
provide protection against the expected
upward movement in interest rates. The
protection afforded by the use of
hedging instruments has resulted in the
Group’s financing costs being
marginally higher in the short term.
Interest cover is 5.2 times (2003: 6.2
times) as a result of the increase in
interest cost and the low contribution of
Hoppers, which traditionally produces
most of its profits in the second half of
the calendar year.

Corporate governance
The company has applied the principles of good governance contained in the
Combined Code as practical for a Group of this size.
Board committees
The Board of Directors
The company supports the concept of an effective Board leading and controlling
the Group. The Board is responsible for approving policy and strategy. It meets
monthly and has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision.
Management supply the Board with appropriate and timely information and the
directors are free to seek any further information they consider necessary.
13 directors’ report The Board consists of five executive
directors, who hold the key operational
positions in the Group, and two non-
executive directors who bring a breadth
of experience and knowledge, one of
whom is independent of management
and any business or other relationship
which could interfere with the exercise
of his independent judgement. The
composition of the Board provides a
balance whereby decision making
cannot be dominated by an individual
or small group.
Audit and remuneration committees
The audit and remuneration committees
of the Board are an important part of
our implementation of the principles of
good corporate governance as set out
in the Combined Code. The audit
committee, chaired by Mr J.J. Hamer,
is formally constituted with written terms
of reference and comprised the two
non-executive directors throughout the
reporting period. The executive
directors are not members of the
committee but the Finance Director
may be invited to attend its meetings.
The committee meets at least twice per
year. The external auditors will attend
for the whole of one meeting and they
have direct access to the non-
executive directors for independent
discussions without the presence of
executive directors.
The audit committee may examine any
matters relating to the financial affairs of
the Group. This includes reviews of the
annual accounts and announcements,
internal control procedures, accounting
policies, compliance with accounting
standards, the appointment of external
auditors and such other related
functions as the Board may require.
The remuneration committee comprised
the two non-executive directors
throughout the reporting period and is
chaired by Mr C.E. Davies. The
committee determines the remuneration
policies of the Group which include the
terms and conditions, including annual
remuneration and incentive awards, of
the executive directors.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors
have a reasonable expectation that the
Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason they
continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the accounts.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for
maintaining a sound system of internal
control to safeguard shareholders’
investment and the Group’s assets,
and for reviewing its effectiveness. The
system of internal control is designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives,
and can only provide reasonable and
not absolute assurance against material
loss and misstatement.
The control framework within the Group
is as follows:
❖ A strong culture of internal control
across all areas of operation.
❖ An organisational structure with
clearly defined lines of responsibility,
delegation of authority and reporting
requirements.
❖ Defined expenditure authorisation
limits.
Major commercial, technological and
financial risks are formally assessed
during the annual business planning
process, which takes place in the last
quarter of the financial year. There is a
formal schedule of matters requiring
authorisation by the Board including, for
example, major capital expenditure, and
new business initiatives.
There is a comprehensive system of
financial reporting. The annual budget,
which is derived from the business
plan, is reviewed in detail and approved
by the Board. The Finance Director
presents a report to the Board each
month detailing the results of each
principal business unit, variances
against budget and other performance
data.
The principal system for evaluating and
managing risk is the regular meeting of
the Board members with the
management of business units. The
purpose of the meetings is to monitor
and control operations. Performance is
reviewed, risks identified, financial and
other implications assessed and
corrective actions agreed as necessary.
Each month Board members present
the output of these meetings to the
Board for review.
The Board has considered the need for
an internal audit function but has
decided the size of the company does
not justify it at present.
14 Relations with shareholders
The Group values the views of its
shareholders and recognises their
interest in the Group’s strategy,
performance, Board membership and
quality of management. It therefore
holds regular meetings with its
institutional shareholders to discuss
objectives.
The AGM will be used to communicate
with private investors and they are
encouraged to participate. The
Chairman of each of the audit and
remuneration committees will be
available to answer questions. Separate
resolutions are proposed on each issue
so that they can be given proper
consideration and there is a resolution
to approve the annual report and
accounts. The Group counts all proxy
votes and will indicate the level of
proxies lodged on each resolution, after
it has been dealt with by a show of
hands.
The Group also has a website with links
providing financial information and press
releases. A welcome letter is issued to
all new shareholders registering in their
own name. Every effort is made to
speak or write to any shareholder
making an enquiry.
Share options and employee 
share ownership
Employee involvement in the overall
performance of the Group has been
encouraged by employee share option
schemes. An Inland Revenue approved
executive share option scheme (the
Approved Scheme) and an unapproved
executive share option scheme (the
Unapproved Scheme) were established
in 1998. Under each of the schemes,
directors and employees of the Group
may be offered options to acquire
ordinary shares, which will only be
granted on the achievement of
performance targets.
On 14 January 2004 a senior
employee was granted 3,398 options
under the Approved Scheme and
2,602 under the Unapproved Scheme.
The exercise price is 457.5 pence
and the exercise period is between
14 January 2007 and 13 January
2014. Details of directors
,
share
options are set out on page 18.
On 1 October 2003 options numbering
89,785 granted under the Savings
Related Share Option Scheme were
exercised by the respective directors
and employees. There are no
unexercised options under this
Scheme.
Employees
The Group has continued its practice of
keeping employees informed of matters
affecting them as employees and the
financial and economic factors affecting
the performance of the Group. This is
achieved through works council
meetings and newsletters.
Applications for employment by disabled
persons are given full and fair
consideration for all vacancies in
accordance with their particular aptitudes
and abilities. In the event of an employee
becoming disabled, every effort is made
to retrain them in order that their
employment with the Group may
continue.
It is the policy of the Group that training,
career development and promotion
opportunities should be available to all
employees.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy is to comply with
the terms of payment agreed with
suppliers when terms of business are
established. At 7 May 2004 the
Group’s trade creditors represented 
73 days of purchases (2003: 67 days).
The Group’s trade creditor days figure
is given as it is a more meaningful
measure.
Corporate social responsibility
The success of the Group to date
would not have been achieved without
the continued support of our workforce.
As such, we make every effort to
contribute to the well-being of the
communities in which we operate, by
becoming actively involved in a variety
of charitable initiatives. This year we
became corporate members of
“Business in the Community” (BITC), a
unique movement of over 700 of the
UK’s top organisations whose purpose
is to inspire, challenge, engage and
support the business sector in
continually improving its positive impact
on society.
15 directors’ report continued At the annual BITC Impact Conference
in March 2004, the Group volunteered
to become a mentor under the BITC
“Partners in Leadership” programme,
which has been designed to help guide
and encourage local community
enterprise. Since then, a number of our
employees have also volunteered and
participated in various BITC
programmes, offering their time and
skills within the communities in which
they live and work.
Charitable Support and political
donations
Throughout the year the Group
responds to hundreds of requests to
support a wide variety for fund-raising
initiatives on a local and national level.
Climbers, rowers, walkers, runners and
adventurers, school fetes, Scouts and
a variety of other groups have all
received our support mainly in the form
of product. We have also sponsored
several of our own employees who ran
in this year’s London Marathon. Finally,
at this year’s ‘Pride of East Lancashire
Business Awards’, we were delighted
to receive the ‘Company of the Year’
Award, sponsored by the Lancashire
Evening Telegraph. The award was
accompanied by a £2,000 prize, which
we chose to donate to two local
schools.
The charitable donations for the year
were £3,000 (2003: £nil) and there
were no political donations. (2003: £nil)
Directors’ responsibilities for the
financial statements
Company law requires the directors to
prepare financial statements for each
financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Group
and company and of the profit or loss
of  the Group for that year. In preparing
those statements, the directors are
required to:
a select suitable accounting policies
and apply them consistently;
b make judgements and estimates
that are reasonable and prudent;
c state whether applicable accounting
standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the
financial statements;
d prepare the financial statements on
the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the
Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and to enable
them to ensure that the Financial
Statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They have
general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them
to safeguard the assets of the Group
and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.
Auditors
Grant Thornton resigned as auditors on
15 April 2004. KPMG Audit Plc were
appointed to fill the casual vacancy
arising. KPMG Audit Plc have indicated
their willingness to continue as auditors
and offer themselves for reappointment
in accordance with Section 385 of the
Companies Act 1985.
By order of the Board
Christopher Neilson
Company Secretary
12 July 2004 
16 Introduction
The Board recognises that directors’
remuneration is of legitimate concern to
the shareholders and is committed to
following current best practice. The
company operates within a competitive
environment that is subject to rapid
commercial change. Its performance
depends on the individual contributions
of the directors and employees and it
believes in rewarding vision and
innovation.
The Board presents the Report on
Remuneration for shareholder approval.
Composition and function of the
remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises
both of the non-executive directors of
the Group. It considers all aspects of
the executive directors’ remuneration
and administers the Group’s share
option schemes. The Committee meets
twice a year. The Committee consults
the Chief Executive and has access to
professional advice both within and
outside the company.
17 report on directors’ remuneration
The remuneration of non-executive
directors is considered by the Board as
a whole following recommendations by
the executive directors.
Policy on executive directors’
remuneration
Executive remuneration packages are
designed to attract, motivate and retain
directors of the calibre necessary to
maintain the Group’s position as a
growing business. The performance
measurement of the executive directors
and the determination of their annual
remuneration package is undertaken by
the committee.
There are three main elements of their
remuneration package:
❖ basic annual salary
❖ annual bonus payments
❖ share option incentives
Each executive director’s basic salary is
reviewed annually by the committee. In
deciding upon appropriate levels of
remuneration the committee has regard
to rates of pay for similar jobs in
comparable companies as well as
internal factors such as the
achievement of strategic objectives,
improvement in operating efficiency and
overall Group performance. Executive
directors’ basic salaries were last
reviewed in May 2004.
The committee establishes the
objectives which must be met for a
cash bonus to be paid. The committee
believes that the award of any bonuses
should be tied to the interests of the
Group’s shareholders and that the
principal measure of those interests is
shareholder value, including growth in
earnings per share, net asset value and
share price. Account is also taken of
the relative success of the different
parts of the business for which the
executive directors are responsible. 
The bonus paid and provided during
the year recognises that the Group has
increased turnover, profit and earnings
per share in every year and the
additional activity involved in the
acquisition of Farmhouse Bakery
Holdings Limited.
Pension arrangements
Executive directors are eligible to be
members of the Group’s defined
contribution pension schemes. Their
dependants are eligible for the payment
of a lump sum in the event of death in
service. The pension costs are charged
by way of contributions related to basic
salary. There have been no changes in
the terms of directors’ pension
entitlements during the year. The Group
has met its contractual commitments to
make payments in respect of directors’
entitlements under the schemes. Share options
The Board believes that share ownership strengthens the link between personal interests and those of shareholders and
encourages long-term improvement in the Group’s performance. All options granted are subject to performance conditions on
exercise.
The committee is responsible for supervising the company’s Inland Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme, Executive Share
Option Scheme and the Management Incentive Scheme. On 8 October 2003 7,812 Approved Share Options and 92,188
Unapproved Share Options were granted to Paul Griffiths at an exercise price of 384 pence. A second tranche of 100,000
Unapproved Share Options were granted to him on 19 January 2004 at an exercise price of 457.5 pence.

Source: DATASTREAM We have audited the financial
statements of Inter Link Foods PLC on
pages 21 to 38. We have also audited
the information in the directors’
remuneration report on page 19 that is
described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the
company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’s members
those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor’s report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other
than the company, and the company’s
members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities
of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for
preparing the Directors’ Report and the
Directors’ Remuneration Report. As
described on page 16, this includes
responsibility for preparing the financial
statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom Law and
accounting standards. Our
responsibilities, as independent
auditors, are established in the United
Kingdom by statute, the Auditing
Practices Board and by our profession’s
ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the financial statements give a
true and fair view and whether the
financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be
audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the directors’ report is not
consistent with the financial statements,
if the company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or
if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and
transactions with the Group is not
disclosed.
We read the other information
accompanying the financial statements
including the unaudited part of the
directors' remuneration report, and
consider whether it is consistent with
the audited financial statements.
We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial
statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in
accordance with Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination,
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to
the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and the part of
the directors’ remuneration report to
be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by
the directors in the preparation of the
financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate
to the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so
as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements
and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited are
free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion, we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements
and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
❖ the financial statements give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs
of the company and the Group at
7 May 2004 and of the profit of the
Group for the year then ended;
and
❖ the financial statements and the
part of the directors’ remuneration
report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

23 consolidated cash flow statement 1. Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
applicable accounting standards.
The principal accounting policies of the Group have remained unchanged from the previous year and are set
out below.
Basis of consolidation 
The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of the company and its subsidiary undertakings, drawn
up to 7 May 2004, using the acquisition method of accounting. The results of the subsidiary acquired during the
year have been included from the date of acquisition. Profits or losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated in
full. On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities which exist at the date of acquisition
are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Under section 230 (4) of the Companies Act 1985, the company is exempt from the requirement to present its
own profit and loss account.
Turnover
Turnover is the total amount receivable by the Group for services provided, excluding VAT and trade discounts.
Intangible fixed assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair
values of the identifiable net assets acquired, is capitalised and is amortised on a straight line basis over its
estimated useful economic life.
Purchased goodwill first accounted for in accounting periods ending before 23 December 1998, the
implementation date of FRS 10, was eliminated from the financial statements by immediate write-off on acquisition
against reserves. Such goodwill will be charged to the profit and loss account on the subsequent disposal of the
business to which it relates.
Development costs
Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when recoverability can be assessed with
reasonable certainty and amortised over three years commencing in the year after the expenditure is incurred, in
line with the expected sales arising from the projects. Where the anticipated life of a character licence cake is
deemed to be less than 3 years, development costs associated with such a product are written off over a shorter
period following half-yearly reviews. All other development costs are written off in the year of expenditure. 
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset over its
expected useful life on a straight line basis as follows:
Freehold property 50 years
Leasehold property Period of lease
Furniture, fittings and office equipment 3–5 years
Plant and machinery 10–15 years
Motor vehicles 3–7 years
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less amounts written off.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, and
net realisable value, on a first in, first out basis after making due allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.
notes to the financial statements 24 25 notes to the financial statements continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Deferred taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is recognised
without discounting in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting
purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Leasing commitments
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated over their expected
useful lives. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance
outstanding and is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the profit and
loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Pensions
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the profit and
loss account as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes. 
Government grants
Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income account and are released to
the profit and loss account by equal annual instalments over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets.
Government grants of a revenue nature are credited to the profit and loss account in the same period as the
related expenditure.
Financial instruments
Financial assets are recognised in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provision is made
for diminution in value where appropriate. Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments is recognised on
the accruals basis, and credited or charged to the profit and loss account in the financial period to which it relates.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets
and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All

Earnings per share is calculated on the basis of profit for the year after tax divided by the weighted average
number of shares in issue for 2004 of 9,595,168 (2003: 7,537,192).
Diluted earnings per share is calculated on the basis of profit for the year after tax divided by the weighted
average number of shares in issue for 2004 adjusted for the dilutive effect of options granted which totals
9,932,132 (2003: 7,862,991).
An adjusted earnings per share and a diluted adjusted earnings per share, which exclude goodwill amortisation, have
also been calculated to allow shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group.

10. Acquisitions
On 13 January 2004, the entire issued share capital of Farmhouse Bakery Holdings Limited was acquired for a
consideration of £5,050,000. 
The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and goodwill arising on
consolidation has been capitalised and will be amortised over a period of 20 years, its expected useful life.

The principal fair value adjustments which have been made are to reduce the valuation of stock existing at the
date of acquisition and the provision for onerous obligations is based on the directors’ best estimate at 7 May
2004 and are subject to further review during the year ending 30 April 2005.
The loss before taxation of the Farmhouse Bakery Holdings Limited group for the period from 1 July 2003, the
beginning of the financial year, to 13 January 2004, the date of acquisition, was £171,836. The profit before
taxation for the year ended 30 June 2003 was £773,023. 
During the year the Farmhouse Bakery Holdings Limited group made the following contributions to, and
utilisations of, Group cash flow:

During the year the directors reassessed the provision for onerous obligations taken over on the acquisition of
the business and assets of Soreen. The provisions were increased by £218,000 to cover the ongoing payment
of personal disability benefits to six employees and commitments to sponsorship agreements. 
The contingent deferred consideration payable in respect of Cakes for the Connoisseur has reduced by
£251,000 as a result of turnover achieved by that business in the year ended 7 May 2004.
The useful economic life of the goodwill in respect of all acquisitions is 20 years, based on the directors’
assessment of the income streams of the acquired businesses.

During the year the Group increased its bank loan facility from £8.35 million to £17.33 million in conjunction with
the acquisition of Farmhouse Bakery Holdings Limited. Part of the facility is currently used to guarantee loan
notes amounting to £3,180,666 which were issued to the vendors of Hepworth & Whittles Limited and will be
used to redeem the loan notes when notice is served by the holders of those notes. The loan facility is repayable
by quarterly instalments over a 4 year period with quarterly instalments of £375,000 in the next twelve months.
The bank loan facility includes an amount of £5 million which is a revolving loan which is not repayable until
October 2009.
In addition, the Group has a mortgage of £1,050,000 which is repayable by quarterly instalments of £37,500
over 7 years.
At 7 May 2004, net bank borrowings including the guarantee provided to the holders of the loan notes and
certain loans totalling £17,895,000 were secured by cross guarantees between the company and its subsidiary
undertakings, together with a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the company. Amounts owed under
finance leases are secured against the specific assets to which they relate.
The Group has unutilised overdraft facilities of £1,985,000 at 7 May 2004 which are subject to review in
December 2004. This overdraft facility is technically repayable on demand.
The Group uses financial instruments comprising cash, short-term borrowings, trade debtors and trade creditors,
that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the
Group’s operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The directors
review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. Short-term debtors
and creditors have been excluded from the following disclosures.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank and other borrowings. The loan
notes carry a coupon of 5%, and a margin of 2.0% is payable. Interest rates ranging between 1.5% and 2.25%
over base rate apply to loans and a margin of 1.25% applies to the bank overdraft up to a level of £2 million,
above which the rate increases to 1.75%. The Group’s policy is to keep approximately 40% of borrowing at fixed
rates of interest. Interest rates are forecast to increase in the reasonably foreseeable future; therefore, the
percentage of borrowing on fixed rates has been allowed to increase to 52%.
The interest rate exposure of the net financial liabilities of the Group as at 7 May 2004 was:
2004 2003
£’000 £’000
Fixed — loan notes and finance lease obligations 10,239 3,665
Floating — loans and overdrafts 9,590 8,299
19,829 11,964
The weighted average fixed interest rate is 6.9% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is
3.1 years. The floating rate of interest is based on LIBOR.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs
and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. The Group’s general policy throughout the year has been, to
ensure continuity of funding, that at least 10% of its borrowings should mature in more than five years.
At the year end 28% of Group borrowings were due to mature in more than 5 years and throughout the year it
was 5%. Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.

28. Contingent liabilities
There were no contingent liabilities at 7 May 2004 or 3 May 2003.
29. Pensions
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for the benefit of employees. The assets of the
schemes are administered by trustees in funds independent from those of the Group. The pension costs for the
year were £281,000 (2003: £187,000). There were no prepaid or outstanding contributions at either the
beginning or end of the financial year.
30. Capital commitments
The Group has capital commitments at 7 May 2004 amounting to £2,540,000 (2003: £411,000).
Contingent consideration of £400,000 has been provided in respect of the acquisition of The Creative Cake
Company because the gross profit criteria which would give rise to the final payment have been met in 2004.
The final payment of the contingent consideration for the Creative Cake Company is £400,000 in the year
ending 30 April 2005. The sales performance of the Cakes for the Connoisseur division in 2004 has caused the
directors to reduce their estimate of the contingent consideration from £294,000 to £43,000 under the terms of
the acquisition agreement which will be paid in August 2004. That payment will be the final payment under the
agreements to purchase Cakes for the Connoisseur.

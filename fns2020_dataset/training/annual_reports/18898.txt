COVER IMAGE: T-PYLON INNOVATION
Nationwide Platforms supports
new T-Pylon design innovation
Lavendon’s UK subsidiary,
Nationwide Platforms, provided
two 50m operated truck
mounted platforms to carry 
out work on an innovative new
electricity pylon scheme that 
will change the silhouette of the
UK’s landscape. Since 1928 the
iconic ‘lattice’ design electricity
pylon has formed the backdrop
of the UK’s countryside and now
a new pioneering design is to
replace 88,000 pylons throughout
the UK over the coming years. 
The T-Pylon design was the
winner of a 201 1 international
competition to find the next
generation of electricity pylons,
which is being tested and
developed by one of Nationwide
Platform’s key customers.
By using powered access for
the work, it enabled the
contractors to safely reach
the pylons and manoeuvre the
units to the ideal position to
attach conductor wires.

The Board uses a range 
of Key Performance Indicators
(“KPIs”) to assess performance. 
These include strategic KPIs
which measure how we are
meeting our objectives and are
also used in determining
performance payments to 
the executive directors and
senior management team.
Financial KPIs measure the
overall performance of the
business and are aligned 
with those commonly used 
by shareholders. 
Non-financial KPIs also form 
a key part in monitoring our
strategic progress as well as
being of importance to our 
wider stakeholders.

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
This strong performance was primarily
delivered from continued strong
revenue growth in the Middle East and
an improvement in margins from our
UK business.
The proposed dividend increase for the
year of 17% reflects these strong results
and the Board’s confidence in the Group’s
long term future.
During the year, we undertook a significant
fleet investment programme that provided
both additional capacity to grow our business
and also continued to refresh our rental fleet
to ensure that it remains highly competitive.
The investment programme included c.£20
million that was originally planned for 2016,
enabling the delivery of additional fleet in the
final months of 2015. The decision to bring
forward this investment was to ensure our
market positions in the UK, France and the
Middle East were improved and that we
are well positioned to capture growth
opportunities as we move into 2016.
The Board remains focused on improving
the performance of our German business,
and we strengthened its management team
during the year with appointments of new
Managing and Finance Directors. Following
an operational review of the business, its
organisational structure is being reshaped
to be more in line with our regionally based,
larger depot business model applied
successfully elsewhere in the Group.
We believe that these changes will be
operationally complete by the end of 2016,
moving the business closer to its

average cost of capital (“WACC”) and, once
achieved, maintain it above this benchmark
across the business cycle. This strategic
target was achieved in 2014 and further
improvements in ROCE have been delivered
in 2015. To recognise the development of
our capital structure over time and, in
particular, changes to the Group’s cost
of equity and debt, we reassessed the
Group’s WACC in the year and a WACC of
9.5% is now used when assessing our
ROCE performance. As we expand our
capital base in support of our growth plans,
we anticipate that the Group’s ROCE will
make more modest progress while the
returns from the additional capital
employed reach expected levels.
Financial results
The Group’s total revenues in 2015
increased by 1% to £248.6 million (2014:
£246.3 million), with rental revenues also
increasing by 1% to £233.5 million
(2014: £231.9 million).
Underlying operating profits increased by
10% to £43.1 million (2014: £39.3 million)
with margins improving to 17.3% (2014:
16.0%). The combination of a further
improvement in the Group’s trading
performance and a reduction in net interest
costs to £4.6 million (2014: £5.2 million)
enabled the Group’s underlying profit
before tax to increase by 13% to £38.5
million (2014: £34.1 million).
With the Group’s underlying effective tax
rate reducing to 21% (2014: 23%),
customers, streamlining accountability
and providing a firm base from which to
improve returns.
The continued improvement in the Group’s
performance in recent years reflects our
strategic focus of developing strong market
positions and a differentiated service
offering to drive revenues and improve
margins. The allocation of additional capital
during 2015 demonstrates the operational
flexibility provided by the strength of the
Group’s balance sheet, underpinning our
ability to support the delivery of our growth
plans with investment when required.
We are confident that the consistent
delivery of revenue growth, driven and
serviced from our efficient cost structure
with its inherent operating leverage, will
generate substantial shareholder value
in the medium term.
Dividend
Given the Group’s strong financial
performance in the year, the Board is
proposing a final dividend of 3.70 pence per
share, making a total dividend for the year
of 5.40 pence, an increase of 17% over the
previous year (2014: a total dividend of 4.60
pence). The final dividend, if approved, will
be paid on 21 April 2016 to shareholders
on the register at the close of business on
4 March 2016.
The proposed increase in the dividend
not only reflects the strong financial
performance in the year, and the strength
of our operating cash flows, but also the
Board’s confidence in the Group’s future
and the continued recognition that
dividends are an important means of
delivering shareholder value.
Dividend cover, based on the proposed
total dividend for 2015 and underlying
earnings per share, has reduced to 3.3 times
(2014: 3.4 times) in line with our stated
intention to maintain dividend distributions
within a range that is covered three to four
times by earnings. The actual dividend
cover in any one year will be balanced
against the Group’s investment needs and
funding requirements as we move through
the business cycle.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s ROCE for the year increased
to 12.3% (2014: 12.1%). The calculation of
ROCE is based on the Group’s operating
profit before exceptional items and the
average of the opening and closing capital
employed for the year of £336.6 million
(2014: £309.2 million). The ROCE of 12.3%
is stated on a like for like basis with the
prior year and therefore ignores the
favourable impact on the Group’s capital
employed arising from the impairment this
year of the carrying value of the remaining
goodwill in the German and Belgian
businesses. The impact of this impairment
reduces the Group’s capital employed and
so increases the reported ROCE for 2015
to 12.7% (2014: 12.1%).
The Group’s principal strategic target has
been to improve ROCE above our weighted

underlying profit after tax increased by 15%
to £30.4 million (2014: £26.4 million) and
underlying earnings per share increased by
15% to 17.95 pence per share (2014: 15.65
pence per share).
Amortisation* charges for the year reduced
to £1.7 million (2014: £2.0 million). An
exceptional item of £20.6 million was
incurred, relating to a non-cash impairment
charge on the carrying values of the
remaining goodwill associated with the
Group’s German and Belgian businesses.
After amortisation* charges and the
exceptional item, the Group’s operating
profits were £20.7 million (2014: £27.2
million), profit before tax was £16.2 million
(2014: £21.0 million) and profit after tax
was £8.3 million (2014: £13.9 million),
with earnings per share of 4.91 pence
(2014: 8.23 pence).
Using exchange rates consistent with 2014,
both total and rental revenues increased
by 2% to £252.2 million and £236.9 million
respectively, with underlying operating
profits increasing by 8% to £42.6 million
(2014: £39.3 million) and underlying profits
before tax increasing by 11% to £38.0
million (2014: £34.1 million). Underlying
profit after tax increased by 14% to
£30.1 million (2014: £26.4 million) with
earnings per share increasing by 13% to
17.76 pence (2014: 15.65 pence).
Cash flow
Underlying earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
increased by 8% to £85.9 million (2014:
£79.6 million) with margins improving to
34.5% (2014: 32.3%). After absorbing
movements in working capital and
payments of interest and tax, the Group
generated £68.8 million of operating cash
in the year (2014: £66.7 million). This
operating cash was used to largely fund
the Group’s increased purchase of rental
fleet assets in 2015, after which the net
cash used by operating activities was
£21.1 million (2014: net cash generated
from operating activities £13.6 million).
As we moved through 2015, the
management of our working capital in
the Middle East became more challenging
due to the well publicised liquidity issues
in the region. This is primarily an issue
within our Saudi Arabian business,
although its impact is mitigated by the
better working capital metrics seen in
our other markets in the region that are
driving our current revenue growth.
Whilst our Middle East business unit is
self-funding, its increased working
capital needs will moderate the rate
at which we allocate additional capital
into the region in the coming year.
This discipline is expected to increase
the level of “free cash” generated by
the region and will remain in place until
the liquidity pressures in the market
show signs of easing.
Investment
In 2015, the Group increased its level
of investment in its rental fleet and
operational infrastructure to £95.5 million
(£64.7 million) including c.£20 million
originally planned for 2016. As in previous
years, this was partly funded by the
disposal of surplus or retired assets which
generated £8.8 million (2014: £11.6 million)
in the year. After reflecting movements in
amounts owing to equipment suppliers at
the beginning and end of the year, our
investment programme resulted in a net
cash outflow for the year of £85.8 million
(2014: £45.6 million). This capital
expenditure was predominantly funded
by the Group’s strong operating cash
flows with the balance financed using the
Group’s debt facilities.
The investment was principally directed
towards the purchase of c. 3,100 rental
machines, which has provided additional
capacity to our operations and enabled a
further substantial refreshment of the
Group’s existing rental fleet to be
undertaken. Over the past four years,
around 40% of the Group’s rental fleet has
been refreshed, ensuring that it remains
well invested and highly competitive in
support of our strong market positions.
Net debt
The Group’s net debt before issue costs at
31 December 2015 was £119.9 million
(2014: £90.6 million). The increase in net
debt is principally the net effect of the

investment programme undertaken during
the year being partially offset by our strong
operating cash flows and a favourable
foreign exchange movement of £4.3 million
on our non-Sterling denominated debt.
After adjusting for the unamortised debt
issue costs relating to the Group’s US
Private Placements, the Group’s reported
net debt at 31 December 2015 was
£119.2 million (2014: £89.7 million).
The corresponding debt to equity ratio
was 53% (2014: 41%) and our net debt to
underlying EBITDA ratio was 1.39 times
(2014: 1.13 times). The Group continues to
operate comfortably within its preferred
leverage range of 1.00 – 1.75 times EBITDA.
Board changes
Given the development of the Group in
recent years and our desire as a Board to
demonstrate best practice, we are
separating the current role of Finance
Director and Company Secretary in 2016.
Alan Merrell will continue in his role as
Finance Director and we have appointed
a Company Secretary who is expected to
join the Group in April 2016.
Summary and outlook
The Group delivered a strong underlying
financial performance in 2015, ahead of
market expectations with revenues, profits,
margins and ROCE all delivering year on
year growth. The proposed increase in the
total dividend for the year of 17% reflects
these strong results and the Board’s
confidence in the Group’s long term future.
The key drivers of 2015’s performance
were further strong revenue growth in our
Middle East region and a notable margin
improvement in our UK business. We
recognise that the current financial
performance of our German business is
unsatisfactory and are taking further steps
to address this in 2016 so as to establish
a firm base from which the business can
return to growth on a sustainable basis
and deliver improved financial returns
for the Group.
Our fleet investment programme for 2015
was substantial and included additional
fleet added towards the end of the year to
ensure capacity is available to meet
anticipated growth in demand as we move
into 2016. Following this capacity increase,
our investment programme for 2016 is
primarily focused on the ongoing
refreshment and improvement in the
product mix of our fleet. As a consequence,
our fleet investment for 2016 will reduce to
c.£55 million, more in line with our trend
level of annual investment and one that is
largely self-funded from our operational
cash flows.
While our strong financial position provides
us with the flexibility to accelerate the
allocation of capital in response to
opportunities offering attractive financial
returns as they emerge, the disciplined
allocation of additional capital remains a
key focus of the Board. This will ensure we
maintain our ROCE above our weighted
average cost of capital across the business
cycle. In this regard, the recent increase
in working capital requirements of our
Middle East business will moderate the
rate at which we expand in this market
until such time as the liquidity issues ease
in the region.
Trading in the current financial year has
been in line with our expectations and,
whilst recognising the recent increased
uncertainty in the economic outlook, the
Board looks forward to delivering another
year of progress in 2016.

Drivers of the use of powered access equipment
safety: Increased focus on safety in the workplace, supported 
by ever more stringent Health and Safety legislation, accelerating the
substitution of older traditional methods of access.
efficiency: Escalating costs and shortage of skilled labour in the
construction and refurbishment sectors, driving the need for tools 
to maximise productivity.
construction processes: Commercial pressure to reduce
project timescales, where speed, convenience, efficiency and safety are
prime concerns. The increasing modularisation of construction processes,
which tends to produce a greater demand for access equipment on
construction sites.
What is powered access?
A range of equipment
designed to enable people 
to work safely, productively
and efficiently at height.
Also known as aerial work
platforms (AWP’s) or mobile
elevating work platforms
(MEWP’s).
An attractive alternative to
older traditional access
methods such as ladders,

Why is powered 
access equipment rented?
cost: The equipment has a relatively
high capital cost and there are also
stringent transport and maintenance
requirements.
range: A range of equipment
would be required to satisfy all
applications.
Utilisation: The need for the
equipment tends to be infrequent 
and inconsistent due to varying 
work schedules and applications.
in summary: The combination 
of these drivers of demand and the
efficiencies gained from the rental of the
equipment, should, we believe, continue
to enable the market to grow in the
coming years, subject to prevailing
economic conditions.

Strategic report
customers, marketplace and business model
Customers
Powered access equipment is used across
a broad range of industry sectors in a large
variety of applications by customers of
different sizes.
To tailor our value proposition to meet
customer needs, we analyse and categorise
our customer base in a number of ways.
Customer size
We deal with customers of all sizes from
global businesses, multinational blue
chip’s, national, regional, privately owned
companies and sole traders.
Larger businesses (Tier 1) are handled by our
national account teams, who have specialist
sector knowledge and skills for more
complex arrangements. Our Tier 2 customer
requirements are managed through our
indoor and outdoor sales teams.
In all cases customer enquiries are routed
through our teams of skilled Hire Desk
Controllers, who match the appropriate
fleet asset to the customers needs.
Market sector
Our customers are diverse, engaged in
sectors spanning Construction, Facilities
Management, Infrastructure & Utilities,
Industrial, Energy, Gas and Oil, Film,
Television and Media.
The use of powered access continues to
expand through increasing penetration of our
existing markets and the development of new
applications to meet customer requirements.
An analysis of the Group’s current customer
base in terms of revenue by market sector
is shown above.
Within our sales and service support teams
we employ specialist staff with strong
experience of specific market sectors, for
example utilities, television or media.
Our staff understand specific customer
needs as well as the challenges arising from
the environments in which they are
required to operate. For example, media
sector customers hiring our equipment for
outside broadcasts of sporting or state
events will often be working under strict
security and logistic constraints.
Lavendon’s experience and expertise of
these industries and the restrictions they
can place on service providers enables us
to provide effective powered access
solutions required by the customer.
Maintaining an appropriate mix of
customers from differing industry sectors is
of strategic importance to the Group. The
commercial, industrial and infrastructure
construction sectors are the largest
markets we serve. However, these markets
are inherently cyclical and therefore we
seek to mitigate our exposure by
developing sectors that have smoother
demand profiles.
Geographic
Generally, each of our business units deals
with customers and sectors that arise in
their own geography. The split of revenues
by geography is shown below.
Where it was economically viable to do so,
we have developed our depot network
within each geographic market to ensure
we are able to offer a nationwide service to
our customer base. In some territories, we
have adapted our approach to achieving a
market leading position by concentrating
on specific sectors or regions within a
national market.

businesses, with the construction sector
an important market and particularly
sensitive to pricing levels.
The principal drivers of the use of powered
access equipment are safety and efficiency.
We have continued to focus the investment
of our resources to ensure that we
maintain our market leading position that
enables us to provide:
• A high quality rental fleet
• Excellent machine reliability, through
industry leading levels of maintenance
and service
• Highly trained, skilled staff

Overview of Group strategy
Before we look at the progress that the
Group has achieved in 2015, please let me
remind you of the overall Group strategy.
At its highest level, the Group’s strategy
can be summarised according to the
Strategram (below). We have a mission and
associated series of strategic goals, we then
have our strategic programmes and initiatives
to drive achievement of these goals.
Our mission
Our mission is clear and remains the same:
“To be a powered access rental provider
which is market leader in its selected
geographies, placing safe access at the
heart of what we do”
Currently, Lavendon enjoys market leading
positions in the UK and the Middle East. It is
the second largest powered access rental
business in Germany and Belgium and is
continuing to grow strongly in France,
where it operates the fifth largest powered
access fleet in the country.
Road map
In previous Annual Reports I had set out
a road map for the future. To achieve our
mission we planned three phases of
development, which are summarised 
opposite.
For 2011 to 2013 we focused on improving,
standardising and optimising the Group’s
operations to ready it for the transition into
Group road map
a ‘best in class’ business. We called this phase
“Fit for the Future”, and through the rigorous
implementation of a plan to improve both
operational and capital efficiency we secured
significant financial benefits.
During 2014 and 2015 we entered the
second phase, titled “Best in Class”. In this
phase we sought to drive the business
onward to achieve operational excellence.
In the final phase “Safe Access Solutions
Provider” we are looking to leverage our
position to be the de facto market
leading brand and partner of choice
for the customer.
Strategic goals
In striving to deliver our mission, I also set
three strategic goals to achieve as we
progress along our journey:
• Growth
• Cash Flow
• ROCE > WACC
First, to sustainably increase the scale
of our business, growing its revenues
and profitability.
Second, to generate a cash flow after
the servicing of debt finance, that is
sufficient to cover the replacement capital
expenditure requirements of the business
and support the Group’s dividend policy.
And third, to achieve a Return on Capital
Employed (“ROCE”) in excess of our
weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”)
over the business cycle.

Strategic report
chief executive’s review continued
Progress in 2015
In 2014 we achieved our first strategic goal
with ROCE of 11.9% exceeding our WACC 
for the first time. I am pleased to report that
our ROCE for 2015 is 12.3%, again ahead of
our WACC and an improvement on 2014.
Since 2011, Group revenues have increased
by over 10% while we concentrated
our efforts on optimising our fleet and
infrastructure and securing operating
efficiencies. Driving growth is now the
primary strategic goal as we move forward
into 2016 and beyond.
Our strategic goal for cash flow was to be
able to consistently fund our replacement
capital expenditure requirements from our
free cash flows after servicing debt and at
the same time support our dividend policy.
In 2015 our cash flow was sufficient to fund
our debt service and taxation charges of
£12.2m, our replacement fleet programme
of £44.0m and our dividend in the year of
£8.3m. It was also able to partly fund our
expansion fleet investment of £47.0m.
During 2015, we continued making significant
progress in our quest to deliver our medium
term objective of operational excellence.
With this in mind, we reviewed the progress
being made with the recently outsourced
transportation function in the UK, and
concluded that this was not delivering the
expected customer service improvements
at the expected cost. Consequently, we have
decided to bring this function back under our
direct control. The transition of the function
back in house will be completed by the end
of February, and while this may cause some
disruption to the business in the short
term, we are confident that our operational
efficiencies and customer service levels will
improve over the year.
Innovation
One of the highlights of 2015 was the launch
of the SkySiren PCS secondary guarding
device. Developed by our BlueSky Solutions
business it delivers a major step forward in
our “Your safety, our priority” campaign. It is
designed to prevent potentially fatal crushing
accidents arising through operator error.
At the present time, this technology is
available exclusively from Lavendon and can
be used with a large proportion of the
Group’s fleet of booms lifts. The market
impact of such devices is discussed further
in latter parts of this Strategic Report.
Safety
The safety of our customers and staff is
extremely important to the Group. All of the
Group’s business units continually monitor,
investigate and report on our safety
performance with regard to any lost time
accidents which result in an employee or
contractor needing to take time off work as
a result. We equally report on and take
necessary corrective actions in the case of
near misses when they arise.
Our key measure for monitoring safety
performance is the Accident Frequency
Rate (“AFR”). The AFR is used to monitor
our performance with regard to “lost time”
accidents where as a result an employee
or a contractor has to take three or more
days off work as a result. I am pleased to
report that we beat our target of 0.56
lost time accidents per 100,000 hours
worked, achieving an actual result of
0.42 (2014: 0.52).
Fleet
2015 was a record year for fleet
investment for the Group after we invested
£91m (2014: £61m). We replaced c.2,000
units of fleet and changed the mix where
necessary to reflect the latest demand
profile. We also expanded the fleet in
Europe and the Middle East by 600 and 
700 units respectively.
Technical
Last year I announced that the Group
would be enhancing its Technical
excellence programme. The new
programme, TechX2020 builds upon the
existing programme, but takes it to another
level with the introduction of two new
targets of heightened achievement;
Platinum and Diamond.
In June 2015, our Swansea depot in the UK
became the first depot to achieve Platinum
status. By the close of the year a further
22 depots from the UK, Germany, Belgium,
France and the United Arab Emirates had
also achieved Platinum standard. My
congratulations go to our depot staff and
managers in achieving this fantastic result.
Employees
2015 saw the roll out of a number of staff
training and development programmes.
All management grade staff, as well as
some up and coming employees were
taken through an assessment and
development programme which we called
project Kindle. The programme gave
feedback to employees about their current
ability and potential. As part of the process,
we also identified those employees who
demonstrated the highest potential for the
future and provided them with accredited
tailored training and coaching to ready
them for succession opportunities as and
when they may arise.
In total, the Group facilitated 2,700 days
of employee training over the course of
the year.
At the close of 2015 we completed a
Group wide employee satisfaction survey.
The employee net promoter score from
that survey was 46, which is the highest we
have achieved. This is a promising
indicator for the future, however myself
and my fellow senior executives will
continue to ensure that we focus on this
area to deliver a stable employee base in
2016 and beyond.
Despite the above our principal KPI for
employee satisfaction, employee turnover,
increased to 26% from 19%. A significant
part of the increase was driven by the
outsourcing of logistics staff in the UK to
our chosen logistics partner Wincanton.
Voluntary labour turnover also increased
to 15% from 11% in the year, as improving
market conditions for sales and engineering
positions in the UK affected the Group. Financial performance
Full details of the Group’s financial
performance are detailed in the Financial
Review on page 25. I am pleased to report
that the Group once again improved its
revenues and profits and achieved a ROCE
of 12.3% (2014 12.1%), well ahead of our
WACC of 9.5%.
Strategy and strategic
programmes
Our strategy remains unchanged from
the previous year. Central to the delivery
of the Group’s strategic goals are a series
of four strategic programmes (opposite),
which encompass all of the activities,
projects, policies and actions that
management are taking toward
achievement of these objectives.
On the following pages, I expand upon
each programme in more detail and bring
these to ‘life’ with actual examples of each
strategic element being followed in 2015, 
in our “Strategy in Action” section.
As our business and strategies evolve,
I look forward to updating you on our
progress in the future.
Summary
I am pleased by the continuing performance
of the Group. I would like to express my
thanks to all our staff members who have
worked diligently to help us achieve our
objectives. There is still plenty more work
to do as we continue our journey. I am
confident that together, we will continue to
build a business that delivers on all of our
objectives and will therefore deliver
impressive performance and returns to
our investors.

Strategy in action:
BlueSky Solutions our
key differentiator
The BlueSky Solutions business is a central
element of the Group’s Revenue Generation
Programme. The business designs, develops
and manufactures a range of safety and
efficiency improving equipment that we
offer to our customers for use with powered
access machines.
Their latest products include the SkySiren
PCS, an Intelligent Secondary Guarding
System which began field trials during
October 2015. The product advances our
offering from the existing SkySiren III
product introduced in 2013. It utilises
ultrasonic motion sensors, much like the
reversing systems in modern cars, to give
an audible warning if an operator is in
danger of injuring themselves. If the audible
warning is ignored the system will override
the operator controls and stop the machine
before any contact is made. The device has
received considerable positive feedback
during the trials with one major contractor
committing to mandating across their sites
immediately at product launch.
From a strategic viewpoint, SkySiren PCS
and related products enhance the value

Our UK business, Nationwide Platforms, was called upon to
assist with important inspection and maintenance work on
Bristol’s landmark Clifton Suspension Bridge.
As part of an annual project to maintain the 150 year old bridge, a 27 metre truck
mounted platform was specifically chosen from the company’s specialist vehicles
fleet due to certain weight and width restrictions.
The truck mounted platform also provided sufficient working height and outreach
for the engineers to access the two towers located at either end of the bridge as
well as to allow for routine examination of the wrought iron suspension cables.

TechX2020 – Technical
Excellence Programme
TechX2020 is our enhanced operational
excellence initiative designed to ensure our
performance around safety, price,
punctuality and performance is market
leading. The original TechX programme has
been running across all business units for
several years now and is embedded in the
operational fabric of the Group. TechX2020
encompasses all of the accredited systems
that underpin the operating model of the
business – this includes H&S, quality,
environmental, sustainability and risk
management.
When surveyed, our customers consistently
rate safety, technical support, reliability,
machine availability and on-time collection
and delivery before price. The TechX2020
programme is designed to ensure that the
Group is aligned with and delivering a high
quality service to meet these needs, driving
revenue growth.
As well as boosting revenues by meeting
customer needs, TechX2020 will also
eliminate costs. Its Planned Preventative
Maintenance (PPM) requirement will reduce
the costs incurred covering breakdown
responses and drive compliance with
Group procurement policies. Over time it
will reduce the number of fleet units
awaiting repair at any one time, freeing
more of the fleet for further revenue
generation.
Finally, TechX2020 encompasses a staff
development and recognition programme
for engineering staff, which will increase
retention and skill levels and reduce
recruitment costs.
To ensure its effectiveness, we embrace the
adage that ‘what gets measured gets done’.
We have a comprehensive auditing regime
across all of the TechX2020 disciplines to
ensure excellent standards of compliance
are achieved by all business units. As at
31 December 2015, 39 depots had
achieved Gold status and a further 23 had
gone on to achieve Platinum status.

Strategy in action:
Use of Satmetrix
®
for
customer feedback and
performance monitoring
The essential logic behind the Customer
Focus Programme is simple, the more we
excel in meeting customer needs then the
more our revenues will grow. We will also
retain existing customers because of the
service they receive and attract new
customers from our competitors. To
better understand our customer needs
we instigated a new project!
Towards the end of 2014, the Group’s
business units introduced the Satmetrix
®
suite of customer survey, feedback and
performance monitoring tools. 2015 was
the first full year in which the Group
used the tools.
A total of 6,748 survey responses were
received during 2015 across the Group.
The success of the programme and the
high volume of responses has allowed us
to track key performance measures in
each country in detail. It has also been
possible to look at responses for specific
products or services, such as training or
from specific depots.
The Group’s overall average Net Promoter
Score (“NPS”) rose in 2015 to 40 (2014: 36).
As this is the first full year of data,
comparisons to 2014 maybe slightly
misleading, however we are encouraged
by this level of improvement.
Some highlights from 2015 were our
specialist vehicles and training divisions
in the UK who achieved average NPS’s of
50 and 65 respectively.
Following up on feedback received is
extremely important. Feedback will be
routed to the relevant department and
responsible regional sales manager. There
are many cases where we have responded
quickly to customer feedback, and through
that rapid response and subsequent
actions have delivered an overall positive
experience to the customer.
During 2015, a major European
headquartered multinational gave the UK
business the ultimate score of straight 10’s.
We fed this information back to their key
decision maker, who confirmed that they
too had agreed on our successful trading
partnership. Relations with that customer
continue to improve.
This solution is not a panacea for our
business, but it is a tool, one of many in
our tool box, that we are using to drive
increased customer focus.

Fleet capital investment
During 2015, the Group invested a record
£91m in its rental fleet. As part of this
investment a number of strategic
considerations were made with regard to
maximising the capital efficiency of the
Group’s fleet assets.
A large proportion of the spend £44m
(48%) related to the replacement of
existing life expired fleet assets. Rather
than simply replacing older fleet assets on
a like for like basis, we took this opportunity
to rebalance the fleet toward models that
are currently or expected to achieve a
greater utilisation and increased returns
than those assets being replaced.
The balance of the investment of £47m was
related to expansion of fleet holdings
primarily in the UK, France and Middle East.
Again, we targeted expansion capital
expenditure at those asset types currently
experiencing high utilisation with better
financial returns.
In the main, we purchase used equipment
rather than new machines for the Middle
East region due to the harsher working
environment. Before entering service
all machines are overhauled and brought
up to the Group’s high standard of
maintenance at our Machine Preparation
Centre (“MPC”) in Dubai before entering
the rental fleet across the region (see
image opposite).
Our fleet disposal programme retired
2,270 ex-rental fleet units during the year
generating £8.8m in disposal proceeds.
The disposal process is managed by a
dedicated team to ensure that it operates
effectively without disruption to our
business units and that values realised
are maximised.

a standard rental product remains a key
factor in securing further market share
with our major customers. At the same
time additional channels to market
through our merchant and re-hire
partnership programmes are supporting
our growth ambitions in the more
localised customer segments.
Considerable attention has also been
placed on improving fleet availability as we
sought greater operational efficiency to
increase our service levels. As a result, by
the end of the year, the fleet awaiting repair
had reduced by 24%, releasing c.200
machines back into the fleet available for
hire. This improvement in availability,
together with the additional fleet capacity
that we added towards the end of 2015,
has enhanced our ability to capture the
anticipated growth opportunities in 2016.
Towards the end of the year, we concluded
that our outsourced transportation function
was not delivering the expected customer
service improvements at the expected cost
and was restricting progress in our drive for
greater operational efficiency. Consequently
we have decided to bring this function back
under our direct control. This may cause
some disruption and increase costs to the
business in the short term, as we transition
in-house, however we are confident that
both our efficiency and customer satisfaction
levels will improve over the year.
The measures we have taken to improve
both the UK’s fleet availability and overall
capacity, together with our continued
development of a differential service
offering, are strengthening our market
position and ensuring the business is well
placed as it moves into 2016.

Our Middle East region again performed
strongly in the year, with rental revenues
increasing by 7% to US$85.5 million (2014:
US$79.5 million). Underlying operating profits
increased by 9% to US$28.1 million (2014:
US$25.9 million), with margins improving to
32.4% (2014: 31.7%). On conversion to £
Sterling, rental revenues increased by 16%
to £55.9 million (2014: £48.2 million) and
underlying operating profits were £18.4
million (2014: £15.7 million).
The strong performance in the year was
volume-driven, with increased utilisation of
an expanded fleet (c.700 units were added
to the fleet during the year) more than
offsetting a 6% decline in pricing in the
region. As reported previously, the
geographic drivers of revenue growth in the
region have changed with strong growth in
the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman more than
absorbing a revenue decline in our higher
margin Saudi Arabian business. This was
particularly evident towards the end of the
year, where the delivery of additional fleet
capacity was largely into markets
other than Saudi Arabia and delivered an
accelerated rate of year on year revenue
growth of 10% in the final quarter.
In Saudi Arabia, the lower oil price and political
change in 2015 are influencing the pace of
new investment in this market and whilst in
the medium term the structural drivers will
continue to drive activity levels, in the near
term we are seeing increased competitive
pressures. However, the structural drivers
across the Middle East region remain strong
and the number of large-scale projects
underway is both significant and diverse.
Moreover, we also expect the penetration
of powered access across the Middle East
to increase, as the market develops with
health and safety awareness and the need
to drive productivity improvements.
The well-publicised liquidity issues within
the region have made the management of
our working capital more challenging during
the year. This is primarily an issue within our
Saudi Arabian business, although its impact
is mitigated by the better working capital
metrics seen in our other markets in the
region that are driving our current revenue
growth. Whilst the region continues to be
self-funding, its increased working capital
requirements will moderate the rate at
which we allocate additional capital into the
region in the coming year. We are taking
this measure so that the level of “free cash”
generated by the region is increased, a
discipline that will remain in place until
the liquidity pressures in the market show
signs of easing.

were £2.5 million (2014: £3.8 million).
An improvement in the financial
performance of the Group’s German
business is a key area of focus for the
Board and, following the appointment of
our new management team in the year,
we are accelerating the regionalisation of
the business to concentrate our resources
in the larger industrial conurbations and
implement a ‘local champion’ strategy
similar to that applied successfully
elsewhere in the Group. Whilst these
changes could disrupt the progress in our
revenue development in the short term,
and will incur restructuring costs, we believe
that they will establish a firmer base from
which the business can increase market
share, drive revenues and improve
financial returns to the Group.

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
Our French business continued to grow
strongly in the year, with rental revenues
increasing by 11% to €30.3 million
(2014: €27.4 million).
The revenue performance was principally
driven by growth in volumes across the year
and a stable pricing environment. Our
continuing success in growing our revenue
base in recent years strengthens our
belief that we are building local share in a
market that has still to show signs of a
sustained recovery.
During the year, we continued to invest
additional resources to support the
business’ ability to secure and service
revenue growth. Whilst this increase in
the cost structure of the business has
constrained margin growth in the year,
the strong revenue growth generated by
the expanded structure has enabled
operating profits in the year to increase
to €5.0 million (2014: €4.3 million), with
margins improving to 16.2% (2014: 15.1%).
We intend to continue to provide additional
capital to our French business to ensure
that it is well positioned to achieve both its
growth ambitions in 2016 and ultimately
benefit from any future recovery in
market conditions.
On conversion to £ Sterling, rental revenues
were stable at £22.0 million (2014: £22.1
million) and operating profits were £3.6
million (2014: £3.5 million).
The difficult trading conditions seen in
recent years continued through 2015, with
market pricing under severe pressure and
our business seeing a price decline of
9% in the year. Although we continue to
manage our cost base in response to these
market conditions, underlying operating
profits in the year reduced to €1.6 million
(2014: €2.2 million), with margins at
10.6% (2014: 14.3%).
On conversion to £ Sterling, rental
revenues declined to £10.0 million (2014:
£11.4 million) and underlying operating
profits were £1.1 million (2014: £1.8 million).
Given this continued weaker trading
performance, the Group’s carrying value
of goodwill associated with the Belgian
business has been reviewed for impairment
at the year end and, as a consequence, an
exceptional non-cash impairment charge
of £5.5 million has been made in 2015.

Belgian rental revenues declined by 2%
in the year to €13.8 million (2014: €14.1

weighted towards the first half of the year,
since when, a significant increase in
volumes has absorbed the continuing
pricing pressures in the market and
enabled a return to year on year
revenue growth of 9% in the second
half of the year.

Financial review continued
Financial review of 2015
The review of the Group’s financial
performance is based principally on what we
term the underlying business performance.
This measure excludes amortisation of
intellectual property and intangibles
recognised on acquisitions charges and
exceptional items. We believe that the use
of underlying results aids the comparison
with prior periods and the understanding
of the Group’s financial performance.
Underlying trading performance
A summary of the Group’s financial
performance for 2015, at actual exchange
rates, with a comparison against 2014,
is set out in the table opposite.
The impact of the year on year movement
in average exchange rates in 2015 for
the Group’s main trading currencies
(principally £ Sterling, Euros and a number
of Middle Eastern currencies), was to
reduce revenues by 1% and increase
profits and earnings by 1%. The results
discussed in this ‘Financial review of 2015’
are based on actual exchange rates for
both 2015 and 2014.
Group revenues for the year increased by 1%
to £248.6 million (2014: £246.3 million). The
split of these revenues between the Group’s
regions is given in the charts opposite.
These revenues are principally derived from
the rental of our equipment fleet, but also
include revenues from the sale of new
equipment and from the disposal of ex-
rental fleet units. The split of revenues
between each of these channels, compared
to 2014, is shown in the table below:

and a profit after tax of £8.3 million (2014:
£13.9 million) with earnings per share of
4.91 pence (2014: 8.23 pence).
Dividends
The Group is proposing a final dividend of
3.70 pence per share making a total dividend
for the year of 5.40 pence, an increase of
17% over the previous year (2014: 4.60
pence). The final dividend, if approved, will be
paid on 21 April 2016 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business of 4 March
2016. The Group’s dividend cover, based on
the proposed total dividend for 2015 and
underlying earnings per share, has been
reduced to 3.3 times (2014: 3.4 times) in line
with our stated intention to maintain our
dividend cover within the range of three to
four times by earnings.
Cash flow, investment and acquisitions
A summary of the Group’s cash flows for
the year is shown in the chart overleaf.
During the year, the Group generated
£72.3 million of cash from operations after
movements in working capital but prior to
the purchase and sale of rental assets
(2014: £68.4 million).
A total of £95.5 million was invested in the
maintenance and expansion of the Group’s
rental fleet and operational infrastructure
(2014: £64.7 million). This investment was
partly funded by the sale of surplus and
retired assets which generated £8.8 million
in cash (2014: £11.6 million). After
movements in amounts owed to equipment
suppliers at the beginning and end of the
year of £1.1 million, the net capital
expenditure for the year was £85.8 million
as shown in the chart overleaf.
Balance sheet and
movements in net debt
The Group’s balance sheet is summarised
on the following page.
The Group’s net assets increased by 1% to
£222.9 million (2014: £220.6 million) with
net assets per share (including goodwill)
stable at £1.31 following the impairment
charge on the carrying values of goodwill
associated with the Group’s German and
Belgian businesses (2014: £1.31). If goodwill
is excluded, the net tangible assets per
Rental revenue is shown net of discounts
and value added tax but includes income
generated from the transportation of
equipment, provision of fuel, charging of
damage waiver fees and the sale of spare
parts. The income derived from the rental
of machines is determined by the interplay
of several factors: size of rental fleet, mix of
machine types within the fleet, utilisation of
the fleet, hire period and rental rates
achieved. The importance, or weighting, of
each of these factors can change by week
or by month as the year progresses due to
normal seasonal patterns of demand or
changing customer workloads.
As the opposite table shows, rental
revenues for the year increased by 1% to
£233.5 million (2014: £231.9 million) while
revenues derived from the sale of new
equipment and ex-rental fleet units
increased by £3.5 million and reduced by
£2.8 million respectively. The revenue from
the sale of new equipment in the UK
includes the sale of BlueSky products which
increased year on year by £3.9 million.
The reduced level of sales of new
equipment elsewhere in the Group reflects
the unpredictable nature of this revenue
stream whereby it can fluctuate significantly
in percentage terms from year to year.
The principal cause of the year on year
reduction in the sale of ex-rental fleet
units was the ‘one-off’ sale in 2014 of the
Group’s non-powered access fleet into a
re-hire agreement with a third party.
The Group’s costs are largely fixed in
nature in the short to medium term with
significant movements in the cost base,
outside of acquisitions, mainly being
determined by either depot openings and
closures, or fleet expansion or contraction.
This feature of our business amplifies the
effect of any small movements in revenue
on the profitability of the Group, as there is
little associated increase or decrease in our
cost base in the short term. This impact is
often referred to as “operational leverage”.
The two main cost areas of the business
are employee costs and depreciation.
During 2015, employee costs, excluding
redundancy costs, reduced to £61.5 million
primarily due to the outsourcing of the UK’s
business transportation function (2014:
£68.0 million) and, as a percentage of rental
revenues, these costs reduced to 26.3%
(2014: 29.3%). Depreciation increased to
£41.4 million in 2015 (2014: £39.3 million)
reflecting the increased level of investment
made in the year which also increased the
ratio of depreciation as a percentage of
rental revenues to 17.7% (2014: 16.9%).
The Group’s underlying EBITDA for the year
increased to £85.9 million (2014: £79.6
million) with margins increasing to 34.5%
from 32.3% in 2014. Underlying operating
profits increased by 10% to £43.1 million
(2014: £39.3 million) with margins improving
to 17.3% (2014: 16.0%). The improvement
in both underlying EBITDA and operating
profits reflect the strong performances from
the Group’s key regions of the UK and the
Middle East which were able to more than
compensate for the weaker trading
performance seen in the Continental
European region.
Underlying net interest charges for the year
reduced to £4.6 million (2014: £5.2 million)
reflecting the reduction in average net debt
levels of the Group across 2014 and 2015,
and the benefit of lower interest rates
charged on those borrowings. After interest
charges, the Group’s underlying profit
before tax increased by 13% to £38.5
million (2014: £34.1 million). With a decline
in the Group’s effective tax rate to 21%
(2014: 23%), the Group’s underlying profit
after tax increased by 15% to £30.4 million
(2014: £26.4 million).
The Group’s underlying earnings per share
increased by 15% to 17.95 pence per share
(2014: 15.65 pence).
Statutory trading performance
Amortisation of intellectual property and
intangibles recognised on acquisitions
charges were £1.7 million for the year
(2014: £2.0 million). The Group incurred
exceptional items of £20.6 million (2014:
£11.1 million) in the year, reflecting the
non-cash impairment charge on the
remaining carrying values of goodwill
associated with the Group’s German
and Belgian businesses.
After amortisation of intellectual property
and intangibles recognised on acquisitions
charges and exceptional items, the Group
generated an operating profit of £20.7
million (2014: £27.2 million), a profit before

The main movements in the balance
sheet were:
• the impairment charge on the carrying
values of goodwill associated with the
Group’s German and Belgian businesses
• the amortisation of intangible assets
partially offset by investments made in
computer systems
• investments in property, plant and
equipment, partly offset by depreciation
• an increase in current assets (principally
trade receivables) mainly due to the
revenue growth in the Middle East region
during the year, partly offset by a lower
cash balance at the end of the year
• an increase in non-current liabilities
following the funding of investment
during the year using the Group’s longer
term debt facilities
As announced in July, the level of capital
expenditure increased during the year and
was largely funded by the Group’s strong
cash flows with the balance financed by
the Group’s debt facilities. This net cash
outflow relating to the Group’s investment
activities, partly offset by a favourable
foreign exchange movement of £4.3
million, increased the Group’s net debt
at 31 December 2015 to £119.9 million
(2014: £90.6 million). Adjusting for the
unamortised costs of £0.7 million relating
to the Group’s US Private Placements,
the Group’s reported net debt position at
31 December 2015 was £119.2 million
(2014: £89.7 million). The corresponding
net debt to underlying EBITDA and
net debt to equity ratios remained
comfortable at 1.39 times (2014: 1.13
times) and 53% (2014: 41%) respectively.
This level of gearing and debt is well
supported by operational cash flows
and significant headroom is available
against all bank covenants.
The Group’s debt facilities total c.£165
million and comprise revolving bank
facilities of £50 million and €60 million, current debt facilities available and the
principal risks set out on pages 35 to 36.
The three year forecasts were sensitised for
the two principal risks that the Directors
consider most critical, namely:
• Volatility in the Middle East; and 
• External economic pressure on
business performance.
The sensitivities around these two risks
were modelled using severe but plausible
scenarios together with the potential
mitigating actions that the Group would
have available.
Based on the assessment, the Directors
have a reasonable expectation that the
Group will be able to continue in operation
and meet its liabilities through to December
2018. In making this assessment, the
Directors have assumed that current
finance facilities would continue to be
available in all plausible market conditions
provided that the Group remained
compliant with the terms of these facilities.

Group Finance Director
25 February 2016
Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
maturing in June 2019, together with US
Private Placements with a combined value
of €95 million (being loan notes of €60
million, €17.5 million and €17.5 million
maturing in July 2019, August 2021 and
August 2024 respectively). The available
headroom within this financing package
at 31 December 2015 was c.£35 million.
The bank facility has an interest rate margin,
linked to the level of leverage of the Group,
of between 150 basis points and 230 basis
points above LIBOR or EURIBOR depending
on the currency drawn. The US Private
Placements have fixed coupons of 4.89%
for the €60 million note maturing in July
2019; 2.54% for the €17.5 million note
maturing in August 2021; and 2.92% for
the €17.5 million note maturing in August
2024. These facilities provide the Group
with a robust medium to long term
diversified financing package that will
support the growth plans of the Group
in the coming years.
The Group has exposure to movements
in interest rates on its borrowings. This
exposure is managed by maintaining a
mix of fixed and floating interest rate
borrowings. This allows the Group to
mitigate the impact of interest rate
fluctuations, by allowing some benefit from
rate reductions, while offering some
protection against rate rises. At the year
end, the fixed rate element of borrowings
was 55%, a marked decline over the
previous year’s fixed rate element of 70%
reflecting the utilisation of the Group’s
banking facilities at variable interest rates to
finance the Group’s increased investment
during the year. Based on the year end mix
and quantum of borrowings, a movement
in Euro interest base rates of 0.25% would
increase or decrease the Group’s annual
interest cost by approximately £20,000
while a similar 0.25% movement in £
Sterling base rates would also increase or
decrease annual costs by £123,000.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s ROCE for the year increased to
12.3% (2014: 12.1%). The calculation of
ROCE is based on the Group’s operating
profit before exceptional items and the
average of the opening and closing capital
employed for the year of £ 336.6 million
(2014: £309.2 million). The ROCE of 12.3% is
stated on a like for like basis with the prior
year and therefore ignores the favourable
impact on the Group’s capital employed
arising from the impairment this year of
the carrying values of the goodwill in the
Group’s German and Belgian businesses.
The impact of this impairment reduces the
Group’s capital employed and so increases
the reported ROCE for 2015 to 12.7%
(2014: 12.1%). The main focus of the Group
continues to be to ensure that its average
ROCE over the business cycle is maintained
at a level greater than its WACC.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the
directors have formed a judgement, at the
time of approving the financial statements,
that the Group can have a reasonable
expectation that adequate resources will be
available for it to continue its operations for
the foreseeable future, and consequently it
is appropriate to adopt the going concern
principle in the preparation of the financial
statements. In forming this judgement, the
directors have reviewed the Group’s budget
for 2016 and the forecast for 2017
(including downside sensitivity scenarios),
cash flow forecasts, contingency planning,
the sufficiency of banking facilities and
forecast compliance with banking
covenants.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the Group’s
viability over a three year period to
December 2018. This period is considered
a suitable timeframe, as the Group
prepares three year strategic plans which
provide greater detail to support the
assumptions made within the forecasts
used for this assessment.
In assessing the Group’s viability, the
Directors considered the Group’s current
financial position, a three year forecast,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Lavendon Group plc 2015   33 Managing risk in
our business
The effective management of risk is an
essential part of the Group’s activities and is
critical to the delivery of our strategic and
operational goals. Overall responsibility for
the system of internal control, reviewing its
effectiveness and ensuring that there is a
process to identify, evaluate and mitigate
any significant risks that may affect the
achievement of the Group’s objectives
lies with the Board.
During the year the Board continued to
develop its risk management framework.
This framework considers and records
the Group’s appetite for risk and the
mechanisms in place for identifying and
evaluating risk together with how these
risks are then managed and mitigated.
Risk appetite
The level of risk considered appropriate to
accept in achieving our business objectives
is determined by the Board. The Group has
no appetite for risk in areas relating to
regulatory compliance, and the health,
safety and welfare of our staff, customers
and the wider community in which we work.
We have an increasing appetite for risk in
relation to activities which are directed
towards creating additional demand for our
services to drive revenues and increased
financial returns for the Group.
Responsibility for
risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for risk
management and internal control in the
organisation. The Board has delegated
oversight of the risk process to the Audit
Committee, including review of the risk
framework. Both the Board and Audit
Committee receive updates on risk
throughout the year.
Risk management framework
The risk management framework is designed
to enable the business to identify risks facing
the Group, evaluate the likelihood and
potential impact of those risks, consider
current risk mitigation strategies and identify
any further steps that could be taken to
reduce these risks. At a more detailed level,
the specific objectives of the framework are
to ensure that:
• there are robust and well defined
processes for the identification of risk
• on a consistent basis; key risks are
analysed, rated for impact, likelihood
assessed and are recorded in the
Corporate Risk Register
• risks are considered and, if appropriate,
formally accepted as part of key decision
making processes
• Executive Directors are aware of the
risks that could prevent Lavendon from
delivering its strategic objectives
• the Board is aware of the key Principal
Risks facing the Group and has the
opportunity to monitor the positions
taken and challenge the approach
towards the mitigation of such risks
• mitigation strategies put in place
are effective
• a risk aware culture is promoted, where
everyone in the organisation views the
management of risk as part of their day job
• the environment in which the Group
operates is continually reviewed to take
account of new and emerging risks, and
risks where the profile has changed
• there is a proportionate approach to
the management of risk
Reporting
The Board recognises that the nature and
scope of key risks can change and so reviews
them as well as the systems and processes
to mitigate them. The Corporate Risk Register
is reviewed in detail by the Audit Committee,
and the Board receives updates on changes
to risks on the Corporate Risk Register during
the year. The Audit Committee and Board
also receive specific reports about assurance
work completed in relation to Principal Risks.
The Group’s risk management process
works with senior management across the
business to identify and evaluate risk using
a consistent framework, to facilitate the
identification and escalation of any new
significant risks, or risks where our exposure
is changing. The reporting structure is
illustrated in the following chart.
The Group Executive Management provide
risk information and assurances to the
Audit Committee, through Group business
monitoring and reporting routines. This is
supplemented by:
• information from the Group Risk Lead
that summarises updates from the
Business Unit/Functional Senior
Managers’ quarterly review and update
of their risk registers
• outputs from Internal Audit and other
assurance activities such as TechX audits
(internal audits concentrating on
technical engineering policies and
procedures) and H&S audits
Business Unit/Functional Senior Managers

risk management  Principal risks and uncertainties
The directors carry out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group. The Principal Risks included in the current
Corporate Risk Register are:
Financial
& funding
risk
description
risk
area
Potential
impact Mitigation change
Currency
fluctuation
The Group reports its performance in
£ sterling, but generates revenues, profits
and cash flows in different currencies.
The Group also owns assets and borrows
money in different currencies.
Currency fluctuations can materially affect
the level of revenues, profits and cash
that the Group can generate.
The Group has a formal hedging policy
to mitigate structural and transactional
foreign exchange exposures. It seeks to
match the assets and liabilities
denominated in a particular currency
to provide a natural hedge.
Wherever possible, cash flows arising in a
given currency are utilised to service
borrowings and capital investment in the
same currency.
Availability of
capital funding
The Group requires access to capital to fund
fleet replacement and expansion, depot
network expansion and acquisitions should
they occur.
If the cash flow that the Group generates,
together with its credit facilities is not
sufficient to meet these requirements, then
additional debt and/or equity funding may
be required. If additional funding was not
available, then the Group’s revenue and
cash flow could be adversely impacted.
The Group aims to ensure it has the
necessary equity base and sufficient
banking and other credit facilities available
to support its development plans.
The Group operates within a relatively
modest range of debt leverage (1.0 – 1.75
times EBITDA) to minimise its refinancing risk.
A comprehensive investor relations
programme is in place to communicate
our business strategy and financial
performance, to ensure the investor
community and debt providers are well
informed to ease the process of raising
additional funding should it be required.
Volatility in
Middle East*
Significant volatility in the Middle East
market could result in severe trading
reduction, major bad debt exposure
and/or asset impairments.
There is regular monitoring of economic
and political changes within the market,
including legislative and taxation changes.
Performance in each Middle East
operation is closely monitored using daily,
weekly and monthly reporting systems
against prior year, budget and forecasts.
The level of bad debt provisioning is
regularly reviewed to ensure this remains
appropriate. Additional resources have been
allocated to strengthen credit control and
debt collection functions within the region.
The amount of cash that is held in the
Middle East region is limited, with surplus
funds repatriated on a regular basis.
Changes to the
competitive
structure of the
market
Excessive competitor fleet expansion that
introduces surplus capacity into the market
could place pressure on hire rates and
utilisation levels, and may erode market share.
Market consolidation, the merging of one or
more of our competitors or customers could
also have a similar impact on our market share
There is also the potential that customers
may choose move to the more generalist
plant hire providers that seek to offer a “one
stop” shop (acting as a broker for equipment
they are unable to directly supply), which
could erode market share and margins.
We continue to build the differentiation
of the Lavendon brand through service
initiatives and safety enhancements.
We also continuously monitor our
customer service levels.
Our customer base is wide, from large
multi-national companies through to
smaller sole traders, and operates in many
sectors. This diversity offers a degree of
resilience to competitive pressures.
We closely monitor fleet utilisation and
fleet replacement programmes to avoid
surplus capacity.

economic
pressures put
stress on
business
performance* 
The equipment rental business is largely
cyclical, being linked to the industrial,
commercial and construction sub sectors.
Changes to demand in these sectors will
directly impact on revenues, and because of
the high proportion of fixed costs this will
have a greater impact on margins.
The Group exercises prudent management
through the different phases of the
economic cycle. Plans to mitigate a
downturn are regularly reviewed and
updated and include fleet redeployment
and disposal, headcount flexibility and
capital expenditure controls.
The geographical diversity of the Group
helps to mitigate exposure to the effects
of individual market fluctuations.
Injury to or
death of staff,
subcontractor
or customer
As the Group works in an environment
where people are in contact with heavy
machinery, accidents can occur that result
in injury to individuals, liability to the Group
and damage to its reputation.
The Group has robust health and safety
procedures, provides clear training and
guidance, reviews through H&S audits, and
has embedded accident reporting systems.
Maintenance regimes and statutory
inspection requirements of the Group’s
rental fleet are rigorously enforced.
Appropriate insurance cover is maintained.
Major IT
Systems Failure
The Group operates a group-wide ERP
system, which supports all key processes.
A major IT systems failure and/or cyber
attack could significantly impact Group
operations and customer relationships.
The Group has a full disaster recovery
programme including on and off site systems
replication, and the use of resilient networks.
There is a robust change management
process to ensure IT systems and data
remain secure and correctly configured.
Specific cyber security reviews have been
undertaken resulting in enhanced security
measures being introduced during the year.
Failure to recruit
and retain
appropriately
skilled people
Delivery of Group business plans is
dependent on the skills and abilities of our
people. If we cannot recruit and retain those
people, particularly in key roles, then this
may impact on our ability to meet the
business’ objectives.
There is a clear resource strategy in place,
and processes to identify which people and
roles are essential for the continued delivery
of our business.
This feeds into our recruitment, development,
reward and succession planning, to provide
resilience for the business.
Failure to
comply with
the regulatory
framework
Because of the geographical diversity of the
Group’s business, it is subject to a wide range
of different legal, regulatory and taxation
regimes. There is a risk that changes in these
frameworks, particularly in the Middle East,
may cause operational difficulties.
Some legislative requirements, for example,
compliance with the Anti Bribery and
Corruption regime, have potentially
significant financial penalties for the Group.
The Group has processes in place to identify
any changes in legislative or tax frameworks,
and takes regular external advice.
We regularly review internal arrangements
in place to ensure compliance with
regulations, and update policies and
procedures where required after receiving
appropriate external advice.

The Savannah Project
As a company we challenge our employees to make a
difference, and we are extending that challenge to our
partners and customers alike. We aspire to develop
our relationship with the communities in which we live
and work, to reduce our impact on the environment
and to improve our health and safety both on and off
our premises. Through imaginative initiatives such as
Project Savannah we look to highlight and support the
work of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL).

Painting the machine 
A local artist, Peter Barber (pictured left)
was commissioned to paint the distinctive
giraffe markings. The artist felt the
machine began to take on a personality
of its own, and that ‘it’ was now a ‘he’,
and named the unit Yazz.
Apprentice competition
We held a competition between two
teams of apprentice engineers from our
UK business to completely refurbish two 
retired machines (pictured far left). After
a close competition, a winning team
(pictured above) was selected, and their
machine was readied for painting.
The Savannah Project
The Savannah Project is a charitable venture to help
raise funds for the Zoological Society of London 
(ZSL). ZSL is a charity and a world leader in wildlife
conservation, science and education. For the next
two years Lavendon will donate the entire rental
revenues of one of its most popular powered
access machines (a Genie electric boom) to ZSL.
To increase awareness of the project, the machine,
now affectionately known as Yazz, was painted with
the characteristic markings of a giraffe.
38   Lavendon Group plc 2015 First hires
Yazz is currently available for hire
throughout the UK. Its striking appearance
certainly turns heads. The unit (pictured
below) was recently on hire at Bluewater
Shopping Centre to help with the taking
down the Christmas Decorations.
Ambassador day
Members of the Savannah Project team
were invited to ZSL’s Whipsnade Zoo for 
an “ambassador day” to learn more about
ZSL’s conservation programmes and to
have an opportunity to meet some of the
animals face to face. 
Project launch 
We held an African themed launch day in
August 2015. The machine was unveiled at
the Group’s headquarters in Lutterworth,
UK, by the Mayor of Lutterworth 
Tony Hirons to the accompaniment of
African drums, singing and dance.
About ZSL 
The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) 
is a world leader in wildlife conservation,
science and education. Through their
efforts, they guide and enable others all
across the world. Protecting, educating,
inspiring – working for wildlife. As a
charity they have active conservation
projects in over 50 countries together 
with their two Zoos, ZSL London Zoo
and ZSL Whipsnade Zoo.

We measured our performance, to set a
benchmark, and then set targets over a five
year period through to 2018. Progress
against these targets is measured and
reported to the Group Executive Team on
a regular basis.
The Group is committed to meeting its
sustainability strategy objectives and where
we are currently falling short of target we
will prioritise further activity to remedy this
in the remaining period to 2018.
Over the coming pages we will detail some
of the activities that the Group and its
subsidiaries have undertaken during 2015.
On page 45, we then summarise the years
performance against the targets we set.
Group’s
Sustainability Strategy
The Group launched its sustainability
strategy in 2014. The strategy is comprised
of five elements, each representing a
specific stakeholder group and is
summarised in the sustainability wheel
diagram below.
For each of the five stakeholder groups:
– our environment
– our People 
– our customers 
– our suppliers
– our communities
Lavendon Group
is committed to
operating its business
in a responsible and
sustainable manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2015   41

Our Environment
At Lavendon, we continue to maintain
detailed records of the level of emissions
that our operations emit. This data is
available for each business unit on a
national, regional or local level and we
encourage our management teams to
critically review performance and identify
any areas of improvement and energy
emissions reduction. The Group reviews
the energy usage of all business units on
a quarterly basis to highlight any areas of
concern and monitor actions taken to
improve performance.
Through our internal procurement
policies, we are committed to reviewing
our key suppliers and take pride in
selecting those that complement our
sustainability strategy.
Our chosen Group wide battery supplier
operates a scheme in which our used
batteries are safely disposed of. They are
recycled and re-manufactured into brand
new batteries. By participating in the eco-
friendly scheme, we ensure that we are
compliant with all legislation surrounding
the safe disposal of batteries and contribute
to a more sustainable way of manufacturing
a vital component of our operations.
During 2015, we tendered for a new
energy provider for our German and
Belgian subsidiaries. We carefully selected
a provider who supplies energy from
sustainable sources. As a company, the
new provider is committed to the whole
energy cycle from developing innovative
efficiency solutions to energy access.
GHG Emissions Report
Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission
sources required under the Companies Act
2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’
Reports) Regulations 2013. These sources
fall within our consolidated financial
statements. We do not have responsibility
for any emission sources that are not
included in our consolidated statement.
The method we have used to calculate
emissions is the GHG Protocol Corporate
Accounting and Reporting Standard
(revised edition) using the location-based
scope 2 calculation method, together with
the latest emission factors from recognised
public sources including, but not limited
to, Defra, the International Energy Agency,
the US Energy Information Administration,
the US Environmental Protection Agency
and the Intergovernmental panel on
Climate Change.
Limitations to data collection
Waste disposal and waste recycling at
Middle East sites have been excluded as
data was not available.
Scopes
The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting
and Reporting Standard (revised edition)
dictates to report the GHG emissions by
Scopes 1, 2 and 3.
Scope 1
Scope 1 includes direct GHG emissions
from sources that are owned or controlled
by the company such as natural gas
combustion and company owned vehicles.
Scope 2
Scope 2 accounts for GHG emissions from
the off-site generation of purchased
electricity, heat and steam.
Scope 3
Scope 3 includes all other indirect
emissions. Included in this assessment are
waste disposal, business travel and third-
party deliveries Not included in this data are
staff commuting, third party maintenance
and vehicles.
Reporting scope 3 activities is optional.
However, these activities can contribute a
significant portion of overall emissions and
it has therefore been decided to report
these where applicable.
Following the outsourcing of the UK
transport to our chosen logistics partner,
Wincanton, the emissions surrounding
deliveries will now be reported in scope 3
under third party deliveries rather than
under company-owned/leased vehicles in
previous years. Due to the continuing growth
of the Middle East business, their CO
2
emissions have also consequently increased.

Our Community
Although the Savannah Project took centre
stage in 2015’s charity events calendar, we
encourage our depots to get involved in
their own events.
Our UK subsidiary, Nationwide Platforms,
took part in their annual ‘Christmas Jumper
Day’ and 2015 saw the employees raise
money for ITV’s Text Santa campaign and
various other fundraisers for popular
events such as Children in Need.
Our Middle East subsidiary, Rapid Access,
also got involved in their local communities
through the outreach project detailed
opposite.
To encourage involvement in local
communities, Nationwide Platforms, the
Group’s UK business runs a volunteering
scheme allowing employees to take up to
two days a year to support a good cause
or charity of their choosing. This scheme
is continuing into 2016.
As a result of the fantastic efforts of our
employees and the Group’s own
contributions, £36,000 has been donated
to good causes throughout 2015 and plans
to continue this during 2016 are in place.
The Group itself made donations of
£32,000 (2014: £30,000).

As part of our Group’s Sustainability Strategy, we encourage
our employees to get involved in charity work and aspire to
make a difference. By engaging in local and national charity
events it empowers our workforce and develops the
strength and trust of the Lavendon brand.
Our Rapid Access business partnered with a local organisation called
‘Volunteer in UAE’ for two events in 2015. The first was a team of 20 volunteers
from our Rapid Access business preparing meals for 500 local workers and the
other being 15 volunteers accompanying 50 local special needs children on a
trip to a local water park.

This approach has proved extremely
successful and in 2015 the scheme was
extended to include our UK specialist
vehicles division (truck and van mounted
platforms). We are looking to extend the
approach across our Continental Europe
businesses in the future.
Workplace
As an industry leader in providing safe
access solutions for our customers we
also recognise that we carry the same
responsibilities for our workforce. We have
continued to invest in new rental fleet,
suitable premises to work in and
appropriate training and support for our
employees. It is vital that we ensure the
people we employ either directly or as
contractors remain safe.
In 2012 we set out a blueprint for Health
and safety across the Group with a 3 year
Strategic Plan that focused on the 5 C’s –
Culture, Competency, Communication,
Controls and Contractors. Our business
units were set objectives and targets in
each of these areas and progress in each
area has been consistently measured
against the Group benchmarked position.
Each business unit has made considerable
improvements over this period and we
have set sound foundations for the future.
We believe that the process, procedures
and culture now embedded are industry
leading and the impact of this effort is
evidenced by successfully beating our
accident frequency rate (AFR) reduction
targets for the third consecutive year, with
our 3 Day AFR reducing from 0.69 in 2013
to 0.42 in 2015.
2015 also saw the introduction of
TechX2020 programme as detailed in
the strategic report.
People
The Group seeks to provide an
environment in which employees feel
respected and are given the opportunity to
contribute to the success of their business.
It is intended that all employees work in
discrimination and harassment free
surroundings.
The Group actively promotes all aspects of
equal opportunities and believes employees,
prospective employees, customers and
suppliers should be treated fairly.
We operate an independent whistle-
blowing system across all operations
allowing employees to raise any issues
they feel the Group should be addressing.
Our people are instrumental to our
success; we respect and value the
individuality and diversity that every
employee brings to the business. We seek
to create a positive and open working
environment wherever we operate.
Marketplace
Our customers are at the heart of
everything we do. We recognise our
responsibilities and work closely with our
customers to develop and share best
practice of safe powered access use across
all the territories in which we operate. In
2015 we significantly increased the number
of customer focused initiatives we ran
across the Group including hosting
many complimentary powered access
workshops for our customers.
During our annual Health, Safety and
Sustainability week in September our
business units ran a series of customer
Work at Height events. These events proved
very successful and were attended by
representatives from over 600 interested
parties. The aim was to provide our
customers with a forum to share best
practice and keep up to date with the latest
innovations and safety developments in
powered access.
Lavendon continues to support the
International Powered Access Federation
(“IPAF”) with Group employees holding seats
on the worldwide International Council as
well as the UK, German and Middle Eastern
councils. Through these positions we are
able to keep up to date with any changes
and also assist in guiding development to
the benefit of our customers and the
industry as a whole. We support the IPAF
Worldwide Accident reporting database,
which aids IPAF to identify accident trends
across the industry.
In previous years, our UK business launched
an innovative approach to dealing with
emergency situations when working at
height. They gave customers immediate
access to download and read bespoke                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2015   45

Compliance with the
UK Corporate
Governance Code
The governance rules applicable to all UK
companies admitted to the Official List of the
UK Listing Authority are set out in the UK
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’),
published by the Financial Reporting Council.
This report sets out our governance policies
and practices, including details of how we
applied and complied with the Code’s
principles during the year.
The Board
The Board is chaired by myself as
Non-Executive Chairman, with the other
members being Don Kenny (Chief Executive
Officer), Alan Merrell (Group Finance
Director), Andrew Wood (Senior
Independent Director) and John Coghlan
and John Wyatt (Non-Executive Directors).
There were no changes to the composition
of the Board during the year.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer are separated, with Don Kenny
holding the position of Chief Executive
Officer and myself holding the office
of Chairman.
The Board directors provide the Company
with experience and knowledge from a
range of industry, financial and commercial
backgrounds. This combination of skills
and experience assists the Board in any
decision making process and in the
development of business strategy.
Biographical details of each director,
including current directorships held in
other companies, are detailed on page 46
of this Annual Report.
Board balance, independence
and commitment
The three Non-Executive Directors
constitute, excluding myself as Chairman,
60% of the Board. The Non-Executive
Directors provide a strong and independent
monitor on the performance of both the
Group and its executive management.
We believe as a Board that the Non-
Executive Directors are independent within
the guidance of the Code as they have not
been previously employed by the Group,
have not and do not currently have a
material business relationship with the
Group, are remunerated on a fixed fee
basis, do not have close family ties with
the Group’s advisors, directors or senior
employees, do not hold cross directorships
with the other directors nor have other
significant links with other directors, do not
represent significant shareholders and
have not served on the Board for more
than nine years. Their backgrounds in
industry and finance make them suitably
qualified to perform their duties as
members of the Board and as members
of the Audit, Remuneration and
Nomination Committees.
The Executive Directors, Don Kenny and
Alan Merrell, do not currently hold non-
executive directorships outside of the
Company. Neither the Non-Executive
Directors or myself as Chairman currently
hold other roles that are considered to
impair or conflict with our abilities to
fulfil our duties to the Group.
Effectiveness
Meetings
We hold regular Board meetings during
the year, with minutes being recorded
and agreed by all directors ensuring
an accurate record is made of all
relevant matters.
During 2015, the Board held eight
formal meetings. The attendance of each
director at these meetings is shown in
the table below:

At each Board meeting the Chief
Executive Officer and Group Finance
Director provide a review of business
performance and give details of any
strategic issues arising.
48   Lavendon Group plc 2015
John Standen 
Non-Executive Chairman
“The Board fully supports the
principles set out in the
Code and confirms that it
has complied with all of the
provisions of the Code
throughout the financial year
ended 31 December 2015.” We also review each individual business
unit’s performance with local management
on at least one occasion during the year.
As a Board we maintain a schedule of
matters reserved for decision by the
Board, including the release of a number
of financial, corporate and statutory
disclosures, approval of business strategy,
acquisitions and disposals, composition of
relevant committees and management
structures, and matters relating to ethical,
health and safety concerns.
I hold separate meetings, at least annually,
with all members of the Board in order to
review their contribution during the year.
I also meet with the Non-Executive
Directors as a group, to review matters
relating to their role on the Board.
The Group reviews conduct and liability
issues as part of its annual risk review and
mitigates these exposures through
Directors and Officers’ insurance cover
where appropriate.
Board committees
We operate three Board committees,
namely the Audit Committee, the
Remuneration Committee and the
Nominations Committee, to which we
have delegated certain responsibilities.
The relationship and intra-action between
the Board, the Committees and the
executive management team is
illustrated in the diagram below.
The membership, responsibilities and
activities of the Committees are set
out in the Audit, Nomination and
Remuneration Committee Reports on
pages 52, 55 and 56 respectively.
Information and
professional development
Board papers are circulated to all members
of the Board in advance of each meeting,
and the quantity and focus of such
information is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Directors provide feedback to management
to enable the reporting formats and content
of Board papers to be enhanced, and make
individual enquiries of management for
clarification on issues whenever necessary.
The Board allows directors to take
professional and independent advice as
may be necessary in carrying out their
duties. Directors also attend training
courses, when appropriate, to ensure
they remain up to date with the latest
developments and legal requirements that
impact their individual responsibilities.
During the year, Alan Merrell held the joint
role of Finance Director and Company
Secretary. Given the development of the
Group in recent years and our desire as a
Board to demonstrate best practice, we
have decided to separate these roles and
have appointed a Company Secretary to
the Board who is expected to join the
Group in April 2016.
Performance evaluation
An external review of the performance
of the Board and its Committees was
undertaken in 2013.

Committees towards the end of 2015. My
review involved meeting with each director
on various aspects relating to the operation
of the Board and its Committees. My
findings were discussed at our December
2015 Board meeting, and we concluded
that the Board and its Committees
operated effectively during the year and
that actions previously agreed had been
implemented. We also agreed that there
were certain areas that could be further
improved in 2016, and accordingly various
actions have been agreed.
It is the Board’s intention to have the
next external review of its effectiveness
performed towards the end of 2016,
maintaining a three year cycle in line
with best practice.
Re-election
In accordance with the Articles of
Association of the Company, all directors
are subject to election at the Company’s
first Annual General Meeting following their
appointment, and all are required to seek
re-election at intervals of no more than
three years. In line with best practice, all of
the Group’s directors seek re-election on
an annual basis, and their biographical
details are detailed on page 46.
Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The directors and auditors set out their
respective responsibilities for preparing and
reviewing the financial statements in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on
page 72 and in the Independent Auditors’
Report on page 73 of this Annual Report.
Our strategy for delivering sustained value
over the longer term is set out in the
“Strategic Review” on pages 7 to 45.
Risk management and internal control
The Board maintains a system of internal
controls within the Group to manage risks
and provide a reasonable, but not
absolute, degree of assurance on the
reliability of the financial and other
information used both within the business
and for external publication, as well as
safeguarding the assets of the Group
against unauthorised use or disposition.
The systems in place are designed to Corporate governance
Continued
identify to the Board, on a timely basis,
matters that require attention so that
they may be considered and dealt with
appropriately. The Board has reviewed
the effectiveness of the systems of
internal control that were in operation
during the past financial year, and
these are summarised under the
following headings:
Control environment
There is a clearly defined organisational
structure that allows the Group’s
objectives to be planned, communicated,
executed, controlled and monitored.
The Group employs suitably qualified
staff so that the appropriate level of
authority can be delegated to ensure the
efficient management of the business.
Delegated authority is embedded
throughout the organisation, covering
the preparation and review of financial
and operational information together
with the procedures for seeking and
obtaining approval for major transactions
and organisational changes. The level
of delegated authority is reviewed
annually by the Audit Committee.
Identification and evaluation of
business risks and control objectives
The identification and evaluation of both
financial and non financial business risks
facing the Group is reviewed on a regular
basis by the Board. During this process
the effectiveness of its internal controls
in safeguarding against these risks is
considered, and where necessary
additional controls are introduced or
existing controls are enhanced.
Information systems
The management information systems
provide the Group with relevant and timely
reports from which both the Board and
senior management can monitor the
performance of the business. Budgets and
prior year data provide the Board and
senior management with comparative
information with which to assess and
monitor the performance of the various
activities of the Group. Operational
performance statistics are reviewed
against a range of measures including
competitive benchmarks and historical
trends. The Group has continued to invest
in developing and enhancing these
information systems during the year, to
ensure that the information is provided
in the most efficient manner.
Monitoring
The Executive Directors have significant
involvement in the day-to-day management
of the Group’s activities and are, therefore,
able to monitor the control procedures at
an operational and financial level. A Group
Executive Committee, comprising the two
executive directors and direct reports from
the operating subsidiaries and business
functional units, meets regularly to discuss
key operational risks and issues, monitor
business unit performance and ensure
efficient communication.
The Group maintains an internal audit
function, which is outsourced to Audit-R
Limited. The internal auditors undertake
a programme of audits across the Group.
During 2015, a series of risk meetings and
workshops were held to identify and
evaluate the key business risks, from which
a focused audit programme was developed
and agreed with the executive and the
Audit Committee. The internal audit
reports are addressed to, and reviewed by,
the Audit Committee, and appropriate
actions, if required, agreed.
Any reportable control weaknesses
identified by the Group’s external auditors
are discussed with the Audit Committee,
and reports circulated to the relevant
executive directors.
Going concern
The Group closely monitors its future
anticipated cash flows and compliance
with its banking covenants. Based on
these forecasts and the sensitivities
which have been run on different scenarios
the directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Group and Company have
adequate resources to continue in existence
for the foreseeable future. For this reason
they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the accounts.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional
shareholders
The Executive Directors hold a series of
meetings with institutional investors after
the publication of the Group’s annual
and interim financial results each year.
Meetings are also held during the year
with both existing and prospective
shareholders, to provide the opportunity
to understand the Group’s operations
and strategy in greater detail.
In addition, I maintain a regular dialogue
with major shareholders in relation to
strategy and corporate governance issues,
and Non-Executive Directors are also
available to meet major shareholders
as required. In particular, the Senior
Independent Director, Andrew Wood, is
available to meet major shareholders in
the Company, to allow any concerns to be
raised independently from the Board.
The Non-Executive Directors are also
available for questions from individual
shareholders at the Company’s Annual
General Meeting each year.
As a Board we retain the services of a
Stockbroker to ensure a regular flow of
relevant information is made available to
both current and prospective shareholders
and to facilitate feedback to assist the
Board in understanding the issues and
concerns of its shareholders.
The Annual General Meeting and
shareholder communications
The majority of the Company’s share
capital continues to be held by institutional
investors.

Whilst we do not include a formal
presentation at the Annual General Meeting
(“AGM”) for private shareholders, we do
maintain a website: www.lavendongroup.com,
which publishes financial results,
presentations, formal announcements,
and a number of corporate governance
documents for review by current and
potential shareholders. In addition, at the
Company’s AGM, the full Board, including
the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration
and Nomination Committees, are
available to answer individual questions
or concerns about the Group’s
performance and strategy.
The notice of the AGM and Annual Report
are sent out at least 20 working days prior
to the date of the AGM. It is our policy to
ensure that resolutions proposed at the
AGM remain segregated on matters which
are substantially different. In particular, the
approval of the Group’s Remuneration
Committee Report is subject of a separate
resolution. Shareholders are able to lodge
their votes through the CREST system, and
a proxy count is given for each resolution
after the voting on a show of hands.
The overall voting for each resolution is
publicly announced following the
completion of the Annual General Meeting.

Members and qualifications
of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by myself,
with both John Coghlan and John Wyatt as
members. We have all served for the
duration of 2015 and are all considered
to be independent.
As a chartered management accountant

Finance Director of FTSE 250 companies,
I am considered to have relevant financial
experience of sufficient depth to be able
to perform my role as Committee
Chairman. John Coghlan is also a
Chartered Accountant with significant
financial experience with a number of
publicly listed companies. The biographies
of all the members of the Committee
are set out on page 46.
During 2015 the Audit Committee held
four formal meetings. The meetings are
attended by the Committee members and,
by invitation, the Chairman, the Chief
Executive, the Group Finance Director, the
Group Financial Controller, the Group Tax
Manager and representatives from the
Group’s external and internal auditors.
The attendance of each director at these
meetings (and the occasions at which the
Group’s external and internal auditors
attended) is shown in the table below:

Terms of reference
The Audit Committee has written terms of

published on the Company’s website
(www.lavendongroup.com).
As the Audit Committee our principal
responsibilities are to:
• Monitor and review the integrity of the
Group’s annual and interim financial
statements, the accompanying reports
to shareholders, corporate governance
statements and any announcements
related to the Group’s financial
performance, including a review of
the significant financial reporting
judgements contained in them.
• Monitor the Group’s key areas of risk,
together with the application of policies,
procedures and practices to mitigate
these risks.

external auditors.
Activities of the
Audit Committee
At the Audit Committee meetings during

judgements reflected in the Group’s
published financial statements.

auditors regarding their audit, including
their findings on internal control and
a statement on their independence
and objectivity.
Andrew Wood
Chairman of the Audit Committee
“In 2015 we placed the
external audit of the Group
out to tender, and following a
recommendation from the
Audit Committee, the Board
is proposing to shareholders
at the Group’s forthcoming
Annual General Meeting
the appointment of
Deloitte LLP to replace
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
as external auditors to the
Group in 2016.” • The external auditors’ audit strategy

for the year ending 31 December 2015.
• Approval of the viability and going

view of the Group’s performance,
business model and strategy.

• The Audit Committee’s terms of reference.
The Audit Committee confirmed with the

necessary information for completion of
their assignments. At each meeting, the
external and internal auditors were asked
whether they wished to bring any matters
to the attention of the Committee without
the executive directors being present.
Significant areas
The significant accounting and audit matters
considered by the Committee and discussed
with the external auditors during the year
and in relation to the 2015 year end were:
Recoverability of Middle East debtors
The Committee has been regularly updated
on the economic impacts of falling oil prices
and the increased political tensions within
the Middle Eastern region.
During the course of 2015 and up until the
date of publication of this report, we have
regularly reviewed management information
regarding the trade receivable balances in
the Group’s Middle East business.
Reports detailing the amount and ageing
of overdue trade receivable balances by
territory and customer; cash collection
performance; post balance sheet date
receipts; litigation updates and details of
provisions made; were reviewed and
discussed with the external auditors.
The Committee were satisfied that the
carrying value of the Middle East trade
receivables was reasonable and sufficient
provisions had been made for amounts
considered uncollectable.
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles
We reviewed the assumptions and basis of
calculation that management used in the
modelling of future discounted cash flows
that were prepared to support the carrying
value of the Group’s goodwill and intangible
assets. In particular, the carrying value of
goodwill relating to the Group’s German
and Belgian business unit was discussed
following the continued deterioration in
trading performance in 2015 and
management’s recommendation to make
a goodwill impairment charge of £15.1m
and £5.5 million respectively in the 2015
financial statements.
The Committee were satisfied that the
assumptions and basis used in calculating
the goodwill impairment charges were
reasonable and that it was appropriate to
write off the remaining carrying values of
the goodwill relating to both the German
and Belgian businesses. We are satisfied
that the stated balance of the goodwill and
intangible assets relating to the UK
business in the Group’s balance sheet is
reasonable and supported by appropriate
calculations using acceptable assumptions.
Provision for uncertain tax positions
The Group employs experienced, and
suitably qualified tax professionals inhouse,
and seek extensive advice from professional
external advisors, in order to monitor and
assess the Group’s tax positions.
As a Committee we receive regular
updates on changes in the Group’s tax
positions and are satisfied that the
Group’s recognised and un-recognised
tax positions are appropriate.
Tangible asset useful lives
and residual values
We reviewed the annual exercise
undertaken by management to reassess
the useful lives and residual values of
the Group’s rental fleet.
The Committee, after considering the
previous useful lives achieved of similar
assets and actual residual values achieved
on disposals, together with management’s
assumptions going forward, were satisfied
that the Group’s depreciation policy
continued to be appropriate.
External audit
The Group’s external auditors are
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . As an Audit
Committee we are responsible for reviewing
the independence and objectivity of the
external auditors, and ensuring this is
safeguarded notwithstanding any provision
of any other services to the Group.
We recognise the importance of
safeguarding auditors’ objectivity and have
taken the following steps to ensure that
auditors’ independence is not compromised:
• Each year we carry out an evaluation of the
external auditor as to its independence
from the Group and its relevant officers
in all material respects and that it is
adequately resourced and technically
capable to deliver an objective audit to
shareholders. Based on this review the
Committee recommends to the Board
each year the continuation, or removal
and replacement, of the external auditor.
• We have formal policy relating to the
procurement of non-audit related work
from the Group’s external auditors. This
policy has been applied in the year and is
reviewed annually. The policy permits the
engagement of external auditors, without
the prior approval of the Committee, for
non-audit services where the fees will not
exceed 30% of the annual audit fee for
the Group, and where the services
relate to advice on the interpretation of
accounting regulations, legal matters
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Lavendon Group plc 2015   53

and other matters that have relevance to
the external audit function. In the case of
taxation services, the external auditors
can be engaged, without the prior
approval of the Committee, where the
associated fee for each individual
assignment does not exceed 30% of the
Group’s annual audit fee and the
associated fees in aggregate in any year
do not exceed the Group’s annual audit
fee. The policy specifically prohibits
engaging external auditors to make
management decisions or provide
management services, acting as an
advocate in litigation, investment banking
services, internal audit services of a
recurring nature, the design and
implementation of financial and risk
management systems and executive
search services.
• We review all fees paid for audit,
together with any consultancy fees,
to assess the likelihood of any
independence issues arising.
• The external auditors’ report to the Board
and the Audit Committee confirming their
independence in accordance with Auditing
Standards. In addition to the steps taken
by the Board to safeguard auditors’
objectivity, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
operates a five-year rotation policy for
audit partners.
Our assessment of the performance of
the external auditors for 2015 is that they
remain effective, and after reviewing the
level of fees relating to the provision of
non-audit services and the nature of that
work that they continue to be independent.
External Audit Tender
Following a detailed review of the tenure of
PwC LLP as the Group’s statutory auditors
as well as the level of non-audit services
provided by PwC LLP in the current and
also recent years, the Committee decided,
in the interests of good corporate
governance, to rotate the external audit for
the year-ending 31 December 2016 and
therefore held a formal tender process in
the fourth quarter of 2015. PwC LLP did
not take part in the tender process
leaving them available to be considered
to provide non-audit services to the
Group in the future.
We commenced the process with a
market assessment to identify suitable,
appropriately experienced audit firms to
be invited to participate in the tender for
the Group’s audit. A request for an audit
proposal from those audit firms selected
was sent towards the end of the third
quarter of 2015. A tender review
committee, chaired by myself, was
formed to review the audit proposals
and receive presentations from each
of the selected audit firms.
The tender process concluded with the
Audit Committee recommending to the
Board the appointment of Deloitte LLP to
replace PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
external auditors to the Group. The Board
has accepted this recommendation and will
propose the appointment of Deloitte LLP
as external auditors to the Group to
shareholders at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting on 14 April 2016.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for their
advice and service to the Group over many
years and their contribution to the Group’s
development during that time.
Internal audit
The Head of Internal Audit is accountable
to the Committee and attends Committee
meetings by invitation, and also meets
independently with myself.
Internal audit manage the risk management
process for the Group as ‘Group Risk Lead’,
maintaining the Corporate Risk Register and
regularly updating the Audit Committee on
changes to risks throughout the year.
The Group’s internal audit function
undertakes financial control and focused
operational audits throughout the year. The
annual audit programme is agreed by the
Committee, and reflects the required core
control reviews and business risks identified
within the Group’s Corporate Risk Register.
The function uses both internal and
external specialist resources to complete
the audit programme as appropriate.
During 2015, the internal audit function
reported to the Committee on the seven
audits completed in the year. As a
Committee we discussed the findings of
each audit and regularly monitor the
implementation and status of the audit
recommendations.
The Committee annually reviews the
resources and performance of the internal
audit function.
Whistle blowing procedure
To enable employees to raise matters of
impropriety or concern relating to financial
or other issues, we maintain an independent
reporting procedure that is available to all
employees, through which these concerns
can be raised. The service, called “Speak Up”,
is available to employees in all territories.
The procedure provides feedback to the
employee regarding the matters raised and
any subsequent actions taken.
Andrew Wood 
Chairman of the
Audit Committee
25 February 2016 The Nominations Committee is chaired by
myself, and the membership includes all of
the Board’s Non-Executive Directors.
There were no changes to the composition
of the Committee during the year.
As a Committee we have written terms of
reference, which are published on the
Company’s website (www.lavendongroup.com).
All Committee members are considered
to be independent.
Key responsibilities
Our key responsibilities as a Committee
 are to:
• Review the structure and constitution
of the Board and its committees, taking
into consideration the diversity and
balance of skills, knowledge and
experience of the directors.
• Consider succession planning for
directors and other senior executives.
• Identify and nominate candidates for
appointment to the Board when required.
• Annually review the time commitment
required of non-executive directors.
Main activities of the
Committee during the year
During 2015, we held three formal
meetings. The attendance of each of the
Committee members at these meetings is
shown in the table below:
Attendance table
Meetings Apologies

John Standen 3–
Andrew Wood 3–

The key matters considered at these
meetings were:
• Reviewed the terms of reference of the
Committee, recommending, where
appropriate, amendments to align with
best practice.
Board composition
• Reviewed the composition of the Board
and its Committees including the range
of skills, level of experience, time
commitment and balance between
executive and non-executive directors.
Following this review, we recommended
to the Board that, given the Group’s
development in recent years, the current
joint role of Finance Director and
Company Secretary be separated in line
with best practice and that a dedicated
Company Secretary to the Board be
appointed. This recommendation was
accepted and subsequently an
appropriate process was commenced
to identify suitable candidates. We have
made good progress and have
appointed a Company Secretary to the
Board who is expected to join the
Group in April 2016.
Succession planning
• During the year, the Committee has
overseen the establishment of a ‘talent
management’ programme to identify
high potential individuals that can then
be considered as part of the succession
planning for the Group’s Executive
Directors and senior management team.
This process is underway and the
Committee receives regular updates on
the progress of the programme, the
individuals identified and their respective
development plans. Alongside this
programme, a senior management
succession mapping exercise is being
completed to identify succession risks
within the Group, so that our training,
development and recruitment strategies
can be shaped accordingly.

Annual Statement by
the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee
This is my first report following the approval
of our updated remuneration policy at last
year’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).
I am pleased to report that the updated
policy as proposed was supported by
99% of shareholders.
Looking back over the Group’s performance
in 2015, further progress has been made in
the year with revenues, profitability, margins
and Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”)
all increasing over 2014. In particular, the
Group’s ROCE has continued to improve
and at 12.3%* is at its highest point for over
10 years. The continued progress in this
important financial metric for the Group is
reflected in the annual bonus scheme
award to the Executive Directors for 2015
of 26.4% of salary (21% of the maximum
bonus available).
The three year performance period for
the 2013 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
awards concludes in April 2016. The
performance conditions, that will determine
the extent that these awards will vest, are
based on return on capital employed
(ROCE) and total shareholder return (TSR)
over the three year period (each accounting
for 50% of the total award). The average
ROCE over the performance period (three
years to 31 December 2015) was 11.36%
resulting in 25% of the award linked to
ROCE performance vesting. The impact of
the weaker share price performance of
the Group in 2014 and 2015 is likely to
result in the TSR element of the award
lapsing (the performance period for which
spans the three-year period to 9 April
2016). Consequently, it is likely that
12.5% (50% x 25% of the award linked
to ROCE performance) of the 2013 award
will vest in April 2016.
The Committee is not proposing to make
any changes to the Remuneration Policy for
the year ending 31 December 2016. The
key terms of how the policy will be applied
in the year ahead are set out opposite.
• A review of Executive Directors base
salaries was carried out during the year
and an increase of 2.6% was awarded,
effective from 1 January 2016. This is in
line with the average increase awarded to
our UK workforce as a whole.
• The annual bonus scheme for 2016 will
operate in a similar manner to the
scheme that was in place for 2015, with
financial targets linked to the Group’s
profitability and ROCE, alongside personal
objectives. The maximum bonus
opportunity is 125% of salary, with 30%
of any bonus paid being deferred in
shares for three years.
• The performance conditions for the
2016 LTIP award will be similar to those
used for the 2015 grants which were
based on ROCE (40%), relative TSR (40%)
and earnings per share growth (20%).
The awards over 125% of salary will be
granted to the Executive Directors in
April 2016. The performance targets
applying to the 2016 grants are still
under consideration but will retain
measures linked to TSR and financial
performance, and will be announced
at the time awards are made.
The Director’s Remuneration Policy is not
subject to a shareholder vote this year but
has been reproduced on the following
pages for ease of reference. However, a
resolution to approve the Annual Report on
Remuneration (together with this letter to
shareholders), will be proposed at the
forthcoming AGM of the Company on
14 April 2016.

Remuneration Policy
This report sets out the Company’s overall
policy on directors’ pay as approved by
shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
The remuneration of the Company’s
executive directors comprises a base
salary, an annual performance bonus,
participation in a long-term incentive plan
with returns-based on Group performance,
together with a defined contribution
towards pension arrangements and other
benefits, as detailed in this report.
In determining the remuneration packages
of the executive directors of the Group,
and advising, where appropriate, on the
remuneration policies relating to the
Group’s senior management below Board
level, the Committee aims to ensure that:
• executives are appropriately rewarded for
their contributions to the Group, and
account is taken of their individual
responsibility and performance;
• rewards are linked to the Group’s
performance so that the interests of the
executives are aligned with those of the
Company’s shareholders;
• remuneration packages reflect current
market conditions in order to attract,
retain and motivate executives of a
high quality;
• executive shareholding is encouraged to
ensure a longer-term focus; and
• the Company complies with the UK
Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee believes that there should
be an appropriate balance in the executive
directors’ remuneration packages between
fixed and variable (performance related)
pay, that encourages the long-term success
of the Company. The chart below illustrates
the potential rewards available for the
executive directors in terms of fixed pay
only, for target performance (target
incentive payout) and out-performance
(maximum incentive payout).

Assumptions: Salary levels (on which other elements of the package are calculated) are based on those
applying on 1 January 2016. The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying those
benefits (as disclosed) for the year ended 31 December 2015. Target performance assumes a bonus of
50% of salary and 25% vesting under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). Maximum performance
assumes a bonus of 125% of salary and 100% vesting of the LTIP awards. The LTIP grant level in both
scenarios is 125% of salary each year. No share price growth has been assumed.

The individual components of the remuneration package for executive directors
are summarised below:
To attract and

performing
individuals

company
Our policy is to pay salaries at market rates for the
role, taking into account the skill level, experience of
the individual and the interests of shareholders.
Salaries are benchmarked against comparable roles
in companies of a similar size and in companies
within the industry sector.
In determining salary increases the Committee takes
into account individual performance, market data,
any changes in role or responsibility and the policy
being adopted for pay reviews elsewhere in the
Company or Group. The Committee also considers
the impact of any increase to salaries on the total
remuneration package.
Salaries are paid monthly and are normally reviewed
annually (with any changes usually effective from
1 January each year). Details of the current salaries
of the executive directors are set out in the Annual
Report on Remuneration.
An appraisal of the performance of the
individual is taken into account when salary
levels are reviewed each year.

Benefits currently comprise a company car (or cash

appropriate. There is no maximum prescribed
value but the Committee monitors the overall
cost of the benefit provision to ensure that it
remains appropriate.
Executive directors are also entitled to membership
of the all-employee Lavendon Share Incentive Plan
(‘SIP’) and participate on the same terms as other
eligible employees.
The Company does not offer a defined benefit
pension scheme, instead it provides an allowance
of up to 25% of salary that can be invested into a
defined contribution plan and/or taken as a cash
allowance in lieu of pension.

To drive and

objectives
and provide
alignment with
the returns
received by
shareholders
The LTIP permits an annual grant of shares which
vest subject to performance and continued
employment. The maximum grant policy under the
LTIP is 150% of base salary.
The executive directors are subject to shareholding
guidelines requiring them to build and maintain a
shareholding in Lavendon equivalent to 100% of
gross base salary (to increase to 200% of base salary
by 2016). In addition, the executive directors have
agreed to retain the shares received (net of tax) from
LTIP awards granted in 2015 onwards for a further
two years post vesting.
Awards under the LTIP are subject to a
relative total shareholder return performance
condition and financial performance
conditions, each measured over three
financial years.
The Committee may use different or
additional measures and adjust the weighting
of the conditions for future awards to reflect
changes in the business strategy. The
measures are designed to provide a rounded
assessment of the long-term performance
of the business and reflect the returns
delivered to shareholders.
The Committee has the discretion to reduce
the level of vesting of an LTIP award if it
considers that it is not reflective of the
underlying financial and/or corporate
performance of the Company.

The maximum annual bonus potential is 125% of

the minimum financial targets is determined each
year taking into account the circumstances at that
time. The ‘on-target’ performance bonus is set at
50% of base salary.
30% of any bonus awarded is deferred into shares
for three years.
Bonuses are based on the achievement of a
combination of financial objectives and
corporate/personal objectives. The measures
are reviewed annually and financial targets
will account for at least three-quarters of the
total bonus opportunity.
For each financial measure, normally a sliding
scale of stretching targets is set by the
Committee, which apply from the beginning of
each financial year. A minimum of financial
performance must be achieved before any
bonus relating to corporate or personal
objectives becomes payable.
The Committee retains an absolute discretion
to reclaim some, or all, of the annual bonus
paid in exceptional circumstances, such as
misstatement of results, an error in
calculating performance and/or misconduct
by the individual.

Further details on the
Deferred Share Bonus
Plan and Long-term
Incentive Plan
The awards under the Deferred Share
Bonus Plan (DSBP) and the Long-term
Incentive Plan (LTIP) will be granted in
accordance with the rules of the relevant
plan and the discretions contained therein.
The DSBP was approved by shareholders in
2012 and the LTIP in 2015. A copy of the
rules of each plan is available from the
Company Secretary on request. Awards
may be structured as a conditional award
or nil-cost options. The rules also provide
the flexibility for awards to be settled in
cash, although this is only expected to be
used in exceptional circumstances.
Unless the Committee determines
otherwise, participants will ordinarily
receive dividend equivalents on vested
shares under the DSBP and LTIP . These
may be paid in cash or shares.
Matching awards under the DSBP will no
longer be granted.
The performance measures for the LTIP
awards will be set using a sliding scale of
targets and no more than 25% of the
award (under each measure) will vest for
achieving the threshold performance
hurdle. The performance targets will be
set prior to the grant of each award and
different targets and/or weightings
between measures (from those set out
in the table above) may be set for future
award cycles.
Under the rules of the LTIP , the Committee
has the discretion to amend the targets
applying to existing awards in exceptional
circumstances providing the new targets
are no less challenging than originally
envisaged. The Committee also has the
power to adjust the number of shares
subject to an award in the event of a
variation in the capital of the Company.
The Committee has the discretion to reclaim
some, or all, of a vested DSBP and/or LTIP
in exceptional circumstances, such as a
misstatement of financial results, an error
in assessment of performance, the use of
misleading information and/or gross
misconduct on the part of the individual.
The authority to use this discretion lasts for
two years following the vesting of any award.
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee believes that executives
should be encouraged to build significant
long-term share holdings and the
remuneration policy has been designed
with this key principle in mind. The
executive directors are currently expected
to build a shareholding in the Company,
over time, equal to 100% of annual salary.
This guideline holding will increase to
200% of salary by 31 December 2016.
Furthermore, the executive directors have
agreed to retain the shares received (net
of tax) from future LTIP grants for two
years post vesting.
Legacy arrangements
Shares vesting under the 2013 LTIP awards
are not subject a post-vesting holding
period. Share vesting under the 2014 LTIP
awards are subject to a six month post-
vesting holding period. These awards,
made prior to the commencement of the
current policy, will be allowed to vest on the
terms on which they were granted.
The deferred annual bonus for 2014 was
awarded under the policy approved by
shareholders at the 2014 AGM and is
subject to the deferral arrangements
contained therein. The deferred shares vest
after one year, subject to continued
employment and a malus provision (under
which the shares will lapse if there has been
a deterioration in the deferral period of any
of the financial metrics that were used to
determine the original bonus).
Under the rules of the DSBP and LTIP , the
Committee has the discretion to amend the
performance targets applying to existing
awards in exceptional circumstances
providing the new targets are no less
challenging than originally envisaged.
The Committee also has the power to
adjust the number of shares subject to
an award in the event of a variation in
the capital of the Company.
Full details of the outstanding awards are
set out in the Annual Report on
Remuneration on page 62.
Service contracts and policy
on termination payments
Under the executive directors’ service
contracts, twelve months’ notice of
termination of employment is required by
either party. Should notice be served, the
executives can continue to receive their
base salary, benefits and pension for the
duration of their notice period. The
company applies a general principle of
mitigation in relation to termination
payments and supports the use of phased
payments. Outplacement services may be
provided where appropriate and any
statutory entitlements or sums to settle or
compromise claims in connection with a
termination would be paid as necessary.
In the event of a cessation of employment,
the executives may still be eligible for a
bonus, payable in cash, on a pro-rata basis,
but only for the period of time served
from the start of the financial year to the
date of termination and not for any period
in lieu of notice.
The rules of the DSBP and LTIP set out what
happens to outstanding share awards if a
participant leaves employment before the
end of the vesting period. Generally, any
outstanding share awards will lapse when an
executive leaves employment except in
certain circumstances. If the executive leaves
employment as a result of death, ill health,
injury, disability, retirement, redundancy,
transfer of employment or any other reason
at the discretion of the Committee, then they
will be treated as a ‘good leaver’ under the
plan rules. The share awards for a good
leaver will vest, subject to an assessment of
any performance conditions and, for the
LTIP awards only, a pro-rata reduction to
reflect the proportion of the vesting period
served. Under the terms of the LTIP , the
Committee may dis-apply the time pro-rating
requirement if it considers it appropriate to
do so. In determining whether an executive
should be treated as a good leaver and the
extent to which their award may vest, the
Committee will take into account the
circumstances of an individual’s departure. The treatment of share awards on a change
of control is the same as that set out above
in relation to a good leaver (albeit with the
vesting period automatically ending on the
date of the change in control).
Chairman and non-
executive director’s fees
and letters of appointment
The fees for the Chairman are determined
by the Remuneration Committee taking into
account views of the Chief Executive (the
Chairman excludes himself from such
discussions). Non-executive director fees
are reviewed annually by the Chairman and
Chief Executive. Fee levels are set to reflect
the responsibilities and time commitment
of the role, the experience of the individual
and their effectiveness in the role.
Benchmark research is also undertaken
against fees paid in companies of
comparable size and complexity. The fee
structure for the non-executive directors
comprises a basic Board fee, combined
with additional fees for where a Committee
Chairman or Senior Independent Director
role is also performed. The Chairman and
non-executive directors may also be
reimbursed for the grossed-up cost of any
taxable expenses incurred during the
performance of their duties. In exceptional
circumstances, additional fees may be
payable to reflect a substantial unplanned
increase in time commitment during a year.
The fees are paid monthly through the
Company’s payroll.
The Chairman and non-executive directors
have letters of appointment, which are for
a period of three years. The letters of
appointment may be terminated on giving
three months’ notice by either party.
Recruitment policy
Base salary levels will be set in accordance
with Lavendon’s remuneration policy,
taking into account the executive’s
expertise, experience and their existing
remuneration package. Where it is
appropriate to offer a lower salary initially,
a series of increases to the desired salary
positioning may be given over subsequent
years subject to individual performance.
Benefits will generally be provided in
accordance with the approved policy, with
relocation expenses/an expatriate
allowance paid if required.
The structure of the variable pay element
will be in accordance with Lavendon’s
approved policy detailed above. The
maximum possible variable pay opportunity
is 275% of base salary; being a maximum
bonus of 125% of base salary and a
maximum long-term incentive award of
150% of base salary. The structure of
variable pay would be granted on a
consistent basis to the other executive
directors. However, in the case of the
annual bonus, different performance
measures may be set taking into account
the responsibilities of the individual, and
the point in the financial year at which
they joined.
If it is necessary to buy out incentive awards
granted by a previous employer (which
would be forfeited on leaving the previous
employer), the value of the buy-out will take
into account the form of the previous award
(cash or shares), the timing of the award
and its expected value. Replacement share
awards, if used, may be granted using
Lavendon’s existing share plans to the
extent possible, although awards may also
be granted outside of these schemes if
necessary and as permitted under the
Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal promotion, any
outstanding variable pay awarded in
relation to the previous role will be allowed
to pay out according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new Chairman or non-executive
director will be set in line with the
approved policy.
External non-executive
director positions
Subject to Board approval, executive
directors are permitted to take on non-
executive positions with other companies.
Executive directors are permitted to retain
their fees in respect of such positions.
Details of outside directorships held by the
executive directors and any fees that they
receive are provided in the Annual Report
on Remuneration.
Differences in remuneration
policy for executive
directors compared to
other employees
The remuneration policy for the executive
directors is designed with regard to the
policy for employees across the Group as
a whole. There are differences in the
structure of the remuneration policy for the
executive directors, for example, a higher
emphasis on performance related pay and
increased use of shares, reflecting the
responsibilities of the position. The
Committee has not consulted directly with
employees on the executive remuneration
policy but takes into account the pay and
employment conditions of the general
workforce when considering any changes
to the quantum or structure of the
executive remuneration packages.
How the views of
shareholders are taken
into account
As part of the Committee’s annual review
of remuneration matters, consideration is
given to any feedback received from the
Company’s shareholders. The Committee
engages proactively with its shareholders,
particularly when any changes are made
to the remuneration policy, whereby the
Committee Chairman will inform major
shareholders of these in advance. Details
of votes cast for and against the resolution
to approve the prior year’s remuneration
report are provided in the Annual Report
on Remuneration.

(i) The 2015 figure relates to the bonus award for the year ended 31 December 2015. Of the total bonus award, 30% will be paid in deferred shares.
(ii) The figure in the 2015 column relates to theLTIP awards granted in 2013, which are based 50% on ROCE performance and 50% on relative TSR performance. Average ROCE over
the three financial years to 31 December 2015 was 11.36% resulting in 25% of this part of the award vesting. The TSR performance period ends on 9 April 2016; based on
performance to date, this part of the award is expected to lapse. Since the awards have not yet vested, in accordance with the regulations, the value of the shares shown in the
table above is based on the average share price over the period 1 October to 31 December 2015 of 143p.
The figure in the 2014 column relate to the vesting of the 2012 LTIP . These awards vested on 5 May 2015. The values have been updated to reflect the actual share price on
vesting of 177p and the value of dividend equivalent shares awarded on vesting.

i) The 2012 awards were subject to a performance condition requiring the Company’s ‘TSR’ performance to out-perform that of the FTSE SmallCap Index excluding Investment
Trusts (the “Index”). The Company’s TSR performance over the performance period must have been at least equal to the performance of the Index for 15% of the awards to vest,
increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the awards vesting if TSR performance is 60% or more above the performance of the index. Performance was measured over three
financial years, starting with the year in which the award is granted. Lavendon’s TSR was 30% above the index, resulting in 57.2% of the awards vesting. These awards vested on
and were exercised on 5 May 2015. In accordance with the rules of the Plan, additional awards representing the value of dividends that would have been paid on the vested
shares during the period between the date of grant and the date of vesting of the awards were also made. The total number of shares vesting to Don Kenny was therefore
167,679 and to Alan Merrell was 122,432. The share price on the date of vesting was 177p.
ii) The 2013 awards were granted on 10 April 2013 and are subject to a TSR and ROCE performance condition (each accounting for 50% of the award). TSR is measured relative to
the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap Index excluding Investment Trusts and Financial Services Companies over three years from the date of grant (with 25% vesting at median
increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance or above). For the ROCE condition, average ROCE over the three-year performance period must be at least 11.25% for 25%
vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for average ROCE of 13.25% or above.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The awards granted, vesting and exercised under this Plan relating to the executive directors are detailed in the table below:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Lavendon Group plc 2015   63
Pension contributions
in 2015
In 2015 pension contributions of £100,000
were made to Don Kenny (2014: £81,112)
and £62,500 to Alan Merrell (2014:
£59,250). For both Don Kenny and Alan
Merrell, a taxable ‘cash in lieu’ payment was
made for the total pension contribution.
Annual bonus payments
in 2015
The annual bonus scheme for 2015 was
based on a combination of financial
performance (up to 100% of salary) and
personal performance metrics (up to 25%
of salary). The Group had to deliver both a
profit before tax, amortisation and
exceptional items (PBTA) of £37.3 million
and a return on capital employed of 11.7%
before any bonus payments (either financial
or personal performance-related) would
start to accrue.
The range of performance metrics for
2015 are shown in the table below.
The Group delivered an underlying PBTA of
£38.5 million in 2015, below the ‘on-target’
threshold of £41.7 million but ahead of the
PBTA performance in 2014 of £34.1million
and the minimum threshold for the 2015
annual bonus scheme of £37.3 million.
The Group’s ROCE for 2015 was 12.3%,
ahead of the ROCE in 2014 of 12.1% but
below the ‘on-target’ threshold of 12.5%. This
combined financial performance, together
with an assessment of the delivery of
personal objectives, has resulted in an overall
bonus of 26.4% of base salary being payable
under the 2015 annual bonus scheme.
Under the annual bonus scheme policy
applying for 2015, 30% of any bonus paid is
deferred into shares for three years under
the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The deferred shares relating to the 2015
annual bonus scheme will be awarded in
April 2016.

Deferred Share Bonus Plan
The awards granted, vesting and exercised under this Plan relating to the executive directors are detailed in the table below:
These awards related to a part deferral of the 2014 bonus. The awards were granted on 6 May 2015 and the face value has been
calculated using the average share price over the preceding three days of 174.8 pence. The awards were subject to a malus provision
which stated that the awards would lapse if there was a deterioration in EBITA and/or ROCE in 2015 compared to 2014. This minimum
level of financial performance was achieved and consequently the awards will vest in full on 6 May 2016.
The deferred shares relating to the 2015 annual bonus scheme will be awarded in April 2016.
Directors’ interests
The interests of the directors in the ordinary share capital of the Company are shown below:
Long Term Incentive Plan continued
iii) The 2014 awards were granted on 10 April 2014 and are subject to a TSR and ROCE performance condition (each accounting for 50% of the award). TSR is measured relative to
the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap Index excluding Investment Trusts and Financial Services Companies over three years from the date of grant (with 25% vesting at median
increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance or above). For the ROCE condition, average ROCE over the three year performance period must be at least 11.25% for 25%
vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for average ROCE of 12.63% or above.
iv) The 2015 awards were granted on 21 May 2015 and are subject to the following performance conditions:
– 40% is based on TSR measured relative to the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap Index excluding Investment Trusts and Financial Services Companies (with 25% vesting at
median increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance or above);
– 40% is based on ROCE, where averageROCE over the three-year performance period must be at least 11.75% for 25% vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting
for average ROCE of 13.00% or above; and
– 20% is based on compound growth in earnings per share (EPS), with 25% of this part of the award vesting for 7% p.a. growth increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting
for growth of 14% p.a. or above.
Irrespective of the extent to which the performance conditions have been met, the Company’s Remuneration Committee may, at its discretion, scale back the level of vesting of the

It was the Company’s policy in 2015 that
executive directors should build a
shareholding in the Company, over time,
equal to 100% of annual salary to facilitate
the alignment of interests with those of the
Company’s shareholders. This guideline
is being increased to 200% of salary by
31 December 2016. Shares counting
towards this guideline include beneficially
owned shares. As at 31 December 2015,
Don Kenny and Alan Merrell held shares
with a value equivalent to 144% and 146%
of their base salaries respectively.
All directors’ interests are beneficially held.
There has been no change in the directors’
interests in the ordinary share capital of
the Company between 31 December 2015
and 25 February 2016.
Shareholder voting
The following remuneration related
resolutions were approved by
shareholders at the Company’s AGM
last year, on 16 April 2015.
Approval of the Annual Report on
Remuneration for 2015 will be sought
at the Company’s forthcoming Annual
General Meeting on 14 April 2016.
Company performance
The chart opposite shows the Company’s
performance, measured by ‘Total
Shareholder Return’ (TSR), compared to
the FTSE SmallCap Index excluding
Investment Trusts (the ‘Index’) for the seven
years ended 31 December 2015. The
Committee considers the Index to be the
most meaningful comparison of historic
share price performance in assessing
the Company against an index of similarly
sized businesses.
Historic CEO pay
The table opposite shows the total
remuneration for the persons holding
the role of Chief Executive over the same
seven-year period.
i) Kevin Appleton left employment with effect from 30 June 2011, and under the terms of his contact, he was entitled to
receive a termination payment, after mitigation, of £312,000. In addition to Kevin Appleton’s termination payment of
£312,000, the Committee determined that awards over 136,500 shares in the Company, previously granted under
the Company’s 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan in 2010, would vest on the date of cessation of his employment.
These awards were exercised on 9 August 2011 and had a value, on exercise, of £136,500. Both the termination
payment of £312,000 and the value of the LTIP award of £136,500 are included in the Total Remuneration figure
of £623,000 shown in the above table.
ii) Don Kenny was appointed to the position of Chief Executive on 1 October 2011

The table opposite shows the movement in
the salary, benefits and annual bonus for
the Chief Executive between the current
and previous financial year compared to
that for the average UK employee. The
Committee feels that this provides a more
appropriate comparator than movements
in the wage bill for the total workforce,
which is distorted by movements in the
number of employees and variations in
wage practices in our overseas markets.
Relative importance of
the spend on pay
A comparison of total employee pay
against the Group’s profit after tax and
distributions through dividends to
shareholders, for 2015 against 2014,
is set out in the graphs opposite.

Neither Don Kenny nor Alan Merrell
currently hold any external non-executive
director positions.
Application of the
remuneration policy
for 2016
Base salaries
As set out in my Annual Statement on
page 56, the base salaries for the executive
directors were reviewed during the year.
Base salaries were increased by 2.6%
effective from 1 January 2016 in line with
the average salary increase for our UK
workforce. The base salaries for 2016 are
therefore: Don Kenny, £410,400 and Alan
Merrell, £256,500.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus scheme for executive
directors in 2016 will again be based on
a combination of financial targets and
corporate/personal objectives. The forward
looking targets are deemed to be
commercially sensitive but retrospective
disclosure will be given in 2016’s Annual
Report on Remuneration.
Long-term incentives
LTIP awards for 2016 will be 125% of
salary for both the Chief Executive and the
Finance Director and will be made in April
2016. Vesting of the awards will be based
on performance over three financial years
to 31 December 2018.
The performance conditions for the 2016
LTIP awards are still under consideration,
but the Committee will retain a combination
of measures linked to TSR and financial
performance. The actual performance
conditions selected will be disclosed at the
time of granting the 2016 awards.
Chairman and Non-Executive
Director fees
It has been agreed that fees for the
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
will not be revised in 2016. The fees remain
at £125,000 for the Chairman and a base
fee of £40,000 for the Non-Executive
Directors with the fee of £6,000 for
chairing a board committee and a fee of
£3,000 for undertaking the role of the
Senior Independent Director.

Share capital
By resolutions passed at the Annual General
Meeting on 16 April 2015 the directors were
generally and unconditionally authorised
for the purposes of Section 551 of the
Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”), to exercise
all the powers of the Company to allot
shares and grant rights to subscribe for,
or convert any security into, shares:
a) up to an aggregate nominal amount
(within the meaning of Section 551(3) and
(6) of the Act) of £565,671 (such amount to
be reduced by the nominal amount allotted
or granted under (b) below in excess of
such sum); and
b) comprising equity securities (as
defined in Section 560 of the Act) up to an
aggregate nominal amount (within the
meaning of Section 551(3) and (6) of the
Act) of £1,131,341 (such amount to be
reduced by any allotments or grants made
under (a) above) in connection with or
pursuant to an offer by way of a rights issue
in favour of holders of ordinary shares in
proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the
respective number of ordinary shares held
by them on the record date for such
allotment (and holders of any other class
of equity securities entitled to participate
therein or if the directors consider it
necessary, as permitted by the rights of
those securities), but subject to such
exclusions or other arrangements as the
directors may consider necessary or
appropriate to deal with fractional
entitlements, treasury shares, record dates
or legal, regulatory or practical difficulties
which may arise under the laws of, or the
requirements of any regulatory body or
stock exchange in any territory or any
other matter whatsoever.
These authorisations expire at the
conclusion of the next Annual General
Meeting of the Company to be held on
14 April 2016, and the directors are
re-proposing that renewal should be
sought. Such proposals are set out as
resolutions 12 and 13 in the Notice of
the Annual General Meeting. Details of
movements in share capital during the
year are set out in note 24 to the
Group’s financial statements.
In addition, the directors have been given
power pursuant to Sections 570(1) and 573
of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) to:
a) allot equity securities (as defined in
Section 560 of the Act) of the Company for
cash pursuant to the authorisation
conferred by that resolution; and
b) sell ordinary shares (as defined in Section
560(1) of the Act) held by the Company as
treasury shares for cash, as if Section 561 of
the Act did not apply to any such allotment
or sale, provided that this power shall be
limited to the allotment of equity securities
for cash and the sale of treasury shares:
i. in connection with or pursuant to an offer
of or invitation to acquire equity securities
(but in the case of the authorisation granted
under (b) above, by way of a rights issue only)

Issue of share capital
During the year, the Company issued an
aggregate of 755,542 (2014: 882,432)
ordinary shares of one pence each:
• 617,468 shares were issued following the
exercise of awards under the Lavendon
2006 Long Term Incentive Plan;
• 99,326 shares were issued under the
Share Incentive Plan;
• 21,414 shares were issued following
the exercise of options under the
Lavendon 1996 Approved Share Option
Scheme; and
• 17,334 shares were issued under the
Deferred Share bonus Plan.
Share Option Schemes
The Company established two share option
schemes on admission of its ordinary shares
to the Official List of the London Stock
Exchange on 10 October 1996, namely:
i. the Lavendon Group 1996 Company
Share Option Plan (the ‘Employee Scheme’);
and
ii. the Lavendon Group 1996 Unapproved
Executive Share Option Scheme (the
‘Executive Scheme’).
Options were granted under the terms of
the schemes on the day following the
announcement of the Group’s interim and
annual financial results each year at an
option price equal to the mid-market
quoted share price derived from the
London Stock Exchange Daily Official List at
the close of trading on the preceding day.
The schemes were closed on reaching their
tenth anniversary on 10 October 2006, and
no further share options have been issued
under these schemes.
The value of options granted to any
individual was subject to an individual limit
such that the aggregate exercise price of all
options granted during a year could not
exceed 200 per cent of base annual salary
in the case of a director, or 100 per cent in
the case of any other employee.
Options were granted subject to the
following performance targets:
The Employee Scheme
An option would be exercisable in full if
growth in pre-exceptional earnings per
share (“EPS”) exceeded growth in the Retail
Price Index (“RPI”) over the performance
period by an average of at least 3 per cent
per annum.
The Executive Scheme
An option would not be exercisable unless
growth in pre-exceptional EPS exceeded
growth in the RPI over the performance
period by an average of at least 3 per cent
per annum. The option would be exercisable
in full if growth in EPS exceeded growth in
the RPI by an average of at least 6 per cent
per annum. The option would be exercisable
on a straight line basis between these two
percentage levels.
All performance targets were measured
over an initial three year period and to the
extent that they were met, they could be
retested. In the case of an option granted
in the period to 31 August 2003, the target
may be achieved on a three-year rolling
basis up to the tenth anniversary
of grant in the case of the Employee
Scheme, and the seventh anniversary in
the case of the Executive Scheme. Any
options granted after this date are capable
of being retested annually over 0-4 years
and 0-5 years, provided that the target is
always measured from the fixed base of
the financial year immediately prior to
grant. The option will lapse to the extent
that the target has not been achieved by
the end of the fifth year. There is a two
year period over which options can be
exercised. The options remain exercisable
until the seventh anniversary of their
date of grant.
Executive directors do not have any
outstanding grants under either share
option scheme.
Details of all other share options granted
under the terms of the schemes that still
have options exercisable at 31 December
2015 are shown below:

The Lavendon Group plc
2015 Long Term Incentive
Plan (the “Plan”)
The Plan was approved by shareholders
at the Annual General Meeting held on 16
April 2015. The Remuneration Committee
of the Company (the “Committee”)
supervise the operation of the Plan.
Eligibility
Any employee (including an executive
director) of the Company and any of its
subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in
the Plan at the discretion of the Committee.
Grant of awards
The Committee may grant an award under
the Plan either as a conditional allocation of
ordinary shares in the Company (“Shares”)
or a nil cost option with a short exercise
window. The Committee may also decide to
grant cash-based awards of an equivalent
value to share-based awards or to satisfy
share-based awards in cash, should there
be a compelling reason to do so.
The Committee may grant awards within
six weeks of the approval of the Plan by
shareholders and then within six weeks
following the Company’s announcement of
its results for any period. The Committee
may also grant awards at any other time
when there are exceptional circumstances
which the Committee considers justifies
the granting of awards.
An award may not be granted more than
10 years after the approval of the Plan by
shareholders.
The Committee will review the operation of
the Plan each year prior to making a grant.
Awards are not transferable, except on
death. Awards are not pensionable.
Individual limit
The maximum market value of Shares over
which awards may be granted to any
individual in any financial year in normal
circumstances will not exceed 150% of that
individual’s base salary.
Overall Plan limits
The Plan may use new issue Shares, treasury
Shares or Shares purchased in the market.
In any ten calendar year period not more
than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital
of the Company may be issued or issuable
under the Plan, and under any other
executive share plan.
In any ten calendar year period not more
than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital
of the Company may be issued or issuable
under the Plan and any other employee
share plan adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue
Shares for the purposes of these limits unless
institutional investor bodies decide otherwise.
Vesting of awards
Awards will normally vest on or following
the third anniversary of grant once the
Committee has determined the extent to
which the applicable performance
conditions (see below) have been satisfied
and provided the participant is still
employed in the Company’s group.
Leaving employment
As a general rule, an award will lapse upon
a participant ceasing to hold an office or
employment within the Company’s group.
However, if a participant ceases to hold an
office or employment in the group because
of death, ill health, disability, injury,
redundancy, the sale or transfer of his
employing company or business out of the
Company’s group or in other circumstances
at the discretion of the Committee, then an
award will vest when the participant ceases
to hold an office or employment with the
Company’s group. The extent to which an
award will vest will depend upon the extent
to which the performance conditions have,
in the opinion of the Committee, been
satisfied up to the date of leaving. The
award will then be pro-rated to reflect the
period of time between its grant and the
time of leaving employment, although the
Committee can decide not to pro-rate an
award if it regards it as inappropriate to do
so in the particular circumstances.
In the event that a participant retires, an
award will normally continue to the time
when vesting would have occurred if the
participant had remained an office holder
or employee with the Company’s group.
The award will vest to the extent that the
performance conditions have been
satisfied over the three year performance
period, and may then be pro-rated to
reflect the reduced period of time between
its grant and the cessation of employment.
Alternatively, the Committee may decide,
in exceptional circumstances, that the
award will vest on cessation of
employment. The award will then be
pro-rated (as described above).

Performance conditions
All awards will be subject to performance
conditions set by the Committee.
Details of LTIP awards granted to executive
directors are disclosed separately in the
Remuneration report on pages 63 to 64.
Details of all other LTIP awards granted
under the terms of the Plan at 31 December
2015 are shown on the previous page.
Deferred share bonus plan
On 19 April 2012, shareholders approved
the establishment of a deferred share
bonus plan (“DSBP”).
Eligibility
An individual is eligible to participate if
they are an employee of the Group and
has or will receive a bonus relating to all
or part of the Financial Year immediately
prior to the Financial Year in which the
award is granted.
Grant of awards
Under the terms of the plan, the
Remuneration Committee may grant two
types of award:
Conditional Awards – which convey a
conditional right to acquire shares under
the plan
Deferred award – which convey a
conditional right to acquire shares under
the plan and at a given later date
Operation
Participants of the scheme will be required to
forgo payment of part of their annual bonus
entitlement in return for a grant of awards of
equal value to the amount forgiven.
The awards will then be subject to the
performance and vesting conditions
applied by the Remuneration Committee.
Full details of the scheme can be obtained
from the Company Secretary at the
company’s registered office.
Share incentive plan
During 2007 the Company established a
Share Incentive Plan (‘the SIP’).
The SIP is a UK HM Revenue & Customs
(“HMRC”) approved plan under which the
Company can provide share benefits in a tax
advantaged way to all its UK employees on
the same terms. Details of the shares issued
under the SIP are detailed in note 25.
The SIP allows the Company to either give
“free shares” to employees or provide a
facility for employees to purchase shares
from their pre-tax salary. Shares purchased
by employees may be supplemented
by the Company with additional free
“matching shares”.
Operation
The board of directors of the Company (the
“Board”) supervises the operation of the SIP .
The SIP comprises the following three
elements and the Board may decide which
element to offer to eligible employees:
a) “Free Shares” are ordinary shares in the
Company (“Shares”) which may be allocated
to an employee.
The market value of Free Shares allocated
to any employee in any tax year may not
exceed £3,000 or such other limit as may
be permitted by the relevant legislation.
Free Shares may be allocated to employees
equally, on the basis of salary, length of
service or hours worked, or on the basis of
performance, as permitted by legislation.
b) “Partnership Shares” are Shares an
employee may purchase out of their
pre-tax earnings.
The market value of Partnership Shares
which an employee can purchase in any tax
year may not exceed £1,500 (or 10% of the
employee’s salary, if lower), or such other
limit as may be permitted by the relevant
legislation. The funds used to purchase
Partnership Shares will be deducted from
the employee’s pre-tax salary.
c) “Matching Shares” are free Shares which
may be allocated to an employee who
purchases Partnership Shares.
The Board may allocate Matching Shares to
an employee who purchases Partnership
Shares up to a maximum of two Matching
Shares for every one Partnership Share
purchased (or such other maximum ratio
as may be permitted by the relevant
legislation). The same Matching Share ratio
will apply to all employees who purchase
Partnership Shares under the SIP on the
same occasion.
An award of Shares may not be made
under the SIP later than ten years after
shareholder approval of the SIP .
Eligibility
Employees of the Company and any
designated participating subsidiary who
are UK resident taxpayers are eligible to
participate.
The Board may allow non-UK tax resident
taxpayers to participate. The Board may
require employees to have completed a
qualifying period of employment of up to
18 months in order to be eligible to
participate. All eligible employees must
be invited to participate.
Retention of shares
The trustee of the SIP trust will award Free
Shares and Matching Shares to employees
and hold those Shares on behalf of the
participants. Free Shares and Matching
Shares must usually be retained by the
trustee of the SIP trust for a period of
between three and five years after award.
The trustee will acquire Partnership Shares
on behalf of participants and hold those
Shares on behalf of the participants.
Employees can withdraw Partnership
Shares from the SIP trust at any time.
The Board may decide that awards of Free
Shares and/or Matching Shares will be                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2015   71

forfeited if participants cease to be
employed by a company in the Company’s
Group within three years from the grant of
those awards unless they leave by reason of
death, injury, disability, redundancy,
retirement on or after reaching age 50, or
the business or company for which they
work ceases to be part of the Company’s
Group. In any of those cases, the
participants will be required to withdraw
their Shares from the SIP .
If an employee ceases to be employed by
the Company’s Group at any time after
acquiring Partnership Shares, he will be
required to withdraw the Shares from the
SIP trust.
Corporate events
In the event of a general offer being made
to shareholders, participants will be able to
direct the trustees how to act in relation to
their Shares. In the event of a corporate
reorganisation any Shares held by
participants may be replaced by equivalent
shares in a new holding company.
Dividends on shares held by the
trustee of the SIP
Any dividends paid on Shares held by the
trustee of the SIP on behalf of participants
may be either used to acquire additional
Shares for employees (“Dividend Shares”) or
distributed to participants.
Rights attaching to shares
An employee will be treated as the
beneficial owner of Shares held on his
behalf by the trustee of the SIP .
Any Shares allotted under the SIP will rank
equally with Shares then in issue except for
rights attaching to such Shares by reference
to a record date prior to their allotment.
Overall SIP limits
The SIP may operate over new issue
Shares, treasury Shares or Shares
purchased in the market.
In any ten calendar year period, the
Company may not issue (or grant rights to
issue) more than 10 per cent of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company
under the SIP and any other employee
share plan adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue
Shares for the purpose of this limit unless
institutional investor bodies decide that
they need not count.
Variation of capital
In the case of a variation in the share capital
of the Company, Shares held in the SIP will
be treated in the same way as other shares.
Alterations to the SIP
The Board may, at any time, amend the SIP
in any respect, provided that the prior
approval of shareholders is obtained for
any amendments that are to the advantage
of participants in respect of the rules
governing eligibility, limits on participation,
the overall limits on the issue of Shares or
the transfer of treasury Shares, the basis for
determining a participant’s entitlement to,
and the terms of, Shares to be acquired
and the adjustment of awards.
The requirement to obtain prior
shareholder approval will not, however,
apply to any minor alteration to benefit the
administration of the SIP , to take account
of a change in legislation or to obtain or
maintain favourable tax, exchange control,
or regulatory treatment for any participant
or any company in the Company’s Group.
General
Awards made under the SIP are not
transferable other than to the participant’s
personal representatives in the event of
their death. No benefits received under
the SIP will be pensionable.
Directors’ interests in
significant contracts
No directors were materially interested in
any contract of significance.
Insurance of directors
The Company has put in place insurance to
cover its directors and officers against the
costs of defending themselves in civil legal
proceedings taken against them in that
capacity and in respect of damages
awarded in such proceedings.
The Group maintains insurance for
Lavendon Group plc’s directors in respect
of their duties as director, which is a
qualifying third party indemnity provision
for the purposes of the Companies Act
2006. This cover was in place during the
financial year and at the date of approval
of these financial statements.

Statement of directors’
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for
preparing the annual report, the directors’
remuneration report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to
prepare financial statements for each
financial year. Under that law the directors
have prepared the financial statements for
the Group in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union, and the
parent company financial statements in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law). Under company law the
directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that
they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Group and the Company and
of the profit or loss of the Group for that
period. In preparing these financial
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting
estimates that are reasonable and
prudent; and
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union and applicable UK
Accounting Standards have been
followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in
the Group and parent company financial
statements respectively.
The directors are responsible for keeping
adequate accounting records that are
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of
the Company and the Group and enable
them to ensure that the financial statements
and the directors’ remuneration report
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and,
as regards the financial statements of the
Group, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They
are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Company and of the Group
and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the
maintenance and integrity of the Group
website www.lavendongroup.com.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the Annual
Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced
and understandable and provides the
information necessary for shareholders to
assess the Group’s performance, business
model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and
functions are listed in the Governance
section on pages 46 to 47 confirm that,
to the best of each person’s knowledge
and belief:
• the Group financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true
and fair view of the assets, liabilities,
financial position and profit of the Group;
• the Strategic Report on pages 7 to 45
includes a fair review of the development
and performance of the business and
the position of the Group, together with
a description of the principal risks and
uncertainties that it faces.
Independent auditors and
disclosure of information
to auditors
In accordance with Section 418 of the
Companies Act 2006, each director in office
at the date of the Directors’ Report is
approved, confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no
relevant audit information of which the
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• he has taken all the steps that he ought
to have taken as a director in order to
make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that
the Company’s auditors are aware of
that information.

Our opinion
In our opinion, Lavendon Group plc’s Group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise:
• the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2015;
• the Group income statement and the Group statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the Group cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• the Group statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements.
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union.
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: £2.1 million which represents 5% of underlying operating profit, being
operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items.
• We performed a full scope audit on seven separate reporting units.
• The reporting units audited included the four largest trading entities in the Group.
• The audits were conducted by the Group engagement team in the UK and by local PwC network firms
operating under our instruction in Germany, France and the Middle East.
• Recoverability of accounts receivable.
• Goodwill impairment assessment.
• Provision for uncertain tax positions.
• Tangible asset useful lives and residual values.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular,
we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk
of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to
provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read
in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Lavendon Group plc – continued
74   Lavendon Group plc 2015
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Recoverability of accounts receivable
Refer to page 53 (Audit Committee Report),
page 83 (Significant judgements and estimates)
and page 98 (notes).
The Group has significant operations in the Middle
East and its accounts receivable balance includes
a significant amount of overdue debt in the Middle
East operating segment. In recent years the
Middle Eastern business has experienced difficulty
in recovering significantly aged debt and there is
a material provision in place against overdue
amounts. Management apply a board approved
policy to the whole of the Middle East segment in
order to provide for accounts receivable. They
assess the policy annually, undertaking a process
by which they assess the recoverability of individual
debt and determine the appropriate provision
amount. This includes a review of the movement
during 2015 of balances that were outstanding at
31 December 2014. No amendment to the policy
was made during 2015.
We developed an understanding of the controls in place surrounding credit
control and debtor recoverability, both in the Middle East and at Head Office,
finding no issues that would cause us to amend our detailed testing plan.
We tested the integrity of reports detailing the level of debt by age bracket,
territory and customer by testing a sample to invoices and identified no exceptions.
We then used those reports to identify our sample to test the recoverability of
balances, focusing on large, old balances, which we did by agreeing them to post-
year end cash collection where possible or by reading correspondence with the
customers concerned: our assessment of the recoverability of individual balances
did not indicate that the directors’ provision was materially misstated.
We assessed the board approved provisioning policy specific for Middle East
receivables by considering the historical collection from aged customers and
understood the movements of aged debtors from the prior year. We used this
to challenge the assumptions therein and found them to be appropriate to
the circumstances.
The Group engagement team worked closely with the PwC Middle East audit team.
The Group engagement leader visited PwC Middle East during the pre-year end
planning phase and we sent PwC Middle East detailed instructions at the
beginning of the audit, clarifying that the recoverability of debtors was an area
of focus. Group engagement team also reviewed the work performed by PwC
Middle East and attended the audit clearance meeting in Dubai.
Goodwill impairment assessment
Refer to page 53 (Audit Committee Report),
page 83 (Significant judgements and estimates)
and page 91 (notes).
We focused on this area because the
determination of whether or not an impairment
charge for goodwill and other intangible assets
was necessary involved significant judgements
about the future results of the businesses and
the wider economies in which they operate,
particularly the long term growth rates, profit
margins and the discount rate.
In particular, we focused on the CGUs in Belgium
and Germany. When planning our audit, we
determined that we needed to focus on the
German CGU as the level of headroom identified by
the directors during their impairment assessment
was low in comparison to the prior year and the
Belgium CGU because the Group recognised an
impairment charge of £8.8m in the prior year in
respect of the Belgian goodwill and profit is
continuing to decline. This was following profit
decline in recent years due to challenging
conditions within the construction industries in
those two territories in particular.
Following management’s assessment as part of
their own year-end procedures, all amounts of
goodwill in relation to Belgium and Germany
were fully written off. Following this write off, we
identified a further risk of overstatement of the
impairment charge.
For all segments with goodwill (prior to impairment), we evaluated the directors’
future cash flow forecasts and the process by which they were drawn up,
including comparing them to the latest Board approved budgets, which
contained the level of detail that we needed, and testing the integrity of the
underlying calculations, identifying no exceptions.
We used our valuation expertise to create our own independent expectation to
challenge the key assumptions, by:
• comparing the directors’ assumptions for long term growth rates and profit
margins in the forecast to historical results and general economic forecasts; and
• comparing the discount rate with the cost of capital for the company and
comparable organisations adjusted for local market risk.
We found the assumptions used by the directors to be largely consistent with
our expectations and materially appropriate.
In respect of Belgium and Germany, we found the assumptions for long term
growth (1% and 1.5% respectively) and discount rate (13.3% and 11.0%
respectively) to be acceptable. Based on our testing, we concurred with the
decision to fully write off both the Belgian and the German goodwill.
We read and considered the disclosures made by the directors in relation to the
assumptions impacting the impairment of goodwill held in Belgium and
Germany and found them to be consistent with our testing and compliant with
the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment’.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2015   75
Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the
group operates.
The Group is structured with 6 operating segments, as shown in note 2 in the notes to the financial statements, being the geographical
trading locations of the UK, Germany, Belgium, France, the Middle East and a non-operating Corporate cost centre. The Group financial
statements are a consolidation of a number of reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating businesses and centralised functions,
which make up the operating segments, and a number of other non-trading Group entities.
Accordingly, of the Group’s reporting units, we identified 7 (being Head Office and 6 trading entities, being the UK, Germany, France and the
three financially largest reporting units within the Middle East) that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information,
either due to their size or their risk characteristics. These entities provide a significant level of coverage over the consolidated accounts
(including 91% of consolidated revenues and 93% of consolidated underlying operating profit).
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Provision for uncertain tax positions
Refer to page 53 (Audit Committee Report), page 83
(Significant judgements and estimates) and pages 88
and 99 (notes).
The Group operates in a number of overseas
territories and is therefore subject to various risks
of non-compliance with domestic legislation. The
Group is also commonly the subject of tax
inspections and enquiries by relevant local
authorities in the normal course of business and
these enquiries could lead to additional tax and
penalties being levied against the Group. The
Group holds a provision to reflect the risk
associated with these uncertain tax positions.
We focused on this area because the determination
of whether to provide for an uncertain tax position
involved significant judgement about the likelihood
that one will crystallise.
We held discussions with the Group’s tax advisors in the various territories in
order to understand any ongoing investigations and conclusions reached
during the year.
Using our experience of similar tax investigations in these territories, we
evaluated the appropriateness of the recognition or non-recognition of the
benefits or liabilities associated with these tax positions, and the treatment
of any related interest. We found that the positions taken by the Directors
were appropriate.
Tangible asset useful lives and residual values
Refer to page 53 (Audit Committee Report), page 83
(Significant judgements and estimates) and pages 91
and 92 (notes).
We focused on this area because the Group owns
a significant level of fleet assets (net book value
£277.6m) and the estimates of their useful lives
and residual values have a significant impact on
the financial statements both in terms of the
annual depreciation charge and the profits
recognised on the disposal of fixed assets.
The directors are required to reassess useful lives
and residual values annually in accordance with
IFRS to ensure they remain appropriate, and have
done so, concluding that they are consistent with
the accounting policies noted within page 106.
We challenged the directors’ assessment by:
• comparing the estimated useful economic lives and residual values of fleet
assets to the actual useful economic life and proceeds from the sale of similar
assets that were disposed of during the previous 7 years;
• considering the impact on useful economic lives of the directors’ plans and
expectations for the business; and
• considering whether the judgements underpinning the estimates useful
economic lives were consistent with the judgements made by the directors
elsewhere in the financial statements.
We did not identify any exceptions in our testing of the directors’ assessment. 76   Lavendon Group plc 2015
Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Lavendon Group plc – continued
The audits of these 7 reporting units were performed by either the Group engagement team or by other PwC network firms operating
under the instruction of the Group engagement team. We sent detailed group instructions to all of those component auditors, in which we
identified and explained the areas where we wanted them to focus their work. We then held meetings and calls with them to clarify and
discuss their audit approach, materiality and reporting requirements. This, together with additional procedures performed at the Group
level, including analytical procedures and certain tests of detail over specific balances and transactions, gave us the evidence we needed
for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These,
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually
and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £2.1 million (2014: £1.9 million).
How we determined it 5% of underlying operating profit, being operating profit before amortisation of acquired intangibles
and exceptional items. This is consistent with the prior year.
Rationale for benchmark applied We considered this to be the key financial benchmark used by the key stakeholders to evaluate
performance of the Group.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.1 million (2014:
£0.1 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 50, in relation to going concern. We have
nothing to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the
directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the
directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have
concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinions
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 48 to 51 with respect to internal control and risk
management systems and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 72, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland).
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements,
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive
procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Lavendon Group plc 2015   83
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2015
1.   BASIS OF PREPARATION
General information
Lavendon Group plc (‘the Company’ or with its subsidiaries ‘the Group’) is the European and Middle Eastern market leader in the rental of
powered access equipment operating a fleet of approximately 21,000 machines through a network of 70 active depots located in Belgium,
France, Germany, the UK and a number of countries in the Middle East.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is 15 Midland Court, Central Park, Lutterworth, Leicestershire LE17 4PN.
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS’s”)
and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group
financial statements have been prepared, on a going concern basis, on a consistent basis, under the historical cost convention as modified
by financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the profit or loss. A summary of the more significant Group accounting policies is set
out in note 30 on page 102.
The Parent Company has adopted Financial Reporting Standards 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). Its results, reported
under FRS 101, are detailed on pages 111 to 118.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the
amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. All material
intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Consistent accounting policies have been
adopted across the Group.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair
values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Subsidiary undertakings include all entities which are controlled by the Group. Specifically the Group has control over the investee,
exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the ability to use its control over the investee to affect
the amount of the returns from the investee.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Details of the subsidiaries of the Group are given in note 4 of the Parent Company financial statements on pages 114 and 115.
Significant judgements and estimates
Significant estimates have been used in respect of the calculation of the residual values of property, plant and equipment, the calculation of any
impairment to the carrying value of goodwill, the valuation of intangible assets recognised on acquisition, and the trade receivables provision.
The residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are estimated based on management’s historic experience of
disposals of such used equipment and their judgement of the current market conditions.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using estimating long-term growth rates and
appropriate judgements of discount rates, based on historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of future prospects. Other
intangible assets are tested for impairment if there are indications they might be impaired. Full details of the judgements and estimates
used are given in note 12.
The fair value of intangibles recognised on acquisition is derived from a combination of previous knowledge, experience and consultation
with independent valuers.

Notes to the financial statements
Continued
1.   BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED
The trade receivables provision is based on management’s best estimate of the recoverability of specific customer balances, after taking
into account the recent payment experience, underlying economic climate and discussions with key customers.
Equity settled share based payment schemes require management to estimate the fair value of each award at the grant date and estimate
the number of options expected to vest by adjusting for expected leavers. In making these assumptions management apply option pricing
models using externally obtainable actual and historic inputs where possible. The expected number of leavers is based on historic trends
and is adjusted based upon management’s judgement where considered appropriate.
The Group operates in a number of overseas territories and is subject to tax inspections and enquiries by local authorities. A provision is held
to reflect the risks associated with uncertain tax positions, the determination of which necessitates management judgement. The Group
recognises these uncertain tax positions based on a combination of previous knowledge, experience and consultation with external advisors.
2.   SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
The internal reporting arrangements for Lavendon Group plc comprises of five operating segments based on the geographical locations of
the UK, the Middle East, Germany, France and Belgium and one non operating Corporate cost centre. The Corporate cost centre comprises
the Group directorate, statutory compliance and Group functions and holds the Group’s bank borrowing facilities.
The Group’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the Group Board. The Group Board reviews the Group’s internal reporting in order
to monitor and assess performance of the operating segments for the purpose of making decisions about allocation of resources.
Performance is evaluated based on actual results compared to agreed targets and performance in prior periods.

Corporation taxation:
– current year 6,492 7,293
– adjustment in respect of prior years 179 (175)

– adjustment in respect of prior years 728 180
– taxation movement on share based payments (2) (21)
Total deferred tax 1,167 (12) 
Taxation charge 7,838 7,106
The taxation charge on the underlying profit is £8,084,000 (2014: £7,704,000). The taxation credit on amortisation of intellectual property
and intangibles recognised on acquisitions and exceptional items is £246,000 (2014: £598,000), see note 3.
In addition to the amount of taxation charged to the income statement, net tax of £42,000 (2014: £159,000) was charged (2014: credited)
directly to reserves in respect of share based payments. This comprises a current tax credit of £125,000 (2014: £191,000) in respect of
options exercised during the year and a deferred tax charge of £167,000 (2014: £32,000) representing the reduction (2014: reduction) in
the deferred tax asset held in respect of share based payments.
Following a review of the potential for profit distributions from the Group’s overseas subsidiaries a further deferred tax provision of
£172,000 (2014: £636,000) including a prior year adjustment of £67,000 has been made in the financial statements for withholding tax
liabilities that may arise upon any future distributions of profit to the United Kingdom from overseas subsidiaries.
Reconciliation of taxation
The tax charge for the year is higher (2014: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20.25% (2014: 21.50%).
The differences are explained below:
2015 2014
£’000 £’000
Profit before taxation 16,156 20,982
Profit at standard rate of corporation tax in the UK: 20.25% (2014: 21.50%) 3,272 4,511
Adjustments to tax in respect of prior years – current tax 179 (175)
Adjustments to tax in respect of prior years – deferred tax 728 180
Effect of overseas tax rates (47) 748
Potential withholding taxes on unremitted overseas earnings 105 636
Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 372 108
Exceptional impairment charge not deductible for tax purposes 4,167 1,906
Additional tax losses recognised – (945)
Effect on deferred tax due to the tax rate change in the UK (1,002) –
Tax losses not recognised 64 137
7,838 7,106
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, the standard rate of corporation
tax applied to the Group’s UK profits for the accounting period is 20.25%.
In the July 2015 Budget Statement, it was announced that the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK will be further reduced to 19%
with effect from 1 April 2017 and to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020. These changes were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015 and
are therefore reflected in the deferred tax balances in these financial statements.

Diluted earnings per share 13,876 169.7 8.18p
Underlying earnings per share
Basic 26,379 168.6 15.65p
Diluted 26,379 169.7 15.54p
Earnings per share are calculated on the 169,392,703 weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the year ended
31 December 2015 (year ended 31 December 2014: 168,556,682).
Diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares which arise from share incentive scheme awards
granted to employees, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary share capital during the
year. The effect of this dilution is to increase the weighted average number of ordinary shares to 170,262,717 (year ended 31 December
2014: 169,729,849).
Underlying earnings per share is presented to exclude the impact of amortisation charges and exceptional items in the year and their
associated tax effect. The directors believe that underlying earnings per share provides additional relevant information about underlying
business performance.

The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2015 of 3.70 pence per ordinary share
which will distribute an estimated £5,400,000 of shareholders’ funds. It will be paid on 21 April 2016 to those shareholders who are on the
register at 4 March 2016 subject to approval at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination was allocated, at date of acquisition, to the cash generating unit that benefited from that
business combination. The directors consider that a cash generating unit is generally an individual country of operation.
Where there is a change in the way the Group manages and operates the goodwill allocation to individual cash generating units is
reviewed and reallocated where appropriate.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. For the purpose
of determining potential goodwill impairment, recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow
projections based on financial plans covering a three year period. The growth rate assumptions used in the plans are based on past
performance and management’s expectations of market developments. The growth rate assumptions used to determine the cash flows
beyond the three year period are 2% for UK, 1.5% for Germany and 1% for Belgium (2014: 2% for UK and Germany and 1% Belgium).
The pre-tax rate used to discount the projected cash flows for the UK is 10.0% (2014: 10.0%), for Germany it is 11.0% (2014: 10.0%)
and for Belgium it is 13.3% (2014: 12.3%).
The impairment review identified that an exceptional impairment charge of £5,492,000 (2014: £8,868,000) was required against the
goodwill arising on the acquisition of dk Rental N.V in Belgium and an exceptional impairment charge of £15,088,000 (2014: £nil) against
the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Gardemann group of companies in Germany.

Note
In 2014, the Group refinanced its existing bank facilities, originally scheduled to be renewed in July 2016, and extended them to July 2019 at a lower margin cost.
Costs of £964,000 associated with the completion of the bank refinancing have been fully written off to the income statement as an exceptional item in 2014.
In addition, the Group issued two new loan notes on the US Private Placement market, each with a value of €17.5 million, finally maturing in August 2021 and August
2024 respectively. Costs of £366,000 associated with the two new US Private Placements are being amortised over the term of each loan note, split equally for each note.
Following the refinancing, the Group’s debt facilities total c.£165 million and comprise revolving bank facilities of £50 million and €60 million together with US Private
Placements with a combined value of €95 million.

22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
returns for shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the overall cost of capital.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital risk management during the year.
Consistent with other companies in the rental industry, the Group monitors capital by measuring the return on capital employed and the
ratio of net debt to equity:
2015 2014
£’000 £’000
Total borrowings (note 19) 131,799 108,238
Less: unamortised debt issue costs (note 19) (726) (904)
Less: cash and cash equivalents (note 16) (11,915) (17,660)
Net debt after unamortised debt issue costs 119,158 89,674
Total equity 222,901 220,620
Debt to equity ratio 53% 41%
Return on capital employed 12.7% 12.1%
The ratio of net debt to equity increased during the year, due to the increase in the level of net debt exceeding the increase in total equity
that was principally derived from profits generated during the year. During the year the Group has complied with its banking covenants,
and expects to remain compliant for the foreseeable future.

22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
The Group has exposure to the following principal risks:
• market risk;
• credit risk; and
• liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall risk management policy aims to minimise the potential adverse effects of financial markets on the Group’s financial
performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out centrally by the Group except for customer credit risk which is the responsibility of each operational entity.
1. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the Group’s income, or its financial instruments, will be affected by changes in market prices, for example interest
rates or foreign exchange rates. The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on its financial liabilities. The risk is currently managed by
maintaining a proportion of borrowings at fixed interest rates, principally the loan placements undertaken during in 2012 and 2014.
The Group also has exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. This risk is minimised through the use of foreign currency
borrowings and net investment hedging. The effect on the Group’s 2015 results due to movements in foreign exchange rates is presented
in the Strategic report on pages 26 to 33.
2. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations. Such risk arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and cash and bank balances.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is shown in the table below:
2015 2014
£’000 £’000
Cash and cash equivalents (note 16) 11,915 17,660
Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments (note 15) 68,769 60,355
80,684 78,015
Cash and cash equivalents
Surplus cash is held in current and deposit accounts with established financial institutions. No material amounts are held in financial
institutions with a Moody’s credit rating below Baa.
Trade and other receivables
The management of credit risk exposure to customers is the responsibility of each operation who have formal credit policies in place to
mitigate this risk. The credit policies require that the credit worthiness of a customer is assessed prior to trading and that the level of
exposure to that customer remains within agreed credit limits. To support these policies, the Group maintains credit insurance for certain
operating subsidiaries.
The Group’s only exposure to concentrations of credit risk is to geographic and industry sector risk. As set out in the Strategic Report on
pages 7 to 45 the construction sector is an important market and particularly sensitive to pricing levels. This exposure is actively managed
with efforts being focused on widening the Group’s customer base to other sectors.
No individual customer makes up more than 3% of revenue (2014: 3%). 22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

Euros 14,480 13,200
Middle East currencies 31,298 24,442
68,769 60,355
3. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group aims to achieve a balance
between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost effective borrowing structure. The Group has committed bank facilities of £50 million and
€60 million which finally mature in July 2019. The Group has a loan placement with a value of €60 million and two loan replacements each
with a value of €17.5 million, that finally mature in July 2019, August 2021 and August 2024 respectively. This is supplemented by hire
purchase and finance lease facilities. The Group aims to ensure that there are sufficient funds or credit lines available to supplement cash
flows generated from trading to meet known obligations in the next twelve months. An analysis of liquidity risk, being the maturity of
financial liabilities and the undrawn committed borrowing facilities is presented in note 21.
The Group’s financial liabilities are analysed in note 20.

23. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES CONTINUED
During the year, a deferred tax asset has been recognised relating to brought forward tax losses with a value of £15,092,000 (2014:
£18,905,000). Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that there is convincing evidence to support the
realisation of the related tax benefit through future profits.
There are unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to trading losses in overseas operations. The losses which have not been recognised
amount to £3,322,000 (2014: £18,812,000). The tax values associated with these losses are £880,000 (2014: £5,116,000). The reduction
in the year results from the Group’s decision to withdraw the majority of the claims made in the UK in respect of trading losses in its
European operations.

• the Lavendon Group 1996 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (the “Executive Scheme”);
• the Lavendon Group Share Matching Plan 2005 (the “Plan”);
• the Lavendon Group Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”); and
• the Lavendon Group Share Incentive Plan (the “SIP”).
The total charge for the year relating to the five equity settled compensation plans was £702,000 (2014: £501,000), all of which related to
equity settled share based payment transactions. After deferred tax (debited)/credited to the income statement, the total charge was
£700,000 (2014: £480,000).
Share option schemes
The Company established two share option schemes on 10 October 1996. The Company has made periodic grants of options under both
schemes, details of which are given in the Directors’ report on pages 67 to 72. Both the Employee Scheme and the Executive Scheme
closed in October 2006. Consequently no further awards have been made since that date.
The fair value of the share options is based on historic volatility of the share price over the last five years. The expected life is the average
expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the
assumed option life.
A reconciliation of the option movements over the year to 31 December 2015 is shown below:

25. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED
Long term incentive plan
The Lavendon Group Long Term Incentive Plan (“the LTIP”) was approved at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 16 April 2015.
2012 awards:
The performance condition was based on the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the performance of the FTSE
Small Cap Index excluding Investment Trusts over the performance period. The number of shares which vested was dependent upon
relative achievement against agreed criteria.
2013 and 2014 awards:
There are two performance conditions applying to the 2013 and 2014 awards. 50% of the award is subject to a performance condition
comparing the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against a comparator group of companies comprising the FTSE Small Cap Index
(excluding investment trusts and financial services companies) over three years commencing on the date of grant of the award. The
remaining 50% of the award is subject to a performance condition based on the average Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of the Group
over three financial years ending on 31 December. A general performance underpin also applies. The number of shares which vest under
both performance conditions is dependent upon relative achievement of each condition against agreed criteria.
2015 awards:
There are three performance conditions applying to the 2015 awards. 40% of the award is subject to a performance condition comparing
the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against a comparator group of companies comprising the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding
investment trusts and financial services companies) over three years commencing on the date of grant of the award. 40% of the award is
subject to a performance condition based on the average Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of the Group over three financial years
ending on 31 December. The remaining 20% of the award is subject to a performance condition based on the growth in EPS of the Group
over three years commencing on the date of grant of the award. The number of shares which vest under both performance conditions is
dependent upon relative achievement of each condition against agreed criteria.
The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the awards made in 2015 are detailed below:

Share Incentive Plan (“The SIP”)
In November 2007 the Group introduced the Lavendon Group plc Share Incentive Plan.
99,326 SIP shares (2014: 13,256) were issued during the year of which 41,834 shares were SIP matching shares (2014: 5,302). The fair
values are calculated by applying the following models:
Share Incentive Plan – Black-Scholes option pricing model:
Share price                                     Price at date of grant
Exercise price                                 Nil pence per share
Expected share price volatility     29.2% – 30.6%
Expected share price volatility is estimated by calculating the annualised daily volatility of the share price over the preceding three years. 
Expected dividends                       Based on historical dividend yield
Risk-free interest                            4.5%
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages. 26. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Impact of new accounting standards
There are no new standards which impact the financial statements as at 31 December 2015.
As at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards were in issue but not yet endorsed by the EU.
These standards were available for early adoption but the Group has not applied these standards in the preparation of the financial
statements. Adoption of these standards is not expected to have a material impact on the Group:
• Amendment to IAS19 ‘Employee benefits’ on defined benefit plans
• Annual improvements 2012
• Annual improvements 2013

30. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Impact of new accounting standards continued
New or revised accounting standards and interpretations issued by 31 December 2015 but not yet effective are listed below:
• Annual improvements 2014
• IFRS9 ‘Financial instruments’ − classification and measurement
• Amendment to IFRS9 ‘Financial instruments’ regarding general hedge accounting
• Amendment to IAS16 ‘Property plant and equipment’ and IAS38 ‘Intangible assets’, on depreciation and amortisation
• IFRS15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’
• IFRS16 ‘Leases’ – recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and
services provided to customers outside of the Group, stated net of returns and value added and other sales taxes.
Revenue from rental fleet hire is recognised on a daily basis over the period of hire when the Group can reliably measure the likely flow of
economic benefits. Other revenue, including the sale of new and ex-rental fleet equipment, is recognised as at the point at which the goods
or services are delivered to and accepted by the customer.
The Group rents equipment under short term arrangements that are cancellable by the customer on demand. These are treated as
operating lease arrangements.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, that is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments,
has been identified as the Group Board.
The operating segments are the main geographic areas in which the Group operates together with one non operating corporate cost
centre. The Group’s main geographic areas are the UK, the Middle East, Germany, France and Belgium.
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency. Items
included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment
in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date,
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are
subject to effective cash flow or net investment hedges which are recorded in equity. Translation differences on non-monetary items are
reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in either equity or the income statement as appropriate.
Group companies
The results and financial position of overseas Group entities are translated into Sterling as follows:
• assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; and
• income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, where effective, are taken to equity. Tax charges and credits attributable
to those exchange differences are also taken directly to equity. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised
in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate.

30. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Financial instruments
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss,
loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised cost. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments
were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this position at
each reporting date.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial instruments held for trading and those assets designated
at fair value through profit or loss. A financial instrument is classified in this category if it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling or
repurchasing in the short term or if it is a financial instrument so designated by management on initial recognition. Derivative financial
instruments are included as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Items in this category are classified as current assets
or current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised cost
Loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised costs are non-derivative financial instruments with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a
debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. They are initially measured at fair value. Other liabilities at amortised cost are initially
recognised at fair value. They are included in current liabilities, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance
sheet date, which are classified as non-current liabilities.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are included in
the income statement in the period in which they arise. Loans and receivables and other liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired. Impairments of such financial assets are recorded in the income statement.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for equipment rental or other products or services performed in the ordinary course
of business. If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are classified as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect
all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for issue costs. Issue costs arising from a modification of a
borrowing facility are amortised over the period of the borrowing or until the facility is considered to be “extinguished” at which point any
unamortised costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs associated with the re-negotiation of an existing facility,
that are not separately identifiable are treated as an extinguishment and are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at
their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedging
instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as:
• cash flow hedges – hedges of floating interest rate transactions; or
• net investment hedges – hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception, as well as its risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Movements on the hedging reserves in equity are
shown in the Group statement of changes in equity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2015 105
30. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities continued
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges
are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss (for
instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition
of a non-financial asset or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial
measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria
for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast
transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative
gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Net investment hedges
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is
recognised in equity; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and
losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Non-hedging derivatives
Changes in the fair value of any derivative financial instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in
the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial instruments traded in organised active financial markets is based on quoted market prices at the close of
business on the balance sheet date. Financial assets held by the Group are valued on a mark to market basis by financial institutions.
The fair value of financial instruments for which there is no quoted market price is determined by a variety of methods incorporating
assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar
instruments are used for long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value
for the remaining financial instruments.
Fair value measurements are undertaken using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the measurements,
according to the following levels:
Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is,
as process) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).
Level 3 Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data ( that is, unobservable inputs).
Leases
Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the
minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the
finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in financial liabilities – borrowings.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are
depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and its lease term.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the periods benefiting from the incentives.

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
• the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; and
• it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
• the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow
will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the
likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. Provisions are recorded
separately in the financial statements where material.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance expense.
Where the Group expects amounts to be received in relation to a provision, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when its
receipt is considered certain.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairments in value. Cost includes
the initial purchase price of the asset and any directly attributable costs of bringing it into its intended use. Additional transportation costs
incurred to move existing fleet between operating segments are expensed in the year in which they are incurred. Depreciation is provided
on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful
lives. Estimated useful lives and residual values are as follows:
Useful lives Residual values
Short leasehold properties the lease period nil
Rental fleet 7 to 13 years 0-20%
Office fixtures and equipment 3 to 4 years nil
Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years nil
Residual values and useful economic lives are reassessed annually.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable
net assets of a subsidiary acquired at the date of acquisition. Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date. Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the
accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those of the Group.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there
are indications that goodwill might be impaired. An impairment charge is recognised for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill
exceeds its fair value.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold, allocated where necessary
on the basis of relative fair value.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Other intangible assets acquired as part of an
acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill, if those assets are separable and their fair value can be measured
reliably. Intangible assets acquired separately from the acquisition of a business are capitalised at cost.
Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of an internal project are capitalised as intangible assets provided that a number of criteria
are satisfied. These include the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it is available for use or sale, the availability of adequate
resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset and how the asset will generate probable future economic benefit.
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition are detailed in note 12. They are estimated to have asset lives in the range of 1 to 6 years and
are amortised on a straight-line basis accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2015 107
30. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Other intangible assets continued
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over 3 to 5 years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will
generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Computer software development costs recognised as
assets are amortised on a straight line basis over 3 to 5 years. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are
recognised as an expense as incurred.
Intellectual property
Intellectual property comprises trademarks and patents which are initially recognised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over
a period of up to 5 years.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to
depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). In
assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows of the cash generating units are discounted to their present value using a
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and associated risks.
The directors consider that a cash generating unit is generally an individual country of operation.
Employee benefit costs
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into an independently administered fund.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all
employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The cost of providing these benefits, recognised in
the income statement, comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
Following the acquisition of the Gardemann group of companies in 2006, the Group now has an obligation to a single ex-employee of the
Gardemann group under a defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme is unfunded, but a full provision of £138,000 (2014: £159,000), based
on an actuarial valuation, is included in the Group’s balance sheet under accruals. Given the immateriality of this single obligation to the Group
as a whole, management do not consider the full disclosure required by IAS19 (revised) “Retirement Benefits” to be appropriate in this instance.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Lavendon shareholders are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends
are approved, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Inventories
Inventories, comprising ex-rental fleet equipment available for sale, third party equipment purchased for resale, machine spare parts and
consumables, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost basis used within the Group is a ‘First In First Out’ or FIFO
basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Ex-
rental fleet disposals are transferred to inventory prior to external sale or scrappage.
Taxation including deferred tax
Provision for taxation is made at the current rate.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an asset
or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable
profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred taxation is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred
taxation asset is realised or the deferred taxation liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the
amounts can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received under
such plans is recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fair value is determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model
for share option schemes and in the case of share matching plans and the long-term incentive plan, by use of a Monte Carlo simulation.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives, excluding the impact of
any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share
incentives that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are
expected to vest. The impact of the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding
adjustment to equity, over the remaining vesting period.
Share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over the Parent Company’s shares) are
accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone financial statements of the Parent Company.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to employees of subsidiary undertakings in the group is treated as a
capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the
vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertaking, with a corresponding credit to equity. This does not have an impact
on the Group’s financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the Group Balance
Sheet. For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Exceptional items
The Group defines exceptional items to be those that, by virtue of their nature, size or frequency, warrant separate disclosure in the
financial statements in order to better understand the underlying performance of the Group. These include, but are not limited to, costs
of reorganisation and restructuring, impairment of non-current assets, significant one-off financing costs and significant one-off claims.

Independent auditors’ report

Report on the company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Lavendon Group plc’s company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise:
• the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2015;
• the Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements.
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion,
information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the company acquired in the course of
performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting
records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration report - Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 72, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland).
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements,
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive
procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Lavendon Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2015.

Lavendon Group plc 2015 113
1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and in accordance
with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). The Company has transitioned to FRS 101 from previously
extant UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice for all periods presented and any disclosure exemptions taken are listed in note 13.
The principal accounting policies and estimation techniques have been applied and are set out below:
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange differences
are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
Fixed asset investments
Investments are included at cost stated at the historical Sterling value at the time of investment other than where overseas investments are
hedged by foreign currency borrowings in which case the investment is included at cost, restated at the year end Sterling value at the
balance sheet date and any exchange movement is taken to reserves. Where appropriate, the carrying values of fixed asset investments
are measured by reference to their discounted future operational cash flows, or their imputed resale value, and provision is made for any
diminution in value where necessary.
Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans on behalf of the Group. The amounts in the Company
are immaterial and are therefore not disclosed.
The fair value of the employee services received under such plans is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account. Fair value is
determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model for share option schemes and the Share Incentive Plan, and in the case of Share
Matching Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, by use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is
determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting
conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet
date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision on original
estimates, if any, is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity, over the remaining vesting period.
Share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over the Parent Company’s shares) are
accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone financial statements of the Parent Company and the Group.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Lavendon shareholders are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the periods in which the
dividends are approved, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for issue costs. Issue costs arising from a modification of a
borrowing facility are amortised over the period of the borrowing or until the facility is considered to be “extinguished” at which point any
unamortised costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs associated with the re-negotiation of an existing facility, that
are not separately identifiable, are treated as an extinguishment and are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit can differ from net profit/loss as reported in the profit and
loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
2.   RESULT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Parent Company’s profit and loss account has not been presented in these
financial statements. The Parent Company’s profit after tax for the financial year was £15,562,000 (2014: loss of £6,153,000).
Included in the above result are dividends received in the year of £20,000,000 (2014: £nil).

COVER IMAGE: T-PYLON INNOVATION
Nationwide Platforms supports
new T-Pylon design innovation
Lavendon’s UK subsidiary,
Nationwide Platforms, provided
two 50m operated truck
mounted platforms to carry 
out work on an innovative new
electricity pylon scheme that 
will change the silhouette of the
UK’s landscape. Since 1928 the
iconic ‘lattice’ design electricity
pylon has formed the backdrop
of the UK’s countryside and now
a new pioneering design is to
replace 88,000 pylons throughout
the UK over the coming years. 
The T-Pylon design was the
winner of a 201 1 international
competition to find the next
generation of electricity pylons,
which is being tested and
developed by one of Nationwide
Platform’s key customers.

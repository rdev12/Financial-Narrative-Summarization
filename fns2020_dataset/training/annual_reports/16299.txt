CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
IN RETROSPECT, 2006 WAS A YEAR OF A FULL-BLOWN CRISIS FOR THE DAIRY INDUSTRY OF
UKRAINE. ALTHOUGH THE GROUP WAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE RUSSIAN IMPORT BAN
ON THE UKRAINIAN DAIRY PRODUCTS, WE MANAGED TO PRESERVE OUR CORE OPERATIONS
INTACT, TO CUT THE COSTS WHEREVER WE COULD, AND TO BUILD STRONG BASE FOR
GROWTH IN THE FUTURE.
Results
In the context of this challenging environment, I am pleased to announce the Group’s annual
results for 2006. Sales were ‡35.1 million, down from ‡39.9 million in the previous year. On a
comparable basis, EBITDA is reported at ‡2.8 million, as against ‡3.5 million (‡2.9 million
1
) in
the previous year. Profit before tax was ‡1.2 million compared to ‡2.3 million (‡1.8 million
1
) in
2005. Significantly, gross profit margin improved to 20.7% from 16.9% in 2005.
As one of Ukraine’s leading dairy producers, we are ingrained in the fabric of the country’s
business environment. As a significant food exporter, we are also dependent on world markets
and international politics. Imposed in January 2006, the Russian import ban on Ukrainian dairy
products was as much a political decision as it was a turning point for the entire dairy industry of Ukraine. Under huge pricing
pressure and a massive transfer of value to the consumers, Ukrproduct Group successfully resisted the industry-wide price
reductions. I am delighted to confirm that this strategy has worked well – the Group can report trading results for 2006 that are
broadly in line with the pre-crisis results for 2005.
Dividends
The Group is committed to a balanced dividend policy whereby the shareholders are rewarded in line with the trading performance
while a balance between reinvesting profits and dividend distributions is maintained. As a result, the Board is recommending a final
dividend payment of 0.51 pence per ordinary share for the year ended 31 December 2006 which would lead to 0.61 pence per
ordinary share for the full year. If approved at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 29 June 2007 to shareholders on the
register as at 1 June 2007.
Strategy
Ukrproduct Group continued with its strategy of developing and retaining its market position
in two core product segments – processed cheese and packaged butter. These will be
supplemented soon by hard cheese – a product that we expect will play a key role in
expanding the Group’s range and in helping to retain and expand the customer base.
The Group’s manufacturing capability remains one of the most up-to-date in Ukraine; a
significant amount of capital expenditure was dedicated this year to both building the new
hard cheese plant and to improving the existing asset base to ensure high quality of the
product offering. The largest single asset put into operation in 2006 was the new skimmed
milk powder (SMP) production facility – this is a timely addition to the Group’s existing SMP
capacity in the midst of a very favourable price trend in the world market.
Brands remain the backbone of our business but it is true to say that this year they have had
to withstand a number of challenges. Intense price pressure, a glut of substitute products in
the market and more discerning consumers have all combined to provide for the most
challenging trading environment in years. Under these conditions, the Group’s premier brands
such as “Our Dairyman” retained their leading market positions and substantially improved
margins. We are dedicated to strengthening our core brands, as well as cautiously nurturing
new brands in hard cheese.
Our distribution network, as in prior years, played a key role in supporting the Group’s sales.
While retail chains develop dynamically in Ukraine, the more traditional channels of
distribution, such as open-air markets, continue to play a material role in selling the Group’s
products. Our distribution subsidiaries throughout Ukraine provide valuable services, and
supply the Group’s executives with quality feedback on most recent developments. We are
satisfied with the current distribution arrangements and in the future we shall be making every
1

differences 3
effort to make sure that this distribution structure is supported and maintained.
Since becoming a public company in 2005, the Group has undergone a substantial transformation and is now a vertically integrated,
pan-Ukrainian operator with a significant asset base and leading domestic market shares in processed cheese and packaged butter.
We are also encouraged by our established export operations.
On behalf of the Board, it is with pride and confidence that I congratulate everyone at the Group for their steadfast achievements in
what was a very trying business environment last year. Success is built by people and for people – I am extremely confident that the
coming years will see the significant results of our joint effort.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
IN 2006, UKRPRODUCT GROUP COMBATTED THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF THE
RUSSIAN IMPORT BAN ON UKRAINIAN DAIRY PRODUCTS AND FINISHED THE YEAR
WITH GOOD OPERATING PROFIT AND A STRONG BALANCE SHEET. IN AN EXTREMELY
CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT, WE STRENGTHENED THE GROUP’S ASSET BASE,
RETAINED ITS MARKET-LEADING POSITIONS AND PRESERVED THE GROUP’S CORE
DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY. BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF EARNINGS, WE BELIEVE
THAT FOUNDATIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT FOR HEALTHY ORGANIC GROWTH IN THE FUTURE.
Introduction
Much as we are used to the vibrant nature of Ukraine’s business environment, 2006 proved
exceptionally volatile by any measure. The year started with introduction by the Russian
veterinary authorities, of what effectively became an import ban on Ukrainian dairy products.
Remaining in force throughout the year, the ban was the year-defining event. It most profoundly
affected the Ukrainian manufacturers of hard cheese; in particular, those who traditionally
supplied close to 100% of their output to Russia. Suddenly deprived of the long-accustomed
access to the Russian market, these manufacturers dramatically increased supply into the
Ukraine domestic market resulting in substantially reduced prices for hard cheeses. Although
Ukrproduct Group did not produce hard cheese or export to Russia at the time, the indirect
effects of significant oversupply were felt by the Group almost immediately. Some of the
surplus in hard cheese was re-processed into soft cheese thus flooding the Group’s core
markets and putting intense price pressure on its entire product range. Product substitution
effect also had a negative impact: given the plentiful supply of low-priced (albeit often low-
quality) hard cheese, some customers switched from processed cheese in favour of hard
cheese.
In their totality, by mid-year all these developments caused a significant deterioration of
the business environment for the entire dairy industry in Ukraine. In the first six months
of the year, basic product prices remained low and the determination of dairy producers
to maintain sales volumes added to pricing pressures. In this situation, Ukrproduct
Group, although better positioned than some of its competitors to withstand these
pressures, was unable to prevent the first monthly operating loss in its history in May.
Moreover, further margin compression resulted in June and July.
As an immediate response to these pressures, a cost rationalisation programme was
launched, resulting by September in a significant improvement of the Group’s financial
position and a leaner cost base. In parallel, as a matter of business principle, the Board
adopted a strategy of maintaining margins at the sake of volume sales, in particular, by
reducing its presence at open-air markets which traditionally had been a high volume
outlet for processed cheese and butter but at margins lower than those achievable in
other areas.  In the remainder of the year, our strategy proved successful and, despite
lower sales volumes for processed cheese, margins and volumes in every other product
were maintained.  In particular, sales of packaged butter finished the year at a similar
volume to the previous year and at better margins.  Our emphasis, at all times, on quality
found favour with consumers who, encouragingly, appear to be prepared to pay a higher
price for a better quality product.  Throughout the entire year, sales of skimmed milk
powder (“SMP”), our third major product, remained strong although depressed world
prices impacted upon margins in the first half.  The second half, however, proved reasonably
successful as the concurrent droughts in the US and Australia reduced the supply of SMP to
the world market and lead to increased prices.
As a result of these developments, the Group’s sales of ‡35.1 million in 2006 were below those
of 2005. However, we believe the quality of sales and earnings have been substantially enhanced
and, as a consequence of our firm decision to preserve profitability, gross margins have
improved at the gross level to 20.7% in 2006 from 16.9% in the previous year.
Overall, it is my firm belief that not only did we finish 2006 in much better financial shape
than an overwhelming majority of competitors in Ukraine but we also managed to achieve
greater efficiencies throughout the entire business of the Group. 5
Operating review
In the 2005 Annual Report, we noted “slowing GDP growth and weaker consumer spending” in Ukraine. Subsequently, the economy
appeared to gather steam but, by the middle of the year it was clear that food consumption was not going to recover to the levels
observed in 2003-2005; consecutive increases in gas and electricity prices and accumulation of mortgage and personal debts
combined to put pressure on consumers’ food budgets.
Against this background for food consumption, we are pleased with the production and sales of the Group. Production of processed
cheese was 12,800 tonnes (2005: 14,700 tonnes) while output of packaged butter remained stable at 9,200 tonnes in both 2006 and
2005. Production of milk powder also increased during the year totalling over 4,000 tonnes (2005: 3,700 tonnes).
During the year, operating developments of the Group continued according to plan.
Notwithstanding the challenging business environment, the capital expenditure programme continued as planned. The majority of
expenditure was deployed in the building of a new hard-cheese plant at the site of one of our operating plants, Starkon. The hard-
cheese plant is scheduled to become fully operational in May 2007, with trial batches coming off in June and full capacity likely to be
achieved by the end of the year. When fully operational, the plant will be producing up to 3,600 tonnes of hard cheese annually.
Encouragingly, the trading environment and timing for our entry into the domestic hard cheese market appears very favourable for
the Group as small-scale manufacturers are increasingly being put out of business by a combination of high raw milk prices,
inadequate product quality and an inability to reach customers efficiently. With our national network, we believe the Group is much
better positioned to mitigate these factors and to capitalise on the opportunities that the hard cheese segment offers.
Another important capital expenditure item was the installation, in December 2006, of the new SMP dryer at the Starkon plant. The
timing of its installation proved fortunate as, by the end of 2006,  world SMP prices recovered. The new SMP dryer has nearly
doubled the Group’s SMP production capacity and, most importantly, allowed the Group to produce an output of excellent quality
with broader customer acceptance. At the beginning of 2007, the new installation was running at full capacity and is expected to
provide the Group with further significant sales in 2007.
As in the previous year, the Group’s distribution capability was a cornerstone of our performance in 2006. We made selective
investments in our distribution subsidiaries which, in turn, provided the guidance and support to the Group’s sales team in
strengthening relationships with leading retailers. We are seeing the results of our continuing efforts as retailers are keen to retain
and support pan-Ukrainian food manufacturers. At this stage of development, the organised retail chains in Ukraine are keenly
interested in securing a reliable supply of quality foods to their stores.  The directors of the company are aiming for  Ukrproduct
Group to be a partner of choice for such retailers.
Prospects
The Board believes that the Group’s core markets in Ukraine of processed cheese and packaged butter have reached a certain level of
maturity. Consumption-only driven growth has moderated and is unlikely to deliver substantial benefits to the Group. The Board is
looking for future growth by expanding the Group’s market share in traditional products, entering adjacent markets and exploiting
opportunities outside of Ukraine. We are keen to pursue all these routes.
Domestically in Ukraine, our market share in processed cheese and packaged butter should remain intact. Although still challenged
by low-quality, low-price producers, we are observing a gradual return to more normal trading patterns. Stable quality and
predictability of supply from Ukrproduct Group remain the major factors of attraction for emerging retail chains.
Over the years, Ukrproduct Group has paid particular attention to building a vertically integrated operation to maintain the stability of
sales and profitability, notwithstanding the fluctuations in the operating environment. Our industrial assets are now capable of
producing all semi-processed materials required for production of processed cheese and butter; with the launch of the hard-cheese
plant we will extend the value-added chain into reprocessing of whey and production of whey powder. Various stages of our value-
added process help the Group to remain a balanced dairy producer thus securing the overall stability of business.
Another important aspect of our business is customer differentiation. When developing the Group’s distribution capability in the
years of fast growth, we have always kept in mind various customer segments and distribution channels. Some of these channels,
such as independent distributors, have been – and largely remain – reliable partners; their margins are determined by their ability to
deliver agreed sales targets with planned margins. Some other channels, such as open-air markets and small shops, have proved
more of a challenge from the viewpoint of cost of service and margins. Recognising differences in customer requirements, we have
divided our product trademarks among various distribution channels. Such trademarks as “Our Dairyman” and “Kremlin” will only be
supplied to the retail distribution channels whereas “People’s Product”, “Nash CyrOK” and “Divogray” will be channelled through
open-air markets. This division allows the Group to cater to different customer audiences and maintain a cost-effective balance
between customer value and profitability.
Our brand portfolio is another important facet of our business. We believe our brands preserve our sales base and secure profit 6
margins by ensuring customer recognition and delivering a price premium over comparable products. During times of intense price
pressure, our brands such as “Our Dairyman” have maintained volumes and the margins. Two new brands will be introduced with the
launch of our own hard cheese production in May this year. These brands will be positioned in the quality segment of the market.
Outlook
Following the events of 2006, the executive team intends to put a renewed emphasis on the development of branded quality products
for the medium and high-income consumers. For the first time in the Group’s history, our major new initiative – the entry into the
hard cheese market – will be specifically intended for high-end customers. In our other core segments, we are following a similar
approach and are keen to move products upwards both in terms of customer value and price. Our approach is balanced; we are
conscious that dairy products are staple food for the majority of the population, thus any upmarket initiative must be based on the
strength and recognition of our core brands. Importantly, the upmarket product segments have very high entry barriers as capital
expenditure and quality requirements are substantial. Over recent years, we have conducted a substantial modernisation programme
of the Group’s plants resulting in a solid asset base.  We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalise on the growing taste for
quality foods among Ukrainian consumers.
On the basis of our expertise in launching new products and building dairy plants, we are currently working on an expansion
programme for the next five years.
2006 was a significant test of the Group’s ability to progress in a fast-changing, demanding business environment. Our response to
this test gives us confidence for the future.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
THE MARKET TURMOIL IN 2006 CURTAILED THE EXPECTED GROWTH OF THE BUSINESS AND LIMITED THE POTENTIAL FOR
NET PROFIT. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS SETBACK, THE GROUP MAINTAINED OPERATING PROFITS, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED
ITS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND STRENGTHENED BALANCE SHEET.
Results
The results of the prior year 2005 benefited from the foreign exchange gain on translation differences of ‡0.6 million. As a result of
the change in accounting estimate (please refer to note 5 to Financial Statements), there is no comparable income in the current year
2006. The comparable figures for EBITDA, PBT and net profit adjusted for this item show the alternate prior year figures to reflect the
underlying trading performance of the business.
Sales are reported at ‡35.1 million compared with ‡39.9 million for 2005.  By segment, processed cheese accounted for 36% of
sales or ‡12.7 million; butter for 33% or ‡11.6 million and milk powders for 20% or ‡7.0 million with the balance made up by third-
party products and services. EBITDA for the year was ‡2.8 million versus ‡3.5 million (‡2.9 million
2
) in 2005. Profit before taxes
(PBT) was ‡1.2 million compared to ‡2.3 million (‡1.8 million
2
) with net profit of ‡1.1 million versus ‡2.0 million (‡1.4 million
2
) in
2005. Gross profit margin increased from 16.9% in 2005 to 20.7% in the year under review.
Profitability was adversely affected by a significant increase in the depreciation charge. In 2006, this amounted to ‡1.4 million
compared to ‡0.9 million in 2005 and was a reflection of the substantial increase in the Group’s asset base.
Product segments
The following table shows the gross and PBT margins for 2005 and 2006.
The gross margin in cheese improved slightly as a result of the executive decision to preserve profitability by restricting the sales
volumes. In butter, the dramatic improvement in margins is mostly attributable to a greater production of the own butter with higher
margins. In milk powders, the margins essentially remained stable.
Cash flow and capital expenditure
The net cash flow from operating activities during the year was ‡3.8 million versus a net outflow of ‡1.2 million in 2005. This
reflected a decrease in trade receivables and inventory; the former reflecting the tighter credit terms and the latter, the reduction in
the inventory stored due to the improved availability of semi-processed dairy materials.  The underlying cash generation of the
Group remained strong thus allowing the Group to carry on with the planned capital expenditure of ‡4.5 million. The main
investments were made at the Starkon plant – the installation of the new SMP dryer – and building works and equipment for the
hard-cheese plant.
Bank facilities
The Group has a working capital facility of up to ‡4.5 million provided by Ukraine OTP bank at interest rates fixed in both Hryvna and
US Dollar. Overdraft facilities of up to ‡0.5 million are also available to the Group from various banks in Ukraine. The facility is
renewable in May 2008 and has various clauses protecting the Group from the occurrence of unexpected events. Further funding for
working capital needs and project finance, if necessary, is available from either the principal bankers or other banking institutions in
Ukraine.

Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share (EPS) in the year were 2.6 pence as compared to 5.0 pence (3.6 pence
2
) in 2005. The basic EPS has
been calculated by dividing net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the time-weighted average number of shares in issue
throughout the year. The diluted earnings per share were 2.6 pence for the year versus 4.8 pence (3.4 pence
2
) in 2005.
Dividends
In view of the Group’s positive trading performance and strong cash generation, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 0.51
pence per ordinary share for the year ended 31 December 2006 which would lead to 0.61 pence per ordinary share for the full year
(2005: 0.85 pence). If approved at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 29 June 2007 to shareholders on the register as at 1
June 2007.

As at 20 April 2007, the Company has been notified of the following substantial interests in its issued ordinary share capital (the ten
largest shareholders are reported):
Payment policy
The Group has a general set of guidelines for paying its suppliers based on specific criteria. However, it is normal practice to agree
payment terms with a specific supplier when entering into a purchase contract. The Group seeks to abide by the payment terms
agreed whenever it is satisfied that the goods or services have been provided in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions.
Auditors
For the financial year under review, BDO Stoy Hayward LLP served as auditors to the Group. The Board proposes, subject to a
satisfactory fee arrangement and a three-year review of independence, to reappoint BDO Stoy Hayward LLP as auditors to the Group
for the financial year 2007 at the AGM on 21 June 2007.
All of the current Directors have taken the necessary steps to make themselves aware of any information needed by the Company's
auditors for the purposes of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. The directors are not aware of
any relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities and for the preparation of financial statements which comply with the requirements of the Companies
(Jersey) Law 1991.
The directors have elected to prepare the financial statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs).
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the company’s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows.  This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the
International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’.  In virtually all
circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards.  A
fair presentation also requires the directors to:
· select and apply appropriate accounting policies;
· present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
· provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
Financial statements are available on the Group’s website in accordance with the applicable legislation governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements. The maintenance and integrity of the group’s website is the responsibility of the directors. The
directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Introduction
The Group’s Board has considered the guidance published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
concerning the internal control requirements of the Combined Code of Corporate Governance and has established an ongoing
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group.
In general terms, the Group’s corporate governance principles aim to secure adherence to prudent business practice, to prevent
executive excesses harmful to enterprise and to align the managers’ interests with those of shareholders. Driving shareholder value is
key and an underlying motive of corporate governance. The Group is well aware of the heightened requirements for corporate
transparency and the shareholder responsibility advocated by the international business community and regulatory bodies in the UK,
Ukraine, Jersey and internationally. Consequently, the Group has evolved its composition along the lines of clearer responsibility for
Directors and a more transparent holding structure for shareholders. As the Group grows, these policies and procedures will be
developed to reflect the requirements of the Combined Code appropriate to a company of the Group’s size.
The Board
The Group Board consists of one non-executive and four Executive Directors. The biographical details of the Directors are shown on
page 9. The roles of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive of the Group are held separately with a clear division of
responsibility between them. The Chairman of the Board is an independent non-executive Director.
Within the scope of the corporate governance procedures, the Board meets regularly to consider the financial results, budgets, and
major items of capital expenditure of all the Group’s companies. This body is also responsible for formulating, reviewing and
approving the Group’s strategy and the phases of its development.
The meetings of the Board of Directors take place in Ukraine or Jersey, or any other suitable jurisdiction as decided by the Board.
Teleconference calls are also a possibility, when Directors are present in either (or both) Jersey or Ukraine.
The Board has established two committees: Audit and Remuneration.
Audit Committee
Chairman, Jack Rowell
The Audit Committee consists of one non-executive Director. The member of the Audit Committee has relevant financial experience.
This Committee, inter alia, is responsible for reviewing the Annual and Interim financial statements, in addition to the systems of
internal control and risk management, and also for ensuring the integrity of the financial information reported to the shareholders.
The Audit Committee is scheduled to meet at least three times per annum.
Remuneration Committee
Chairman, Jack Rowell
The Remuneration Committee comprises one non-executive Director. This Committee is scheduled to meet at least twice per annum
to advise the Board on the Group’s remuneration strategy and to determine the terms of employment and total remuneration of the
Executive Directors, including the granting of share options. Among others, the objective of this Committee is to attract, retain and
motivate Executives capable of delivering the Group’s objectives. The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for the evaluation
of the performance of Executive Directors.
Investor Relations
The Group meets and encourages communication with its institutional and private shareholders, fund managers, financial analysts
and brokers. In communicating to the above-mentioned parties the Group uses various means such as the annual report, interim
statements, annual general meetings and the Company’s corporate website (www.ukrproduct.com) as necessary.
The Group recognises that the increased transparency is an integral part of being a listed company. As such the Group has set up
procedures to ensure that it discloses price-sensitive information to the market in a timely fashion, regularly consults with its 14
nominated adviser and ensures timely publication of its interim and annual financial statements within the deadlines imposed by the
AIM Rules and the corresponding requirements of the jurisdictions in which the Group is present or operates.
Financial procedures and internal control
The Group adheres to comprehensive and strictly regulated budgeting and reporting procedures that are aimed at more efficient
internal control and risk management. The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness, however, it is recognised that any control system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
The main constituents of the internal control system are:
- documented policies, procedures and authorisation levels;
- clearly defined lines of responsibility in the organisational structure of the Group;
- a management structure which facilitates ease of communication both vertically and horizontally;
- annual budgeting and monthly reporting procedures.
The annual budgets consist of monthly budgets, which are updated each month once actual figures become available. Due to the
dynamic development of the macroeconomic environment of the country the Group operates in, variances in actual figures for sales,
prices and other underlying assumptions from those forecasted may occur. Hence, the budget is flexed to better reflect the future of
the Group. Such variances by each company within the Group are discovered and recommendations for further actions are
formulated.
The internal control system is further enforced by the Group’s internal audit department. The main objectives of the internal audit
function are to ensure the safety of the Company’s assets and the reliability of accounting records. The internal audit department is
responsible for auditing the financial statements and accounting procedures of the companies within the Group, as well as for
disclosing and reducing various types of risks related to Group operations. Each company within the Group has a designated auditor,
who systematically performs the audits. 15
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
The Group is committed to the principles of corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) and believes that these are in the long-term
interests of its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board is committed to developing and implementing CSR policies which are aimed at:
- promoting equality and fairness among employees, partners and suppliers;
- ensuring safe and healthy working conditions;
- maintaining the Group’s corporate reputation and dedication to business ethics;
- supporting the communities in which the Group operates; and
- establishing long-term and healthy relationships with the Group’s partners, customers and other affiliated parties.
The main elements of the Group’s approach towards fulfilling the objectives outlined above comprise the following:
Employees
The Group is committed to ensuring equal opportunities to all its employees, both current and prospective. Each employee’s efforts
are highly valued and the Board believes that a diverse mix of the workforce facilitates innovation, efficiency and teamwork. As a
matter of corporate policy, regular training and development workshops are conducted for the staff. These are aimed at all employee
groups, including management, technical as well as production personnel. The training programmes encourage the staff to move up
the career ladder and are central to the Group’s continuing growth and success.
Health and safety
Management at business units within the Group are responsible for developing and maintaining the underlying practices that provide
for a healthy and safe working environment. Special attention is given to the production facilities, where the equipment, lighting, air
conditioning, workspace and other constituents undergo constant review and optimisation. Regular monitoring is carried out to
ensure that required standards are met and that employees use the provided communication channels to further develop their
surrounding working conditions.
Customers
Customer satisfaction is at the core of the Group’s business model. Accordingly, the Board is keen to continue supplying the
customers with high quality, affordable products as required by current market demands. The Group’s segmentation practices are
aimed at segregating various customer groups in order to meet their needs with maximum efficiency. In addition, regular marketing
surveys are conducted to ensure maximum value is offered to customers on a consistent basis. 16
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE REPORT
Environment
The Group recognises the importance of good environmental practices and seeks to minimise a negative impact that its operations or
products might have on the production sites and surrounding areas. The Group complies with the environmental laws and
regulations of Ukraine and promotes the effective resource management, energy conservation and waste efficiency internally and in
dealings with the third parties. The Group’s modernisation programme of 2005-2008 puts specific emphasis on acquiring and
installing only the most advanced and environmentally-friendly production and auxiliary equipment.
Food safety
At the time of writing of this Report, the Group’s Starkon Plant was in the process of accreditation to ISO 22000 Food safety
management systems – Requirements for any organisation in the food chain, an international standard published in 2005 to ensure
safety of the food supply chains worldwide.
Community support
The Group is keen to develop and maintain partnership relationships with the communities by means of supporting the local
initiatives and charitable events. The Group participates in such initiatives by contributing cash donations and gifts, as well as
employee time, by encouraging staff to participate as volunteers. 17
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
This report is prepared by the Remuneration Committee of the Board and sets out the Company’s policy on the remuneration of the
Directors, with a description of service agreements and remuneration packages for each Director.
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”)
The Committee comprises one non-executive Director and is chaired by Jack Rowell. This Committee is scheduled to meet at least
twice per annum. The objective of the Committee is to advise the Board on the Group’s overall remuneration policy and to determine
the terms of employment and total remuneration of the Executive Directors and certain senior employees, including the granting of
share options. The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for the evaluation of the performance of Executive Directors.
Remuneration Policy
The Company’s remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which:
· are designed to attract, motivate and retain high calibre Executives;
· are competitive and in line with comparable businesses;
· are rooted in practices exercised in countries where the Group operates;
· intend to align the interests of the Executives with those of the shareholders by means of fixed and performance related
remuneration; and
· set challenging performance targets and motivate Executives to achieve those targets both in the short and long-term.
Base salary
The Committee reviews base salaries of the Executive Directors each year taking into account job responsibilities, competitive market
rates and the performance of the Executive concerned. Consideration is also given to the cost of living and the Director’s professional
experience. While determining the base salaries, the Committee also considers general aspects of the employment terms and
conditions of employees elsewhere in the Group.
Incentive bonus plans and equity arrangements
The Committee plans to consider developing long-term equity incentive arrangements to make the overall Executive Remuneration
structure more performance-related, more competitive and aligned with shareholders’ interests.
Service contracts
The appointments of executive Directors are valid for an indefinite period and may be terminated with three months notice given by
either party at any time. The Company’s provision for compensation for loss of office is to provide compensation which reflects the
Company’s contractual obligations.
Bonus Scheme
The Committee has established a cash bonus scheme for Executive Directors based on the overall performance of the Company and
attainment of the operating profit targets.
Non-executive directors
The appointments of non-executive Directors are valid for an indefinite period and may be terminated with three months notice given
by either party at any time. The decision to re-appoint, as well as the determination of the fees of the non-executive Directors, rests
with the Board. The non-executive Directors may accept appointments with other companies, although any such appointment is
subject to the Board’s approval and terms and conditions of Service Agreements. 18

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Group and Principal Activities
The Company is a public limited liability entity registered in Jersey with a registered office at 26 New Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3RA,
Channel Islands.
For the purposes of this financial information the terms “Operating Group” and “Group” have been taken to indicate the companies listed
in note 3(c). The “Operating Group” includes all those subsidiaries of Ukrproduct Group Ltd (the ‘Company’) that operate on the territory
of Ukraine. The “Group” includes the Company and all of its subsidiaries. Ukrproduct Group Ltd became a public company on 11
February 2005, placing 27.2% of its share capital on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.
The Group’s main activity is production and distribution of dairy-based food products (butter, processed cheese, milk powders) in
Ukraine and abroad. The Group’s sales in Ukraine are managed and facilitated by its own pan-Ukrainian distribution network that
currently employs almost 450 employees and makes use of around 200 vehicles and refrigerated vans.
The Group’s exports are managed by the Company’s two subsidiaries: Ukrprodexpo and Dairy Trading Corporation. Capitalising on the
Group’s strong reputation for quality and business excellence, those companies collaborate with international traders and partners to
export skimmed milk powder and other products to Germany, Denmark, Holland, Japan, Bulgaria and other countries.
The Group’s overall management and production facilities are based in Ukraine, with the HQ in Kyiv. The Group commands leading
positions in the Ukrainian processed cheese and packaged butter markets and owns a range of widely recognisable trademarks in
Ukraine, including “Nash Molochnik”, “Narodniy Product”, “Vershkova Dolina”. The average number of employees of the Group during
the year ended 31 December 2006 was 2,372 (2005 – 1,805).
2. Operating Environment of the Group
The main activities of the Operating Group are concentrated in Ukraine, a country which continues to display characteristics of an
emerging market. The prospects for future economic stability in Ukraine are largely dependent upon the effectiveness of the economic
measures and reforms undertaken by the government, together with legal, regulatory and political developments, which are beyond the
control of the Group.
3. Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial information are set out below:
(a) Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”),
including International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The majority of companies making up the Operating Group maintain their accounting records in accordance with Ukrainian regulations.
The financial information has been prepared from those accounting records and adjusted as we consider necessary in order to comply
with IFRS. Accounting records of the Operating Group are maintained in Ukrainian Hryvna (“UAH”). The Hryvna has also been adopted
as the functional currency for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements (see note 3e). Since the Ukrainian Hryvna is not a
major convertible or recognisable currency outside of Ukraine, the financial information has been translated into British pounds sterling
(hereinafter GBP or ‡) at the rates given in note 3(q), as the Group’s presentational currency. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in
the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.
(b) Changes in accounting policies
In preparing these financial statements, the following amendments to published standards and interpretations to existing standards
effective in 2006 were adopted by the Group.
- IAS 19 (Amendment), Employee Benefits (effective from 1 January 2006).  This amendment introduces the option of an
alternative recognition approach for actuarial gains and losses.  It may impose additional recognition requirements for
multi-employer plans where insufficient information is available to apply defined benefit accounting. As the Group does not
have actuarial gains and losses and does not participate in any multi-employer plans, adoption of this amendment does not
require additional disclosure. 25
- IFRIC 4, Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease (effective from 1 January 2006).  IFRIC 4 requires the
determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease to be based on the substance of the arrangement.  It
requires an assessment of whether: (a) fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets
(‘the asset’); and (b) the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.  Management assessed the impact of IFRIC 4 on the
group’s operations by reviewing all the existing arrangements. There was no impact of the adoption of IFRIC 4 on the results
or net assets of the group.
- IAS 39 (Amendment), The Fair Value Option (effective from 1 January 2006).  This amendment changes the identification
of financial instruments classified at fair value through profit and loss and restricts the ability to designate financial
instruments as part of this category.  The Group believes that this amendment should not have a significant impact on the
classification of the financial instruments, as the Group should be able to comply with the amended criteria for the
designation of financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss.  The Group applied this amendment from 1 January
2006, which has no impact on the results or net assets of the group.
- IAS 39 and IFRS 4 (Amendment), Financial Guarantee Contracts (effective from 1 January 2006).  This amendment
requires issued financial guarantees, other than those previously asserted by the entity to be insurance contracts, to be
initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of: (a) the unamortised balance of the related
fees received and deferred, and (b) the expenditure required to settle the commitment at the balance sheet date. There was
no impact on adoption of this amendment.
The following Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards effective in 2006 were not relevant to the Group.
- IAS 39 (Amendment), Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of Forecast Intra-group Transactions (effective from 1 January 2006).
The amendment allows the foreign currency risk of a highly probable forecast intra-group transaction to qualify as a hedged
item in the consolidated financial statements, provided that: (a) the transaction is denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency of the entity entering into that transaction; and (b) the foreign currency risk will affect consolidated profit
or loss.  This amendment is not relevant to the Group’s operations, as the Group does not have any intra-group transactions
that would qualify as a hedged item in the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2006.
- IFRS 1 (Amendment), First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRS 6 (Amendment),
Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources (effective from 1 January 2006).  These amendments are not relevant to
the Group’s operations as the Group is not a first-time adopter of IFRS nor does it carry out exploration for and evaluation
of mineral resources.
- IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources (effective from 1 January 2006).  IFRS 6 is not relevant to the
Group’s operations.
 - IFRIC 5, Rights to Interests arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds (effective
from 1 January 2006).  IFRIC 5 is not relevant to the Group’s operations.
- IFRIC 6, Liabilities Arising from Participating in a Specific Market – Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (effective from
1 December 2005).  IFRIC 6 is not relevant to the Group’s operations.
The following Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards were not yet effective in 2006.
- IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: disclosures and a complementary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial
Statements – Capital Disclosures (effective from 1 January 2007).  IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures to improve the
information about financial instruments.  It requires the disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information about exposure
to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and
market risk, including sensitivity analysis to market risk.  It replaces IAS 30, Disclosures in the Financial Statements of
Banks and Similar Financial Institutions and the disclosure requirements in IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
Presentation.  It is applicable to all entities that report under IFRS.
The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about the level of an entity’s capital and how it manages capital.  The Group
assessed the impact of IFRS7 and the amendment to IAS 1 and concluded that the main additional disclosures will be the
sensitivity analysis to market risk and the capital disclosures required by the amendment of IAS 1.  The Group will apply
IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 to the accounts for the period beginning on 1 January 2007.
- IFRS 8, Operating Segments (effective from 1 January 2009). This standard sets out requirements for disclosure of
information about an entity’s operating segments and also about the entity’s products and services, the geographical areas 26
in which it operates, and its major customers. It replaces IAS 14, Segmental Reporting. The group will apply this standard in
the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2009 and the application will not result in any impact on the results or net
assets of the group.
             - IAS 23 Borrowing Costs (revised) (effective from 1 January 2009). The main change from the previous version is the
removal of the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial
period of time to get ready for use or sale. The Group is currently assessing its impact on the financial statements.
- IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies (effective
for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 March 2006). IFRIC 7 provides guidance on the application of IAS 29
requirements in a reporting period in which entity identifies the existence of hyperinflation in the economy of its functional
currency, when the company was not hyperinflationary in the prior period. IFRIC 7 is not relevant to the group as none of the
group companies has a currency of hyperinflationary economy as its functional currency.
- IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS2 (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006). IFRIC 8 requires
consideration of transactions involving issuance of equity instruments to establish whether or not they fall within the scope
of IFRS 2. It applies to the situations where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity
instruments issued. Management is currently assessing the impact of IFRIC 8 on the accounts.
- IFRIC 9, Reassessment of embedded derivatives (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2006). IFRIC
9 requires the entity to assess whether an embedded derivative is required to be separated from the host contract and accounted
for as a derivative when an entity becomes a party to the contract. Subsequent reassessment is prohibited unless there is a
change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that otherwise would be required under the
contract, in which case reassessment is required. Management is currently assessing the impact of IFRIC 9 on the accounts.
- IFRIC 10, Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 November
2006). IFRIC 10 prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill and investments in equity
instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date. The group will apply
IFRIC 10 from 1 January 2007 but it is not expected to have any impact on the group’s accounts.
- IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 - Group and Treasury Share Transactions (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 March
2007). Share-based payment transactions in which an entity receives services as consideration for its own equity
instruments shall be accounted for as equity-settled. This applies regardless of whether the entity chooses or is required to
buy those equity instruments from another party to satisfy its obligations to its employees under the share-based payment
arrangement. It also applies regardless of whether:  (a) the employee’s rights to the entity’s equity instruments were granted
by the entity itself or by its shareholder(s); or (b) the share-based payment arrangement was settled by the entity itself or by
its shareholder(s). Management is currently assessing the impact of IFRIC 11 on the accounts.
- IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008).
IFRIC 12 gives guidance on the accounting by operators for public-to-private service
concession arrangements. IFRIC 12 is not relevant to the Group operations due to absence of such arrangements.
(c) Principles of combination and consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results of the companies set out in the table below. As described in note 1, the Group
is comprised of a number of companies which were brought together under a single parent company - Ukrproduct Group Ltd - on
11 February 2005.
The companies which became subsidiaries of Ukrproduct Group Ltd on 11 February 2005 were Ukrproduct Group CJSC, Dairy Trading
Corporation Ltd and Linkstar Ltd. All three companies were ultimately 100% owned equally by Crensel Finance Ltd and Densim Group
Management SA, companies which had incorporated Ukrproduct Group Ltd and were its 100% owners. On 11 February 2005 Crensel
Finance Ltd and Densim Group Management SA made a share exchange with Ukrproduct Group Ltd, granting to the later all their
interests in Ukrproduct Group CJSC, Dairy Trading Corporation Ltd and Linkstar Ltd in exchange for the newly issued shares by Ukrproduct
Group Ltd. As a result of these share exchange transactions Ukrproduct Group Ltd came into full possession of Ukrproduct Group CJSC,
Dairy Trading Corporation Ltd and Linkstar Ltd, while Crensel Finance Ltd and Densim Group Management SA retained full possession
of the enlarged share capital (30 million shares) of Ukrproduct Group Ltd. As the transactions in which Ukrproduct Group Ltd took
control of the other Group companies may be defined as transactions under common control, these transactions fall outside the scope
of IFRS. 27
IFRS contain specific guidance to be followed where a transaction falls outside the scope of IFRS. This Guidance is included at paragraphs
10 to 12 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. This requires, inter alia, that where IFRS doesn’t
include guidance for a particular issue, the directors may also consider the most recent pronouncements of other standard setting
bodies that use a similar conceptual framework to develop accounting standards. In this regards, it is noted that the United States
Financial Accounting standards Board (FASB) has issued an accounting standard covering business combinations (FAS141) that is
similar in a number of respects to IFRS3. Further there is currently a major project being run jointly by the IASB and FASB to converge
IFRS and US GAAP .
In contrast to IFRS3, FAS141 does include, as an Appendix, limited accounting guidance for transactions under common control which,
as with IFRS3, are outside the scope of that accounting standard. The guidance contained in FAS141 indicates that a form of accounting
that is similar to pooling of interests accounting, which was previously set out in APB Opinion 16, may be used when accounting for
transactions under common control.
Having considered the requirements of IAS8, and the guidance included within FAS141, it is considered appropriate to use a form of
accounting which is similar to pooling of interests when dealing with the transaction in which Ukrproduct Group Ltd acquired its
controlling interests in Ukrproduct Group CJSC, LinkStar Limited, and Dairy Trading Corporation Limited.
In consequence, the results of operations for the period should be reported as though the acquisition of the controlling interest through
transaction under common control occurred at the beginning of the period. The effects of intercompany transactions should be eliminated
in determining the results of operations for the period prior to the acquisition of the controlling interest, meaning that those results are
on substantially the same basis as the results of operations for the period after the acquisition of the controlling interest. Similarly, the
consolidated balance sheets and other financial information should be presented as though the assets and liabilities of the combining
entities had been transferred at the beginning of the period, i.e. 1 January 2005. Financial statements and other financial information
presented for prior years should also be restated to furnish comparative information. All restated financial statements and summaries
should indicate clearly that financial data of previously separate entities is combined.

(d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The Group makes estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may deviate from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates
and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
- Impairment of goodwill. The group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The
recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future
cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. Actual outcomes may vary.
-Useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are
amortised or depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on the management’s estimates of the period that the
assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Due to the long live assets,
changes to the estimates used can result in significant variations in the carrying value.
- Fair value of financial instruments. The group determines the fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted, based on
estimates using present values or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions
used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. Where market prices are not readily available, fair value is
either based on estimates obtained from independent experts or quoted market prices of comparable instruments. In that
regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison with independent markets and, in many cases,
could not be realised immediately.
- Inventory. The Group reviews the net realisable value of and demand for its inventory on a quarterly basis to ensure recorded
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Factors that could impact estimated demand and selling prices
are the timing and success of future technological innovations, competitor actions, supplier prices and economic trends.
- Income taxes. The Group is subject to income tax in several jurisdictions and significant judgement is required in determining
the provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, the company recognises tax liabilities based on estimates of whether
additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognised when, despite the company’s belief that its tax
return positions are supportable, the company believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully
sustained upon review by tax authorities. The company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit
years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies
on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. To the extent that the final
tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact income tax expense in the
period in which such determination is made.
- Share based payment. The Group has the equity-based option schemes for the executive and non-executive directors. Fair
value of the share options is estimated by using valuation models, such as Black-Scholes and binominal lattice, on the date of
grant based on certain assumptions, such as the expected volatility, expected life of the options and dividend growth rate.
- Legal proceedings. In accordance with IFRS the Group only recognises a provision where there is a present obligation from
a past event, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and the amount of costs of the transfer can be estimated reliably. In
instances where the criteria are not met, a contingent liability may be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Realisation of any contingent liabilities not currently recognised or disclosed in the financial statements could have a material
effect on the group’s financial position. Application of these accounting principles to legal cases requires the Group’s management
to make determinations about various factual and legal matters beyond its control. The Group reviews outstanding legal cases
following developments in the legal proceedings and at each balance sheet date, in order to assess the need for provisions in
its financial statements. Among the factors considered in making decisions on provisions are the nature of litigation, claim or
assessment, the legal process and potential level of damages in the jurisdiction in which the litigation, claim or assessment has
been brought, the progress of the case (including the progress after the date of the financial statements but before those
statements are issued), the opinions or views of legal advisers, experience on similar cases and any decision of the group’s
management as to how it will respond to the litigation, claim or assessment.
(e) Translation from functional to presentation currency
Management has considered what would be the most appropriate functional and presentational currencies for these financial statements.
As a result of this review management has concluded that: 29
(I) the Ukrainian Hryvna is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. Consequently
the Ukrainian Hryvna is the most appropriate functional currency for the Group;
(II) the Group should use British pounds sterling as the presentational currency for its Consolidated IFRS financial
statements.
Consequently, management has used the following basis for the translation of Ukrainian Hryvna figures to British pounds for presentation
purposes:
(I) for current year figures all assets and liabilities are translated at the rate effective at the balance sheet date. Income
and expense items are translated at the average rate for the year.
(II) for comparative figures all assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate existing at the relevant balance sheet
date. Income and expense items are translated at an average rate for the period.
(III) all exchange differences resulting from the application of the translation methods described above are recognised
directly in equity as a separate component of equity (IAS 21.39 (c) )
Actual exchange rates applied in the translation are detailed in Note 3(q) below.
(f) Segment reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns
that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within
a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns different from those of segments operating in other economic
environments.
The Group has recognised business segments as primary format of segment reporting. The secondary format was chosen to be the
geographical segment.
(g) Property, plant and equipment
Figures calculated using Ukrainian statutory accounting rules, have been adopted as deemed depreciated historical cost for property,
plant and equipment as at 1 January 2004. Subsequent additions have been recorded at cost.
With effect from 1 January 2004, the Group adopted the revaluation model (as defined in IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment) for all
classes of assets. The Group’s assets were revalued in January 2004. This change of accounting policy was made on the grounds that
management believe that this policy provides more reliable and relevant financial information because it better reflects the value in use
of such assets to the Group. In accordance with the provisions of that standard, the revaluation model has not been applied retrospectively.
All categories of property, plant and equipment are subsequently carried at fair value at the date of revaluation, less any subsequent
accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Changes in fair value are recognised in equity (the “revaluation
reserve”). An appropriate transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss reserve when freehold land and buildings
are expensed through the income statement (eg through depreciation, impairment or sale).
Depreciation is applied to all items of property, plant and equipment with the exception of land. Depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Buildings           20-40 years;
Plant and machinery           7-15 years;
Equipment and motor vehicles 3-10 years.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in operating profit.
(h) Assets under construction
Assets under construction are reported at their cost of construction including costs charged by third parties and the capitalisation of the
Group’s material costs incurred. No depreciation is charged on assets during construction. Upon completion, all accumulated costs of 30
the asset are transferred to the relevant fixed asset category and depreciated at applicable rates from the time the asset is completed and
ready for use.
(i) Intangible assets
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specialised
software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives (3 years) using the straight-line method. The amortisation expense
is included within administrative expenses in the Income Statement.
Trademarks are shown at historical cost. Trademarks have finite useful lives and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trademarks over their estimated useful lives (20 years).
The amortisation expense is included within Selling & Distribution expenses in the Income Statement.
Customer list is shown at fair value at the date of revaluation obtained by using the estimates of the independent valuers, less any
subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-
line method to allocate the cost of the customer list over its estimated useful lives (20 years). The amortisation expense is included
within Other expenses in the Income Statement.
(j) Goodwill
Goodwill is excess of acquisition costs above the fair value of the Group’s share in the net assets of a subsidiary or an associated
company at the acquisition date. Goodwill is reported in intangible assets with any impairment being charged to the Income Statement
within administrative expenses. Goodwill is annually assessed with respect to the impairment of value and reported at cost net of total
loss from impairment of value. Gains or losses on disposal of a subsidiary includes the carrying value of goodwill related to the
subsidiary sold.
(k) Impairment of assets
Assets with indefinite useful life are not amortised and are annually assessed with respect to the impairment of their value. Assets
subject to amortisation are assessed with respect to the impairment of their value whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
value, an impairment loss is recognised in income. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s net selling price and value in use.
The net selling price is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm’s length transaction while value in use is the present
discounted value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal after the end
of its useful life. Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if it is not possible, for a cash generating unit.
Impairment charges are included in the administrative expenses line item in the Income Statement, except to the extent they reverse
gains previously recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
(l) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. The cost of
finished and unfinished goods comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on
normal operating capacity) but excludes borrowing costs.
(m) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
(n) Share-based payments
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the income statement
over the vesting period. Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the
options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting
period. Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the income statement is charged with the fair value
of goods and services received. 31
(o) Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of sales of goods and services net of value added tax, rebates and discounts after eliminating
sales within the Group. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
are transferred to the buyer. Revenues and expenses are recognised on an accruals basis.
(p) Income taxes
Taxation has been provided for in the financial statements in accordance with relevant legislation currently in force. The charge for
taxation in the Income Statement for the year comprises current tax and changes in deferred tax. Current tax is calculated on the basis
of the taxable profit for the year, using the tax rates in force at the balance sheet date. Taxes, other than on income, are recorded within
operating expenses.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the balance sheet liability method, for all temporary differences arising between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes except for those difference permanently disallowed. A
deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible
temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date.
(q) Foreign currency translation
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the Hryvna (“foreign currencies”) are recorded in Hryvna at the exchange rate
effective on the transaction date. Exchange differences resulting from the settlement of transactions denominated in foreign currency
are included in the income statement using the effective exchange rate on that date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into Hryvna at the official exchange rate at the balance
sheet date. Foreign currency gains and losses arising from the translation of assets and liabilities are reflected in the Income Statement
as foreign exchange translation gains and losses.
Income and expense figures have been converted to British pounds for presentation purposes at the average rate for the year. Assets
and liabilities items have been converted to British Pounds (‡) for presentation purposes at the closing rate. The resulting exchange
differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
For translation of the financial data, the exchange rates of Ukrainian Hryvna to GBP and USD officially set by the National Bank of Ukraine
were used. The weighted average rate for the year was calculated based on the daily exchange rates officially set by the Bank of Ukraine.
(r) Pension costs
The Group contributes to the Ukrainian mandatory state pension scheme, social insurance and employment funds in respect of its
employees. The Group’s pension scheme contributions are expensed as incurred and are included in staff costs. The Group doesn’t
operate any other pension schemes.
(s) Financial assets
The group classifies its financial assets into one of the following categories, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
Other than financial assets in a qualifying hedging relationship (see below), the group’s accounting policy for each category is as
follows:
Fair value through profit or loss:  This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives.  They are carried in the balance sheet at fair
value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.  The group does not have any assets held for trading nor does it
voluntarily classify any financial assets as being at fair value through profit or loss.
 
Hryvna for 
1 GBP (‡) 
Hryvna for 
1 USD ($) 
Official rate as at December 31, 2006 9.9045 5.0500 
Official rate as at December 31, 2005 8.6759 5.0500 
Weighted average rate for 2006  9.3128 5.0500 
Weighted average rate for 2005 9.3129 5.0500 
  32
Loans and receivables:  These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market.  They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (trade debtors), but also incorporate
other types of contractual monetary asset.  They are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provision for
impairment.
Held-to-maturity investments:  These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities
that the group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.  These assets are measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, with changes through the income statement.
Available-for-sale:  Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available-for-sale and comprise
the group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.  They are carried at
fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.  Where a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset
constitutes objective evidence of impairment, the amount of the loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted
securities), the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
(t) Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired.  Other
than financial liabilities in a qualifying hedging relationship (see below), the group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss:  This category comprises only out-of-the-money derivatives.  They are carried in the balance sheet at
fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Other financial liabilities:  Other financial liabilities include the following items:
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are recognised at amortised cost.
Bank borrowings, certain preference shares and the debt element of convertible debt issued by the group are initially recognised at the
amount advanced net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.  Such interest bearing liabilities are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the
period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the balance sheet.  “Interest expense” in this context
includes initial transaction costs and premia payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is
outstanding.
(u) Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when
declared by the directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
(v) Share issue costs
All qualifying transaction costs in respect of the issue of shares are accounted for as a deduction from equity, net of any related tax
deduction. Qualifying transaction costs include:
·     Costs of preparing the prospectus
·     Accounting, tax and legal expenses
·     Underwriting fees
·     Valuation fees in respect of the shares and of other assets
(w) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
4. Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, and price risk), credit risk,
liquidity risk and cash flow interest-rate risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of
financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasurer under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Group Treasurer
identifies and evaluates financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. The management board provides broad 33
guidance and operating principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign
exchange risk, interest-rate risk, credit risk, and investing excess liquidity.
Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
Although the Group is an international operator, the management believe that the foreign exchange risk is minimal at present and is likely
to remain so in the future. The Group’s international operations consist primarily of the export of milk powders to the various markets
around the world. The primary currency for export sales is the US dollar.
The Group’s established corporate policy towards minimising the potential foreign exchange risk is to require the customers to pay for
the export shipments of the skimmed milk powder in full and in advance (from one to two months). The Group’s export operations have
never employed any other payment methods as a matter of corporate principle, and this is expected to continue in the future. Similarly,
the Group has never been engaged in forward transactions and does not expect to conduct these transactions in the future. The
Directors believe that these policies effectively eliminate the foreign exchange risk. The Group’s export-related obligations in Ukraine,
such as payments for raw milk and packaging materials, are all entirely Hryvna-denominated. The UAH/US dollar exchange rate has
been reasonably stable in recent years; the directors have no reason to believe that this is likely to change in the future.
Price risk
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk for its milk powders business segment. The price for this product is predominately
determined by the world market and the activities of large international trading companies in this market. There is always a risk that the
prevailing world marketing price may be insufficient to cover the production costs for skimmed milk powder. Against such a risk, the
Group recognises that there is no effective financial hedge, thus the major instrument employed in management of the price risk is tight
control of operating costs.
Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales of products both in
Ukraine and abroad are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of
committed credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group’s Treasurer aims to maintain flexibility in
funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
Cash flow and fair value interest-rate risk
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of
changes in market interest rates.
The Group’s interest-rate risk arises from medium to long-term borrowings. Potentially, borrowings issued at variable rates expose the
Group to cash flow interest-rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest-rate risk. Operating Group
policy is to maintain at least 80% of its borrowings in fixed rate instruments. At 31 December 2006, all borrowings were at fixed rates.
5. Change in accounting estimates
Effective from 1 January 2006, the Group changed the accounting estimate of the intra-group loans. In the previously reported
periods, such loans gave rise to the currency exchange differences that were recorded in Income Statement. From 1 January 2006,
the intra-group loans are accounted for as investments in the Ukrainian subsidiaries and reflected in the equity reserves. Had the
estimate been changed on 1 January 2005, the net income for year 2005 would have been ‡1,438,000. The impact on the current
year 2006 was an exchange loss of ‡283,000.
6. Prior year adjustment
In November 2005, the Group acquired Letichiv and Jhmerinka plants. IFRS 3 requires the Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) exercise to
be performed within 12 months from the date of acquisition. Such exercise was performed by an independent valuer Uvecon within the
period of twelve months from the date of acquisition. The corresponding Adjustment to reflect the effects of the PPA exercise on Balance 34
Sheet as at 31 December 2005 was made in the accounts. There was no material effect of the prior year adjustment on Income Statement
and Cash Flow Statement.

The majority of the Group’s recognised assets and liabilities are in Ukraine. Sales to the countries in Europe represent sales to
international traders of milk powders located in Europe. These traders consequently resell the milk powders to other countries
worldwide.
8. Property, plant and equipment
Fixed assets with a net book value of  ‡5,680,555 as at 31 December 2006 (‡4,453,000 at 31 December 2005) were pledged as collateral

The PPA adjustments made to the book value of assets are shown in the following table.
Upon carrying out an impairment review for the carrying amount of the goodwill, no goodwill write-off was recorded. As the entire
amount of the carrying value of the goodwill after the PPA exercise is attributed to Letichevsky Maslozavod OJSC, the key
assumptions on which the management based the cash flow projections from the plant were, firstly, the continuing value from the
plant is securing the milk supply zone from the competitive milk collectors (the “physical presence competitive defense assumption”)
and, secondly, a cluster of the continuing relevant dairy expertise that existed on the plant (“relevant dairy expertise assumption”). In
the opinion of the management, the values assigned to each of the two key assumptions were as follows: ‡100,000 – to physical
presence competitive defense assumption and ‡84,000 – to relevant expertise assumption. The period over which the cash flows
were assessed to each assumption was under five years although it is the management’s view that the assumption might be relevant
even after this term. The discount rate applied to the projections was 12%.
The intangible asset “Customer list” represents the captive individual suppliers of raw milk in the vicinity of Letichevsky Maslozavod
OJSC and Jmerinsky Maslosyrzavod LLC. In Ukraine, where about 80% of the entire milk comes from the individual producers, the
existing supplier base is very important for the dairy producers and thus is valuable. The acquired asset “Customer list” was
recognised in the accounts on the basis of the Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) exercise conducted within the 12-month period
following the acquisitions of two plants. The asset was valued by an independent valuer Uvecon using the sales comparison method
and depreciated replacement cost (DRC) methods (for tangible assets) and income and cost advantage methods (intangible assets).

19. Other reserves
The reduction in revaluation reserve is due to sale of property, plant and equipment which have previously been revalued. The
following describes the nature and purpose of each reserve within owners’ equity.
Fund-raising expenses. The Group has entered into equity-settled share-based transactions with parties other than employees
and has measured the transactions indirectly at the fair value of the instruments granted. This party was WH Ireland who acted as broker
of the fund-raising for the Group by placing ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange, section AIM in February 2005. The fair
value of the share-based instruments (warrants) given to the broker as part of consideration was ‡120,000.

The weighted average applicable tax rate was 6.6% (2005: 11.7%). The charge is due to the changes in profitability of the companies
comprising the Group in the respective countries.
Ukraine currently has a system of taxation broadly similar in scope to those of the developed market economies. There are a number of
laws related to various taxes imposed by both central and regional governmental authorities. Although laws related to these taxes have
not been in force for significant periods, the practice of taxation and implementation of regulations are well established, documented
with a sufficient degree of clarity and adhered to by the taxpayers. Nevertheless, there remain certain risks in relation to the Ukrainian tax
system: few court precedents with regard to tax related issues exist; different opinions regarding legal interpretation may arise both
among and within government ministries and regulatory agencies; tax compliance practice is subject to review and investigation by a
number of authorities with overlapping responsibilities.
Generally, tax declarations remain subject to inspection for an indefinite period. In practice, however, the risk of retroactive tax assessments
and penalty charges decreases significantly after three years. The fact that a year has been reviewed does not preclude the Ukrainian tax
service performing a subsequent inspection of that year.
The Group’s management believes that it has adequately provided for tax liabilities in the accompanying financial statements; however,
the risk remains that those relevant authorities could take different positions with regard to interpretive issues.
During the period under review, the Ukrainian companies within the Group paid royalties and interest charge on the outstanding credits
and bonds to another Group company – Linkstar Limited (Cyprus). These payments were not taxable in Ukraine due to the existing
Double Taxation Treaty between Ukraine and Cyprus.
27. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing net profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders (profit for the year) by the
weighted average number of shares in issue. The diluted earnings per share take into account the potential exercise of all options and
warrants in existence and in the money at the date of this report. The options were granted to the Directors of the Company on 31
January, 2005 and are exercisable until 11 February 2009 at the price of 57 pence. The warrants were granted to the Company’s Brokers
on 31 January 2005 and are exercisable until 31 January 2008 at the price of 53.5 pence.
Although no potentially dilutive instruments existed at 31 December 2006, the company has 1,302,896 share warrants issued to the
nominated broker WH Ireland exercisable until 11 February 2008 at a price 53.5 pence and  912,028 share options issued to the
Directors exercisable until 11 February 2009 at a price 57 pence.  The effect of these warrants and options is antidilutive.
28. Share-based payments
The Company operates an equity-settled share based remuneration scheme for employees. During the period under review the Company
did not grant share options to the Directors. All options granted to the Directors in the prior periods and outstanding as at 31 December
2006 vested on 11 February 2006 and expire on February 11, 2009. During 2006, the exercise price of the options granted to the
Directors was increased from 53.5 pence to 57 pence to reflect the market conditions at the time. As a result of the modifications, no
incremental fair value was granted to the Directors as the new market price reflected the current market conditions and the options
remained out of money during the year. Thus no additional charge was recorded in the accounts.

The fair value of the options granted in 2005 was ‡95,336. An Income Statement remuneration charge of ‡19,336 was recognised in
2006 (2005: ‡76,000).
The fair value of options granted in 2005 has been calculated based on the following data.
To account for dividend yield in the Black-Scholes model, the modified current stock prices were calculated at option grant dates by
subtracting present value of future dividend payments from the actual stock price at those dates. Dividends were assumed to be paid
in two half-yearly instalments. Expected volatility was approximated by an average historical volatility of the peer group companies.
The latter was calculated from daily standard deviations of the peer group stock returns during last 4 years.
29. Dividends
As at 20 April 2007, the Board of Directors proposed the final dividend payment of 0.51 pence per ordinary share for the year ended 31
December 2006 which would lead to 0.61 pence per ordinary share for the full year. If approved at the AGM, the final dividend will be
paid on 29 June 2007 to the shareholders on the register as at 1 June 2007. No tax consequences for the Group will arise out of this
transaction as the Group’s parent company is an entity registered under the Jersey laws.
The directors are proposing a final dividend of 0.51 pence (2005 – 0.50 pence) per share totalling ‡210,000 (2005: ‡206,000). This
dividend has not been accrued at the balance sheet date.

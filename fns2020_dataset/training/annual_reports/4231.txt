One OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
Year ended 31 December 2003
RESULTS CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Two
"2003 has seen a significant change in the
structure and financial health of the company"
At the end of the 2002 financial year Crown Sports
consisted of 22 Dragons Health Clubs, 27 Fitness
Express management contracts, an Australian
publishing business, 8 golf clubs, and a horse betting
business. We had reported Group operating losses of
over £6.0m and net debt of £35.7m. 
A year later I am able to report a significant change in
the structure and financial health of the business.
During 2003 Crown Sports took significant strides
forward and is now an operationally stronger business
with a clear focus on Health and Fitness, a market in
which we see opportunities for future growth. For the
year to 31 December 2003, the Group achieved a small
operating profit despite £3.0m of exceptional costs,
and most significantly reduced debt by around 50% to
£18.0m.
Despite continuing tough conditions I am able to
report a solid year for the Dragons Health Clubs
business which is our continuing business going
forward. Turnover from these continuing operations
fell to £22.6m (2002: £24.6m) mainly due to the
ongoing pressure on joining fees and competitive
marketing offers. Due to a reduction in central
overheads and good club cost control, operating
profits from the continuing businesses, before
exceptional items and goodwill, improved by 32% to
£3.7m (2002: £2.8m). Exceptional items relating
principally to the sale of the disposed businesses
totalled £3.0m and resulted in the Group reporting
pre-tax losses of £2.0m (2002: loss £6.1m). Earnings
per share before exceptional items reduced slightly to
0.3p (2002: 0.4p).
During the year we completed the sale of Crown Golf
to Bennelong for £15.4m in cash, disposed of The
Winning Line to Last Race Ltd for £0.07m and sold
Crown Content, the Australian publishing business 
to Sportsbrand Media Group for an initial
consideration of £1.0m. Since the year end we have
also sold our health club in Leamington Spa for £1.3m
representing 16 times earnings before interest,
taxation, depreciation and amortisation. On 30 March
2004 we also sold the Fitness Express business for
£1.15m.
During 2003 we also commenced the process of
making two important changes to the structure of our
business that we hope to implement in 2004.
First, a resolution will be put to shareholders at the
AGM in respect of the re-organisation of capital which
will eliminate the deficit on the profit and loss account.
If this is successfully implemented we will be in a
position where we can, if we choose to do so
commence dividend payments in the future.
Secondly, at the Interim results in September 2003 I
indicated that we hoped to move to AIM by the end of
the financial year. The administrative process has
proceeded slower than anticipated, however we are
confident that this will be concluded within the next
few months. 
OUTLOOK
Last year I communicated to shareholders that we had
a clear plan for 2003 and I can confirm that the
strategic and operational objectives highlighted were
met. The transitional year for Crown Sports is behind
us and we can now concentrate fully on growing the
core Dragons business.  Three
For the future we remain well placed in the industry
and the market in which we operate due to:
• consistent profit delivery and cash generation from
our core business;
• a level of net debt which at year end had reduced
down to £18.0m representing a lower gearing of
37% (following the disposals of the Leamington
Spa club and Fitness Express in Q1 2004, gearing
has reduced further to 31%);
• a property portfolio that is underpinned by 10
freehold and 7 long leasehold properties which
provides a valuable platform of tangible assets and
low operating costs.
The board of Crown Sports Plc remain committed to
our belief that the health and fitness market has good
long term prospects and that our focus on improving
our operations, delivering profit growth and reducing
debt will improve shareholder value. 2004 has started
well with positive trends in new joiners and
membership growth and providing that market
conditions do not deteriorate we should continue to
progress.
Finally, once again I would like to thank the staff of
Crown Sports Plc for their contribution to the
company’s performance in 2003.
RAY PIERCE
Chairman Crown Sports plc operates the Dragons Health
Club brand which currently consists of 21 mid
sized health and fitness clubs across England that
provide gym, swimming, spa, racquets and social
facilities.
Despite the continuing difficult trading environment in
2003 we can report that last year we achieved a
number of our key business and financial objectives. 
In particular we have:
• disposed of our identified non core businesses
enabling us to focus on the health and fitness
sector where we see good long term prospects for
growth;
• increased the operating profit of our continuing
business by 32%;
• improved our overall financial position with a
further £18m of debt paid down in a business
which is underpinned by a high level of freehold
and long leasehold assets.
During 2003, as a result of the competitive market
conditions and the increasing level of new
membership deals and offers both the yield per
member and joining fees were put under pressure.
Primarily as a result of these factors our membership
revenues fell by 6%, however this was offset by
operational cost reductions of 11% which resulted in
an operating profit before amortisation and any central
costs of £6.0m, which was in line with previous year’s
performance.
Importantly, the Dragons business maintained its
strong focus on customers which resulted in a 21%
reduction in the number of members terminating their
membership compared to the previous year. This was
due, in part, to our unique Dragons Promise retention
programme and the introduction of new categories of
longer term memberships. As a result we reversed the
previous decline in membership and in 2003 grew our
membership finishing the year at just over 51,500. 
In the area of joiners we introduced a number of new
membership initiatives and in the latter part of the year
recruited additional marketing expertise and resource
that contributed to an improvement in our sales
position.
In addition, we invested £0.4m in refurbishment 
work in 6 clubs in order to improve the member
environment and enhance the sales potential. Early
results have been positive and as a result we plan to
roll out these improvements into a further group of
clubs in 2004. 
All of the above financial performance excludes the
Leamington Spa club which was sold as a going
concern for £1.3m. The sale of the club, which was our
only town centre operation and did not reflect the
location profile of the rest of the group, represented a
good opportunity to generate cash that has been used
to further pay down debt.
Looking forward, we believe that the measures put in
place during 2003 have put us in a good position to
take advantage of the long term positive trends in
health and fitness.
In particular, the Dragons business will benefit from
the following:
• a robust member base with a high percentage of
the more loyal over 35’s age group and a proven
record of retention improvement;
• strong cash generation combined with a high
freehold and long leasehold asset base;
• a solid management team who have a proven
ability to deliver substantial cost efficiencies and
positive member trends.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Four Five
In the short term the market remains tough and highly
competitive, but we are continuing to see encouraging
growth in our membership levels as a result of highly
effective retention programmes combined with strong
marketing and club specific pricing strategies. 
Finally, in the first quarter of 2004 we can report that
on a like for like basis the number of new joiners has
increased by 11%, this was combined with better
retention, with a 13% reduction in the number of
leavers. Overall, the net increase in members is almost
3 times that achieved in the first quarter of last year.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW Six
DRAGONS HEALTH CLUBS
The 22 Dragons health clubs (prior to the sale of the
Leamington Spa club on 20 January 2004) decreased
turnover by 8% to £22.6m which includes the negative
impact of franchising food and beverage operations in
a number of clubs. Operating profit before
amortisation stayed flat at £6.0m. Membership
increased over the course of the year to 51,500. 
FITNESS EXPRESS
Fitness Express is a management contract business in
the health and fitness market and was acquired by
Crown Sports plc in April 2001. Turnover decreased
by 9% to £3.1m (2002: £3.5m) and operating profit
before amortisation decreased to £0.1m (2002:
£0.3m). Membership numbers have increased to
21,500 at the year end. 
The business was disposed of on 30 March 2004 and
has been classified as a discontinued operation.
OTHER BUSINESSES
Other businesses comprise Crown Golf, Crown

Crown Content is a publishing business based in
Melbourne, Australia which Crown Sports Plc

before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
(2002 profit: £0.1m). The business was disposed of on
5 August 2003.
The Winning Line is a specialist betting business and
was acquired by Crown Sports Plc in April 2001. The

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are as follows:
£m
Impairment of Goodwill and
other tangible assets (see below) 2.9
Reorganisation/restructuring costs 0.1
Total operating exceptional items 3.0
Profit on disposal of Crown Golf (0.4)
Profit on disposal of The Winning Line (0.1)
Loss on disposal of Crown Content 0.5
Total exceptional costs (3.0)
Re-organisation costs relate to write-off of termination
payments made to senior managers and staff, following
the reorganisation of the operations reflecting the
Group’s increased focus on the Dragons Health Clubs
business and disposal of the non-core operations.
GOODWILL AND OTHER 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
A review of the carrying value of goodwill and other
intangible assets arising on past acquisitions has led to
an impairment provision, which has no impact on the
business’s current year cash flows, being made of
£2.9m. This all relates to goodwill that arose on the
acquisition of the Fitness Express business, Studio
Fitness Enterprises Ltd, and the write down reflects the
consideration received on the sale of the business on 
30 March 2004.
INTEREST
Net interest payable has reduced to £2.0m before
exceptional items (2002: £2.2m). No exceptional
interest charges have been made this year (2002:
£0.8m).
Net interest excluding exceptional items was covered
1.5 times by operating profit before exceptional items
(2002: 1.9 times).
TAXATION
The tax charge for the year was £0.3m (2002: £1.0m).
Taxation has been provided after taking account of tax
losses available from earlier years and a provision for
deferred taxation as required by Financial Reporting
Standard 19 ‘Deferred Taxation’.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per ordinary share before exceptional items
were 0.3p (2002: 0.4p) and the loss per share after
exceptional items was 0.8p (2002: 2.5p loss).
DIVIDENDS
The Company currently has a substantial deficit on
distributable reserves and is therefore unable to pay
dividends to the shareholders. Subject to shareholder
approval at the Annual General Meeting, the Board is
planning to undertake a capital restructuring exercise
whereby the deficit on distributable reserves is offset
against the share premium account. This will allow the
payment of dividends from profits made after the date
when this restructuring becomes effective.
CASH FLOW
Cash inflow from operating activities (before
exceptional items) for the year was £5.0m (2002:
£5.2m). Net cash outflows from capital expenditure
and financial investment was £1.3m (2002: £11.4m
inflow). The net cash inflows from acquisitions and
disposals was £15.0m (2002: £0.6m outflow). 
The net cash outflow was £0.7m (2002: £2.3m),
funded through increased borrowings.
BANKING FACILITIES
Net debt at the year end amounted to £18.0m,
resulting in a balance sheet gearing ratio of 37%.
Bank facilities totalling £53.0m were arranged in April
2002. These replaced a range of facilities which had
previously existed within the business. Of the new
facilities £40.0m is a term loan repayable over 7 years.
The costs involved in arranging these facilities
amounted to £1.2m, which have been capitalised over
the duration of the facility. Where early repayments
have been made amortisation of these costs has been
accelerated.
As at 31 December 2003 the bank loans outstanding
under these facilities amounted to £17.4m (2002:
£33.5m). Following the sale of the Dragons club at
Leamington Spa on 20 January 2004 and the disposal
of Fitness Express on 30 March 2004, the loans were
reduced to £15.0m (see Post Balance Sheet Events
below). Following these transaction the balance sheet
gearing ratio fell to 31%. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Eight
SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS
Shareholders’ funds reduced in the year by £2.3m to
£48.7m (2002: £51.0m).
The retained loss for the year was £2.3m (2002:
£7.2m). 
Net assets per share at the balance sheet date were
16.7p per share (2002: 17.6p).
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRIOR YEAR
ADJUSTMENT
No changes have been made to the Group’s accounting
policies in 2003.
TREASURY POLICIES
The Board sets the treasury policies of the Group and
lays down parameters within which the various aspects
of treasury risk are managed.
Interest rate risk is managed through interest rate
derivatives which cap the group exposure to interest
rate increases but limit the benefits it derives from
reductions in interest rates.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENT
The Dragons Health Club at Leamington Spa was 
sold on 20 January 2004 for £1.3m. Studio Fitness
Enterprises Ltd was sold on 30 March 2004 for
£1.15m. After deducting the costs of the sale, the net
proceeds from both of these transactions were used to
repay bank debt.
TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL
FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
For reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January
2005, the consolidated accounts of the group must
comply with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS).
These financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with UK accounting standards. The
consolidated financial performance and financial
position as disclosed in these financial statements may
be significantly different if determined in accordance
with IFRS. Major differences between UK accounting
standards and IFRS identified to date as potentially
having a significant effect on the consolidated financial
statements may include: fair value accounting for all
financial instruments, including derivatives; the
requirement to provide for deferred taxation on
potential capital gains calculated on the book value of
revalued properties and fair value adjustments arising
on acquisition; and accounting for the intrinsic fair
value of the cost of share options granted to employees
in the profit and loss account. The group has not
quantified these differences. 
This summary should not be taken as an exhaustive
list of all the differences between UK accounting
standards and IFRS that potentially have a significant
impact on the consolidated financial statements. No
attempt has been made to identify all disclosure,
presentation or classification differences that would
affect the manner in which transactions or events are
presented.
In addition, the bodies that establish UK accounting
standards and IFRS have significant ongoing projects
that could affect the potential differences and the
impact of these differences on the future consolidated
financial statements. The actual impact on the
consolidated accounts of the adoption of IFRS will
depend on the standards applicable and the particular
circumstances prevailing on adoption of IFRS on 1
January 2005.

external training and by means of bonus arrangements.
The Group has a policy of keeping employees up to
date with major developments by means of regular
staff meetings.
It is the policy of the Group not to discriminate against
disabled persons whether in, or applying for,
employment. Disabled applicants for employment or
those who become disabled while in the company’s
employment are not considered less favourably than
those without disabilities and appointments of
disabled people are made on the same terms and
conditions as other comparable employees without
disabilities. For the purposes of training, career
development and promotion, disabled employees are
treated in the same way as other employees.

Chairman Thirteen REMUNERATION REPORT
PURPOSE 
The remuneration and emoluments of Executive Directors are determined by the Board based on the
recommendations of the Remuneration Committee. The composition of the Remuneration Committee is set out
on page 10. 
The Committee's overall purpose is to ensure that the Company's Executive Directors are fairly rewarded and that
the remuneration of such Directors is independently approved and monitored.
The principal terms of reference of the Committee are as follows:
• To determine the Company's broad policy for executive remuneration and the entire individual remuneration
packages including, but not limited to, pension rights and any compensation payments and share option
entitlements for each of the Executive Directors and, as appropriate, other senior executives.
• To give full consideration to the Combined Code, including matters relating to disclosure, remuneration policy
and service contracts and compensation.
The fees of the Directors on the Remuneration Committee are agreed by the full Board.
The committee has access to independent advice where it considers appropriate, however no external advice has
been required during 2003.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
The following graph charts the total cumulative shareholder return of
the company since 1 January 1999.
The index selected was the FTSE Leisure and hotels index. This is
considered to be appropriate as it includes Crown Sports Plc itself and
a number of other health club operators.
BASE SALARY AND BENEFITS
The base salary and benefits of Executive Directors are normally reviewed annually, by the Remuneration
Committee. It is the aim of the Remuneration Committee to reward Executive Directors competitively and any
change reflects both business and individual performance.
The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the following section of the report.
BONUSES
The Group operates a non-pensionable annual bonus scheme for Executive Directors and Senior Managers. The
financial targets set for bonuses are reviewed and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
A bonus of £15,000 was payable to Martyn Grealey in respect of the year ended 31 December 2003.
PENSION SCHEME ARRANGEMENTS
The Company contributes an agreed sum to pension schemes of Executive Directors, which are externally
administered, for the benefit of Directors. 
M Grealey was appointed Director on 14 January 2003. The company contributes 10% of his base salary
(excluding bonus and benefits) to his pension scheme.
During the year contributions were made to the pension scheme of M Grealey of £15,000 (2002 contributions:
£7,849). No payments have been made during the year to any other Director who served during 2003.

Fees payable to Bennelong and LMS, who are substantial shareholders and in which J Chapman and R Rayne
respectively have interests, in the year to 31 December 2003 are disclosed in note 22.
SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The Company operated the Crown Sports Plc Senior Executive Share Option Plan (the "Executive Plan"). The
Executive Plan enables options to be granted to Directors and employees of the Company and any subsidiary of
the Company . The scheme is not approved by the Inland Revenue for the purposes of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988. The Scheme is administered by the Board in the light of recommendations from the Remuneration
Committee.
Participation is at the discretion of the Board. However, in order to qualify, Executive Directors and employees
must devote substantially the whole of their working time to the affairs of the Group.
Options may usually be exercised between three and ten years after their date of grant. Earlier exercise is, however,
permitted on the death, disability , redundancy or retirement of the option holder, or the sale or transfer out of the
Group of the employing company , business or that part of the business to which the employment relates, or in any
other circumstances approved by the Board. The Remuneration Committee agreed that a percentage of future share
options grants to Directors would only be exercisable dependent upon performance criteria being achieved.

M Grealey was appointed Director on 14 January 2003. He received a grant under the Executive Plan of 1,000,000
share options, exercisable at 12.5p, on joining the Group in 2002. 30% of the grant is subject to performance
criteria, requiring like for like Dragons operating profit to grow by an average of 10% per annum by 2004,
compared to each of 2003, 2002, 2001.
The highest and lowest prices of the company’s shares during the year were 8p and 5.12p respectively. The price
at the year end was 7.37p.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
None of the Executive Directors has a service contract which is terminable on greater than one year’s notice.
Apart from a fixed fee determined by the Board, the Non-Executive Directors have no service contracts and do not
receive any pension benefits. 
Martyn Grealey was appointed Chief Executive of Crown Sports Plc with effect from 14 January 2003. Prior to this
he had held the position of Managing Director of Dragons Health Clubs Plc. In line with company policy, his
service agreement has a notice provision of 12 months from the employer and 6 months from the employee and
there is no provision for loss of office included in the contract. His basic salary is not dependent on performance
criteria, however a discretionary bonus and the share options granted to him in 2002 are both subject to such
criteria. His potential annual bonus is principally based on group performance in terms of profitability and
exceeding profit targets. He is also entitled to a bonus dependent on future share price performance. 
On behalf of the Board
R F PIERCE
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Fifteen The company is committed to high standards of Corporate Governance in line with Section 1 of the Combined
Code. 
APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE
Directors
The composition of the Board changed on 14 January 2003 when Ray Pierce was appointed Chairman and Martyn
Grealey was appointed Chief Executive. Following these appointments there is now a clear delineation of
responsibility between the Chairman and Chief Executive.
Following the changes to the Board in early 2003 the Board currently comprises one executive and three non-
executive Directors. Each Director submits himself for re-election at least every three years. An Alternate Director
has been appointed for one of the non-executive directors. The alternate director will attend Board meetings only
if the nominated director for whom he is acting as alternate is unable to attend. 
Ray Pierce has continued to be designated the senior independent non-executive Director, throughout 2003.
Biographical details of the Directors are given on page 9. 
The Board of Directors meets regularly (not less than six times a year) and has a schedule of matters specifically
reserved to it for decision. It has delegated authority to Committees of the Board on other specific matters. The
day to day management of the Group’s businesses is delegated to the Chief Executive assisted by certain other
senior managers who together form the Executive Committee. Details of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees are given below. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and to independent professional
advice, if required, at the Company’s expense and receive appropriate training on joining the Board. Cargil
Management Services Ltd is appointed as Company Secretary to the Group.
All Directors appointed during the period will seek re-election at the first AGM following their appointment.
The Board has established the following committees, to facilitate its operations:
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee meets no less than three times a year and assists the Board in reviewing the effectiveness of
internal control systems. The Committee also reviews financial statements to be published externally before their
submission to the Board. It also authorises changes in accounting policies.
The committee receives reports from the Risk Management Committee concerning the effectiveness of the Group
Risk Management process.
The Committee reviews and approves terms of reference and fees of the external auditors and considers their
independence. The Committee meets at least annually with the external auditors without management present.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee meets not less than twice a year and is responsible for determining the
remuneration packages of Executive Directors and Senior Management. The report on Directors’ remuneration on
page 13 gives full details of the company’s policy on executive remuneration and of individual Directors’
remuneration packages.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Sixteen No Director is present during any meeting of the remuneration committee at which his own remuneration is
discussed. The fees of the non-executive Directors are a matter for the Board as a whole.
THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee comprises the entire board, due to the small number of Directors. The whole
Board considers the appointment of new Directors.
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
The Executive Committee meets monthly and is not a committee of the Board. Its role is to assist the Chief
Executive in fulfilling his responsibilities for directing and promoting the profitable operation and
development of the Group. The Committee has been led by the Chief Executive throughout 2003.
The composition of each of these Committees is given on page 10.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Directors review the effectiveness of the Group’s system for all internal controls annually , including financial,
operational, compliance, and risk management. The Board confirm that it has established procedures necessary to
comply fully with the Turnbull Guidance ‘Internal Control Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’.
The control framework and key review processes in place over the various business and geographical operations
of the Group are as follows:
• The Board sets corporate strategy and business objectives. The Executive Committee and divisional
management must integrate these objectives into their operational and financial business plans for
presentation to the Board. Where areas for improvement in the system of Internal Control are identified, the
Board considers the recommendations made by the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee;
• The Executive Committee meets regularly together with other senior executives to consider group operational
and financial performance and business development. The Chief Executive reports to the Board on behalf of
the Executive Committee on significant changes in the business and external environment. The Group’s
Finance Director provides the Board with monthly financial information which includes key performance and
risk indicators;
• The management of each business unit has been charged with the ongoing responsibility for identifying the
risks facing the unit and for putting in place procedures to mitigate and monitor risks. Management report
regularly on their review of risks and how they are managed to the Executive Committee;
• The Group has established a Risk Management Committee with responsibility for ensuring key risks are
identified, the potential impact is assessed and action is taken to mitigate the risks concerned. The Risk
Management Committee reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis;
• The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management process
and refers significant risks to the Board for consideration. The Audit Committee review reports from the
external auditors on the system of internal control, including the identification of material weaknesses. The
Audit Committee discusses with management the actions taken in relation to all problem areas identified. The
Chairman of the Audit Committee reports to the Board on the outcome of the Audit Committee meetings held
and the Board receives the minutes of all such meetings;
Seventeen • The Treasury position of the Group is managed centrally and is the responsibility of the Group’s Finance
Director who attends all Board meetings. Reports and forecasts are submitted monthly to the Board;
• Financial forecasts are prepared routinely throughout the year for review by the Board, with sensitivity analysis
where appropriate, and include details of the Group’s on-going compliance with its regulatory and banking
requirements. The Group has set investment appraisal and authorisation procedures and capital expenditure
is reviewed against budgets which have been approved by the Board;
• There are supporting group policies and employee procedures for the reporting and resolution of suspected
fraudulent activities. It is the aim of the Group to employ and train staff and management of high integrity,
and compliance with external regulation and internal policies is demanded from all staff.
The Board has carried out a specific assessment of the company’s system of internal control in operation during
the year ended 31 December 2003 and up to the date of this Annual Report and Accounts through the monitoring
process described above. The Audit Committee and Risk Management Committee have assisted the Board in
discharging these review responsibilities.
GOING CONCERN
The Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts as after making appropriate
enquiries it considers that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
Certain circumstances that arose during 2002, including the events of the final quarter involving the offer for the
company by Bennelong, have made full compliance with the Combined Code difficult to achieve in 2003.
An agreement was negotiated with Bennelong towards the end of 2002 that governed the composition of the Board
from January 2003. The agreement required the Board to be reconstituted to specifically include:
• a new independent Non Executive Chairman
• a Chief Executive 
• a Non Executive Director nominated by London Merchant Securities Plc & European Golf club Investment
Ltd
• a Non Executive Director nominated by Bennelong Group Ltd.
The agreement also limits the Board to four Directors unless unanimously agreed by the Directors, and requires
that any change in the composition of the Board from that stated above can only be made with the approval of the
majority of the Board. Under the terms of this agreement two of the Non Executive Directors are not fully
independent as they have been nominated by specific shareholders. However, these Directors are fully
independent of management and recognise their responsibilities to act in the best interests of shareholders as a
whole. An Alternate Director has been appointed for one of the non-executive Directors, the Alternate Director is
also not fully independent as he has also been nominated by a specific shareholder.
The Board has failed to comply fully with the Code provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code
during the period from the start of 2003 to the current date as follows:
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE continued Eighteen Nineteen
Despite the areas of non-compliance discussed above the Board consider that during 2003 these committees
functioned effectively as then constituted. Following further review the Board considers that the committees will
continue to function effectively going forwards despite the continuing areas of non-compliance discussed above.

B.2.2 Remuneration

Following the Board changes on 14 January 2003 where Ray Pierce was
appointed Chairman, due to the requirements of the agreement described
above, there is no fully independent Director other than the Chairman who
could be appointed to this post. Thus the Board will not fully comply with this
provision of the code going forward, as Ray Pierce holds both this post and the
post of Chairman.
From 14 January 2003 under the terms of the agreement described above
neither of the Non Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) is fully
independent. Therefore the Board will not comply with this provision going
forwards.
Full compliance has not been achieved under the terms of the agreement
described above. The Non Executive Directors (other than the Chairman) are
not fully independent. This non-compliance will continue going forward.
This provision has not been met in 2003 and non-compliance will continue
going forwards. Following the Board changes on 14 January 2003 the Audit
Committee does now comprise three Non Executive Directors, however due to
the agreement discussed above only one of these Directors is independent. STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing
those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements; 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company and the group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
R F PIERCE
Chairman
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES Twenty We have audited the financial statements on pages 23 to 51. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body , in accordance with section 235 of the Companies
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Directors’ remuneration report. As
described on page 20, this includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are
established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and by our profession’s ethical guidance. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not
consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed. 
We review whether the statement on page 18 reflects the company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the corporate governance statement and
the un-audited part of the Directors’ remuneration report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. 
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed. 
Twenty One INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF CROWN SPORTS PLC We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of
the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be
audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at 31st
December 2003 and of the loss of the group for the year then ended; and 
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Basis of Accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
applicable accounting standards. All accounting policies have been consistent throughout the period.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all Group
undertakings made up to 31 December 2003.
The consolidated financial statements are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. 
The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included in the profit and loss account after or up to the date
that control passes respectively.
As a consolidated profit and loss account is published, a separate profit and loss account for the parent Company
is omitted from the Group financial statements by virtue of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful
economic life of that asset as follows:
Freehold Buildings – 50 years
Long Leasehold Property – 50 years
Short Leasehold Property – Over the unexpired term of the lease
Surface finishes – 15 years
Fixtures, Fittings & Equipment – 3-10 years
Motor Vehicles – 4 years
Land is not depreciated.
The Directors carry out regular impairment reviews of the freehold and leasehold buildings in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard No 11. Provisions for impairments in value are taken to the profit and loss account.
Turnover
Turnover represents membership entrance fees and subscription income receivable in respect of the year together
with sales of leisure and catering services at invoice value excluding value added tax. Membership fees are time
apportioned over the period that they apply.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL Twenty Eight
STATEMENTS
Year Ended 31 December 2003 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Goodwill
Purchased goodwill (both positive and negative) arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 28
December 1997, when FRS 10 ‘Goodwill and intangible assets’ was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year
of acquisition. When a subsequent disposal occurs any related goodwill previously written off to reserves is written
back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given and associated costs over
the fair value of the separable net assets acquired) arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 28
December 1997 is capitalised. Positive goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated
useful life, normally 20 years. 
Negative goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 28 December 1997 is included within
fixed assets and released to the profit and loss account in the periods in which the fair values of the non-monetary
assets purchased on the same acquisition are recovered, whether through depreciation or sale.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 28 December 1997, the profit or loss on
disposal or termination is calculated after charging (crediting) the un-amortised amount of any related goodwill
(negative goodwill). 
The Directors carry out regular impairment reviews in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 11.
Provisions for impairment in value are taken to the profit and loss account.
Concessions, Licences, Trademarks and Similar Rights
Concessions, licences, trademarks and similar rights are included at cost. The Directors consider these assets to
have an enduring life due to the strength of earnings in the related business and accordingly no regular
amortisation is recorded.
The Directors carry out regular impairment reviews in accordance with FRS 11. Provisions for impairment in value
are taken to the profit and loss account.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow
moving items.
Finance Lease Agreements
Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of
an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease. The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset
and is depreciated in accordance with the above depreciation policies. Future instalments under such leases, net
of finance charges, are included with creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element,
which is charged to the profit and loss account, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation
for future instalments.
Operating Lease Agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with
the lessor are charged against profits as incurred.
Twenty Nine 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Taxation
The charge for tax is based on the profit and loss account for the year and takes into account tax deferred because
of timing differences between the different treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. Provision
is made for deferred tax in accordance with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 19 ‘Deferred
Taxation’ which was adopted in 2002. Except where required by FRS 19, this standard requires full provision to
be made for taxation in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet
date. Deferred tax assets arising from unrelieved losses are only recognised to the extent that they are regarded as
recoverable. 
Going Concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are carried at cost less provisions for impairment in value.
Current Asset Investment in 2002 reflects a subsidiary undertaking’s investment in Crown Sports plc shares carried
at cost. The subsidiary was sold early in 2003. UTIF 37 – purchases and sales of own shares requires, if material,
the company to reclassify the assets in shareholders funds. This was not done, as such an adjustment is not
considered material.
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of
exchange prevailing at that date.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period and their balance
sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet dates. Exchange differences arising on translation of opening net
assets are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. All other exchange differences are included
in the profit and loss account.
Pension Costs
Pension costs relate to defined contribution schemes and are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.

Forty Three 19.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group's principal financial instruments comprise bank term loans, bank overdraft facilities and cash. The
main purpose of these is to finance the Group operations. 
Currently all the Group activities are conducted in sterling and as such no currency risk exists. The activities of
Crown Content Pty Limited were conducted in Australian Dollars but following the disposal of this business in
2003 and the repayment of borrowings denominated in Australian Dollars, there is no currency risk to the Group.
At the year end there were no foreign currency borrowings. 
The Group additionally has other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors which arise
directly from normal trading and as such the Company excludes these in the disclosure below as permitted by
Financial Reporting Standard 13.
Interest rate risks
Under the terms of the loan facilities of the Group taken out during 2002, the Group is exposed to interest rate
risks from any movement in the LIBOR rate.
Interest rate risk is managed through interest rate derivatives which cap the group exposure to interest rate
increases. The Group purchased an interest rate swop financial instrument in May 2002 that protects £24m of
borrowings against upward movements in the LIBOR rate above 6.25% but exposes the Group to charges should
the LIBOR rate fall below the floor specified in the agreement of 3.95%. 
As at 31 December 2003 this financial instrument had a negative market value of £76,000 (2002: £564,000),
which represents the potential cost to the Group should the instrument have been cancelled on that date.
Following the repayments of debt from the proceeds of the sale of the golf business, The Winning Line and Crown
Content, the Group’s debt level is less than that protected by the financial instrument. Accordingly, a provision of
£104,000 against the cost of cancelling the amount of the financial instrument surplus to the Group’s needs was
charged against profit in 2002. During 2003 £49,000 of the provision has been credited to profit against actual
charges incurred under the agreement, and the provision carried forward stands at £55,000 at 31 December 2003. 
To minimise interest costs on bank overdrafts and cash balances a Group netting agreement is in operation.
The fair value of the loan notes is not materially different to the book value of £55,793.

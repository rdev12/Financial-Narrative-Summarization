Chairman’s Statement
Ian Kirkpatrick Chairman
The outlook remains encouraging in our principal
markets around the world.
Financial Highlights 
Turnover for the year was up 25% to
£163.4m (2004: £130.9m) which yielded an
increase in gross profit of 20% to £32.0m
(2004: £26.7m). Operating profit* more than
doubled to £4.5m (2004: £2.0m). Profit
before tax rose to £1.2m (2004: loss of
£4.5m), a turnaround of £5.7m. 
Market Conditions
Since August 2003 we have indicated that
demand and activity levels were beginning
to improve, however, it was in the year
ended 31 January 2005 that we saw these
increased activity levels translate into actual
revenue and profit growth across all of our
markets. In the UK, the market for
permanent IT professionals was very strong
in the first half of the year. In Continental
Europe despite continued challenges facing
the Eurozone economies we were delighted
to be able to increase revenue and double
profits. The US continued its strong growth
and it is particularly satisfying that the
profits for the year now exceed those
achieved in 2001.
The IT Sector recovered strongly during
2004 with higher levels of requirements and
in some areas increases in margins and pay
rates. The recovery in the IT sector occurred
mainly in the first half as a result of a release
of pent up demand and new projects
coming on stream. The contracts business,
which picked up mainly in the second half of
last year, achieved significant growth and
there is some evidence that the margin
decline experienced over the last five years
may have bottomed out.
The Consulting business was affected in the
second half by a fall in business confidence
in the UK due to slowing consumer demand,
rising oil prices and uncertainty in interest
rates and therefore its results were below
our expectations for the final quarter. The
division quickly reduced headcount to
realign costs with revenues. 
Strategic Plan
Over the next three years, our markets are
expected to remain competitive and growth
rates, whilst stable, will be moderate. The
Group’s three year plan is designed to achieve
better than average market growth through
investment in headcount, infrastructure and
our new outsourcing services which will
generate long term visible revenues. This
investment is currently forecast to be £1.0m
over the next 12 months.
In the UK, growth will be driven by
increased geographical penetration
through opening self funding regional
satellite offices. In Europe, investment 
will mainly be focused on increasing
headcount in existing locations and
organic expansion into new territories. In
the US, the Group will seek to increase 
fee-earning capacity aggressively with 
new office openings and expansion of new
services throughout the existing network.
Ian Kirkpatrick
Chairman  Annual Report & Accounts 2005 5 Harvey Nash Group plc
The Group has already begun further
investment in its outsourcing services in the
UK and in the US. The Group will consolidate
its position as a leading provider of senior IT
management and technical professionals,
with substantial capabilities for outsourcing,
both onshore and offshore. Our unique
portfolio of services and increased fee-
earning capacity will maximise growth in
revenues and profits over the next three
years although in the short term the
investment required will inevitably hold back
our progress.
Employees 
The Board expresses its thanks to all the
Group’s staff for their continued
commitment and loyalty throughout the
year. In particular, we believe that their
professionalism, pace and urgency to
deliver, have been the most important
factors in the successful recovery of the
Group and they deserve full recognition. 
Board of Directors
To support the Group’s three year strategic
plan the Board is pleased to announce the
following changes. David Higgins, Chief
Executive Officer will become Executive
Deputy Chairman. Albert Ellis, Group Finance
Director will be promoted to Chief Executive
Officer. The Board will look to appoint a new
Group Finance Director and in the interim,
Albert Ellis will continue to perform the role
until a replacement is appointed. David
Treacher retires at the Annual General
Meeting and the Board would like to thank
him for his valuable contribution and wish
him well for the future. 
Outlook
In the UK, the demand for IT professionals
remains strong with the Resourcing division
continuing its growth. However, the lower
levels of business confidence have impacted
our Consulting division. Whilst still
profitable, Consulting’s revenues are likely to
be lower in the current year than last year. 
In Continental Europe the growth rates in
the first quarter are positive and activity
levels remain high. With higher margins and
improved productivity, this should translate
into strong profit growth.
In the US, the Group is investing significantly
in fee earners, infrastructure and
outsourcing in order to achieve
differentiation, critical mass and enhanced
national coverage. 
Whilst our progress in the current year will
be held back by the investment we are
making in our business and the lower level of
revenues within the Consulting division, the
overall outlook remains encouraging in our
principal markets around the world.
“Our unique portfolio of
services and increased
fee-earning capacity 
will maximise growth in
revenues and profits over
the next three years.” Annual Report & Accounts 2005 6 Harvey Nash Group plc
David Higgins Chief Executive
We have delivered a strong financial performance
growing revenues and operating profits and
demonstrating the strength and quality of the
underlying business.
The Group’s unique portfolio of services 
and strong brand have positioned us well 
to take advantage of the improved market
conditions. As a result, we have delivered 
a strong financial performance, growing
revenues by 25% to £163.4m and operating
profits* up 127% to £4.5m, demonstrating
the strength and quality of its underlying
businesses.
The operating profit margin* of the Group
increased to 2.7% from 1.5% last year as the
Group realised the benefits of increased
volume from higher margin markets.
United Kingdom
Turnover in the UK was up 13.7% to £79.7m
(2004: £70.1m) with net operating profit**
up 90% to £2.2m (2004: £1.1m). 
In the first half year, demand for permanent
IT professionals increased as a result of
more projects coming on line. Once the
volume of projects improved, demand
picked up for flexible IT consultants,
positively affecting the Group’s IT
contracting business, which strengthened 
in the second half. 
In the offshore software development
business, investment began to pay off as 
the forward order book started rising again
following the end of a large project in
Continental Europe in August last year. 
In addition, the sales and marketing
investment which will drive this business
forward in the coming year, was initiated 
in the final quarter.
The Executive Search business experienced
strong demand in the first half year and the
number of interim managers on assignment
was steady. However, as business
confidence weakened towards the end of
the year, clients delayed key senior hiring
decisions and turnover fell back in the
second half.
Continental Europe
Turnover was up 13% to £59.5m (2004:
£52.9m) and operating profit* increased 
by 117% to £1.4m (2004: £0.6m). 
We indicated in April 2004 that activity
levels in Europe were picking up and
revenues were expected to increase even
though the larger European economies had
not yet returned to robust growth. This can
be seen in the 25% improvement in second
half revenues compared with the first half.
Profits in the second half rose by 54% when
compared with the first half, reflecting the
focus on higher margin services. 
In particular, the Benelux countries
experienced increasing numbers of
requirements as the market improved in the
second half of the year. In the Netherlands,
the Group adds value to clients through its
Managed Services, designed to provide
recruitment process outsourcing solutions
to large organisations such as Siemens.
Demand is strong for this service and 
profits in the second half were boosted
considerably as volumes improved. 
Chief Executive’s Statement
David Higgins
Chief Executive “The Group’s success is based on differentation 
and added value services.”
Annual Report & Accounts 2005 7 Harvey Nash Group plc
In France, demand for our Consulting
services remained weak and the business
made a small loss for the year. In the current
year the Group is implementing its plan to
increase its focus on the IT market and
broadening the range of services offered.
Currently the expectation is that the
business as a whole will be profitable by
January 2006.
Germany returned to healthy growth in 
the year ended 31 January 2005 as the
business focussed on providing higher
margin value added services such as 
systems management outsourcing (to IBM
mainframe clients) and specialist candidates
through its SAP competency centre. 
Finally, Switzerland has successfully
leveraged the Group’s portfolio of services
to capitalise on the increasing demand for
permanent IT professionals in the banking
and insurance sector. 
United States
The US was the strongest market for our
services in the world last year. The Group
increased its revenues there by 223% to
£24.1m (2004: £7.4m) and its operating
profit** by 154% to £0.9m (£0.4m). This
growth is partly due to the full benefit of
acquisitions made during the previous year.
The Group opened an office in New Jersey
in October 2004. This is a key commercial
centre where many Fortune 500 companies
have relocated their back office operations
post September 11th. The start up
investment cost, included in the US
operating profit, was £0.1m. In line with the
Group’s strategy of differentiation through
added value services, a key part of the
service offered here is “outsourcing”, mainly
focused on infrastructure and help desk
operations. This office is now gaining
traction in its markets and is expected to
breakeven by January 2006. Winning any
one of a number of outsourcing proposals
which are currently under consideration at
prospective clients, will shorten the
budgeted time to profitability.
In December 2004, the Group acquired the
business and certain assets of Bluesuit
Consulting, a small niche IT Services
business in the Chicago area. This completes
the first stage of our strategic plan to
establish a presence in all the major cities in
the US.
Having grown revenues and profits so
aggressively over the last year, the Group is
now further strengthening its management
team with professional back office and
systems infrastructure which will enable 
the US business to grow to the next level.
Capacity has been created to provide a
sound platform to increase profits in the
medium term although the investment will
weigh heavily on results in the short term. 
In addition, the investment required to
establish an IT outsourcing service is
estimated to be in the region of £0.2m 
in the coming year. This will increase the
opportunity for the Group to continue its
strategy of focusing on added value services
in higher margin markets.
Group Overview
The Group’s success is based on
differentiation and added value services.
Investment in our IT outsourcing and
offshore services will be increased this 
year as clients are looking to their trusted
partners to take more control of their IT
resources. Harvey Nash is particularly well
placed with its unique portfolio of services
and strong brand to take advantage of these
growth opportunities.  Annual Report & Accounts 2005 8 Harvey Nash Group plc
Financial Review
Albert Ellis   Group Finance Director
Strong cash flows funded expansion of the business
and enabled the Group to make a further reduction
in the long-term debt.
Profit and Loss Account
Turnover increased 25% to £163.4m for the
year ended 31 January 2005 (2004: £130.9m)
mainly as a result of improved trading and the
US acquisitions. Gross profit margin of 19.6%
was slightly below the previous year (2004:
20.4%) reflecting the increase in direct sales
commissions associated with the growth 
in turnover. Excluding this the gross margin
remained stable at 23.3% (2004: 23.3%). 
The proportion of turnover relating to the
Resourcing Division was 92% (2004: 90%)
compared to 8% (2004:10%) from Consulting.
The total fully inclusive cost base of the
Group for the year was marginally lower
than last year at £30.0m (2004: £30.4m)
reflecting the £3.3m reduction in
exceptional charges offset by increased
investment in headcount and office
infrastructure of £2.9m. 
Group operating profit for the year was
£2.1m (2004: loss of £3.7m) from which
interest payable of £0.9m (2004: £0.9m) was
deducted, resulting in a turnaround from a
loss before taxation of £4.5m for the year
ended 31 January 2004 to a profit before
taxation in the year under review of £1.2m.
Exceptional Items
In the year the Group incurred net
exceptional items of £0.2m (2004: £3.5m) 
as a result of the integration of the US
acquisitions, costs of due diligence
performed on an aborted potential
acquisition, offset by the release of a
provision for UK property costs (£0.4m) 
no longer required. There is no change 
to the total charge at the year end.
Taxation
A tax charge of £0.8m for the year has arisen
(2004: £0.3m). £0.4m relates to current year
taxes in the UK and Europe and £0.5m to
prior year taxes with an increase of £0.04m
in the deferred tax asset. The deferred tax
asset of £1.2m (2004: £1.2m) represents
unrelieved tax losses of £1.1m and short-
term timing differences of £0.1m. 
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share of 0.55p compares
to a loss per share in 2004 of 8.75p. The
adjusted earnings per share is 4.26p
compared to a loss in 2004 of 0.74p.
Balance Sheet
Intangible assets increased by an
additional £2.1m, mainly in relation to 
the acquisition of the business of Bluesuit
Consulting Inc in Chicago. During the year
goodwill of £2.2m was written off in the
profit and loss account and variances 
due to foreign exchange movements
amounted to a net £0.1m
At 31 January 2005, fixed assets were £1.4m
(2004: £1.4m) which reflected matching
capital expenditure and depreciation written
off in the year. 
Debtors have increased to £32.1m (2004:
£23.7m) mainly as a result of increased
trading particularly in the final quarter of the
year, however debtor days slipped by 13%
compared to 31 January 2004 mainly in the
UK where payments due from three large
clients were received after the year end.
Albert Ellis
Chief Financial Officer  Annual Report & Accounts 2005 9 Harvey Nash Group plc
Creditors falling due within one year have
also increased in line with trading, however,
a reduction in the banking revolving credit
facility of £3.0m is included for the first time
as a short term liability, transferred from
creditors falling due after more than one
year at 31 January 2004.
The provision for liabilities and charges of
£0.3m (2004: £1.6m) relates to an estimate
of the Group’s future property lease
obligations in Europe.
Cash Flow
Trading cash flow of £5.3m was generated
from operations before the effects of
movements in working capital. Cash outflow
from operating activities was £1.4m (2004:
£1.9m) after deducting £6.6m invested in
working capital.
Interest paid was £0.9m (2004: £0.9m) and
taxation paid of £1.4m (2004: £0.5m) mainly
relates to adjustments in the UK and payments
for prior period Swiss corporation tax
(including £0.5m withholding tax), of which
85% has been recovered after the year end. 
Capital expenditure of £0.8m compares to
£0.4m last year and represents investment 
in updating the Group’s IT systems and the
continued investment in its Contractor
Management System. 
The net cash effect of acquisitions and
disposals during the year was £nil (2004:
£1.5m outflow).
The Group had £0.1m cash inflow from
financing, being the exercise of share options
of £0.2m offset by £0.1m applied to finance
leases (2004: net cash outflow of £3.8m).
In summary, the Group’s net debt position
increased from £4.8m to £8.8m as a result
of the working capital investment of £6.6m,
reduced by free cash flow of £2.3m and
favourable foreign exchange differences 
of £0.3m.
Banking Facilities
The Group has renewed its banking facilities
totalling £22.0m which comprise working
capital of £15.0m, an overdraft of £4.2m 
and a residual £3.1m of revolving credit
which is repayable on 30 April 2006. 
Acquisitions
In November 2004 the Group issued
870,717 ordinary shares in connection with
the Group's deferred consideration for the
acquisition of Snowdogs LLC, the Group’s
Seattle based business. The earnout target
was exceeded and accordingly the second
tranche of deferred consideration was
settled. There was no cash element. The
final tranche is due after 31 January 2006.
On 17 December 2004 the Group entered
into an agreement to acquire the business
and certain assets of Bluesuit Consulting Inc,
an IT business based in Chicago for a
maximum consideration of $4.7m. The
initial consideration of $1.2m (£0.6m) was
settled by way of a fresh issue of 743,716
ordinary shares. The deferred consideration
will be satisfied by the issue of shares with
an aggregate value of up to a maximum of
$3.5m, based on the business achieving
certain targets over the three years ending
16 December 2007. 
International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS)
The 2005 financial year end will be the last
reporting period prior to the introduction of
IFRS. The Group will report its interim results
for the 2006 year end in accordance with
IFRS, together with the restatement of 2005
on a comparable basis. Annual Report & Accounts 2005 10 Harvey Nash Group plc

Corporate Governance

The Group fully supports the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice as set out in the FRC Combined Code issued in July 2003.
The Board has considered the implications of the new revised Combined Code on the Group’s governance and will comply with those
provisions considered appropriate for the size of the Group.
Application of Principles of Good Governance
Board of Directors
At 22 April 2005 the Board of Directors comprised two Executive and four Non-Executive Directors. The two Non-Executive founders, 
David Treacher and Thomas Crawford are considered independent. The Group has an independent Chairman and Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director who are both members of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. The Executive Board members are 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Nominations Committee.
The Board meets at least 10 times per annum and has a fixed schedule for reviewing the Group’s operating performance. In addition such
other meetings as are required are arranged to deal with specific issues or transactions. The Board also has a schedule of matters and
responsibilities specifically reserved to itself the main items of which include:

Non-Executives. 
The Executive Directors are responsible for the day to day operational and financial management of the Group within the framework set out
by the Board. Outside the formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board, the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors make themselves
available for consultation with the Executive team as often as necessary.
Procedural compliance is monitored by the Chairman and the the Chief Financial Officer (who is also the Company Secretary)  and  Directors’
appointment and removal is a matter for the Board as a whole. Independent professional advice and training is available to all the Directors.

Directors have met with the Company’s major shareholders and other potential investors on a regular basis and have reported to the Board
on those meetings.
On joining the Board, a new Director receives appropriate induction including meeting with other Directors and senior management, visiting
the Group’s key operations and meeting the Groups’ principal advisors.
The Board has a policy of reasonable funding for independent professional advice for all Directors in furtherance of their duties as Directors
of the Company.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year with the Group’s senior financial management and external auditors to review the interim
and annual financial statements, the accounting policies of the Group, its internal financial control procedures and compliance with
accounting standards. The members of the Committee are Ian Kirkpatrick (Chairman) and Gus Moore, both of whom are independent Non-
Executive Directors.
The Board considers that the membership of the Committee as a whole has sufficient recent and relevant financial experience to discharge
its function. The Committee has a formal agenda, timetable and terms of reference. Annual Report & Accounts 2005 15 Harvey Nash Group plc

Corporate Governance continued
for the year ended 31 January 2005
Accountability and Audit
The Board has made every effort to ensure that this report represents a balanced understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects.
The means by which the Board maintains a sound system of internal financial control is set out below.
Internal Control
The Directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal controls, for monitoring their
effectiveness to provide them with reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial information used within the business and for
publication, and that assets are safeguarded. There are inherent limitations in any system of internal control and accordingly even the most
effective system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, that it
has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and financial statements, that it is regularly
reviewed by the Board and accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The Board identifies and appraises risks, and maintains control and direction over appropriate strategic, financial, and organisational
structure matters with formally defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority. There are established procedures for planning and
capital expenditure, for information and reporting systems, and for monitoring the Group’s businesses and their performance. The Board has
delegated to executive management the implementation of the systems of internal financial control within an established framework that
applies throughout the Group and is responsible for reviewing the Group’s whistleblowing procedures..
The Directors believe the following to be the key procedures established to provide internal financial control:
• The operation of authorisation procedures.
• Clearly delegated responsibilities.
• Close involvement of senior management in day to day activities.
• Setting of detailed annual budgets with detailed reporting of variance analysis on a monthly basis.
• The operation of an Audit Committee, supported by an internal audit function.
The Directors have reviewed the systems of internal financial control in operation during the year.
Compliance with Code Provisions
The Company has complied throughout the year with Section 1 of the Code of Best Practice except as follows:
Code Provision A3.2
The Company has four Non-Executive Directors, two of whom, David Treacher and Tom Crawford, are considered non-independent due to
their respective significant shareholdings. 
The Board has appointed Gus Moore as the senior independent Non-Executive Director in addition to the Company’s existing independent
Non–Executive Chairman.
Code provision A6.1
The Company has not complied with provision A.6.1 as the Board did not put in place during the year under review a formal process to
consider its performance either as a Group or individually, nor have the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors met together to specifically
assess the performance of the Chairman. The Board intends to consider appropriate measures, which may include external support, to
ensure that an evaluation of its performance is put in place in the next financial year.   
Going Concern
After having made appropriate enquiries including a review of the 2005/06 Group budget, medium term plans and available banking facilities
compared to funding requirements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the financial statements.

22 April 2005 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 17 Harvey Nash Group plc
Remuneration Report 
for the year ended 31 January 2005
This Report, which has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the Combined Code
(‘the Regulations’), outlines the membership and workings of the Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) and provides an explanation
of the various elements of the Company’s remuneration policy together with details of Directors’ remuneration in respect of the year ended
31 January 2005. In accordance with the Regulations, a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to shareholders on the information contained in the descriptions ’Directors’ Remuneration’,
’Interest in Share Options’, ’Directors’ Pension Entitlement’ and the share option scheme sections in this Report (‘the auditable parts’) and to
state whether, in their opinion, these parts of the Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as
amended by the Regulations).
Remuneration Policy
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives by rewarding them with 
competitive salary and benefit packages. These packages are reviewed each year to ensure that they are fair and competitive and reflect
the responsibilities and experience of each Director. The Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that they are supportive of the 
Group’s business objectives and the creation of shareholder value and takes advice from external sources in order to determine and 
develop its policies. The Group expects to review this policy on an ongoing basis. A balanced view is taken of remuneration split 
between non-performance related and performance related elements.
The remuneration package of each Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the
individual and information from independent sources for similar jobs in comparable companies.
The Executive Director remuneration packages consist of:
• Basic salary.
• Performance-linked bonus.
• Share options.
• Company car allowance.
• Pension contribution.
• Private healthcare insurance.
The performance-linked bonus is payable depending on the level of Group profit for the year compared to budget. If the maximum bonus
became payable it would represent no more than 50% of the Executive’s basic salary. 
Fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board at the beginning of each financial year having given due
consideration to market practice.
Directors’ Service Contracts
In line with Group policy Directors’ contracts contain notice periods which do not exceed 12 months.
The details of the service contracts of those who served as Directors during the year are:

Death Benefit Schemes and the Harvey Nash Directors’ Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme. As at the date of this report and 31 January
2005, the interest was in a total of 1,488,025 ordinary shares.
David Higgins Incentive Trust
Following the placing and open offer in March 2002, 2,801,216 ordinary shares were placed in the David Higgins 2002 Discretionary Trust for
the purpose of establishing an additional means of incentivising certain key employees of the Group, using funds provided by David Higgins.
During the year 1 million shares were transferred from the Trust to Ian Basser (ex-Director) who exercised his option at a price of £1. Options
of the remaining 200,000 shares originally granted to Ian Basser lapsed. David Higgins remains a beneficiary of this trust and these shares are
included in his total interest above of 7,982,378.
In addition to the share options disclosed above, on 16 December 2002, the David Higgins Discretionary Trust granted options to Albert 
Ellis over 700,000 Harvey Nash shares. Under the Trust deed these options can be exercised immediately. This Trust is independent of the
Company Schemes and granting of options remains at the sole discretion of the Trustees, David Higgins and Albert Ellis and therefore the
Trust is outside the scope of the Remuneration and Audit Committees. These options can be exercised at any time prior to 16 December 2012
for an aggregate exercise price of £1. Any income tax or national insurance contributions arising on the exercise of these options will be
payable by the option holder. There are no performance criteria associated with the exercise of these options. Annual Report & Accounts 2005 20 Harvey Nash Group plc

Share Option Schemes
At 31 January 2005, the following options to subscribe for ordinary shares have been granted to certain employees (including Directors)
under the terms of the Share Option Schemes:
The Harvey Nash Group plc Share Options Scheme 1997 (auditable)
At 1 February 2004 the scheme held 51,470 ordinary shares. Options over these shares were excercised in the year.
The Harvey Nash Group plc Performance Related Share Schemes (auditable)
The Performance Related Schemes are administered by the Board under the supervision of the Remuneration Committee. The schemes are
open to all full time employees except those who have had a material interest in the Group within the previous 12 months. The options
granted under the Performance Related Scheme are subject to certain performance criteria, including earnings per share growth. The
schemes’ exercise price is determined by the Board but will not be less than the average share price for the five days immediately preceding
the grant of options. The Harvey Nash Group plc Performance Related Share Plan is an Inland Revenue Approved Scheme, however, the
Board is able to grant unapproved options under the Scheme. For schemes from July 2000 the Group has obtained agreement from the
employee that he or she will settle the employer’s national insurance charge in respect of any gain arising on eventual exercise. All options
are granted for nil consideration.

Directors’ Responsibilities in Relation
to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 January 2005
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements; and
•prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors consider that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance of the Group’s website, however, information published on the Internet is accessible
in many different countries where legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from that
applicable in the United Kingdom. The work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and accordingly the
auditors do not accept responsibility for changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on
the website. Annual Report & Accounts 2005 22 Harvey Nash Group plc
Independent Auditors’ Report to the 
Members of Harvey Nash Group plc
for the year ended 31 January 2005
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Harvey Nash Group plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, the Consolidated and Company 
Balance Sheets, the Cash Flow Statement, the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses and the related notes which have been
prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out in the statement of accounting policies. We have also
audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
(’the auditable part’).
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. The Directors are also responsible for preparing the
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information comprises only the Financial
Highlights, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Operational Review, the Finance Director’s Review, the Directors’ Report, the
unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Corporate Governance Statement.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s or Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. Annual Report & Accounts 2005 23 Harvey Nash Group plc
Independent Auditors’ Report to the 
Members of Harvey Nash Group plc continued
for the year ended 31 January 2005
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 January 2005 and of the 
profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended.
• The financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
• Those parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Annual Report & Accounts 2005 27 Harvey Nash Group plc Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 January 2005 
1 Basis of Preparation
These financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting
standards. The 31 January 2004 net assets of the Group have been reduced by £0.4m, following the reclassification of own shares held that
are now categorised within capital and reserves (previously included in fixed asset investments), in accordance with the adoption of UITF 38.
In addition in accordance with UITF 38, a £0.7m adjustment was made to the accumulated profit and loss reserves arising on previous
impairments of own shares held that had passed through the profit and loss account in prior periods.
2 Accounting Policies
(a) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary
undertakings made up to the year end using acquisition accounting. The results of subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated
profit and loss account from the date control passes. Intra Group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation. On the acquisition 
of a subsidiary all of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their
condition at that date. All changes to those assets and liabilities and the resulting gains and losses that arise after the Group has gained
control of the subsidiary are charged to the post acquisition profit and loss account.  Where deferred consideration on acquisitions is to be
satisfied by the issue of Harvey Nash Group Plc shares, the directors estimate the contingent liability and establish a shares to be issued reserve.
(b) Turnover
The Group derives its turnover in the Resourcing business on a time and materials basis. It is recognised as services are rendered as validated
by receipt of a client approved timesheet or equivalent. On fixed price development work revenue is recognised on the percentage
completion basis, using pre-specified milestones or a client sign off to trigger invoices or the estimate of profit.
Permanent placement fees in the consulting business are recognised as services are provided, and typically in three stages; placement,
shortlist and retainer fee. 
(c) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on a monthly basis to write off the cost of each asset over its estimated useful life according to the following rates:
Leasehold improvements Over the term of the lease 
Office equipment 20% straight line 
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 20% straight line
Computer equipment 33
1
/3% straight line
Motor vehicles 25% reducing balance
(d) Foreign Exchange
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in each company are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at 
the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
On consolidation, revenues, costs and cash flows of overseas undertakings are included in the Group profit and loss account at average rates
of exchange for the period. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling using rates of exchange ruling
at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of opening net assets and results for the period of foreign subsidiary undertakings are dealt with
through reserves net of differences on related foreign currency borrowings. Other gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions
are included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The principal exchange rates to Sterling affecting the Group were:

2 Accounting Policies continued
(e) Leasing and Hire Purchase
Assets acquired under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised as tangible assets and depreciated over the shorter of 
the lease term and their useful lives. Finance charges and interest are taken to the profit and loss account in constant proportion to the
remaining balance of capital repayments or net obligations outstanding. Profits made on sale and finance leaseback arrangements are
deferred and credited to the profit and loss account over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the asset.
Rentals payable under operating lease and contract hire agreements are taken to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the
lease term. Reverse premiums and lease incentive benefits are recognised as a reduction in rental expense. The benefit is allocated on a
straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the first rent review date at which it is expected that the prevailing market rental will
be payable.
(f) Pensions
Pension costs on defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
(g) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over a period up to 20 years.
Currently, goodwill arising on acquisitions is amortised over 20 years with the exception of the Procomp NV acquisition in July 2000, which 
is now incorporated within Harvey Nash IT Consulting NV, which is being amortised over five years. Directors estimate for each individual
acquisition the length of time over which the values of the underlying businesses acquired are expected to exceed the value of the
identifiable net assets.
Impairments of goodwill are recognised as the difference between the carrying value of the intangible asset and the higher of net realisable
value and value in use. Value in use is determined in accordance with FRS 11 by discounting future cash flows at a pre-tax government bond
rate, with post five year forecast growth capped at the relevant country’s long term average GDP real growth rate.
Goodwill previously eliminated against reserves has not been reinstated. The profit or loss on the disposal or termination of a business
includes any goodwill previously eliminated against reserves.
(h) Taxation
Current taxation is applied to taxable profits at the rates ruling in the relevant country. Deferred taxation is provided in full for material timing
differences except where recoverability of a deferred tax asset is considered to be unlikely in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax balances
are not discounted unless the effects are considered to be material to the Group’s results.
(i) Investments and Share Schemes
Own shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy potential obligations under share option schemes are carried at cost and following
the adoption of UITF38 are now categorised within capital and reserves. Any differences between the market value of shares at the date 
of award and the anticipated proceeds from options granted are written off to the profit and loss account over the period to which the
underlying options relate, in accordance with UITF17. In accordance with The Harvey Nash Group plc Performance Related Share Schemes,
market value is calculated as being the average share price for the five days immediately preceding the grant of options.
Other investments held as fixed assets are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
(j) Related Party Transactions
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under Financial Reporting Standard 8 not to disclose intra-group transactions.

Factors That May Affect Future Tax Charges
Based on current capital investment plans, the Group does not expect material timing differences to arise in respect of capital allowances and
depreciation.
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets where there are forecast taxable profits in the next 12 months from which the future reversal of
the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses amount to £1,230,000 (2004: £2,289,000). Future tax charges may be reduced as a
result of tax losses for which a deferred tax asset is currently not recognised.
8 Loss Attributed to the Parent Company
The loss for the year ended 31 January 2005 in the financial statements of Harvey Nash Group plc, the Company, was £297,000 (2004: 
profit £2,277,000). As allowed by S230 Companies Act 1985, no profit and loss account is presented in respect of the parent company.

25 Pensions
Harvey Nash has in place three pension schemes; the Harvey Nash plc Directors’ Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, a Group Personal
Pension Plan provided by National Provident Institution and Legal and General, and a stakeholder scheme with Legal and General which had
no participating members at the year end.
The Harvey Nash plc Directors’ Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme (the ’Scheme’) is a small self-administered scheme. It is an 
exempt-approved scheme under Chapter 1 of Part XIV of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. The assets of the Scheme 
are held separately from the Company by trustees. The current trustees are TFA Crawford, DC Higgins, DH Treacher and Scottish 
Equitable which is the pensioner trustee. The three individual trustees are the only members of the Scheme. The Company 
has the power to appoint individual trustees.
The retirement scheme is provided on a defined contribution basis. The contributions in the year were £23,100 (2004: £22,000).
The Group Personal Pension Plan (the ’Plan’) is a defined contribution scheme provided by National Provident Institution and Scottish
Widows . The Group’s normal policy is to invite employees to join the Plan automatically on completion of three years’ qualifying service,
although senior employees may be invited to join earlier at the discretion of the Directors. The Group contributes 5% and the employee
contributes 3% of the employee’s basic earnings (excluding bonuses) to the Plan. Group’s total contribution to the Plan for the period to 
31 January 2005 was £172,924 (2004: £191,774). Contributions in respect of Director Albert Ellis were £18,900 (2004: £18,000).

27 Financial Instruments
Treasury Management
Treasury policy and significant treasury transactions are approved by the Board.
Financing
The Group’s principal financial instruments are bank loans, bank overdrafts, cash and short-term deposits. The Group has other financial
instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. Acquisitions are financed through a mixture of
equity and medium-term borrowings. Working capital finance for day-to-day requirements is provided through operating cash generation,
invoice discount facilities, debt factoring facilities and small short-term overdraft facilities. All of the Group’s long-term borrowings are
made centrally. Where applicable, funds are then made available for the financing of the Group’s subsidiaries through intercompany loans.
Objectives, Policies and Strategies
The most significant treasury exposures faced by Harvey Nash are raising finance, managing interest rate and currency positions and
investing surplus cash in high quality assets. The Board has established clear parameters, including levels of authority, on the type and use 
of financial instruments to manage these exposures. Transactions are only undertaken if they relate to underlying exposures and cannot be
viewed as speculative.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Group’s policy is to minimise interest charges. Harvey Nash uses interest rate caps to manage its interest rate exposure on its 
debt position.
Currency Risk Management
The Group’s policy is to minimise foreign currency risk. Harvey Nash manages its exposure on equity investments in overseas subsidiaries
through foreign currency borrowings. The currency risk of holding assets and liabilities in foreign currencies across the Group is managed by
partially matching foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
As permitted by FRS 13 short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from disclosure of financial liabilities and financial assets.
Currency and interest rate composition of financial assets and liabilities.

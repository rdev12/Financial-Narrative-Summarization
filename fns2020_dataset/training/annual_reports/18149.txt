Business model
Five elements to our investment case
Strategic report
03 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015 The past year has been one of significant 
progress, even for a company with a 
heritage as long as ours.
Dear shareholder
The past year has been one of significant 
progress, even for a company with 
a heritage as long as ours.
In February 2015, we established 
Coats Group plc as a standalone, listed 
entity. All major investments apart from 
the Coats business have been sold, 
culminating in the Company changing 
name from Guinness Peat Group to Coats 
Group. We are now a UK-headquartered, 
global industrial manufacturing business 
with a new role and direction as a publicly 
traded company with FTSE 250 ambitions.
Board and governance
In March 2015, we established the Coats 
Group plc Board, with Directors chosen 
for their FTSE, geographic, industry and 
functional talents. David Gosnell and 
Alan Rosling both became Independent 
Non-Executive Directors – joining 
Mike Allen, Ruth Anderson and me – 
while Paul Forman, Group Chief Executive, 
Richard Howes, Chief Financial Officer, 
and Rajiv Sharma, Global CEO Industrial, 
became Executive Directors.
In April, Nicholas Bull was appointed 
as Senior Independent Director (SID). 
Nicholas – a chartered accountant with 
over 30 years of global banking experience 
– has also joined both our Audit and Risk, 
and Nomination Committees. Part of his 
role as SID is to act as a sounding board 
for me as the Chairman and to serve as 
an intermediary for the other stakeholders 
when necessary.
Drawing on the varied talents of our 
Non-Executive Directors is important 
to the success of the business and we 
will continue to monitor the Board’s 
composition, so that we maintain the 
best possible mix of skills and industry 
knowledge to support our strategy and 
ambitions. In line with best practice, 
Directors will stand for re-election on an 
annual basis. For more detail, see the 
corporate governance section of this report.
Delisting announcement
Our re-emergence as a UK-headquartered 
global industrial manufacturing business 
has resulted in a change in the regional 
diversity of our shareholder base. Over 70% 
of our shareholders are now UK-based 
(mainly institutional investors), with fewer 
than 12% in New Zealand and Australia. 
In light of this, in November we announced 
our intention to delist from the New 
Zealand and Australia stock exchanges.
We have no material operations or 
Executive Directors in New Zealand or 
Australia and, during the year, both Sir Ron 
Brierley and Blake Nixon ended their long 
associations with the company by stepping 
down from the Board. This delisting move 
– approved in principle by both the NZX 
and ASX authorities – will also eliminate 
the costs and complexities arising from 
a triple listing and share register structure.
A resolution will be put to shareholders 
for approval at the Annual General Meeting 
in May.
Performance in 2015
During the year we delivered a strong 
operating performance and improved 
quality of earnings. The core Apparel 
and Footwear business continued to 
gain market share and in Speciality we 
maintained growth through product 
innovation and geographic expansion, 
despite tough conditions in certain key 
markets.
In our Americas Crafts business we 
delivered an encouraging second half profit, 
while across the Group margins increased 
due to volume growth, lower input prices 
and procurement and productivity savings.
Overall these factors contributed to 
pre-exceptional operating profit increasing 
by 19% on a constant currency basis to 
$139 million. However, discontinued losses 
related to the sale of our loss-making 
EMEA Crafts business, negatively impacted 
reported earnings.
As a Group we enter 2016 on a solid 
footing with improving returns and quality 
of earnings and a stronger business 
portfolio. More details on performance 
during the year can be found in the Group 
Chief Executive’s statement on page 10 
and Operating review on page 15.
Pensions
Another matter of significance for the Group 
is pensions – namely the investigations by the 
UK Pensions Regulator (‘tPR’) that have been 
ongoing for the past two years.
We have recently initiated settlement 
discussions with all three sets of 
Trustees and have stated we would like to 
conclude the pension investigations with 
a solution that is in the interests of all 
parties. To that end we have committed 
not to return to shareholders any of the 
cash balance held by the parent group, 
currently $505 million (£342 million).
Whilst we are committed to finding a 
solution, it must be one that enables us 
to reward our investors with a dividend 
flow from our successful operational 
performance. If such a settlement cannot 
be reached in respect of all the schemes 
on this basis and the investigations proceed 
a hearing in front of the ‘Determinations 
Panel’ would be unlikely before the second 
half of 2016 at the earliest. For full detail of 
the pension schemes and tPR investigations 
see page 26.
Personal highlights of 2015
For me there were two particular 
aspects to our performance in the year 
that I would like to highlight. One is 
innovation – our approach to new 
product development – the other is 
the recognition of the quality of 
our people and products.
Mike Clasper
Chairman
Chairman’s statement
Strategic report
04 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015 Innovation During 2015 we launched 
more new products than ever, in part 
thanks to the agility of our Research 
and Development (R&D) model. This 
model’s foundations are our customer 
understanding and our manufacturing base 
and dedicated R&D managers who interact 
with our customer teams to look for 
innovation opportunities. They create 
teams from employees as and when 
needed – enabling us to use existing 
talent, machinery and operational 
time to test new ideas within the heart 
of the business – on the factory floor 
and with the customer. In 2015, this led 
to major breakthroughs such as Signal, 
our retro-reflective sewing and embroidery 
thread; and a new conductive thread 
developed for a major supplier to secure 
its wireless tracking tags to fabrics.
Recognition It was also another year 
in which both our people and products 
were publicly recognised. Our Red 
Heart brand was awarded the Women’s 
Choice Award in the United States; 
in Bangladesh, brand retailer Decathlon 
gave us a sustainable development 
award; our Footwear division received an 
adidas Quality award for Tier 2 suppliers; 
and, in Vietnam, our Managing Director 
Bill Watson received a Certificate of Merit 
from the office of the Prime Minister.
People
In a year of transition and change, our 
employees have remained committed 
and focused and I would like to thank 
them for their steadfast efforts as we 
settle into this new phase in our history.
Coats is proud of its strong global 
presence. We employ 19,000 people in 
over 60 countries worldwide and we 
recognise it is their talent and commitment 
that sets us apart as a business, ensuring 
that we remain leaders in our sector. We 
will therefore continue to focus on diversity 
and inclusion (cultural and gender) across 
the organisation to ensure that we make 
the most of that considerable talent.
One of the ways we benchmark 
our culture is through our employee 
engagement survey and, in 2015, our 
engagement score (which shows how 
proud people are to work at Coats and 
how willing they are to work toward 
achieving common goals) is up to 
83% (compared with 81% in 2014), 
strengthening our position in the top 
10% of companies globally.
Our Health and Safety figures also 
continued in the right direction. During 
2015, our recordable accident rate was 
0.29 work-related injuries and illnesses 
per 100 Full Time Employees – well below 
industry average figures reported by the 
US Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration.
Looking ahead
In the year ahead we will continue the 
process of ‘normalisation’ as a UK-listed, 
global manufacturing company, while 
increasing the pace of product and service 
development and acquisitions – exploring 
ways in which we can translate our successes 
into greater value for shareholders.

Market trends
Coats is a global leader in growing 
markets and well positioned to take 
advantage of global socio-economic 
trends and specific factors affecting 
the environment in which we operate.
Global socio-economic trend
The continued growth of the urban middle 
class in Asia is fundamentally changing 
our world (see map).
What it means for us:
• Increasing global demand for 
apparel and footwear;
• Increasing demand for consumer 
products with Speciality thread and yarn;
• Asia Pacific moving from production 
base to world’s largest consumer market;
• Asia Pacific will challenge developed 
economies in the production of 
high-end consumer goods.
Apparel and Footwear thread
Consumer demand for clothes and shoes 
tends to grow faster than overall economic 
growth. Historically, there is a strong 
link between clothing retail sales and 
GDP growth.
Thread is a critical component to the 
performance of a garment and, as the 
world’s leader in Apparel and Footwear 
(A&F) thread, we are a key supplier 
to the global $1.5 trillion apparel industry. 
Globally, the industry is expected to grow 
by 2% per year over the medium term, 
but this will be double in Asia as – not 
only will more consumers demand more 
garments – but more affluent consumers 
will demand higher-end garments. The 
global footwear industry is c$350 billion in 
size and has similar growth prospects.
Garment production has been highly 
mobile; with the flight from West to East at 
the end of the 20th century and more 
recently between developing economies. 
The supply chain to the industry has had 
to follow and is highly fragmented.
Within these demand and supply dynamics, 
Coats has not only remained the global 
market leader (we are almost double the 
size of our nearest competitor) but has 
also gained market share.
The garment industry is currently facing 
a number of pressures, to which brands, 
garment manufacturers and component 
suppliers are having to respond:
• Speed (to market, in sampling, in sourcing);
• Productivity (low-cost locations 
scarcer due to inflationary pressures);
• Innovation (product, process 
and consumer experience);
• Quality (as a differentiator);
• Compliance (environmental, 
labour, sourcing)
Coats is leading the industry in meeting 
these needs. We are positioning ourselves 
as the leading value added partner to the 
global apparel and footwear industries.
Speciality threads and yarns
Coats defines Speciality as thread and 
yarn not used in apparel and footwear. 
This ranges from thread used in traditional 
markets such bedding and air bags, 
emerging applications such as tea bags, 
and fibre optics cables and value added 
engineered yarns used in composites 
and conductive products.
Demand for Speciality thread is increasing 
due to growing consumer and government 
demand, and tends to grow in excess 
of economic growth. The main drivers 
currently are:
• Pace of urbanisation in developing 
countries (for example, the rollout 
of fibre optic cables);
• Economic growth, which means 
consumers purchase more products with 
Speciality thread (for example, leisure 
goods, cars with airbags, tea bags);
• Consumers demanding more innovative 
products which can use smart thread 
to enhance their functionality 
(for example, wearable technology);
• Increasing public sector spending and 
safety compliance in developing countries 
(for example, utility infrastructure, flame 
retardant protective clothing for military 
and industrial uses).
Coats estimates the addressable market (in 
to which we currently or could realistically 
serve in the near term) is currently $1.8 
billion in size and likely to grow over time. 
Speciality customers are demanding 
manufacturing localisation and global 
supply solutions, with ways to apply 
threads and yarns both in enhancing 
existing products and in creating new 
ones.
Coats is the leader in its addressable 
market and is gaining market share by 
leveraging its core global capabilities:
• We have leading innovative brands;
• Our size means we can out-invest 
in new technologies;
• Our global customer relationships;
• We can leverage our global, world class 
A&F asset base to develop centres of 
excellence beyond the US and Europe;
• As the market leader we are in a 
position to use bolt-on acquisitions 
to access new geographies and 
adjacent end-markets.
Crafts
Coats is the market leader in the ~$1.8 
billion Americas textile crafting industry. 
Growth in Crafts is driven by inspiring our 
customers and consumers to spend more 
time crafting.
In the North American market we are 
leaders in handknittings, which can be 
split into ‘foundation’ and ‘fashion’ yarns. 
Foundation yarns tend to be longstanding, 
value products characterised by steady 
growth, and our market-leading brand Red 
Heart has made share gains over the last 
few years. Demand for fashion yarns tends 
to more transitory and unpredictable and 
follows consumer trends which are 
driven by a variety of on and offline media 
sources.
In Latin America Coats has a market 
leading presence in both needlecrafts and 
handknittings. Here the dynamics of the 
region are different with the needlecrafts 
market the largest.

Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to report that in 2015 – our 
first year of reporting as Coats Group plc 
– we delivered a strong performance.
2015 performance
1
Coats’ revenues increased 3% to $1,490 
million in 2015 from $1,445 million. 
Industrial sales growth of 5% was driven 
by a strong performance in the Apparel and 
Footwear business, almost wholly driven 
by volumes given a challenging pricing 
environment, and product innovation and 
geographic expansion in the Speciality 
business despite tough conditions in the 
global oil and gas sector. Crafts sales fell 
6% to $277 million (2014: $295 million), 
reflecting tough comparators in the first 
half (impact of the decline in fashion 
handknittings demand) and the mild 
North American autumn/winter in 2015 
which impacted consumer demand. 
Pre-exceptional operating profit increased 
19% year-on-year to $139.4 million (2014: 
$117.0 million). Industrial profit grew 20% 
and margins were up 130 basis points 
(bps) to 11.1% due to strong volume 
growth, lower input prices, productivity 
and non-raw material procurement 
improvements (which more than offset 
labour and energy inflation). The 14% 
increase in Crafts profit was primarily due 
to lower input prices and cost reduction 
initiatives. Margins also benefited from 
lower Group costs year-on-year and initial 
cost savings from an overhead reduction 
programme that resulted from a review of 
our cost base following the disposal of the 
EMEA Crafts business. Operating profit, 
post-exceptional items, on a reported 
(actual currency) basis increased 7% to 
$111 million (2014: $103.4 million). 
Currency movements continued to 
impact results on both a translational 
and transactional basis throughout 2015. 
As we report in US Dollars and given that 
our global footprint generates significant 
revenues and expenses in a number of 
other currencies, a translational currency 
impact can arise. In 2015 a decline in 
Group sales of 5% on a reported (actual 
currency) basis reflected the strengthening 
of the US Dollar against a number of 
currencies, particularly the Euro and 
Brazilian Real. 
Financial summary
Adjusted earnings per share attributable to 
equity shareholders on a like-for-like basis 
increased by 38% to 3.96 cents (2014: 
2.88 cents). This was achieved by higher 
operating profit and a reduction in the 
underlying tax rate. We generated a 
reported attributable loss of $50.6 million 
(2014: $15.0 million profit), due to a 
significant loss ($75.5 million) from 
discontinued items related to the disposal of 
the loss-making EMEA Crafts business, as 
well as a higher level of exceptional charges. 
The disposal of EMEA Crafts, which 
generated a trading loss of $12.7 million 
in 2015, has improved the Group’s quality 
of earnings and returns and allowed 
management to better focus on the high 
performing global Industrial and strong 
Americas Crafts businesses. 
In 2015, Coats generated an adjusted free 
cash inflow of $73.9 million compared to 
$87.8 million in 2014. Higher operating 
profits, lower interest and tax paid were 
more than offset by the implementation of 
a revised supplier payment approach that 
negatively impacted working capital (see 
financial review section for more details). 
Total net cash at 31 December 2015 was 
$241 million, a year-on-year decline of 
$80 million, primarily due to foreign 
exchange losses on the parent group balance 
and the cash outflow related to EMEA Crafts 
and its disposal (although the cash cost was 
significantly lower than the impact on the 
income statement). 
Return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) 
increased to 33% from 24% in 2014, driven 
by higher profitability and the disposal of 
EMEA Crafts, underpinning the rationale for 
disposing the loss-making business (2014: 
27% excluding EMEA Crafts). Over the last 
three years, ROCE increased 13 percentage 
points from 20% in 2013.

Strategic highlights
Acquisition of GSD
I am delighted to be able to report that, 
in a year of change and consolidation, 
we also achieved our first acquisition in 
over ten years. In May we acquired 100% 
of GSD Corporate Limited, a UK-based 
consultancy that supplies the garment 
industry with methods of analysis and 
productivity improvement solutions. GSD, 
which has customers in over 60 countries 
and a strong Asian presence, is now part 
of Coats Global Services. This acquisition 
is a strong fit with our existing business 
and an example of the type of M&A 
transaction which we see as delivering 
future growth for the business.
Crafts: Refocus
During the year we disposed of the 
non-UK part of EMEA Crafts to Aurelius, a 
German private equity firm. This followed 
a comprehensive review of the business 
and its strategic fit within Coats, and it is 
a decision that will better position Coats 
for future profitable growth. It will also 
enable management to focus its attention 
on our high-performing global Industrial 
and strong Americas and UK Crafts 
businesses where we have seen good 
margin improvement overall.
Five elements to our value
I believe that our success as a company 
is underpinned by five core elements. 
These work together to sustain and build 
Coats’ market leadership and to deliver 
cash generative, consistent growth. Each 
element is a strength in itself but, together, 
they combine to set us apart from our 
competitors, giving us a solid platform 
from which to innovate and grow. 
I would like to take this opportunity 
to talk about them in more detail and 
provide pertinent examples.

Global market leader with robust 
fundamentals and capabilities
Our global footprint – some 50 manufacturing 
sites across the world and a sales presence in 
over 100 countries – means we maintain 
market positions that are several times larger 
than our competition. It also enables us to 
satisfy customer demand wherever it occurs 
globally and to pursue global growth 
in Speciality. This is a key differentiator and one 
that provides a sound basis for our growth.
In addition, we have our strong corporate 
brand reputation, which is based on a deep 
heritage stretching back over 200 years, 
and market leading brands that stand 
for excellence in the market place. These 
provide the basis for strong relationships 
with the widest range of brands and 
manufacturers in the world from which 
we constantly gather in depth market 
insight. This unique combination 
of relationships, resources and reach, 
when coupled with our agile global 
R&D network, provide us with an unrivalled 
leadership position in the market.
We maintain that position with a 
comprehensive range of products and 
services, sustained by a culture of continual 
product and service innovation. This enables 
us to lead the industry in anticipating 
and meeting the changing needs of our 
customers and consumers. Over the past 
five years we have launched over 200 new 
products. In 2015 these included:
• Signal thread Our new premium 
reflective thread which couples an 
extraordinarily high level of retro-
reflectance with good sewability 
(intended for mainly decorative use, 
though it also helps enhance visibility 
at night time and in difficult 
weather conditions);
• Secura thread A heat-activated fusible 
thread that we developed in response 
to feedback from our customers to 
help secure buttons and decorative 
applications such as sequins and beads;
• Conductive thread Developed by us 
for a major supplier to secure its wireless 
tracking tags to fabrics (the thread 
acts as an antenna, introducing the 
possibility of incorporating intelligence 
into sewing processes; thus opening 
up a whole range of new product 
markets);
• Opti LUX Trio zips These have been 
specifically created for high-end 
goods, with a longer, more complex 
manufacturing process, which results 
in features such as individually polished 
teeth, smooth slider running and a 
wide range of finishes.
We are also innovators in the field of digital, 
creating products to meet and pre-empt 
a diverse range of industry needs.
• eCommerce A real-time online system 
designed to make thread ordering as 
quick and easy as possible for customers, 
allowing them to check things such 
as thread orders, stock availability and 
payment status from a mobile device.
• Coats Colour Express A web-based 
application, using Coats Colour Capsure 
(our electronic shade card), backed up by 
Coats colour experts, which allows 
customers to accurately match, sample 
and order thread quickly and easily.
• Coats Match A highly portable and  
user-friendly colour-reading device that 
connects via Bluetooth to two mobile 
Apps, Coats Colour Select and Coats 
Colour Compare, allowing customers 
to share measured colour standards; 
set tolerances within which a colour is 
acceptable; and compare physical fabric 
with their chosen colour for accuracy. 
This reduces lead times and the high 
costs associated with traditional colour 
design and approval processes.
• Redheart.com A website for Red Heart 
customers worldwide, with an ordering 
system that allows users to shop for Red 
Heart products with a one-click function 
that gathers all the required supplies, 
and incorporating tutorial, blog and 
community sections.

Defined growth strategy
Our defined growth strategy is well 
established and targets known markets 
through organic and acquisitive growth. 
We have Market Goals in place to guide 
us right through to 2018.
Apparel and Footwear (A&F) We aim 
to be the leading value added partner 
to the apparel, footwear and accessories 
industries and will achieve this with share 
gains garnered from innovation in products 
and services – for instance, anticipating 
trends in the increasing demand for A&F 
driven by a growing middle class in Asia 
Pacific. We will continue to make strategic 
choices in areas such as digital, innovation 
First metallized thread antenna
In 2015 we launched a metallized thread 
antenna specifically for use with a revolutionary 
radio frequency identification (RFID) tag for 
tracking applications in the industrial laundry, 
leather, textile and uniform sectors.
Coats Match digital colour reader
Coats Match is a highly portable, digital colour 
reading device that can significantly reduce 
time and costs for customers at design 
and approval stages.
Strategic report
12 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015 and partnership, utilising the excellence 
of our marketing, sales, enhanced products 
and transformative services. This, combined 
with the skills of our workforce; the agility 
and responsiveness of our systems; our 
operational excellence; and compliance, 
gives us the leading edge we need 
to compete as an industry leader.
Speciality To remain the leading global 
player in Speciality threads and yarns we 
must increase our global reach – accessing 
new geographies and end-markets and 
seizing appropriate merger and acquisition 
opportunities as they arise – while continuing 
to bring innovative products to market. 
This means a move away from our 
traditional segments into value added 
engineered yarns, which we are achieving 
through product innovation, performance 
materials and best in class service.
Crafts To be the leading global player in 
textile crafts means focusing on our strong 
and profitable Americas and UK businesses. 
There is much opportunity within the 
~$1.8 billion Americas textile crafting 
industry, and a smaller – but expanding 
– presence in Latin America. In North 
America our strategy is two pronged – 
firstly, deliver digital inspiration by 
establishing direct relationships with 
consumers, via our redheart.com and 
makeitcoats.com web sites; secondly, 
deliver best in class category management 
and customer service to major retailers 
such as Walmart.
4
Experienced management team 
and people
At Coats we are led by an experienced 
Board and management team who 
are supported by a highly motivated 
workforce. We have made great strides 
during 2015 to ensure that the composition 
of our Board of Directors possess the 
right breadth of geographic, industry and 
functional experience to ensure our success 
as a global manufacturing business. 
Alongside this we have continued to uphold 
and embed the values and behaviours that 
ensure we have an engaged workforce 
and a healthy working environment. 
Our commitment to both is reflected in 
us formally adopting these measures 
as non-financial key performance 
indicators for the Group. For more on this, 
see page 27.
Commitment to Health and Safety 
A safe and healthy working environment 
is our number one priority – and everyone 
has a part to play in contributing to 
our safety culture. 2015 was a year of 
continued improvement and significant 
highlights – for example, in Pakistan we 
achieved 4 million accident-free hours. 
There is, of course, always more work to 
be done and we are targeting a reduction 
from our already low base while at the 
same time extending our reporting 
to cover any commuting accidents our 
employees may experience getting 
to and from work.
Employee engagement In 2015, 98% 
of our employees took part in our employee 
engagement survey and we were pleased 
to see that our employee engagement 
score has risen by two percentage points 
to 83%, keeping us in the top 10% of 
all global surveyed companies.
People We currently have over 70 
nationalities among our employees, and 
more than 20 (out of ~100 people) in our 
global leadership team, and we recognise 
that we must retain the best talent from 
the widest possible pool to ensure the 
ongoing success and relevance of the 
business. In 2015, we launched a diversity 
and inclusion (D&I) programme, which will 
address the number of women in 
leadership positions, and our ongoing 
Management Capability Development 
Programme has now been completed 
by more than 400 people from over 
40 countries. For more details, go to 
the People section on page 20.

Cash generative, consistent growth
The four elements outlined above allow us 
to generate improving financial returns and 
quality of earnings. A continued focus on 
sales and earnings growth and free cash 
flow generation gives us a strong base for 
the future, and we continue to focus on 
working capital management and capital 
discipline, with internal initiatives such as 
a recent review of all fixed costs, as well 
as our annual operational productivity and 
purchasing programmes (saving approx. 
$15 million per annum) and the 
implementation of new operational 
structures.
Operating responsibly
We pride ourselves on being a responsible 
company and recognise the increasing 
importance of compliance in all the markets 
in which we operate. Two elements that 
are essential for us as a Group maintaining 
our reputation within the industry are our 
approach to Corporate Responsibility 
(CR) and managing risk.
Corporate Responsibility Our CR 
programme is integrated with our business 
strategy and helps us build and maintain 
both our reputation and our relationships 
with key stakeholders. It is structured 
around our seven strategic themes which 
we review on a bi-annual basis to ensure 
they remain appropriate and relevant. 
This year we held workshops with over 
70 key suppliers in China to ensure that 
they are meeting the standards set out in 
our supplier code of practice, maintaining 
those high environmental and social 
standards that we demand from all our 
industry partners. For more detail see 
Corporate Responsibility on page 22.
Managing risk We take a robust approach 
to risk management, which underpins our 
operations and ensures that we have the 
necessary systems in place to identify risk 
appropriate for a global manufacturer. 
During the year we put in place a three-
level risk programme, and sought advice 
from global risk consultants on how best to 
protect ourselves as we conduct business in 
new and existing markets. We have 
continued to invest in facilities through our 
capex programme and also established 
a dedicated risk function at a Group level. 
For more detail see Principal risks and 
uncertainties on page 28.
Our outlook
We delivered a strong performance in 2015 
supported by market share gains, product 
innovation, lower input prices and 
productivity and procurement gains. These 
factors have put the business on a solid 
footing for the year ahead.
Additionally, we will realise incremental 
savings from our overhead reduction 
programme, which aims to reduce costs 
following the disposal of EMEA Crafts. 
However, as we continue to grow there is 
a need to reinvest into the business to 
support our growth ambitions. 
Furthermore, against a backdrop of mixed 
economic conditions with uncertainties 
on consumer demand in the US and 
Western Europe, demand from the oil 
and gas industry and the potential for 
the US Dollar to further strengthen, 
Group performance could be adversely 
impacted. On balance, we expect to 
deliver modest year-on-year growth in 
Group pre-exceptional operating profit with 
improvements to non-operating items 
further benefiting adjusted EPS.

like currency basis (restates 2014 figures at 
2015 exchange rates) and all references 
to segment profit are to pre-exceptional 
segment profit.
Despite a challenging pricing environment, 
Industrial revenue rose 5% year-on-year 
from $1,150 million in 2014 to $1,213 
million in 2015 due to good levels of 
volume growth. This was driven by 
underlying market growth and market 
share gains, the latter based on product 
and digital service innovation and excellent 
service levels.
Revenue in Apparel and Footwear 
(which includes accessories, zips and trims and 
global services) grew 5% year-on-year, almost 
wholly due to volume growth. This included 
double-digit sales growth in key markets 
such as Bangladesh, Colombia, Mexico and 
Vietnam. Coats increased its market share, 
with the increasing adoption of Coats’ digital 
services being a key driver. For instance, in Q1 
2015 the Company rolled out an eCommerce 
platform: within one year it is already live in 
25 countries; is used by approximately 7 ,500 
customers; and accounts for over 50% of 
total thread orders. In a general deflationary 
environment, pricing was relatively flat in 
2015, although there were regional variations.
Our core Apparel 
and Footwear 
business continued 
to gain market share, 
and in Speciality 
we continue to 
grow through 
product innovation 
and geographic 
expansion.

Speciality revenue grew 8% year-on-year, 
in line with recent guidance, through 
geographic expansion of existing products, 
such as furniture and upholstery in Asia, 
and new product innovation, notably a 
strong uptake in demand within the 
engineered performance fabrics and 
wire and cable markets. As previously 
announced, overall growth slowed 
between July and October due to the 
slowdown in the global oil and gas sector 
and tough year-on-year comparators. 
The oil and gas sector represented 15-20% 
of Specialty sales in 2015 through the 
supply of components for thermoplastic 
pipes and protective wear. Speciality 
growth improved in the last two months 
of 2015, demonstrating the diversification 
of the end markets in which the business 
operates. Given its relative importance, a 
continued slowdown in the oil and gas 
sector may marginally impact growth 
in 2016.
Revenue in Asia increased by 7% year-on-
year, with good levels of growth across 
most countries driven by both domestic 
and export demand in Apparel and 
Footwear, as well as Speciality growth. 
The Americas delivered a 5% increase, 
primarily due to Speciality sales growth 
in North America, while Latin America 
delivered good Apparel and Footwear 
growth. However, weak market conditions 
adversely impacted performance in the 
loss-making Brazilian business and these 
are expected to continue in 2016. Sales 
were marginally lower in EMEA for the full 
year, primarily due to weak zip demand in 
H1 2015, especially in Italy. However, sales 
improved in the second half supported by 
growth in key Apparel and Footwear 
markets and Speciality, and a better 
performance in zips.
Industrial operating profit increased 20% 
to $135.2 million (2014: $112.2 million) and 
margins increased 130bps to 11.1% (2014: 
9.8%) reflecting good volume growth. In 
addition, there were cost benefits in a 
general deflationary environment, however 
this did lead to a challenging pricing 
environment, and the business also 
continued to deliver productivity and 
non-raw material procurement 
improvements.
Acquisition of GSD
As previously reported, in May 2015 
Coats acquired GSD Corporate Ltd 
(‘GSD’), a UK based company, for a total 
consideration of $5.5 million. GSD supplies 
expert management solutions that analyse

following the strong demand for fashion 
handknitting products in H1 2014. This 
more than offset sales growth in 
foundation handknitting products, in 
both North America and Latin America. 
The mild autumn/winter in North America 
in 2015 negatively impacted sales in the 
final quarter and signs of continued 
softness in the handknittings market have 
persisted in early 2016. Needlecrafts sales 
declined 3%, reflecting the continued 
decline in the Americas needlecrafts 
market, however this was partly offset by 
strong sales in the smaller but growing 
lifestyle fabrics business.
Crafts made a profit for the period of 
$14.4 million (2014: $12.6 million). The 
14% increase was mainly due to lower 
input prices and a focus on reducing 
operating costs, which more than offset the 
decline in sales. This resulted in 90bps 
improvement in segment margin to 5.2% in 
2015 (2014: 4.3%). The increase in 
profitability from H1 2015 ($2.8 million) to 
H2 2015 ($11.6 million) was driven by 
increased sales, operational gearing, a 
greater benefit from lower input prices and 
cost reduction initiatives.
Disposal of EMEA Crafts
As previously reported, Coats completed 
the disposal of its loss-making EMEA Crafts 
business in July 2015. The sale has improved 
the Group’s quality of earnings and returns 
and allowed management to better focus 
on the high performing global Industrial 
and strong Americas Crafts businesses. The 
business generated a loss of $12.7 million 
in 2015, which is recognised within 
discontinued items. See page 25, Financial 
review for further information.

We value our workforce highly and employ 
nearly 19,000 people in over 60 countries. 
Our employees are the core of our 
business. Their leadership, talent and 
commitment ensure we remain leaders 
in our sector, are competitive in the 
marketplace and operate our businesses 
effectively and efficiently. In return, 
we offer a safe, respectful and inclusive 
environment in which our employees 
can thrive.
We are especially committed to 
maintaining high standards of employee 
safety and engaging with our workforce 
on issues that matter to them. Reflecting 
our commitment to reporting performance 
in these areas, we have formally adopted 
our annual recordable accident rate and 
employee engagement score as two 
non-financial key performance indicators 
for the Group. More details can be found 
on page 27.
Maintaining a safe environment
Providing a safe and healthy working 
environment is our number one priority. 
We ask everyone to contribute to our 
safety culture by taking care of themselves 
and looking out for those around them. 
They do this by reporting problems, 
hazards or unsafe conditions immediately 
so that they can be resolved, preventing 
the risk of injury.
Our 2015 recordable accident rate was 0.29 
work related injuries and illnesses per 100 
Full Time Employees (FTEs) compared to 
0.33 in 2014 and 0.37 in 2013. See chart 
right. This is well below the average of 3.2 
for US textile mills
2
 and has been dropping 
steadily since 2011. We are also pleased 
that our recordable accident rates are 
70% lower than the UK average data for 
the manufacture of textiles, as reported 
by the Health and Safety Executive 
for 2014/15.
Employee engagement survey
To achieve our business goals, we rely 
on our employees being engaged and 
driving our business forward. For the past 
five years we have conducted employee 
engagement surveys, to make sure we 
are on the right track. These surveys 
benchmark our workplace culture, 
assess how people feel about working 
at Coats and help us identify areas that 
need attention.
With a high participation rate of 98% 
in the 2015 survey, we were pleased 
to see that our employee engagement 
score has increased to 83% (two 
percentage points higher than last year and 
three percentage points higher than 2013). 
This positions Coats in the top 10% 
of all global surveyed companies

A diverse workforce:
Strategic report
20 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015 Case study:
Making Coats an employer 
of choice in a highly 
mobile market
Maintaining a skilled and motivated 
workforce is a key driver for our business. 
During 2015 we began working on a 
new global employee value proposition 
and carried out a survey across our 
businesses and functions involving over 
2,000 people. The results of the survey 
helped us understand what makes 
Coats an employer of choice in the 
markets where we operate.
We tested our thinking with a pilot 
project in China where we ran focus 
groups with our employees to try to 
understand what motivates them to 
work for Coats and what they value in 
their daily working lives. Some of the 
themes raised included respect, work-life 
balance, health benefits, development 
opportunities and compensation. We are 
now working with the local management 
team to ensure Coats remains an 
attractive employer in the highly mobile 
Chinese employment market.
Our new global D&I network holds regular 
virtual meetings, featuring guest speakers, 
which are open to everyone across the 
business – at least 150 of our employees 
regularly join the calls – and we have a 
dedicated intranet microsite which holds 
key diversity resources and materials, 
accessible by some 7,500 employees. In 
addition, the proportion of women 
enrolled on our management development 
programmes is increasing and we have 
invested in unconscious bias training 
which is being rolled out across our 
senior teams and the business more 
widely. We will report on our progress 
next year as these initiatives develop.
Human rights and 
employment standards
Our worldwide employment standards 
set out the principles which are observed 
across our global operations
4
. These 
standards state our approach to human 
rights and recognise the requirements 
of the UN Declaration of Human Rights 
and the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, the core ILO Conventions, 
and the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises.
Global diversity and inclusion
We need to attract and retain the best 
talent from the widest pool to ensure 
the ongoing success and relevance of 
our business. Our aim is to be a 
meritocracy where everyone has an equal 
opportunity to succeed. A truly diverse 
workforce has many benefits – it brings 
different perspectives, ideas, skills and 
experience to an organisation and has 
a proven positive impact on employee 
engagement and business performance. 
We want our employees to feel valued, 
respected and supported, and for 
the right conditions to be in place for 
everyone to reach their potential.
We are aiming to increase the diversity 
of our workforce through a range of 
activities. In January 2015 we launched 
a global diversity and inclusion (D&I) 
initiative, initially focused on increasing 
the number of women in senior positions 
across the company. We carried out a spot 
survey of 500 employees exploring the 
subject of gender diversity; we are tracking 
responses by gender to equal opportunity 
questions in our annual engagement 
survey; and we have reviewed our 
approach to recruitment and development. 
Coats Turkey is one of the many operations 
that has recently launched a local diversity 
and inclusion programme.
Strategic report
21 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015 Our global scale enables us to build close 
relationships with our customers wherever 
they are located, leverage our expertise 
from around the world and develop local 
market opportunities. But the diversity 
and complexity of our operations bring 
many social and environmental challenges. 
Some of these are unique to a particular 
country or location; others apply globally. 
It is important that we understand these 
and our impact on society, so we can 
manage our business responsibly wherever 
we operate.
Assessing what’s important
The values and standards that we 
subscribe to as a company are at the core 
of our CR programme. They are embodied 
in the five principles that describe the way 
we work: openness and honesty, energy 
for change, freedom to operate, customer 
led innovation and keeping our promises.
To supplement these, we have developed a 
robust approach to materiality assessment. 
This assessment helps us to identify and 
prioritise what are the important CR issues 
for the business and provides a focus for 
the future CR programme. We review our 
materiality analysis on a regular basis, 
as a minimum every two years.
Identifying and prioritising the issues
We began our analysis by identifying a long 
list of CR issues of potential relevance 
to Coats. The topics were gathered using 
a range of benchmarks including the Dow 
Jones Sustainability Indices and the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework. This 
was supplemented by the interests of our 
peers and key stakeholders, especially our 
employees, the brands and our customers. 
Fifty-three issues were highlighted during 
the 2015 review and grouped according to 
our seven strategic themes shown opposite.
An assessment framework measured 
the relative importance of the 53 issues 
and helped focus our thinking. 
In considering each area we asked 
ourselves two questions:
• Does addressing the issue help us 
meet our company goals?
• Is the issue of importance to our 
key stakeholders, and hence to Coats?
For more information on 
our approach to CR and our  
seven strategic themes, go to  
our website. www.coats.com/
corporateresponsibility
Ranking each of the issues against these 
questions enabled us to identify the list 
of priorities for our CR programme. Our 
top 10 material CR issues are illustrated in 
the chart below, but our CR programme 
extends beyond this into all areas that 
support and contribute to the achievement 
of our business goals.
We behave responsibly wherever we operate. 
Our Corporate Responsibility (CR) programme 
is integrated with our business strategy and 
helps us build and maintain both our reputation 
and our relationships with key stakeholders.
Identifying our key priorities
The chart to the right illustrates the 
top 10 material CR issues that we have 
identified for our CR programme. This 
is the minimum that we aim to address. 
Having said that, our CR programme 
extends beyond this and relates both 
to our own operations and the wider 
impact we have on the environment, 
the communities in which we operate, 
and the markets we serve.
For each of our CR issues we have 
established relevant policies and 
programmes, and have identified 
actions to manage our impacts. Our 
activities are co-ordinated by the Head 
of CR and monitored by a CR Advisory 
Group which is chaired by the Chief 
Human Resources Officer.

Strategic report
23 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015 Overhead reduction programme
As previously reported, with the sale of 
EMEA Crafts Coats commenced a review 
of elements of its cost base, including costs 
previously allocated to that business, to 
establish the appropriate cost structure for 
a smaller and less complex Group. During 
the first half of 2015, the review identified 
savings within specific support services, 
resulting in $2.6 million of restructuring 
costs. With the sale of the business 
completed in July, the review identified 
further areas of savings during the second 
half. As a result, additional restructuring 
costs were incurred in H2 2015, leading to 
$14.1 million of restructuring costs for the 
full year. The programme has delivered 
initial savings of approximately $4 million 
in 2015, supporting the improvements in 
Industrial and Crafts margins. Savings will 
continue to be realised in 2016 and H1 
2017; although, as the Company continues 
to grow, some of these savings will be 
reinvested to support growth plans in 2016.
Exceptional items
Net exceptional costs before taxation and 
discontinued items totalled $29.9 million in 
2015 (2014: $20.0 million). This included 
$13.2 million for US environmental costs, 
which included a provision for remedial 
work on the Lower Passaic River, New 
Jersey, USA (see page 26 for further details). 
There was also a charge of $3.3 million 
related to the consolidation of Coats’ 
Mexican operations from three sites to two, 
which will increase utilisation and efficiency 
while reducing operational costs. In 
December, the property was sold resulting 
in a gain on disposal of $9.2 million, thereby 
generating an overall positive contribution 
of $5.9 million. Coats has provided for an 
additional $5.7 million in 2015 in relation 
to the expected costs of the ongoing 
tPR investigations. As mentioned above, 
$14.1 million of costs were incurred in 
relation to the overhead reduction 
programme; no further charges are 
expected in 2016. A $1.5 million loss on 
disposal was recognised on the sale of 
Coats’ share in a Philippines joint venture 
in November 2015.
Non-operating results
Finance costs, net of investment income, 
were $31.2 million in 2015, up from 
$8.0 million in 2014. The increase was 
mainly driven by full year foreign exchange 
losses of $3.2 million (2014: $18.9 million 
gain) on the parent group cash balance in 
relation to movements between the 
British Pound, New Zealand Dollar and 
Australian Dollar. Following a gain of 
$9.1 million in H2 2015, the Company 
moved substantially all of the cash to 
Pound Sterling. IAS19 pensions interest 
charges increased from $11.3 million to 
$17.1 million as a function of the higher 
pensions accounting deficit at the end of 
2014. Based on the deficit at the end of 
December 2015, the Company estimates 
the charge in 2016 will be approximately 
$15 million (subject to any pensions 
investigations settlement and additional 
support to the schemes). In addition there 
was a decrease in investment income from 
$11.5 million in 2014 to $10.5 million in 
2015, despite compensation ($3.2 million) 
received in respect of a compulsory state 
financing arrangement in Latin America in 
the 1980s and 1990s, and a reduction in 
interest on borrowings from $20.2 million 
to $16.8 million in 2015. The decrease was 
largely a result of a lower cost of local 
financing and fixed interest rate swaps 
coming to an end.
The taxation charge for 2015 was 
$43.7 million (2014: $45.1 million) resulting 
in a reported tax rate of 55% (2014: 47%). 
Excluding exceptional items, the impact 
of IAS19 finance charges and foreign 
exchange gains/losses on the parent group 
cash balance, the underlying effective rate 
on pre-tax profits reduced 600bps to 35% 
(2014: 41%). This was driven by a reduction 
in unrelieved losses and withholding tax 
suffered, together with a favourable 
change in profit mix for the period. Profit 
attributable to minority interests increased 
to $11.2 million (2014: $9.6 million) and 
is predominantly related to Coats’ 
operations in Vietnam and Bangladesh 
(in which it has controlling interests).

Return on capital employed increased

increase from 2013.
Strategic report
24 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015 changed from 2014 to exclude UK pension 
recovery payments which totalled 
$25.8 million in 2014 (2015: $33.8 million). 
The year-on-year variance was mainly due 
to the implementation of a revised supplier 
payment approach, which negatively 
impacted working capital.
EBITDA (defined as pre-exceptional 
operating profit before depreciation and 
amortisation) was $183.0 million, up from 
$170.0 million in 2014 (on a reported basis) 
due to the factors that contributed to the 
increase in pre-exceptional operating profit 
outlined earlier in the report.
There was a $15.2 million net working 
capital outflow in 2015 (2014: $27.5 million 
inflow). The outflow was mainly due to the 
implementation of a revised payment 
approach to suppliers, which is in keeping 
with Coats’ commitment to treating all of 
its partners along the supply chain in an 
ethical and sustainable way. This led to a 
material trade payable outflow. With the 
year-on-year increase in trading activity 
there was also an outflow related to 
inventories and trade receivables; however 
this was somewhat offset by an ongoing 
improvement in inventory management 
through a reduction in stock days.
Interest paid decreased to $15.3 million 
(2014: $21.6 million) as a result of a 
reduction in interest rates achieved on 
borrowings. Tax paid reduced year-on-year 
from $55.1 million to $49.3 million in 2015 
and as a percentage of pre-exceptional 
profit before tax the rate fell in line with 
the continued reduction in the underlying 
effective tax rate of the Group. Payments 
to minority interests increased year-on-year 
to $10.1 million (2014: $6.7 million).
There was a $21.4 million free cash outflow 
in 2015 (2014: $46.5 million inflow). This 
included UK pension recovery payments of 
$33.8 million (2014: $25.8 million), of which 
approximately $21 million was paid to the 
Coats Plan and $3 million to the Staveley 
scheme, the same as in 2014 in Pound 
Sterling terms, and $9 million was paid to 
the Brunel scheme (2014: nil) following 
agreement of its triennial funding valuation 
and deficit recovery plan in November 2015 
(see pensions section below). There was a 
$37.0 million outflow (2014: $2.2 million) 
related to the disposed loss-making EMEA 
Crafts business, comprising $14.7 million on 
trading performance and $22.3 million of 
disposal charges. A $7.6 million outflow 
(2014: nil) related to the establishment and 
purchase of own shares for an Employee 
Benefits Trust. This was to cover the 
requirements for a share-based long term 
incentive scheme (in line with the standards 
of a FTSE 250 company) for senior 
employees, that more clearly aligns their 
interests with those of shareholders. 
Exceptional items included $8.9 million 
spent on the pensions investigation (2014: 
$12.2 million), $5.3 million on the overhead 
reduction programme and a net inflow of 
$5.1 million related to the restructuring and 
subsequent property disposal of a Mexican 
operation. In addition, $5.5 million was 
spent on the acquisition of GSD (2014: no 
acquisitions).
Balance sheet
The Group had a net cash position of 
$241 million at 31 December 2015 
(31 December 2014: $321 million). 
This included a parent group cash balance 
of $505 million (£342 million), compared 
to $584 million (£375 million) at the end 
of 2014. The decline was primarily related 
to foreign exchange losses, due to the 
strengthening of the US dollar, spend 
on the UK pensions investigations and 
recovery payments to the Brunel and 
Staveley pensions schemes.
The Coats operating business 
maintained its year end net debt position 
(31 December 2015: $264 million, end 
2014: $263 million), see note 30. An 
important metric for the Company is 
the leverage ratio of net debt (excluding 
parent group cash) to EBITDA. At the 
end of 2015, it stood at 1.4 times, well 
within the 3x covenant limit of the 
Company’s $680 million trade finance 
facility, comfortably within the 1-2x range 
Management aim to operate within and 
lower than 31 December 2014 (1.5 times).
Pensions and other post-
employment benefits
The net obligation for the Group’s 
retirement and other post-employment 
defined benefit liabilities, on an IAS19 
financial reporting basis, was $469 million 
as at 31 December 2015, down from $584 
million at 31 December 2014 ($526 million 
at 30 June 2015). The deficits in the 
Group’s UK defined benefit schemes, 
namely the Coats Plan, Brunel and Staveley 
schemes, decreased to $423 million (£286 
million) from the position at 31 December 
2014 ($508 million, £326 million). This was 
primarily due to a decrease in liabilities 
largely driven by a 25bps increase in the 
discount rate to 3.60% (derived using a 
yield curve approach, based on Sterling AA 
corporate bonds), while the inflation rate 
remained flat at 2.95% (based on a market 
implied long term rate). See table on 
page 26 for more detail.
Adjusted EPS increased by 38%, on a 
like-for-like basis, to 3.96 cents (2014: 2.88 
cents). This was generated through the 
higher operating profit and improvements 
in the underlying tax rate. Reported EPS 
for continuing operations declined from 
2.99 cents in 2014 to 1.78 cents in 2015 
due to foreign exchange losses on the 
parent group cash balance, a $22 million 
negative year-on-year movement, and a 
higher level of exceptional costs. The 
company generated a reported loss from 
continuing and discontinued operations of 
$50.6 million (2014: $15.0 million profit) 
primarily due to the disposal of the 
loss-making EMEA Crafts business.
Discontinued items
There was a loss from discontinued 
operations of $75.5 million in 2015 
related to the sale of the loss-making 
EMEA Crafts business. This comprised 
trading losses of $12.7 million, a loss on 
disposal of $55.8 million and net exchange 
losses of $7.0 million. The loss on disposal 
comprised $17.0 million of cash retained 
in the business and $37.3 million of net 
working capital left in the EMEA Crafts 
business and $13.5 million of other assets 
and liabilities (including disposal related 
costs and completion adjustments), which 
were partly offset by $11.5 million of 
pensions and other liabilities transferred to 
the buyer. The $23.8 million loss from 
discontinued operations recognised in the 
second half of 2015 (H1 2015: $51.7 
million) included additional trading losses, 
disposal related costs, completion 
adjustments and the net exchange loss.
Investment
In 2015 capital expenditure amounted to 
$44.3 million (2014: $46.0 million) and 
was 1.0 times depreciation, in line with 
previous guidance. Key investment areas 
during the year were digital services, such 
as the roll-out of the eCommerce platform, 
which has enabled market share gains and 
reduced operating costs, and spend on 
environmental projects, such as effluent 
treatment plants, which help ensure 
Coats maintains its leading corporate 
responsibility credentials in the industry. 
It is expected that capital expenditure will 
remain around 1.0 times depreciation in 
the medium term, with the key investment 
areas in 2016 being new product/process 
development, capacity expansion and 
ongoing environmental spend.
Cash flow
Coats generated a $73.9 million adjusted 
free cash inflow in 2015, compared to 
$87.8 million in 2014 (excluding EMEA 
Crafts). The basis for this measure has

Pensions – triennial funding valuations
As previously announced, the March 2013 
triennial funding valuation for the Brunel 
scheme was agreed with the trustee in 
November 2015. This revealed a Technical 
Provisions deficit of £94 million which is 
to be repaired by a deficit recovery plan 
of £5.5 million per annum (approximately 
$8 million at 31 December 2015 rates) 
over 10 years. The payment in November 
2015 was made from the Company’s 
parent group cash balance.
Coats continues to have constructive 
discussions with the Trustee of the 
Staveley scheme in respect of the 
December 2013 triennial funding 
valuation, which management believe 
will reveal a Technical  Provisions deficit of 
approximately £100 million, and expects 
to reach agreement on the details of the 
recovery plan during the first half of 2016.
The Coats UK Plan valuation, as at 1 April 
2015 is ongoing and due to be agreed by 
the end of H1 2016. It is anticipated that 
agreement on the Coats triennial valuation 
will coincide with any agreed settlement. 
Coats currently pays £14 million per 
annum (approximately $21 million at 
31 December 2015 rates) on the basis 
of the last agreed triennial valuation in 
October 2013 to repair a deficit of £215 
million. The technical provisions approach 
for valuing pension liabilities is used for 
agreeing triennial valuations and recovery 
plans and will need to be more prudent 
than the IAS19 accounting basis, Coats 
anticipates that the technical provisions 
deficit for the Coats UK Plan will therefore 
follow a similar pattern to that of the 
Brunel and Staveley schemes.
Pensions – investigations
As mentioned earlier in the report, Coats 
has initiated settlement discussions with 
the three sets of Trustees of the Brunel, 
Staveley and Coats UK pension schemes 
to resolve the ongoing pensions 
investigations, agreement from tPR 
will also be needed.
As part of the discussions Coats has 
committed to all parties to retain the entire 
parent group cash balance of $505 million 
(£342 million) within the Group to support 
the schemes and not return this cash to 
shareholders. The cash balance is the 
proceeds generated from Guinness Peat 
Group’s (‘GPG’s’), as the Company was 
known at the time, asset realisation 
programme between 2011-2013 when it 
sold its share in approximately 
50 businesses leaving Coats as the only 
remaining operating business. GPG’s 
Directors had envisaged returning 
the proceeds of the programme to 
shareholders, and distributions were 
made in the form of capital returns and 
share buybacks between 2011 and the 
first quarter of 2013. However, GPG’s 
Directors decided to stop returns in the 
second quarter of 2013 when tPR began 
its investigations, initially into the Coats UK 
and Brunel schemes in April 2013 and then 
later that year into the Staveley scheme.
Coats’ commitment to retain the entire 
parent group cash balance within the 
Group, and any settlement agreement, 
is based on a number of principles and 
conditions. These include tPR withdrawing 
the Warning Notices on the three schemes, 
thereby ending the investigations, and for 
Coats to have the ability to commence the 
payment of normal course dividends to its 
shareholders and have sufficient cash to 
invest in growth opportunities.
The support structure could be any of, or 
a combination of, cash directly paid into 
the schemes, contingent cash earmarked 
for the schemes, if subsequently required, 
and/or cash retained within the Group. 
At this stage the level of ongoing annual 
deficit recovery payments following any 
settlement is not known.
If a settlement cannot be reached in 
respect of all of the schemes and the 
investigations proceed, tPR has previously 
indicated that it believes it would be 
appropriate for the Determinations Panel 
(‘DP’) of tPR to hear the cases for the 
Brunel and Staveley pension schemes at 
the same time as the Coats Plan, which 
means that any hearing is unlikely before 
the second half of 2016 at the earliest.
Lower Passaic River
As previously reported, the US Environmental 
Protection Agency (‘EPA’) notified Coats and 
Clark Inc. (‘CC’), a subsidiary of Coats, and 
many other companies, of potential 
responsibility for certain historical 
environmental costs for the Lower Passaic 
River (‘LPR’), New Jersey, USA. In April 2014, 
the EPA released a Focused Feasibility Study 
(‘FFS’) for the lower eight miles of the LPR 
with an estimated cost of its preferred 
remedy of approximately $1.7 billion, on a 
net present value basis. Coats, and certain 
other companies, submitted a petition in Q1 
2015 to the EPA asserting that it is a de 
minimis party and is seeking resolution on 
that basis.
A Cooperating Parties Group (‘CPG’), of 
which Coats is one of approximately 55 
members, submitted a remedial investigation 
and feasibility study (‘RI/FS’) in H1 2015 with 
an estimated cost of between $518 million 
and $772 million, on an undiscounted basis. 
Consequently Coats, as reported in its half 
year results, recorded a $6.0 million charge, 
net of insurance, that will cover a proportion of 
incurred and expected legal and remediation 
costs, based on the mid-point of the RI/FS 
range (as a de minimis party).  Following a 4 
March 2016 remedial decision by the EPA, this 
provision (reflecting the same de minimis share 
of the larger remedy) was increased by $6.8 
million as at 31 December 2015. See note 28 
for further details.
Coats believes that CC’s predecessors did not 
generate any of the contaminants which are 
driving the current and anticipated remedial 
actions in the LPR, that it has valid legal 
defences which are based on its own analysis 
of the relevant facts, that it is a de minimis 
party, and that additional parties not 
currently in the CPG will be responsible for a 
significant share of its ultimate costs of 
remediation. Negotiations among parties 
and with the EPA, remedial design and 
implementation of remedial action are 
expected to take more than 10 years. 
Additional revisions may be appropriate 
depending on future developments.

Strategic report
27 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015 The effective management of our risks 
and uncertainties is essential in creating 
and protecting value for our shareholders, 
employees, customers and communities.
Overview
Timely identification of risks, combined 
with their appropriate management, 
mitigation and escalation, enables us 
effectively to run our business and 
deliver our strategy in the knowledge 
that the likelihood and/or impact 
associated with such risks is understood 
and managed within our risk appetite.
As a global industrial manufacturer, 
we recognise that risk is inherent within 
our geographical footprint and activities, 
and, with our transition to Coats Group 
plc in early 2015 and the ongoing 
development of our business and 
the internal and external operating 
environment, we have remained 
focused on working to ensure that 
our risk management framework and 
processes continue to evolve accordingly.
Governance structure
We operate a formal governance 
structure to manage risk across the 
Group. The roles and responsibilities of 
the main stakeholders involved in this 
structure are set out below:
• Board – The Board has overall 
responsibility for assessing the Group’s 
principal risks, monitoring the Group’s 
risk management and internal controls 
and setting the level of risk which 
the Group is willing to take in order to 
achieve its strategic objectives. Discussion 
and determination of these matters 
forms a regular part of Board meetings.
Audit and Risk Committee –  
The Audit and Risk Committee’s 
principal role in relation to risk 
management is to review 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management systems and processes 
and to report to the Board if it is not 
satisfied with any key aspect of those 
systems and processes.
More details about the work and 
responsibilities of the Audit and Risk 
Committee can be found in its report 
on pages 43 to 46.
• Group Risk Management 
Committee – The Group Risk 
Management Committee is responsible 
for formulating risk management 
strategies and policies and monitoring 
risk management throughout the 
Group. Its specific responsibilities 
include reviewing risk management 
activities across the Group; reviewing 
the Group Risk Register which includes 
the principal risks determined by the 
Board along with a number of 
additional material risks; supervising the 
management of the key risks in the 
Group Risk Register and monitoring the 
progress and effectiveness of related 
mitigating actions and controls; 
receiving reports on such risks and 
activities from relevant business areas, 
functions and individuals; and making 
reports and recommendations to the 
Board and the Audit and Risk 
Committee as appropriate. The Group 
Risk Management Committee meets on 
a quarterly basis and its membership 
includes representatives from across the 
Group’s business areas and enabling 
functions, drawing together the 
risk management activities across the 
Group, divisions, business units and 
functions and facilitating a streamlined 
business risk and control environment.

Strategic report
28 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015 Risk
During the year, we have focused 
on further strengthening this governance 
structure by enhancing the individual 
country/function-level and division-level 
risk management and assurance systems 
and processes, with supporting tools 
and training, and will continue to 
reinforce this going forward.
Culture
The Board is keenly aware that the 
effectiveness of our risk management 
is dependent not only on systems 
and processes but also on behaviours. 
During 2015 we continued to review 
and reinforce our Ethics Code and 
supporting ethics and risk policies, 
training, communications and 
compliance activities, and through 
those our required values and 
behaviours, all of which were actively 
supported, endorsed and championed 
by the Board and senior executive 
management and which all help 
to strengthen our risk culture.
How we manage risk
Our approach to risk management 
is based around an ongoing cycle of 
identifying risks; setting risk appetite 
levels for those risks; testing those risks 
and risk appetite levels through deep 
dive analysis into likelihood of occurrence, 
impacts, mitigation plans and resource 
and capital expenditure implications; 
then reviewing those risks and risk 
appetite levels accordingly. This continuous 
process helps to ensure that we remain 
focused on the appropriate risks and that 
we are taking the appropriate actions 
to manage and mitigate those risks and 
to deliver our business strategy and 
objectives within agreed risk parameters.
We are committed to continuing to 
review and, as appropriate, refine our 
risk management and reporting processes 
and activities, in order to enhance our 
ability to identify issues promptly and 
in turn proactively to manage risks.
How we identify risk
Our approach to identifying risks follows 
a dual approach, using:
• A top-down approach based on 
regular input and insights from the 
Board and the Group Risk Management 
Committee, drawing on a broad range 
of internal and external operational, 
commercial, economic and other 
perspectives and helping to establish the 
key risks, and potential future risks, 
which could threaten the Group and its 
ability to deliver its strategy. This gives 
colleagues throughout the Group a clear 
direction and set of priorities in their 
ongoing discharge of their own risk 
management responsibilities.
• A bottom-up approach based on 
regular individual country/function-level 
input which helps to identify the risks 
which could threaten local business or 
functional activities. While these risks 
are managed at the local level, they 
are also consolidated and escalated 
as appropriate to the Group Risk 
Management Committee and the 
Board to help in the ongoing cycle 
of identification, testing and 
reviewing described above.
Our risk assessment and risk appetite
We assess risks through a standardised 
process which includes measuring 
likelihood and impact levels, with and 
without controls, against a pre-defined 
scoring matrix. This assessment process 
assists the Board in prioritising risks 
and determining its level of risk appetite 
for each of the principal risks, as well 
as helping to evaluate the adequacy of 
existing controls and mitigating actions 
and the cost-benefit analysis of potential 
further such controls and actions.

Product liability Our expanding product range, in 
particular in our growing Speciality 
business, could potentially create 
more product liability exposure 
for the Group.
Products are tested and measured against 
stringent quality standards. Controls in 
the Speciality area specifically have been 
strengthened with enhanced batch by 
batch testing of safety critical products. 
Coats’ global insurance programme 
includes product liability cover.
Environmental  
non-performance 
Potential non-compliance with 
environmental control procedures  
and/or local requirements could lead to a 
discharge of pollution resulting in legal and 
regulatory action, financial penalties, 
damage to reputation and an adverse 
impact on ongoing operations.
Coats’ Environmental Policy applies 
across the Group and effluent discharge 
quality of all dyeing operations is 
monitored against a pre-determined 
schedule.
Failure of critical  
infrastructure 
Key information systems and data 
stores could malfunction; and/or key 
manufacturing and distribution centres 
could be adversely affected as a result 
of a number of different scenarios. 
Disproportionate reliance on such 
systems and plants could have a 
significant impact on profitability  
in the event of such disruption.
The Group’s manufacturing and supply 
chain function monitors and reviews 
internal supply chains, fire protection 
and other systems and creates and tests 
disaster recovery plans. Rolling property 
risk surveys are conducted and acted 
upon in respect of all Coats’ critical 
supply chain nodes. Actions in relation 
to information systems and data stores 
are set out in ‘Data controls and security’. 
Coats’ global insurance programme

Principal risks
During the year the Board, supported 
by the Group Risk Management 
Committee, has continued to consider a 
broad range of risks and uncertainties 
and has carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group 
along with the current levels of risk 
appetite for each of those risks.
Currently, the Board has identified 
12 principal risks, which fall into one 
of the following three categories:
• High impact operational risks 
– risks inherent in our ongoing 
commercial operations and 
geographic footprint, which, 
if not effectively managed, would be 
liable to cause significant commercial 
disruption.
• Material legacy risks – risks relating 
to the Group’s past operations and 
activities, including through historical 
mergers and acquisitions, which could 
create material financial exposure for 
the Group in its present form.
• Risks to strategy delivery – risks 
that could adversely impact the 
Group’s ability to achieve its defined 
strategic objectives.
These principal risks, along with a 
summary of the measures in place to 
manage and mitigate them, are set 
out in the table below.
As stated above, the Board will continue 
to keep these principal risks, as well as 
the appropriateness of this list and the 
ever evolving broader risk environment, 
under ongoing review.

Data controls  
and security
As a data controller of personal data 
and a processor of third party data, 
failure by the Group to comply with 
ever-more stringent data protection 
laws in different countries could 
lead to significant financial and other 
penalties and adverse relationship 
and reputational consequences. The 
Group also maintains other business 
critical electronic information, and 
inappropriate access to and use of such 
information, including through cyber-
attack, could again create significant 
financial and commercial exposure.
Coats coordinates its technology 
infrastructure on a global basis and 
has a number of cyber security controls 
in place. Internal data networks are 
monitored on a 24/7 basis by a central 
team. External internet access is controlled 
by policy-based web filtering and access 
management tools. Other technologies, 
including data encryption, are deployed 
to protect data assets hosted at its data 
centres and on mobile devices. Further 
controls are being progressively added 
as part of an ongoing cyber security 
risk management process.
Coats ensures all internal users have 
appropriate access rights and permissions 
for their roles and has a global data 
protection policy in place. Provisions are 
underway to ensure compliance with the 
EU General Data Protection Regulation 
expected to be enforced in 2018. 
Bribery and  
anti-competitive  
behaviour
Non-compliance with applicable bribery 
and corruption and/or competition/
anti-trust laws, regulations and standards 
by the Group or one of its partners could 
result in material civil or criminal penalties, 
exclusion from future contract bidding 
processes and reputational damage.
The Group has clear and well publicised 
ethics policies including in relation 
to partners, contractors and suppliers 
which are reinforced through the ongoing 
implementation of a comprehensive 
Supplier Code. There is extensive online 
and face-to-face training and regular 
communications through a range of 
channels. A sub-committee of the Group 
Risk Management Committee comprising 
key business and functional leaders meets 
quarterly to consider risks, legislative and 
regulatory developments and mitigation 
plans. The Group actively maintains a whistle 
blower system, enabling employees and 
others who are aware of or suspect unethical 
behaviour to report it confidentially.
Material legacy risks
Pensions investigation 
and pension scheme 
deficit funding
The UK Pensions Regulator’s 
investigations could lead to a Financial 
Support Direction being imposed on 
one or more of the three UK Schemes.
Additionally, the UK pension scheme 
triennial valuations could lead to increased 
and/or accelerated cash contributions.
These potential scenarios could impact 
one or more of the cash held from 
divestments, free cash flow targets 
and dividend payments.
The strategy relating to the ongoing 
investigations, and the schemes’ funding 
position more generally, are regularly 
reviewed by the Board in light of 
recommendations from the 
Pensions Committee.
The funded pension schemes are 
overseen by their Trustees, who are 
required to have the appropriate 
knowledge and understanding in this 
area and who take professional and 
actuarial investment advice as necessary. 
Where appropriate independent 
professional trustees are appointed to 
schemes to provide additional expertise.
The Group and the scheme trustees 
routinely review de-risking of the 
schemes through liability management 
and investment strategies.

Legacy environmental risks Under the laws of certain countries, 
Coats’ subsidiaries could potentially be 
responsible for investigating and/or 
remediating conditions alleged to be 
associated in whole or in part with 
former operations.
The Board continues to monitor the 
strategy and developments in relation 
to the Lower Passaic River proceedings, 
more detail of which can be found in 
note 28. Beyond that the Group continues 
to refine its policies and procedures for 
managing and mitigating potential legacy 
risks associated with former operations.
Risks to strategy delivery
Mergers and acquisitions 
(M&A) programme – 
execution and integration
Given the important role of inorganic 
growth in the Group’s strategic plans, 
failure properly to execute, integrate and 
capitalise on the potential ongoing value 
in M&A projects could pose a material 
risk to the Group’s ability successfully 
to deliver its strategy.
All M&A projects are overseen and 
closely monitored by the Board and by 
senior executive management. Clear 
processes including specified roles and 
responsibilities for all aspects of M&A 
projects exist along with focused project 
management resources during both 
execution and integration phases. Post-
completion/integration reviews are 
conducted to ensure that learnings are 
identified and built into subsequent 
projects as part of a continuous 
enhancement process.
Appropriate capability 
development
Failure to identify and retain key staff  
and/or continue to develop key skill 
sets among them could result in 
an inability to execute the Group’s 
growth strategy.
The Board and senior management 
remain very focused on talent and 
capability development, as well as 
retention and succession planning. 2015 
capability development actions have 
included record numbers of new cohorts 
on a range of sales force, management 
and senior management development 
programmes and individual coaching for 
selective senior managers. In addition, 
our annual Talent Management and 
Succession Planning process reviews  
talent in the top 300 roles.
Joint ventures/minority 
shareholder relationships
Failure to ensure that appropriate 
governance and risk management 
arrangements are maintained for all 
of the Group’s joint ventures and with 
all minority shareholding partners 
could cause significant disruption  
to the Group’s operations, financial 
performance and strategic plans.
We conduct appropriate due diligence 
on all our joint venture partners and take 
steps to ensure that the same standards of 
risk management that exist in our 
subsidiaries are applied throughout our 
joint venture partnerships. In 2015  
we completed an exit from our only 
minority stakeholding joint venture (in 
the Philippines).

water, labour, etc.) and/or the inability 
or unwillingness of one or more major 
external suppliers to supply raw materials, 
dye stuffs and/or finished goods could 
cause major disruption to the Group’s 
supply chain, leading to lost revenue and 
long term impact on customer relations.
Furthermore, actions by suppliers and 
other agents of the Group inconsistent 
with legal and regulatory requirements 
and/or the Group’s own ethical standards 
could create significant legal and 
reputational exposure for the Group.
Supplier relationships and external resource 
and supply chains are actively monitored 
and managed, with multiple sourcing of 
materials and strategic inventories. Risk 
is spread by dealing with multiple suppliers 
of key materials and continuous scrutiny 
to identify new supply sources. Ethics 
and compliance obligations are reinforced 
and enforced through the ongoing 
implementation of a comprehensive 
Supplier Code (see above). Coats’ global 
insurance programme includes supplier 
dependency cover.
Emergence of disruptive 
competitor behaviour 
in core markets
Planned or irrational strategies or 
behaviours by one or more industry 
competitors in relation to the Group’s 
core markets could adversely impact its 
position, profitability and strategic goals.
We strongly believe in the importance of 
healthy competition and the benefits that 
brings to both our customers and 
ourselves. We maintain a deep 
understanding of emerging industry trends 
through our relationships and contacts 
with customers and global brands and 
through our R&D activities with university 
and specialist led research projects. 
Outputs and insights from these allow us 
to undertake ongoing ‘horizon scanning’ 
and planning strategies.
Long term viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the 2014 revision of the Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have 
assessed the longer term viability of the 
Group over the period to December 
2018. The Directors’ assessment has 
been made with reference to the 
Group’s current position and prospects, 
the Group’s existing committed finance 
facilities, the Group’s strategy and the 
potential impact of the principal risks 
and how these are managed, as detailed 
in this strategic report.
The Group’s strategic objectives and 
associated principal risks are underpinned 
by a set of market goals for the next 
three years and an annual Medium Term 
Plan process which comprises a financial 
forecast for the current year and 
financial projections for the next three 
years. The Medium Term Plan represents 
a common process with standard outputs 
and requirements at the Group level. 
The Medium Term Plan is reviewed by the 
Board annually as part of its strategy 
review process. Although this period 
provides less certainty of outcome, the 
underlying methodology is considered 
to provide a robust planning tool against 
which strategic decisions can be made. 
For these reasons, the Directors have 
determined that a three year time 
horizon to December 2018 is an 
appropriate period over which to 
provide its viability assessment.
The Directors have considered the 
impact of the principal risks facing the 
business in severe but plausible scenarios 
(by modelling sensitivities applied to the 
base case Medium Term Plan), and the 
effectiveness of any mitigating actions, 
including, but not limited to, an 
evaluation of:
• the possible outcomes of the current 
investigations into the Group’s three 
UK pension schemes by tPR, including 
severe but plausible scenarios which 
take into account the current status 
of the investigations, the strength 
of the company’s defences and 
the timescales for resolution. 
See page 26 for an update on 
the investigation;
• the range of possible outcomes 
in respect of legacy environmental 
matters as described in note 28, 
to the financial statements; and
• a range of strategic, operational 
and external risks which could 
affect the group’s ability to achieve 
its strategy.
Based on this assessment, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to 
December 2018.

Corporate governance 37 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Good governance is essential in 
supporting the development of a 
sustainable and successful business 
such as Coats.
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce our corporate 
governance report for the year. As a 
Board, we are responsible for ensuring that 
an appropriate governance structure is in 
place. I believe that the framework we 
have established (and which is set out 
on page 38) is appropriate for a Company 
of our size and nature, and supports the 
delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives 
whilst also ensuring accountability, 
transparency and fairness in our dealings 
with all of our stakeholders, in particular 
our shareholders, customers, employees 
and suppliers.
The Board is fully committed to the 
principles of best practice in corporate 
governance, and collectively believes that 
good governance is essential in supporting 
the development of a sustainable and 
successful business.
Activity in the year
2015 has been an extremely busy year for 
the Board and the evolution of the Group 
as a whole. We have overseen the change 
of name from Guinness Peat Group plc 
and the consolidation of the previous dual 
board structure into a single Board to lead 
the Group. There have also been a number 
of changes to the composition of our 
Board. In the latter part of the year we 
announced our intention to de-list from 
both the Australian Stock Exchange and 
the New Zealand Stock Exchange during 
2016, subject to shareholder approval. All 
of these changes are intended to focus the 
Board and the Group to deliver long term 
value for our shareholders.
Governance
The Company is subject to the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code) which is published and 
regularly updated by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) and its 
equivalent in Australia. It should be 
noted that the Code may materially 
differ from the corporate governance 
rules of NZX Limited (NZX) and the 
principles of NZX’s Corporate 
Governance Best Practice Code – but 
the Company is not obliged to comply 
with these.
The Company has complied with 
the main and supporting principles of 
the Code and where this has not been 
possible an explanation has been 
provided.
Committees
As part of our transition at both a Board 
and Group level, we have separated into 
two Committees, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nomination 
Committee, so facilitating a clearer 
separation of responsibilities for each. 
Terms of reference are available at 
www.coats.com/governance.
Evaluation
Given this period of transition at both 
Board and Group level, we decided not 
to carry out a formal evaluation of the 
Board and Committees during 2015 and 
have determined that such an evaluation 
will be conducted during 2016.

Leadership
The Directors believe that the Board 
has an appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, knowledge and 
independence to satisfy the 
requirements of good corporate 
governance.
Compliance
Significant time and resource is given 
to governance matters by the Board 
and within the everyday operations 
of the Group. This ensures compliance 
within the framework of regulations 
but is also central to delivering 
sustainable business success.
Effectiveness 
The Board understand that an 
effective corporate governance 
framework is an inherent part of 
running a business. 
Accountability 
A key element of ensuring sound 
governance is guaranteeing an 
appropriate system of controls 
and accountability.

Responsibilities:
The Board
The Board’s role is to provide leadership of 
the Company, and it is responsible to the 
shareholders for the long term success of 
the Company. All matters are reserved for 
the Board unless specifically listed in the 
terms of reference for Committees of the 
Board or where the Board has delegated 
authority. These can be seen in the 
governance structure chart above. A 
schedule of delegated authorities is 
reviewed by the Board annually.
Until March 2015, the Company (then 
named GPG) was an investment holding 
company which had no Executive 
Directors. On the appointment of Paul 
Forman to the Board as Group Chief 
Executive on 2 March 2015, the separate 
roles of Chairman and Chief Executive 
were documented in writing and approved 
by the Board. 
Chairman
Mike Clasper, the Chairman, leads the 
Board, and is responsible for its 
effectiveness and governance. He sets the 
tone for the Company and ensures that 
the links between the Board and 
management and between the Board and 
shareholders are strong. He sets the Board 
agenda and ensures that sufficient time is 
allocated to important matters.
Chief Executive
Paul Forman was appointed to the Board on 
2 March 2015, having been Group Chief 
Executive of Coats plc since 31 December 
2009. Paul is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the Group’s operations, for 
recommending the Group’s strategy to the 
Board and for implementing the strategy 
agreed by the Board. He is supported in 
decision making by a Management Board 
comprised of senior managers, 
biographical details of whom can be found 
on page 36.
Senior Independent Director
As noted above, the Board of the Company 
comprised only Non-Executive Directors 
until the name change to Coats Group plc 
in March 2015 and the appointment of a 
single Board to lead the Group. Nicholas 
Bull was appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director and as the Senior Independent 
Director (‘SID’) on 10 April 2015, bringing 
the Company into compliance with Code 
provision A.3.1. 
In his role as SID, Nicholas provides a 
sounding board for the Chairman and 
serves as an intermediary for the other 
Directors when necessary. Nicholas is 
available to shareholders if they have 
concerns which contact through the 
normal channels of Chairman, Chief 
Executive or other Executive Directors have 
failed to resolve, or for which such contact 
is inappropriate. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors provide 
constructive challenge to executive 
management, and bring experience and 
objectivity to the Board’s discussions and 
decision making. They monitor the delivery 
of the Group’s strategy against the 
governance, risk and control framework 
established by the Board. The Non-
Executive Directors, led by the SID, are also 
responsible for evaluating the performance 
of the Chairman.
The Company Secretary
Stuart Morgan joined the Group as Chief 
Legal & Risk Officer and Group Company 
Secretary in 2014. In his role as Company 
Secretary, Stuart is responsible for working 
with the Chairman to develop Board and 
Committee agendas and to ensure that all 
Board procedures are complied with. 
Stuart also advises the Board on corporate 
governance, legal, regulatory and 
compliance matters and developments.

Other Committees
Pensions
The Committee is an ad hoc committee of 
the Board which has been formed 
specifically to provide advice and make 
recommendations to the Board on the 
Group’s strategy in relation to the ongoing 
pension scheme investigations and the 
robustness of the operating systems 
around those schemes. The Committee is 
chaired by Mike Allen and, from 2 March 
2015, its other members are Ruth 
Anderson, David Gosnell, Blake Nixon and 
Richard Howes. Nicholas Bull joined the 
Committee following his appointment on 
10 April 2015. Blake Nixon left the 
Committee, when he left the Company on 
31 December 2015.
Disclosure
The Committee’s primary duty is to 
determine whether, what and when any 
Group information needs to be disclosed 
to the market and to verify such 
information ahead of its disclosure to the 
market via a Regulatory Information 
Service in accordance with the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Rules and 
Transparency Rules. This includes providing 
appropriate reassurances to the Board and, 
as required, individual Directors.
The Committee is chaired by Paul Forman 
and its other members are Richard Howes 
and Stuart Morgan.
Group Risk Management
This Committee is responsible for 
formulating risk management strategies 
and policies and monitoring risk

Composition of the Board and independence
As at the date of this report, the Board comprises the Chairman, five Non-Executive 
Directors (all of whom are considered to be independent) and three Executive Directors. 
The Board is therefore in compliance with the requirements of the Code that, excluding 
the Chairman, at least half the Board comprises independent Non-Executive Directors.

In addition, several Board meetings were devoted exclusively to discussions on 
the Group’s strategy.
Effectiveness
Board meetings in 2015
The Board met regularly throughout the 
period. There were 12 scheduled meetings 
in 2015. The overall number of meetings 
includes those called to manage the 
transition of the Company.
Directors are expected to attend all 
meetings of the Board, and the 
Committees on which they sit, and to 
devote sufficient time to the Company’s 
affairs to enable them to fulfil their duties 
as Directors. The Directors were located in 
the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Hong 
Kong and this geographical diversity 
meant that it was not always possible for 
every Director to attend all Board and 
Committee meetings in person. In the 
event that Directors were unable to attend 
a meeting, they were given time to 
comment on papers to be considered at 
the meeting and discussions were held in 
advance with the Chairman so that their 
contribution could be included in the wider 
Board discussion.
Board activity in 2015
Each year the Board agrees a schedule of 
regular business, financial and operational 
matters to be addressed by the Board and 
its Committees during the course of the 
year and this ensures that all areas for 
which the Board has responsibility are 
reviewed, as shown in the adjacent list.
In addition to the formal Board meetings, 
the Chairman seeks to ensure that he 
meets on a periodic basis with the 
Non-Executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors present. These 
meetings support the constructive 
contribution of the Non-Executive 
Directors, and allow the Chairman to 
ensure that all views are taken into account 
and aired, as appropriate, at full Board 
meetings. All Directors are aware that 
should they have concerns about the way 
the Board operates these are recorded in 
the minutes. No such concerns were raised 
during the reporting period.
Corporate governance 41 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Evaluation
As we have been in a period of transition 
during 2015, and given the significant 
changes to the composition of the Board 
during the year, it was not considered 
appropriate to conduct a formal and 
rigorous evaluation process during the year 
and, consequently, the Company has not 
complied with Main Principle B6 of the 
Code. The effectiveness of the Board has 
been discussed informally by the Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors and no issues 
have been identified. A formal evaluation 
process will be undertaken during 2016. 
Directors’ interests and conflicts
The interests of the Directors (including 
interests of their connected persons) in  
the share capital of the Company and its 
subsidiaries are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 48 to 61. 
There is an established process to capture 
details of any interests that a Director may 
have which conflict with, or could 
potentially conflict with, the interests of 
the Company. The Company’s Articles of 
Association permit the Board to authorise 
any actual or potential conflicts of interest 
if considered appropriate. At each meeting 
the Board considers Directors’ conflicts of 
interest, and Directors are reminded of 
their duty to disclose any conflicts and 
potential conflicts, as well as any interests 
in the matters to be discussed at the 
meeting. 
No Director, either during or since the end 
of the year under review, was or has 
become interested in any material contract 
(not being a contract of employment) with 
the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Induction of new Directors
On joining the Board, all Directors are 
offered a thorough and tailored induction 
programme, the key elements of which 
comprise meetings with Executive 
Directors and senior management across 
the Group, site visits, specific training 
relating to current issues affecting the 
Group (including from external advisers as 
appropriate), meetings with advisers, and 
the provision of Group training manuals 
and other written information relevant to  
their role.
In June 2015 the Board reviewed and 
standardised the Non-Executive Directors’ 
letters of appointment. The changes were 
made to reflect the new Company 
structure. In accordance with good 
governance, the letters of appointment 
were amended to require all Non-Executive 
Directors to stand for election at every 
AGM and to set out more explicitly 
Non-Executive Directors’ duties and 
expectations, along with the treatment of 
conflicts of interest. 
Given the demands that have arisen out of 
the transition process, together with the 
ongoing demands in relation to tPR’s 
investigations, it has not been possible to 
quantify the time commitment required 
from Directors, nor the commitment which 
will be required going forward. 
Consequently, the letters of appointment 
of Non-Executive Directors do not set out 
their expected time commitment, and the 
Company does not therefore comply with 
Code provision B.3.2 in this respect. 
However all Directors have undertaken to 
provide sufficient time to meet their 
obligations, and the Board is satisfied that 
each of the Non-Executive Directors has 
been able to devote sufficient time to the 
Company’s business during the year.
It is the Board’s intention to keep the time 
requirement for Non-Executive Directors 
under review, and to seek to formalise a 
time requirement for the purposes of 
Non-Executive appointment letters at an 
appropriate time in the future.
Training and development
The Chairman is responsible for reviewing 
the training needs of each Director, and for 
ensuring that the Directors continually 
update their skills, and knowledge of the 
Company. All Directors are advised of 
changes in relevant legislation and 
regulations and changing risks, with the 
assistance of the Company’s advisers 
where appropriate. The Directors are also 
provided with regular corporate 
governance updates to highlight changes 
in governance regulations and best 
practice.
It is intended that individual training and 
development needs will be further 
reviewed as part of the formal evaluation 
process to be carried out in 2016.
Information and support
In conjunction with the Company 
Secretary, the Chairman ensures that all 
Directors receive papers and other 
information relevant to matters to be 
discussed at Board meetings at least one 
week before the meeting. As Directors  
were during the reporting period situated 
in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Hong 
Kong, Singapore and the US, suitable 
communication and reporting systems 
have been established which enable  
them to monitor, on a timely basis, the  
Group’s activities.
Senior management and professional 
advisers are invited to attend Board and 
Committee meetings. Where appropriate, 
they contribute to discussions and advise 
members of the Board or its Committees 
on particular matters. The involvement of 
the senior management at Board and 
Committee discussions strengthens the 
relationship between the Board and its 
operating business and helps to provide 
the Board with a greater understanding of 
operations and strategy.
All Directors have access to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. In addition, they have access to 
the advice and services of the Group 
Company Secretary who is responsible for 
providing advice on corporate governance 
matters to the Board.

Relations with shareholders
The Group has a dedicated Investor Relations function and a 
website focused on information and updates relevant to public 
shareholders (www.coats.com/investors).
The Board receives regular updates on investor communication 
activity, changes to the shareholder register and analysis of share 
price performance, and the Chairman ensures that any views 
expressed by shareholders are communicated to the Board at the 
earliest opportunity.
The Board considers transparency and openness to be a key 
feature of its stated strategy and endeavours to ensure that both 
shareholders and the market remain appropriately informed and 
that regular updates are released to the market.
Presentations are made to analysts and shareholders covering the 
Company’s Preliminary Results and its half year results each year. 
These have been attended by the Chairman, and will in future 
include the Senior Independent Director.
Annual General Meeting
The Board considers the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to be a 
useful forum to develop an understanding of the views of its 
shareholders. At its 2015 AGM the Chairman provided an 
additional report to shareholders.
Copies of these presentations and reports and the results of proxy 
voting at the 2015 AGM were released to the markets and can be 
found on the Company’s website www.coats.com.
This year’s AGM will be held on 18 May 2016 in London.

Corporate governance 43 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
We now have a Committee which provides 
a strong combination of longstanding 
knowledge of the business with fresh 
perspectives.
Dear shareholder, 
As Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee (‘the Committee’), I am pleased 
to report on the Committee’s activities 
during the year.
The combining of the Boards of Coats plc 
and Coats Group plc and the transition of 
the listed company from an investment 
holding company to a UK headquartered 
global manufacturing business have 
brought significant changes to the 
membership of the Committee. 
During the year three new members joined 
– Alan Rosling (who had been a Director of 
Coats plc), David Gosnell and Nicholas Bull, 
each of whose biographies can be found 
on page 34 and 35. Blake Nixon was a 
member of the Committee until he 
stepped down on 20 May 2015.  
We now have a Committee which provides 
a strong combination of longstanding 
knowledge of the business with fresh 
perspectives to deal with a very full 
agenda.  As required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, Nicholas Bull and I are 
considered to have recent and relevant 
financial experience.
The Committee has an annual work plan 
framed around the Group’s financial 
reporting cycle, which ensures that it 
considers all matters as delegated to it by 
the Board and covers significant 
accounting estimates and judgments – 
which are set out in the table on page 45.  
Inevitably there are also ‘one-off’ matters 
which require the Committee’s attention 
and which this year included the disposal 
of EMEA Crafts; the Committee scrutinised 
the accounting implications for this major 
transaction, which has also been reviewed 
by the external auditors.
Ruth Anderson
Chairman, Audit and Risk Committee
Audit and Risk Committee report
In 2014 the Company instigated the 
Finance Review, an important internal 
project which is establishing centres of 
excellence in management reporting, 
treasury and tax, with the implementation 
of standard and consistent global 
processes leveraging the use of 
technology. During the year. the 
Committee has maintained its focus on 
the progress of this project, receiving 
regular reports on the roll-out to different 
countries and monitoring how lessons 
learned early on are helping the 
implementation at later stages. 
I will be available at the Annual General 
Meeting to answer any questions about 
our work.

the financial statements of the Company, 
including its annual and half yearly reports 
and any informal reports, such as 
preliminary yearly financial statements and 
analyst presentations, reviewing and 
reporting to the Board on significant 
financial reporting issues and judgments

auditor.
The Committee meets as required in 
advance of and during the annual audit 
process and to consider the final output, as 
well as to consider the half year

Financial Officer, Head of Financial Control, 
Group Head of Internal Audit, and the 
Chief Legal & Risk Officer and Group

Corporate governance 45 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Significant accounting judgments and estimates:
Significant financial and reporting issues considered by the Committee in the year, in no particular order, are set out in the table below. 
The Committee reached its conclusions having considered the explanations given by management, discussed and challenged each 
matter, and asked for further information where it thought appropriate.
Significant financial and reporting issue How the Committee addressed the issue
Disposal of EMEA Crafts The Committee reviewed the accounting implications of the sale including the validity of 
any judgments and estimates which included the calculation of the loss on sale within 
discontinued operations.
Pension matters – valuation of  
obligations and disclosure
The Committee reviewed the methodology for determining key assumptions 
underpinning the valuation of liabilities of the Group’s most significant pension schemes 
under International Accounting Standards. The Committee also reviewed in detail the 
various aspects of the continuing obligation to the Group’s ongoing schemes, including 
the potential impact of tPR’s investigation, and the appropriateness of provisions for 
costs associated with defending the Company’s position. The Committee is satisfied 
that the disclosure relating to these provides an appropriate balance.
The carrying value of intangible assets The Group has significant balance sheet values relating to intangible assets with 
indefinite lives (brands). During the year management presented a detailed paper 
setting out the approach to impairment assessment measurements and how key 
judgments and assumptions applied. Following input from executive management, the 
Committee has considered these carrying values and impairment adjustments where 
necessary.
The carrying value of tangible assets The Committee also reviewed evidence presented by management of impairment of 
tangible assets based on identifying loss making business activities and interrogating 
the related business plans.
US environment provision The Committee has considered at length management’s position on the accounting and 
disclosure implications surrounding the Lower Passaic River following the submission of 
the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study by the Cooperating Parties Group, of 
which the Group is a member. The Committee has also been briefed by management 
on the very recent remedial decisions taken by the EPA with respect to the lower 8 miles 
of the river and how this has been reflected in the calculation of the increased provision.
Other provisions The Committee considered the various judgments made by management in setting 
other provisions, the main areas being in respect of property and costs associated with 
the Pension Regulator’s investigation.
Taxation The Group operates in numerous jurisdictions around the world, with different 
regulations applying in different territories. This complexity together with intra-group 
cross-border transactions give rise to inherent risks. The Committee has reviewed 
management’s reports on tax risks and, in addition, during the year the Group Head of 
Tax outlined to the Committee the Group’s approach to managing its global tax affairs 
and the key judgments being taken, resulting in a formal tax strategy being approved by 
the Board.
The external auditor also reviewed the 
accounting treatment of all significant 
accounting judgments and estimates.
Going concern 
The Committee reviewed a detailed paper 
presented by management setting out the 
assumptions underlying the going concern 
statement. The paper covered the Group’s 
current financing, budgets and forecasts, 
and assessments of principal risks and 
uncertainties. The Committee considered 
this report, and discussed it with the 
external auditor. The Committee also 
considered, in particular, issues relating to 
tPR’s investigations and possible outcomes 
of the Lower Passaic River environmental 
matter, and satisfied itself that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group will have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the period of assessment of 
twelve months from the date of signing 
the accounts. The Committee reported 
accordingly to the Board, which also 
considered Going Concern in detail.
Internal audit
The Group Head of Internal Audit agrees 
the department’s programme of work 
annually in advance with the Committee, 
and at each Committee meeting the 
progress of Internal Audit’s activity is 
reviewed and progress against agreed 
actions by management is monitored.
In assessing the performance of Group 
Internal Audit, the Committee considered 
whether it provided timely assurance and 
practical recommendations to 
management to ensure the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems whilst mitigating 
control deficiencies. The views of the 
external auditor were also sought.
The Committee is satisfied that the Internal 
Audit Function is sufficiently resourced to 
carry out its role, and that there is an 
effective relationship between Internal 
Audit and executive management.
Corporate governance 46 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Audit and Risk Committee report
continued
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for 
determining the nature and extent of its 
principal risks and the extent of the 
Group’s risk appetite, and for monitoring 
and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s systems of risk management and 
internal control. The principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Company are 
addressed in the Strategic report and in 
the table on pages 30 to 33 of this report. 
The Board has delegated to the Committee 
within its terms of reference the responsibility 
for monitoring the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control systems. 
The Committee receives regular reports 
from management, Internal Audit and the 
external auditor relating to the 
effectiveness of the control environment. 
The reporting process ensures that all 
significant business units regularly report 
on their internal control. Group systems 
are reviewed annually with results reported 
to the Committee and to the Board. 
During 2015 a controllership function was 
established to provide greater focus on the 
key decisions and operational effectiveness 
of internal controls. 
The Committee and the Board are satisfied 
that these systems operate effectively in all 
material respects and that this process 
provides appropriate assurance regarding 
the Group’s financial condition, operational 
results, risk management and internal 
compliance and control systems. 
Whistleblowing procedure
Whistleblowing is a standing item on the 
Committee’s agenda. The Company has a 
whistleblowing procedure which enables 
employees who are aware of, or suspect, 
misconduct, illegal activities, fraud, abuse 
of assets or violations of any Company 
policy to report these confidentially. There 
were 31 incidents of whistleblowing 
during the year, all of which were 
investigated appropriately, with disciplinary 
action taken where there was any evidence 
of misdemeanour.
External audit
Independence
The Committee is responsible for reviewing 
the independence of the Company’s 
auditor, Deloitte LLP and making a 
recommendation to the Board on its 
engagement. Deloitte has a policy of 
partner rotation, which complies with 
regulatory standards, and the audit 
engagement partner changed with effect 
from the beginning of the 2014 financial 
year in line with this requirement. In 
addition, Deloitte has a structure of peer 
reviews for its engagements which is 
aimed at ensuring that its independence is 
maintained. 
Maintaining an independent relationship 
with the Company’s auditor is a critical 
part of assessing the effectiveness of the 
audit process. The Committee regularly 
reviews the level of audit and non-audit 
fees paid to Deloitte and also has in place 
a policy for ensuring significant 
assignments are not awarded to the 
auditor without first being subject to the 
scrutiny of the Committee. The key 
principles of the policy on non-audit 
services are: 
Summary of non-audit services 
policy
(i) Prohibited services include services 
remunerated on a success fee or 
participation in activities normally 
undertaken by management. 
(ii) The Committee approved a list of all 
permitted non-audit services. These 
include audit-related reviews of the 
Group’s interim results or any other 
review of accounts for regulatory 
purposes. It also includes certain tax 
compliance and advisory services for 
Group subsidiaries incorporated 
outside the European Union.
During 2015 the external auditor 
provided services in relation to the 
Group’s interim results and tax 
compliance.
(iii) The Committee maintains a list of 
prohibited services which is aligned 
to ‘black-list’ services set out in the 
EU Audit Regulations and Directives.
(iv)  Any service that is not on the list of 
permitted or prohibited services if in 
excess of US$15,000 requires the 
approval of the audit and risk 
committee. 
The Committee confirms that no 
prohibited services were provided by the 
external auditors and it is satisfied that the 
policy on the supply of non-audit services 
could not lead to audit objectivity and 
independence being compromised.
Audit tender
Deloitte LLP was appointed the Company’s 
auditor in 2003. During the year the 
Company established the policy that the 
external audit contract be put out to 
competitive tender at least every ten years. 
However, the transitional provisions under 
the EU Statutory Audit Directive (which will 
be brought into force in the UK with effect 
from 17 June 2016) permit the Company 
to put the external audit contract out to 
tender no later than in 2023. The 
Company has not yet made a decision as 
to the timing of the audit tender. 
There are no contractual obligations that 
restrict the Company’s choice of external 
audit firm.
Assessment of audit process 
effectiveness
The scope of the external audit is formally 
documented by the auditor. They discuss 
the draft proposal with management 
before it is referred to the Committee who 
reviews its adequacy and holds further 
discussions with management and the 
auditor before final approval.
The Committee also reviewed the 
effectiveness of the audit process based on 
its own experience and by seeking 
feedback, via a questionnaire, from others 
in the Company involved in the audit.
The Committee then considered overall 
performance of the auditor, their 
independence and objectivity, and 
reported to the Board that it should 
recommend to the Shareholders the 
reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor 
for the year ending 31 December 2016.
Committee performance
The Committee has undertaken a review 
of its own performance, seeking input 
from the members, regular attendees at 
the Committee and from the external 
auditor. Time has been scheduled at the 
May Committee meeting to analyse the 
results of the survey. This will enable the 
Committee to continue to improve the way 
in which it operates.
The Audit and Risk Committee report was 
approved by the Board of Directors on 
10 March 2016 and signed on its behalf by:

Corporate governance 47 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Dear shareholder,
I’m pleased to present the first annual 
report of the Nomination Committee 
following the separation of the previous 
combined Remuneration and 
Nominations Committee, with effect 
from 2 March 2015, in line with the 
establishment of a single, combined 
Board of Directors under Coats 
Group plc.
Although there have been many 
Board changes during the year, the 
majority of these resulted from the 
internal restructuring of the previous 
Guinness Peat Group plc and Coats 
plc Board to form the single, 
combined Board referred to above. 
The Committee did, however, 
recommend to the Board the 
appointment of Nicholas Bull, who we 
were delighted to welcome as a new 
Non-Executive Director with effect 
from April 2015.
The Committee’s primary focus has 
been on Board succession and 
development plans. As part of a 
Group focus on these matters we 
have also considered plans for the 
continued development of key 
personnel within the business to 
ensure a pipeline of executive talent, 
and have worked with the Chief 
Human Resources Officer to monitor 
the implementation of these plans. 
We are satisfied that the plans in place 
will position us well to deal with 
succession at Board and senior 
management levels in the future, but 
will continue to keep succession 
planning and talent development 
under close review.

Nomination Committee report
Composition and meetings
The Nomination Committee is chaired by 
Mike Clasper (the Chairman of the Group) 
and its members comprise all of the 
Non-Executive Directors along with the 
Group Chief Executive. The Nomination 
Committee met on 2 occasions during 
2015 to discuss proposed appointments, 
succession and development and to 
evaluate the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge on the 
Board.
Appointments
The Committee members recommended the 
appointment of Nicholas Bull as a Non-
Executive Director and SID of the Company 
during the year. The appointment process 
involved the services of an executive search 
agency, the Inzito Partnership, which has no 
other connection with the Company. The 
Inzito Partnership provided a shortlist of 
candidates who were interviewed by 
members of the Nomination Committee, 
following which the recommendation to 
appoint Nicholas Bull was submitted to and 
approved by the Board.
The Committee is currently coordinating a 
search for a new Chief Financial Officer 
following the resignation of Richard Howes 
with effect from 6 April 2016.
The Committee is responsible for 
ensuring that appropriate succession 
and development plans are in place.
Mike Clasper
Chairman
Diversity
When searching for candidates for Board 
appointments, the Nomination Committee 
takes into account a number of factors, 
including the benefits of diversity, 
including gender diversity, and the balance 
of the composition of the Board. The 
overriding requirement is to ensure that 
recommendations for appointments are 
made on merit against objective criteria, 
and that the best candidates are put 
forward for Board appointments.
Succession planning
The Committee is responsible for ensuring 
that appropriate succession and 
development plans are in place for 
appointments to the Board. We are 
satisfied that the succession planning 
structure in place is appropriate for a 
Company of the size and nature of the 
Group, and accords with our FTSE 250 
ambitions. Succession planning 
arrangements will be kept under regular 
review in the future.
Election of Directors
In accordance with provision B.7.1 of the 
Code and the Company’s Articles of 
Association, all Directors will offer 
themselves for re-election by shareholders 
at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.
Corporate governance 48 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for the year  
ended 31 December 2015.
David Gosnell
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Directors’ remuneration report
for the year ended 31 December 2015
Annual statement by the Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Remuneration 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) I am 
pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2015.
This report consists of two main sections 
following my introduction here. The first 
section contains the Annual Report on 
Remuneration for 2015 and the second 
section is a Remuneration Policy 
Summary which sets out the terms of 
the policy approved by shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM.
Following the change of the Company’s 
name to Coats Group plc, three 
Executive Directors were appointed to 
the Board in March 2015. The 
remuneration arrangements for the new 
Executive Directors are in accordance 
with the remuneration policy that was 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 
AGM. This policy had been developed 
and proposed on the basis that the 
Company would complete the transition 
from being an investment company with 
only Non-Executive Directors to a UK 
headquartered global manufacturing 
business with a Board consisting of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
The incentive compensation structure for 
Executive Directors aims to incentivise 
and reward the achievement of 
demanding targets that underpin the 
operational performance and growth of 
the Coats business. These measures are 
critical to the creation of future value for 
shareholders. A significant proportion of 
annual and long term remuneration for 
Executive Directors is directly linked to 
the value of the company’s shares to 
ensure that there is an alignment with 
the interests of shareholders. 
The bonus outcome for 2015, which 
does not apply to any Non-Executive 
Director, reflects the strong operational 
performance and focus on cash 
management by Coats. A significant 
amount of executive time and focus 
remains, of course, on dealing with the 
on-going investigations by the UK 
pensions regulator. However, it is 
important and in the interests of all 
shareholders and stakeholders that the 
continuing Coats business continues to 
grow profitably and produce strong  
cash flows. 
During the year, the Committee 
approved the grants of awards under 
the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan 
and Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, 
approved the remuneration terms for 
each Executive Director and considered 
the impact on existing incentive targets 
and arrangements of the disposal of the 
EMEA Crafts business. 
The Committee also approved the key 
elements of the 2016 annual bonus and 
2016 Long Term Incentive award 
including the setting of targets.
The level of fees for the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors was reviewed 
during the year but no changes were 
made. 
During 2015 an Employee Benefit Trust 
was established and mechanisms were 
put in place to enable the Trustee to buy 
the Company’s shares in the market that 
may be used for any future vested share 
awards.
The Annual Report on Remuneration 
also contains a statement on how the 
policy will be implemented in 2016. I am 
pleased to confirm that all incentive 
measures are directly linked to the 
performance of Coats Group plc. In 
particular, the profit element of the 2016 
Long Term Incentive grant will be based 
on compound annual growth in Coats 
Group plc earnings per share and free 
cash flow. 
The Committee remains focused on 
ensuring that the remuneration policy 
enables the Company to attract and 
retain the calibre of people it needs to 
meet its strategic objectives while at the 
same time adopting incentive targets 
that are challenging and directly linked 
to measures that will create shareholder 
value.

Annual Remuneration Report for 2015
A summary of the Remuneration Policy as approved by shareholders on 22 May 2014 follows after this section of the report. This 
Annual Report on Remuneration has been prepared in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and as 
prescribed in The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in 2013 (the 
Regulations). Where indicated data has been audited by Deloitte LLP.
The Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM on 18 May 2016.
Executive Directors
On 2 March 2015 three Executive Directors were appointed to the Board. These appointments reflected the Company’s planned 
transition from being an investment company to a global manufacturing business. All of the Executive Directors were employed by one 
of the Coats group of companies prior to their appointment. In accordance with the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders on 
22 May 2014 any existing legacy terms and conditions of existing service contracts or remuneration terms continue to apply after their 
appointment.

Total 1,141.2 – 251.1 – 1,025.1 – – – 287.6 – 2,705.0 –
The figures in the table above have been calculated on the basis of the following:
•  The figures for Mr Rajiv Sharma include the value of additional benefits that were provided to him following his relocation and 
secondment from Singapore to Dubai which commenced in June 2015. The contractual terms of the secondment were confirmed by 
his employer in December 2014 prior to his appointment as an Executive Director. The benefits figure for Mr Sharma includes an 
international allowance of $100,000 per annum which is paid as cash and the full cost of paying in advance a one year lease and 
utilities cost of $219,126 per annum on his accommodation in Dubai. Mr Sharma’s remuneration arrangements are determined and 
paid in US dollars and have been converted to UK currency in the table above at an average exchange rate of $1 = £0.6543.
•  Base salaries: represent the actual base salaries paid in the period from the date of appointment as an Executive Director on 2 March 
2015 to 31 December 2015. 
•  Benefits: is the value of all taxable benefits in kind including a company car allowance, private medical insurance and life insurance. In 
the case of Mr Sharma this also reflects the additional benefits provided in connection with his secondment to Dubai as described 
above.
•  Annual bonus (cash and shares): the total value of the annual incentive that is attributable to the time spent during 2015 as an 
Executive Director is shown in the table. One quarter of any bonus outcome is compulsorily awarded in shares under the terms of the 
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan that was approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2014. 
•  Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP): the value of any awards that were granted during a period as an Executive Director or which 
contained a performance period that ended during 2015 would be reflected in this table. As the Directors were only appointed in 
March 2015 no awards have yet vested.
•  Pension: represents the value of all employer contributions to any pension plan or cash payments paid in lieu of a pension benefit. No 
Executive Director participates in any defined benefit pension arrangement.
•  Paul Forman is a Non-Executive Director of Tate & Lyle plc. He received total fees of £52,375  (not included in the table above) during 
the year to 31 December 2015. The policy of the Board is that he is entitled to retain any fee in respect of this appointment.

The measures were selected to incentivise a balance of outcomes that reflected the strategic priorities for the Group. In particular these 
were to increase the attributable profit (profit after tax) that was available for shareholders, to achieve strong growth in trading profit 
through continued efficiency and growth in EBIT performance, ensure consistent and increasing level of cash generation from 
operations through working capital management, and achieve certain key strategic objectives that were specific for each Executive 
Director.

During the year the Committee adjusted the annual bonus targets in order to reflect the disposal of the EMEA Crafts business. Targets 
are set in relation to Budget for the upcoming financial year, and were adjusted so that they reflected continuing businesses only,  
excluding Budget for the disposed EMEA Crafts business and any exceptional costs relating to the disposal. As the EMEA Crafts business 
was expected to make a loss and to increase the level of NWC for 2015, performance ranges were consequently increased.
Long Term Incentive award outcome
No awards vested in 2015 that were either previously granted to an Executive Director or arose from a performance period that ended 
during the current financial year. 
Share awards granted in 2015

The share price used to calculate the number of options awarded under the terms of the Coats Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan and 
the Coats Group plc Deferred Annual Bonus Plan is based on the mid-market closing price for the day immediately preceding the grant 
date, which was £0.2525. For awards under the Coats plc Interim Long Term Incentive Plan a share price of £0.345 was used in order to 
reduce the number of shares awarded as described on the following page.
Corporate governance 51 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Coats Group plc  
Long Term Incentive Plan
Awards were granted on 7 April 2015 as 
nil cost options under the terms of the 
Coats Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan 
that was approved by shareholders on 
22 May 2014. The LTIP awards will vest, 
subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions, on the third anniversary of the 
date of grant. The notional value of any 
dividends paid on any vested share during 
the period from grant to vesting is payable 
as a cash sum. Details of the performance 
measures are provided in the table below.
Coats plc Interim  
Long Term Incentive Plan
All of the Executive Directors were 
employed by Coats prior to 1 January 2015 
and participated in the Coats plc Interim 
Long Term Incentive Plan at a time when 
they were not Executive Directors. Awards 
were granted during 2014 as deferred cash 
awards that were conditional on achieving 
three year performance targets over the 
performance period 1 January 2014 to 
31 December 2016. Under the terms of 
the awards the Company had the right to 
convert the deferred cash award into an 
award over the Company’s shares in the 
form of nil cost options. In order to ensure 
a greater alignment of the 2014 Long Term 
Incentive award with the interests of 
shareholders the maximum deferred cash 
award was converted to an award over a 
maximum number of shares on 
26 February 2015. The share price used to 
determine the maximum number of shares 
awarded was £0.345 which was the 
mid-market price on the date of the AGM 
on 22 May 2014. The mid-market price on 
the date of the conversion was £0.223. 
The higher share price was applied in order 
to reduce the maximum number of share 
options awarded than if the share price on 
the date of conversion had been applied. 
The performance measures and targets 
that applied to the original deferred cash 
award were not changed and the original 
terms and conditions remain the same. The 
earliest date that the award will vest is the 
date of the public announcement of the 
financial results for 2016. Any vested 
shares can only be settled by using market 
purchased shares. The Company has the 
right to make a cash payment in lieu of 
providing any shares.
Coats Group plc  
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan
For all Executive Directors one quarter of 
the bonus outcome relating to the financial 
year 2014 was awarded in the form of nil 
cost options during the year. The annual 
bonus arrangements for 2014 were in 
respect of a financial performance period 
prior to their appointment as Executive 
Directors. The awards were granted on 
7 April 2015 under the terms of the 
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan that was 
approved by shareholders 
on 22 May 2014. Awards are not subject 
to additional performance conditions 
but are subject to clawback in certain 
circumstances such as gross misconduct, 
a material misstatement of results and 
malus.
Long Term Incentive awards performance measures

For this purpose Attributable Profit growth is defined as the Cumulative Compound Annual Growth in Attributable Profit in the 
performance period. The Board will consider the growth in normalised Attributable Profit which is Profit After Tax, adjusted to exclude 
the impact of exceptional costs such as property gains or losses and the impact of IAS19 (pensions finance charges). Attributable Profit 
is defined as retained profit after tax and post minority interests.
Free Cash Flow targets are based on cumulative Free Cash Flow generated for each year of the performance period after maintaining 
the Company’s asset base ie operating cash flow minus capital expenditure, adjusted to reflect any disposals, acquisitions or property 
gains or losses.

Total Shareholder Return is the total 
returns to shareholders which includes 
share price growth and ordinary dividend 
payments. The performance condition is 
measured against a comparator group 
consisting of the FTSE250, excluding 
investment trusts. 
The targets and measures that refer to 
Attributable Profit Growth and Cumulative 
Free Cash Flow in the above table are 
based on the performance of Coats plc, a 
subsidiary of Coats Group plc. Awards from 
2016 onwards are based on the 
performance of Coats Group plc. The 
performance assessment for the 
Attributable Profit Growth measure is 
calculated on the basis that removes the 
impact from any variation in the IAS19 
pension finance charge. The Committee 
reviewed the impact of the sale of the 
EMEA Crafts business during 2015 and 
determined that the original targets would 
be maintained. The Committee retains the 
discretion to consider whatever adjustments 
it considers are fair and reasonable when 
considering the performance against the 
targets shown. The Committee may adjust 
the level of vesting if it considers that the 
performance measures do not reflect the 
overall performance of the Company during 
the performance period or if there has 
been a material event such as an acquisition 
or disposal during the course of the 
performance period.
Non-Executive Directors
The membership of the Coats Group plc 
Board has changed considerably during 
2015 as a consequence of the planned 
transition of the company from an 
investment company to a global 
manufacturing business. Three new 
Non-Executive Directors were appointed to 
the Board and five Non-Executive Directors 
resigned. All fees paid to Non-Executive 
Directors during 2015 were paid in 
accordance with the Remuneration Policy 
approved by shareholders on 22 May 
2014. In July 2015 the fee levels for the 
Chairman were reviewed by the 
Remuneration Committee and for the 
Non-Executive Directors by a sub-
committee consisting of the Chairman and 
the Executive Directors. No changes were 
proposed to any of the fees and they  
have remained at the same level since  
1 October 2013.

Review of performance 
The graph shows the difference between investing £100 in the Company and the constituents of the FTSE All Share Index and FTSE250 
from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2015. It is assumed dividends are reinvested over that period. The Board feels the FTSE All Share 
Index and the FTSE250 each provide an appropriate comparator given the Company’s market capitalisation and its presence on the 
London Stock Exchange.

Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2016
Base salaries for Executive Directors will be reviewed on 1 July 2016. The fee levels for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will 
also be reviewed. 
No changes are expected to the provision of retirement or other benefits during 2016.
The 2016 annual bonus incentive opportunities and Long Term Incentive award grants will be unchanged from 2015 and will be 
implemented in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
For Long Term Incentive awards to be granted in 2016 the key changes will be to reflect the performance of Coats Group plc rather than 
the subsidiary Coats plc. The material changes relating to 2016 will be that the Profit measure for Long Term Incentive awards will no 
longer be the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in Attributable Profit but will be the CAGR in Earnings Per Share. Cumulative Free 
Cash Flow targets will also be on the basis of a measure that is calculated before any UK pension scheme deficit repair contributions.

and W R Szlezak from the start of the year until 2 March 2015. There were no meetings held in this period. From 2 March 2015, and the 
transition to Coats Group plc, the Committee members were: D Gosnell (Chairman), M Allen and A Rosling.
The responsibilities of the Committee are set out in the Corporate governance section of the Annual Report. The Committee also 
received assistance from S Morgan (who also acted as Secretary to the Committee), A Speak (HR Director) and B Fahey (Reward 
Director). No Directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration.
The Company received advice from Herbert Smith Freehills LLP in relation to legal matters relating to the Group’s incentive plans and 
considered the recommendations from the Remuneration Committee of Coats plc during the year ended 31 December 2015. Kepler, a 
brand of Mercer, provided independent advice to the company principally in relation to the design and performance targets set for the 
Group’s incentive plans. Kepler were paid fees of £43,000 for time spent and materials used in providing advice to the Company during the 
period to 31 December 2015. Kepler previously provided advice to the Remuneration Committee of Coats plc. Kepler provide no other 
advice to the Company and the Committee is satisfied that the advice provided was fair and objective.

Remuneration Policy Summary
The Remuneration Policy was approved by 
shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 22 May 2014. The policy 
applies for a period of three years from the 
date of approval. This section of the 
Annual Report is not subject to any 
shareholder resolution at the AGM in May 
2016 and is provided for reference only.
The policy table below has been updated 
for context only. No changes were made 
to the policy since its approval and the 
policy continues to apply. A copy of the 
Remuneration Policy, as approved by 
shareholders at the AGM in 2014, is 
available at www.coats.com.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Committee has responsibility for 
determining remuneration for the 
Company’s Directors including the 
Chairman. The Committee takes into 
account the need to recruit and retain 
Directors who have the suitable skills and 
experience to perform in the interests of 
the Company and its shareholders, while 
paying no more than is necessary.
It will need to ensure that any incentive 
compensation for Executive Directors is 
suitably motivational and will encourage 
any such Executive Directors to meet 
stretching performance targets within an 
acceptable degree of risk.
The Committee’s policy is that 
remuneration and benefit levels should be 
sufficiently competitive, having regard to 
remuneration practice in the industry and 
the countries in which the Group operates, 
to attract, incentivise, reward and retain 
Directors and senior executives.
The Remuneration Policy set out below 
applies to all Executive Directors who are 
appointed to the Board during the life of 
this policy.
Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
receive an annual fee (paid in monthly 
instalments). The fee for the Chairman is 
set by the Committee and the fees for the 
Non-Executive Directors are approved by 
the Board, on the recommendation of the 
Chairman. In determining the appropriate 
level of fees the Committee and the 
Chairman consider advice from external 
sources and data on the fee levels in other 
similar companies. No individual is present 
when his or her own level of remuneration 
is discussed.
Legacy matters
Two of the Non-Executive Directors hold 
share options granted under the Guinness 
Peat Group plc 2002 Executive Share 
Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’). Details of 
share options granted to existing Non-
Executive Directors are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
These remain eligible to vest based on their 
original award terms. The share options 
were not granted subject to performance 
targets, although as the options were 
granted with an exercise price equal to the 
share price at the date of grant, the 
options are subject to an inherent share 
price target. All such options are fully 
vested and are capable of exercise in full.
The Scheme contains limited discretions 
including determining the treatment of 
leavers based on the rules of the relevant 
plan and whether adjustments are 
required in certain circumstances (eg rights 
issues, corporate restructuring events and 
special dividends). Any exercise of these 
discretions would, where relevant, be 
explained in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
When recruiting Non-Executive Directors, the remuneration arrangements offered will be in line with those set out in the relevant 
Section below.
Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy table
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation
Fees
To attract and retain a high-calibre 
Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors by offering market 
competitive fee levels.
The Chairman is paid an all-inclusive fee for all Board responsibilities. The other Non-Executive 
Directors receive a basic Board fee, with supplementary fees payable for additional Board 
responsibilities (if appropriate). The fee levels are reviewed on a periodic basis and may be 
increased taking into account factors such as the time commitment of the role and market levels 
in companies of comparable size and complexity.
Additional payments may be made above the basic Board fee if duties significantly exceed 
expectations.
Supplementary fees. Supplementary fees may be payable to the Senior Independent Director, Chair of the Audit and 
Risk Committee, and Chair of the Remuneration Committee.
No benefits or other remuneration will be provided to Non-Executive Directors.
In determining the level of fees for a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee will take into account all factors it determines to be 
relevant, including the skills and experience of the individual and the need to attract Non-Executive Directors of the appropriate calibre. 
The Committee will also take into account the level of fees offered by equivalent companies.
Corporate governance 57 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Terms of appointment
Fees
Under their respective Non-Executive 
Director appointment letters, all of the 
Non-Executive Directors other than 
Waldemar Szlezak are entitled to receive 
an annual fee. Waldemar Szlezak’s 
appointment letter reflected his agreement 
not to receive any fee.
Sir Ron Brierley elected not to receive any 
fee as from 1 October 2013.
Term and termination provisions
None of the appointment letters contains a 
set term of office.
None of the appointment letters (other 
than for Sir Ron Brierley) contains a notice 
period. Removal of the Non-Executive 
Directors would be governed by the 
Articles of Association of the Company.
Sir Ron Brierley’s appointment was 
terminable by the Company on giving 18 
months’ written notice or by Sir Ron 
Brierley giving 12 months’ written notice. 
In case of early termination by the 
Company other than for cause, Sir Ron 
Brierley was entitled to receive a payment 
in respect of any annual bonus for the 
period to the date on which the notice 
period would expire, based either (at Sir 
Ron Brierley’s election) on the average 
bonus paid in the preceding two financial 
years or on the bonus actually declared (or 
which would have been declared but for 
the cessation of office) for the relevant 
financial years. If Sir Ron Brierley is 
removed as a director within two years of 
a change in control of the Company, other 
than for cause, he is entitled to 
compensation equal to two times the 
average bonus received in the preceding 
two financial years. As referred to above, 
there is no current or future intention to 
award Sir Ron Brierley any bonus under the 
staff bonus scheme and he did not receive 
any compensation for loss of office 
following his resignation from the Board 
on 20 April 2015.
All Non-Executive Director letters of 
appointment are available for inspection at 
1 The Square, Stockley Park, Uxbridge, 
Middlesex UB11 1TD during normal hours 
of business, and will also be available at 
the Company’s AGM.
Policy on payment for loss of office
Save in respect of Sir Ron Brierley, there 
are no provisions in the Non-Executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment that 
would give rise to any compensation 
payments for loss of office. Sir Ron 
Brierley’s entitlements on termination of 
appointment are set out above.
Share options
In respect of the share options granted 
under the Scheme and held by certain 
Non-Executive Directors, on a cessation of 
office on grounds of gross misconduct or 
on-going breach of the terms of 
appointment following a written warning, 
options will lapse. In all other cases options 
would remain capable of exercise.
Executive Directors
The policy that applies following the 
appointments of any Executive Directors is 
shown below. A similar policy applies to 
other senior executives to the extent 
applicable.
Recruitment
In order to appoint an Executive Director, 
including a promotion to the Board of an 
executive from within the Group, the 
Committee will offer the recruit a 
remuneration package that it believes is 
appropriate, taking into account the skills 
and experience of the individual and the 
need to attract, retain and motivate 
individuals of the appropriate calibre. In 
determining the remuneration package 
that may be offered to a new Executive 
Director, the Committee may also take into 
account external and internal comparisons 
and relevant market factors, as well as any 
other factors which the Board determines 
to be relevant.
The remuneration package offered may 
include the components of remuneration 
described below in the Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy table subject to the 
relevant limits as set out in the following 
tables.
For external appointments, the Committee 
may determine that there may be 
exceptional circumstances where it would 
be appropriate, in order to secure the right 
candidate, to compensate for lost awards 
incurred by an individual as a result of 
leaving their former employer. In the case 
of any long term incentive awards, save 
where such awards are close to vesting, 
any such award on appointment would 
normally be granted as a share based 
award, subject to such vesting and/or 
performance conditions as the Committee 
determined to be appropriate, either under 
a one-off arrangement or under the terms 
of the Long Term Incentive Plan (as 
described below). In determining the terms 
of any such awards, the Committee would 
take account of the vesting schedule and 
conditions attached to the forfeited 
awards, but also other factors that it 
determined to be relevant, including the 
need to suitably incentivise and retain the 
individual during the initial years of their 
appointment.

Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy table — Fixed remuneration
Salary
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
To attract and retain the key talent 
that the Company needs to achieve 
its objectives.
Salaries for new Executive Directors will be set by the Board taking into account such factors as it determines to 
be necessary, as discussed above.
Following recruitment, salaries will be reviewed annually with effect from 1 July. Salary reviews take account of 
factors including the market competitive level of pay in other companies, average salary increases applied 
elsewhere across the Group, the performance of the Company, the relative skills, performance and talent of the 
individual and any increase in the scope and/or responsibility of the individual’s role.
The Committee’s approach will consider the median level of salary of similar positions in the FTSE250 (excluding 
financial services) for UK based roles to reflect the global scope and dimensions of the Group’s operations and 
the sector in which it operates. External benchmark data is considered only as a reference point and the median 
figure will not be regarded as a target level of remuneration.
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
To provide a market competitive 
level of retirement provision.
In the case of an external appointment, the Executive Director will either be entitled to participate in a defined 
contribution scheme, on a non-contributory basis, with an employer contribution of up to 20% of salary, or will 
be provided with a cash alternative in lieu of any pension benefits of up to 20% of salary.
In the case of promotion of an executive of the Group to the role of Executive Director, the individual will be 
entitled to continue to participate in any pension arrangements (including any cash alternative arrangements) in 
which they participate at the time of promotion or to participate in a new arrangement on the same terms as 
may be offered to an external appointment (as described above).
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity
To provide a market competitive 
level of benefits.
Benefit provision to Executive Directors will be determined by the Committee taking into account such factors as 
it determines to be necessary, with the aim of creating a competitive overall package.
Benefits may include the provision of private medical insurance, ill-health protection and/or life insurance and a 
cash-for-car-allowance.
In addition, the Company may provide assistance in connection with the relocation of an Executive Director and, 
in the event of an international transfer, may provide tax equalisation arrangements.
Executive Directors may also participate in any all-employee incentive plan operated by the Company from time 
to time, up to the same limit for participation as applies for other employees.
Corporate governance 59 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Variable remuneration
Annual bonus, Cash bonus and deferral into shares under the rules of the Deferred Bonus Plan
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity Performance
Annual bonus incentivises key 
individuals to achieve the objectives 
of the annual business plan.
The metrics are designed to 
incentivise key individuals to achieve 
the objectives and targets that result 
in an increase in profit growth, 
strong cash flow generation for the 
Group and individual key objectives 
that will contribute to the growth of 
the Group.
The deferred element ensures that 
the final value of the annual 
incentive is linked to the longer term 
value of the Group.
Annual bonuses will be determined by reference to 
performance, in the normal course measured over one financial 
year.
The maximum annual bonus that may be awarded will be 
100% of salary.
Any bonuses awarded will be subject to a mandatory 25% 
deferral into shares, to be held for a three year retention 
period, under the terms of the Deferred Bonus Plan. Deferral 
may operate so that shares will be held beneficially by the 
Executive Director during this period, in which case dividends 
will be payable on shares during such period. The deferral may 
alternatively be achieved by the grant of a share award or nil 
cost option in lieu of the deferred portion of the bonus, in 
which case an additional payment in cash or shares may be 
made to reflect dividends that may have been earned during 
the period from grant to vesting.
The deferred element of the bonus may be subject to clawback 
(via the forfeiture of the deferred shares) in cases of personal 
misconduct or a restatement of results that mean the annual 
bonus awarded was greater than it should have been.
The Deferred Bonus Plan was approved by shareholders at the 
2014 AGM.
The performance measures, weightings and 
targets for the annual bonus will be set by the 
Committee on an annual basis.
Performance measures will normally include 
tests of both business and individual 
performance.
As an indication, the business objectives will 
include a profit-based measure and a measure 
that reflects cash generation.
The weighting for each business objective will 
be between 20% and 50% and the weighting 
for the personal objectives will be up to a 
maximum of 20%.
The Target or Budget level of performance will 
result in a payment of between 40% to 60% of 
the maximum award. The Committee will 
determine the Target/Budget level of 
remuneration on a basis that it feels is stretching 
and challenging.
The Committee will be able to reduce vesting 
levels if it determines the result of the 
performance targets does not accurately reflect 
the financial health of the Company.
All annual bonus payments and awards are 
made at the discretion of the Committee and 
the terms of the awards may be amended by 
the Committee at any time provided that they 
remain within the terms of this policy.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and opportunity Performance
To incentivise key individuals to 
achieve key long term objectives.
Principally, the objectives are to 
achieve profit growth; sustained 
cash generation and superior 
performance in Total Shareholder 
Return relative to the FTSE250.
Targets are established considering 
the sector in which the Group 
operates and the acceptable risk 
profile of the Group.
To create alignment between 
executives and shareholders.
To retain key individuals.
Awards will be made annually, conditional on the achievement 
of three year performance conditions.
Award levels for a Chief Executive Officer or a Chief Financial 
Officer will be up to 150% of salary, with lower award levels 
for any other Executive Director. Awards may be made to other 
senior executives within the Group. Larger awards may be 
made in exceptional circumstances, but in no case to exceed 
250% of salary.
Awards will normally be made in the form of nil cost options, 
exercisable following vesting until the tenth anniversary of 
grant, although awards may be made in other forms. An 
additional payment in cash or shares may be made to reflect 
dividends that may have been earned on the proportion of the 
award that vests during the period from grant to vesting.
Awards will be subject to malus and clawback provisions. The 
malus provisions give the Committee discretion to reduce the 
level of an award prior to vesting in the event of personal 
misconduct or if events have happened that caused the 
Committee to determine the grant level was not appropriate. 
The Committee will have discretion to claw back vested awards 
in the event that personal misconduct prior to vesting is 
discovered or if within three years of vesting there is a 
restatement of results that means awards vested at too high a 
level.
The Long Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM.
Performance will be assessed over a period of 
not less than three years.
The performance measures will consist of a 
profitability measure, a cash generation 
measure and a total shareholder return 
measure.
The weighting for each measure will be 
between 20% and 50%.
The weighting for each specific award, the 
definition of the precise measure and the 
targets will be determined by the Committee 
considering the balance of strategic priorities for 
the Company for each three year performance 
period.
In addition, the Committee may consider setting 
an underpin condition which must be satisfied 
prior to vesting of an award.
The Committee will be able to reduce vesting 
levels if it determines the result of the 
performance targets does not accurately reflect 
the financial health of the Company.
Following grant of an award, the Committee 
will have power to amend performance 
measures and targets if events happen that 
mean they are no longer a fair test of 
performance, but not so as to make the 
assessment of performance materially less 
onerous.

Directors’ remuneration report
for the year ended 31 December 2015
continued
Legacy matters in respect of future 
Executive Directors
In the event that an executive of the Group 
is promoted to the Board, the Company 
retains power to honour any existing 
remuneration commitments. In particular, 
any long term awards, both cash and share 
awards, will continue to be capable of 
vesting on their existing terms. This would 
include awards previously granted under 
legacy Group incentive plans. This would 
also include any awards granted under the 
Long Term Incentive Plan or Deferred Bonus 
Plan prior to the individual being appointed 
as a director (although it would be intended 
that any such awards would in any event 
comply with the Policy as set out above).
Shareholding target
Executive Directors will be required to 
attain a shareholding, over a five year 
period, equivalent to 100% of salary.
Service contracts of future Executive 
Directors
The Committee’s policy is for service 
contracts for Executive Directors to reflect 
the Committee’s understanding of best 
corporate practice for listed companies. 
However, in the event that an executive of 
the Group is promoted to the Board, the 
Committee may include terms in any new 
service contract which are consistent with 
that individual’s existing service contract 
and legacy arrangements.
Service contracts offered to non-UK based, 
external appointments will generally be in 
line with the provisions set out above, 
subject to any local law requirements.
Executive Directors will be able to accept 
non-executive appointments outside the 
Company (as long as this does not lead to 
a conflict of interest) with the consent of 
the Board, as such appointments can 
enhance their experience and add value to 
the Company. Any fees received (excluding 
positions where the Executive Director is 
appointed as the Company’s 
representative) may be retained by the 
Executive Director.
Policy on payment for loss of office of 
future Executive Directors
In the case of an executive of the Group 
who is promoted to the Board, the terms 
on cessation of office or employment 
would be governed by the terms of the 
individual’s existing employment 
agreement. In addition, the terms of any 
incentive awards made to the individual 
prior to being appointed as an Executive 
Director, and the terms of any pre-existing 
participation in a pension scheme, would 
govern the treatment of such arrangements.
Subject to this, the key elements of a service contract offered to a UK based Executive 
Director appointment will be:
Notice period The notice period will be no more than 12 months (in the case of notice 
being given by the Company or the Executive Director). An Executive 
Director may be placed on garden leave during some or all of the notice 
period.
Payment in 
lieu of notice 
(‘PILON’)
Save in circumstances justifying summary termination, employment may be 
terminated without notice by paying a PILON comprising basic salary and 
contractual benefits. Subject to any legacy terms, the Company will have 
discretion to pay on a phased basis, which will normally be subject to 
mitigation.
Pension The service contract may include entitlement to pension benefits, subject to 
the provisions and any limits set out in this Policy and the pension scheme 
rules or an annual allowance. The entitlement to pension benefits may 
continue during any notice period.
Benefits The service contract may include entitlement to other benefits, subject to 
the provisions and limits set out in this Policy. The entitlement to benefits 
may continue during any notice period.
Incentive plans The Executive Director will be eligible to be considered (at the Committee’s 
discretion) to participate in the annual bonus and long term incentive 
arrangements operated from time to time, subject to the provisions and 
limits set out in this Policy. The terms of such arrangements would apply in 
the event of a cessation of office or employment, as set out below.
Notice periods, salary and contractual 
rights
The notice periods and contractual rights 
on termination that would be included in a 
service contract offered to an external 
recruit are set out above. In addition, the 
Executive Director would be entitled to 
accrued but untaken holiday.
In respect of any awards made to an 
Executive Director under any all-employee 
share plan, the same leaver conditions will 
apply as apply in respect of employees 
generally.
Discretions
In considering the exercise of its discretions 
under the incentive arrangements, as 
referred to above, or otherwise in 
connection with the cessation of office or 
employment of an Executive Director, the 
Committee will take into account all 
relevant circumstances, having regard to 
their duties as Directors.
In doing so, factors that the Committee 
may take into account shall include, but 
not be limited to, considering the best 
interests of the Company, whether the 
Executive Director has presided over an 
orderly handover, the contribution of the 
Executive Director to the success of the 
Company during their tenure, the need to 
ensure continuity, the need to compromise 
any claims that the Executive Director may 
have, whether the Executive Director 
received a PILON and whether, had the 
Executive Director served out their notice, 
a greater proportion of the outstanding 
award may have vested.
Other
The Company may enter into new 
contractual and financial arrangements with 
a departing Executive Director in 
connection with the cessation of office or 
employment, including (but not limited to) 
in respect of settlement of claims, 
confidentiality, restrictive covenants and/or 
consultancy arrangements, where the 
Committee determines it necessary or 
appropriate to do so. Appropriate disclosure 
of any such arrangement would be made.
Corporate actions
On a corporate action affecting the 
Company, the rules of the Long Term 
Incentive Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan will 
apply. In summary, on a change of control 
awards will vest, subject to the performance 
conditions and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, time pro-rating. 
Deferred shares awarded under the terms of 
the Deferred Bonus Plan, which represent 
deferrals of previously earned bonus, will vest 
in full. Under the Long Term Incentive Plan 
and Deferred Bonus Plan, the Committee 
may determine that a demerger or similar 
event shall constitute a corporate action.
On a variation of share capital or similar 
event, the Committee may make such 
adjustment to awards under the Long 
Term Incentive Plan and the Deferred 
Bonus Plan as the Committee considers 
appropriate.

Incentive plans
Good leavers Other leavers
Annual bonus The Company does not consider it appropriate to set defined ‘good leaver’ 
and ‘bad leaver’ conditions in respect of the annual bonus arrangements. 
Instead, where an Executive Director has ceased to hold office or 
employment with the Group, or is under notice, other than due to personal 
misconduct, the Committee will determine whether or not the individual 
will be eligible to receive any annual bonus.
If the Committee determines that a departing Executive Director is eligible 
to receive a bonus, the amount of the bonus will be assessed by reference 
to the performance targets set for that financial year.
The deferral requirement in respect of 25% of the amount of any bonus 
awarded will apply if the Committee so determines.
The amount of any bonus will be pro-rated for time, provided that the 
Committee has discretion to waive time pro-rating.
Where the reason for cessation of office or 
employment is personal misconduct no bonus 
will be payable.
In other cases, unless the Committee determines 
that the departing Executive Director is eligible 
to receive a bonus, no bonus will be payable.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan
A departing Executive Director will be a ‘good leaver’ on ceasing 
employment due to retirement, injury, disability, ill-health, death, 
redundancy or the sale of a business or subsidiary out of the Group.
Awards held by ‘good leavers’ will normally vest on the normal vesting date 
(ie the third anniversary of grant) to the extent that the performance 
conditions are met, and be pro-rated for time.
The Committee will have discretion to accelerate vesting to the date of 
cessation. The Committee also will have discretion to waive the time 
pro-rating requirement.
Unvested awards will lapse in full where the 
cessation of office or employment is on grounds 
of personal misconduct.
In other cases, the Committee will have 
discretion to determine that unvested awards 
will vest (in which case the terms applicable to 
‘good leavers’ will apply). Unless this discretion is 
exercised, unvested awards lapse in full.
Deferred Bonus 
Plan
Unvested deferred shares (which represent deferrals of earned bonus) will 
vest in full on the normal vesting date (ie the third anniversary of grant), 
provided that the Committee will have discretion to accelerate vesting to 
the date of cessation.
Where the reason for cessation of office or 
employment is personal misconduct unvested 
deferred shares will lapse in full.
Development of this policy
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee does not consult with employees when determining remuneration policy.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee remains committed to shareholder dialogue and takes an active interest in voting outcomes. The Committee sought the 
views of our major shareholders before submitting this Policy for shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM.
The Committee may, without seeking shareholder approval, make minor changes to this Policy that do not have a material advantage to 
Directors.
A copy of the Remuneration Policy, as approved by shareholders at the AGM on 22 May 2014, is available at www.coats.com.

The methodology for Scope 1 direct 
emissions is to convert fuel consumed in 
kWh to GHG equivalent using the DEFRA 
published global conversion factors. The 
methodology for Scope 2 indirect 
emissions is to convert the electricity or 
other purchased energy in each country 
from KWh to GHG equivalent using the 
country level conversion factors published 
by DEFRA. The resultant figures are then 
consolidated globally.

Corporate governance 65 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and 
have elected to prepare the parent 
Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law), including FRS 102 ‘The 
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in 
the UK and Republic of Ireland’. Under 
company law the Directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Company for 
that period. 
In preparing the parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; 
and
• prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial 
statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting 
policies;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole;
• the strategic report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
• the Annual Report and financial 
statements, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy.

by the Board of Directors and is signed on

Opinion on financial statements of 
Coats Group plc
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of 
the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of the Group’s loss for the 
year then ended;
•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union;
•  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including FRS 102 
“The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”; and
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows, the related Group notes 1 to 36 the Company Balance Sheet, 
the Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Company Cash Flow Statement and 
the related Company notes 1 to 8. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice), including FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in 
the UK and Republic of Ireland”.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs  
as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, in addition to complying with 
its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the Group has also 
applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Going concern and the directors’ 
assessment of the principal risks that 
would threaten the solvency or  
liquidity of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding 
the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained within note 1 
to the financial statements and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of 
the Group contained within the strategic report on page 33.
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
•  the Directors’ confirmation on page 30 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
•  the disclosures on pages 30 to 33 that describe those risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
•  the Directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval 
of the financial statements;
•  the Directors’ explanation on page 33 as to how they have assessed the prospects of 
the group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to 
be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and 
we did not identify any such material uncertainties. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for

we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those 
standards.
Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the 
greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Revenue recognition
As discussed in the Annual Report and 
financial statements, from early 2015 the 
Coats Group plc activities were reviewed 
by the Board as that of a UK-
headquartered, global industrial 
manufacturing business. We have 
considered the risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition to be more relevant in 2015 
due to this transition. This risk is primarily 
focused on appropriateness of cut-off due 
to the volume and lead times of sales 
made over the year-end and the 
judgement in respect of the point of 
transfer of risks and rewards of goods to 
customers. The revenue recognition policy 
is disclosed in note 1 (K) and the 
classification of revenue in note 3 of the 
financial statements. 
We have considered the revenue recognition policies of the Group, challenged the basis 
of significant adjustments to revenue and considered the cut-off of sales around the 
year-end to assess the appropriate transfer of risks and rewards of goods to customers.
Disposal of EMEA Crafts
The disposal of the EMEA Crafts business 
was a significant one-off transaction with 
a material impact on the results of the 
Group, as explained in the Group Chief 
Executive’s Statement on page 10 of the 
Annual Report. The loss on disposal has 
been calculated by management to be 
$76.0 million, see note 32 in the financial 
statements. This results from operating 
losses in the EMEA Crafts business of 
$12.7 million, loss on the assets and 
liabilities disposed of $55.8 million and 
exchange losses of $7.5 million recycled to 
the consolidated income statement.
We have audited the closing balance sheet of the disposal Group, reviewed the 
contractual commitments and challenged key inputs in the calculation determining the 
loss on disposal. We have audited the $7.5 million exchange loss recycled to the 
consolidated income statement upon completion of the transaction and confirmed the 
reduction in consideration from $10 million to a nominal amount.
Going concern and the impact of the 
Pensions Regulator’s investigations
Significant judgement is required to assess 
the impact of the Pensions Regulator’s 
investigations on the going concern basis 
of the Group, this includes assessing the 
impact of the Pensions Regulator’s 
investigations into the funding gap of the 
existing UK defined benefit schemes. The 
Director’s evaluation of the business as a 
going concern is given on page 79 of the 
financial statements and their 
consideration of the long term viability of 
the Company on page 33. Further details 
of the Pension Regulator’s investigation is 
given in the Chairman’s Statement on page 
4 of the Strategic Report and in note 24 of 
the financial statements.
The Pensions Regulator’s investigation impacts the Brunel, Staveley and Coats UK 
schemes operated by the Group. We considered the appropriateness of management’s 
assumptions and estimates used in their cash flow model, challenging those 
assumptions and considering supporting forecasts, estimates and sensitivities. We 
considered the appropriateness of management’s conclusions over the impact of the 
Pensions Regulator’s investigations through reviewing board minutes, correspondence 
with the pension trustees and met with the legal advisers.

Material assumptions underlying 
retirement benefit obligations
The net defined benefit liability of Coats 
Group plc is $3,249.1 million (2014: 
$3,679.1 million) which represents an area 
of significant judgement for the financial 
statements, particularly in relation to the 
assumptions adopted such as discount, 
inflation and mortality rates. The key 
assumptions underlying the valuation of 
the retirement benefit obligations are 
presented in note 10 of the financial 
statements. This is also identified as a 
critical accounting judgement in note 1 of 
the financial statements.
We worked with our own actuarial experts to test the assumptions such as discount, 
inflation and mortality rates underlying management’s calculation of the Group defined 
benefit schemes. We have compared these assumptions to industry benchmarks and 
prior year rates.
Lower Passaic River
The Lower Passaic River provision requires 
significant management judgement, 
including assessing the likely outcome of the 
US Environmental Protection Agency’s (‘EPA’) 
investigation. Management has set out their 
considerations in respect of the Lower 
Passaic River Study Area litigation in note 28 
of the financial statements. During 2015 the 
Cooperating Parties Group submitted their 
Remedial Investigation Report and Focused 
Feasibility Study to the US Environmental 
Protection Agency, providing a reliable basis 
for management to make an initial provision. 
Subsequent to the year end, and considered 
an adjusting post balance sheet event, the 
EPA issued their Record of Decision (‘ROD’) in 
respect of this matter and management 
updated the basis for their estimate, resulting 
in an additional charge to the income 
statement of $6.8 million from the 
recognition of the provision together with 
the related insurance reimbursement asset. 
The provision is currently considered by 
management to be the best estimate of a 
future liability under accounting standards 
based on the EPA’s decision and current 
information available. Management identify 
provisions as a critical accounting judgement 
in note 1 of the financial statements.
We challenged management’s assumptions used in determining the provision for the 
Lower Passaic River, including: a review of relevant correspondence with management’s 
experts, consultation with independent experts and carrying out testing on movements 
in the provision. We considered information provided by outside legal counsel in 
relation to the investigation and held calls with key legal advisers. We considered the 
implications of the EPA releasing their ROD and concluded it was an adjusting post-
balance sheet event. We audited the insurance policies held against the potential 
liabilities and considered the accounting adopted by management and specifically the 
implications of using the EPA’s ROD in the calculation of the provision.
Carrying value of intangible assets 
and tangible assets
The Group holds $239.6 million of brands 
(2014: $239.6 million) and $5.5 million of 
goodwill (2014: $2.2 million) shown in note 
13 of the financial statements. The Group 
also holds tangible fixed assets of 
$273.0 million (2014: $298.2 million) as 
shown in note 14 of the financial statements. 
Management is required to assess whether 
the carrying value has been impaired where 
assets have an indefinite life or where there 
are indications of impairment. The 
impairment test requires significant 
management judgement and is based on 
assumptions about future profitability, cost 
of equity and cost of debt. This is also 
identified as a critical judgement in note 1 of 
the financial statements.
We considered indicators of impairment in respect of the tangible fixed assets, focusing 
on the performance of the various components of the Group where material tangible 
fixed assets are held. We tested management’s assumptions used in the impairment 
model for intangible assets and tangible assets, where indicators of impairment were 
found, including cash flow projections, discount rate and sensitivities used. We 
considered the historical accuracy of management’s forecasts, challenged the 
assumptions used in management’s models by comparing to industry data sources, 
reviewed supporting evidence and applied further sensitivities.

Taxation
Due to the nature and complexity of tax 
legislation in the multiple jurisdictions in 
which the Group operates, management 
are required to exercise a degree of 
judgement as to the application of 
corporation tax laws and the recoverability 
of deferred tax assets. The Group effective 
tax rate is 54.8% (2014: 46.6%), with 
deferred tax assets of $12.5 million and 
deferred tax liabilities of $33.0 million 
recognised in the statement of financial 
position. Management make a number of 
judgements on the future profitability of 
key components of the Group when 
recognising deferred tax assets on brought 
forward trading losses. The tax 
reconciliation is included in note 9 and the 
deferred tax in notes 16 and 23 of the 
financial statements.
We worked with our tax specialists in key jurisdictions to evaluate the appropriateness 
of judgements and assumptions made by management with respect to their assessment 
and valuation of tax risks, including a review of applicable third party evidence and 
correspondence with tax authorities.
We evaluated management’s forecasts and assessed management’s conclusions on 
the sufficiency and availability of future profits to support the recognition of deferred 
tax assets.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues 
considered by the Audit and Risk Committee discussed on page 45. We have 
reported two new risks in 2015: revenue recognition and the disposal of EMEA Crafts. 
We have reported revenue recognition due to the re-positioning of the Group as a 
UK-headquartered manufacturing business in 2015 and EMEA Crafts as a significant 
one-off transaction. We have refined the risk on provisions to be specific to the Lower 
Passaic River provision in 2015.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as 
a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that 
makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person 
would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our 
audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be $7.9 million, which is approximately 8% 
of adjusted profit before tax; determined as forecast profit adjusted for exceptional 
costs related to the disposal of EMEA Crafts, Lower Passaic River provision and the 
impact of restructuring in Mexico. In 2014 materiality was determined to be £6.3 million 
(equivalent to $9.8 million), which was below 1% of net assets adjusted for the deemed 
pension liabilities. We have changed the basis of materiality from adjusted net assets 
to an adjusted profit measure, subsequent to the merger of the Coats Group plc 
and Coats plc Boards and the change of focus from an investment company to a 
UK-headquartered, global industrial manufacturing business.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee 
all audit differences in excess of $560,000 (2014: $545,000), as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We 
also report to the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified 
when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Financial statements 70 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Independent auditor’s report to the Members of Coats Group plc
continued
An overview of the scope of our audit Coats Group plc and all head office entities were subject to full statutory audit by the 
Group auditor. Due to the geographically widespread nature of the Group, the audit is 
subject to scoping decisions on overseas components; we also regularly rotate countries in 
and out of scope to ensure an element of unpredictability in our scoping. In 2015 we 
brought Tunisia into audit scope in place of a German entity. Our involvement in the audit 
of the overseas components is as follows: the senior members of the audit team and Senior 
Statutory Auditor follow a programme of planned site visits, planning calls and closing 
meetings. The Group auditor also reviews the work of overseas component auditors.
The components were selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit 
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at 
the components identified above was executed at levels of materiality which were lower 
than Group materiality. We included 17 entities in scope in 2015 (2014: 17) which 
included entities across all major geographic regions operated in by the Group, 
including key markets USA, Mexico, Brazil, China, Vietnam, India, Bangladesh and 
significant entities in Europe, including the head office companies in the UK.
Revenue
Audit scope 84%
Non-audit scope 16%
Adjusted proﬁt
Audit scope 99%
Non-audit scope 1%
Our audit provided coverage of 99% (2014: 81%) of the Group’s profit before tax and 
84% (2014: 85%) of the Group’s revenue is subject to full scope audit or audit of 
specified account balances.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out 
analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of 
material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining 
components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
Opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•  the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and 
accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or
•  returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
•  the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Financial statements 71 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the 
Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
•  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
•  otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that 
they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the 
Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the 
Audit and Risk Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm 
that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of  
directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality 
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our 
quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls 
and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent 
partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or 
for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the 
parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.

Financial statements 78 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Notes to the financial statements
1 Principal accounting policies 
The following are the principal accounting 
policies adopted in preparing the financial 
statements.
Critical accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted 
by the Group are set out in this note to the 
consolidated financial statements. Certain 
of the Group’s accounting policies 
inherently rely on subjective assumptions 
and judgements, such that it is possible 
over time the actual results could differ 
from the estimates based on the 
assumptions and judgements used by the 
Group. Due to the size of the amounts 
involved, changes in the assumptions 
relating to the following policies could 
potentially have a significant impact on the 
result for the period and/or the carrying 
values of assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated financial statements: 
• Pension and other employee 
benefit obligations 
The retirement benefit obligations 
recognised in the statement of financial 
position in respect of defined employee 
benefits are the present values of the 
defined benefit obligations at the year 
end less the fair value of any associated 
assets. Key assumptions involved in the 
determination of the present values of 
the defined benefit obligations include 
discount rates, beneficiary mortality and 
benefits in payment inflation rates. 
Changes in any or all of these 
assumptions could materially change the 
employee benefit obligations recognised 
in the statement of financial position. 
 
A sensitivity analysis relating to the 
Group’s major defined benefit pension 
arrangements is included in note 10. 
• Carrying value of intangible assets 
and tangible assets 
The carrying value of intangible assets 
and tangible assets is dependent on the 
calculation of discounted cash flows 
arising from the cash-generating units 
to which those assets relate. Changes in 
either the discount rates applied or the 
estimated cash flows could materially 
change the carrying values of these 
assets. 
• Provisions 
In determining the level of provisions 
held at year end the Board takes advice 
from external experts as appropriate. 
The nature of the estimates adopted is 
such that the final liability that 
crystallises may differ from these 
estimates.
A) Accounting convention and format 
The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union, 
which comprise standards and 
interpretations approved by the 
International Accounting Standards Board 
(‘IASB’) and International Accounting 
Standards and Standing Interpretations 
Committee interpretations approved by 
the predecessor International Accounting 
Standards Committee that have been 
subsequently authorised by the IASB and 
remain in effect. 
Except as set out below the same 
accounting policies, presentation and 
methods of computation have been 
followed in these consolidated financial 
statements as applied in the Group’s 
annual financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2014. 
B) Changes in the Group’s accounting 
policies
Following the change in the name of the 
Company to Coats Group plc and its focus 
as a global manufacturing business a 
number of the Group’s accounting policies 
have been changed:
• presentation currency changed from 
Great Britain pounds sterling (‘Sterling’) 
to United States Dollars (‘USD’);
• operating profit accounting policy 
changed to exclude interest income and 
foreign exchange gains and losses on 
cash and cash equivalents used in 
investing activities;
• exceptional items accounting policy 
adopted; and
• operating segments changed to 
Industrial and Crafts.
In addition to the above changes, 
following the sale of the EMEA Crafts 
business which was completed on 31 July 
2015, the results of that business are 
presented as a discontinued operation. 
Accordingly, prior period amounts in the 
consolidated income statement have been 
reclassified to discontinued operations.
C) Basis of preparation 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are listed on pages 134 to 135. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal, as appropriate, 
or the subsidiary meets the criteria to be 
classified as held for sale. The effective 
date is when control passes to or from the 
Group. Control is achieved when the 
Group has the power over the investee 
and is exposed, or has the rights to 
variable returns from its involvement with 
the investee and has the ability to use its 
power to affect its returns. The existence 
and effect of potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible are 
considered in determining the existence or 
otherwise of control. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to align their 
accounting policies with those used by the 
Group. 
Where subsidiaries are not 100% owned 
by the Group, the share attributable to 
outside shareholders is reflected in 
non-controlling interests. Non-controlling 
interests are identified separately from the 
Group’s equity, and may initially be 
measured at either fair value or at the 
non-controlling interests’ share of the fair 
value of the subsidiary’s identifiable net 
assets. The choice of measurement is 
made on an acquisition-by-acquisition 
basis. Changes in the Group’s interests in 
subsidiaries, that do not result in a loss of 
control, are accounted for as equity 
transactions. Where control is lost, a gain 
or loss on disposal is recognised through 
the consolidated income statement, 
calculated as the difference between the 
fair value of consideration received (plus 
the fair value of any retained interest) and 
the Group’s previous share of the former 
subsidiary’s net assets. Amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income 
in relation to that subsidiary are reclassified 
and recognised through the income 
statement as part of the gain or loss on 
disposal. 
Joint ventures 
Joint ventures are entities in which the 
Group has joint control, shared with a 
party outside the Group. The Group 
reports its interests in joint ventures using 
the equity method. 
Financial statements 79 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Going concern
Giving due consideration to the nature of 
the Group’s business and underlying 
investments, taking account of the 
following matters: the ability of the Group 
to realise its liquid investments and to 
manage the timing of such liquidations; 
the Group’s foreign currency exposures; 
the potential requirement to provide 
financial support to the Group’s UK 
pension schemes, including the 
appropriate capital structure to be adopted 
by the Group in the future; and also taking 
into consideration the cash flow forecasts 
prepared by the Group and the sensitivity 
analysis associated therewith, the directors 
consider that the Company and the Group 
are going concerns and these financial 
statements are prepared on that basis. 
Further detail is contained in the corporate 
governance section on page 62.
D) Foreign currencies 
Foreign currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
recorded at the rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the period end. All currency 
differences on monetary items are taken to 
the consolidated income statement with 
the exception of differences on receivables 
and payables that represent a net 
investment in a foreign operation, which 
are taken directly to equity until disposal of 
the net investment, at which time they are 
recycled through the consolidated income 
statement. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange 
rate as at the date of initial transaction. 
Presentation currency
The financial statements of Coats Group 
plc have previously been presented in 
Sterling. Following the change in focus of 
the Group to a global manufacturing 
business and the change in name of the 
Company to Coats Group plc, the currency 
in which the Group presents its financial 
results has been changed from Sterling to 
USD. Accordingly, the Board determined 
that, with effect from 1 January 2015, 
Coats Group plc will present its results in 
USD. The Board believes that this change 
will help to provide a clearer 
understanding of the Group's financial 
performance by more closely reflecting the 
profile of its operations. 
In order to satisfy the requirements of IAS 
21 ’The Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates’ with respect to a change 
in presentation currency, the financial 
information previously reported has been 
restated from Sterling into USD using the 
procedures outlined below:
• assets and liabilities were translated into 
USD at the relevant closing rates of 
exchange; 
• income and expenses were translated 
into USD at the average exchange rate 
for the relevant period; 
• differences arising from the retranslation 
of the opening net assets and the 
income and expenses for the period 
have been taken to the translation 
reserve; and
• the cumulative foreign currency 
translation reserve was set to nil at 
1 January 2004, the date of transition 
to IFRS. All subsequent movements 
comprising differences on the 
retranslation of the opening net assets 
of non-USD subsidiaries have been 
taken to the translation reserve. Share 
capital, share premium and other 
reserves were translated at the historic 
rates prevailing at the dates of 
transactions.
The change in presentation currency 
represents a change in accounting policy 
which is accounted for retrospectively. The 
comparative year has been restated from 
Sterling into USD using the following 
exchange rates:
December 2014
Average 0.61
Year end 0.64
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose 
presentation currency is not US Dollars are 
translated into the Group’s presentation 
currency at the rates of exchange ruling at 
the period end and their income 
statements are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the year. The exchange 
differences arising on the retranslation 
since 1 January 2004 are taken to a 
separate component of equity. On disposal 
of such an entity, the deferred cumulative 
amount recognised in equity since 1 
January 2004 relating to that particular 
operation is recycled through 
the consolidated income statement. 
Translation differences that arose before 
the date of transition to IFRS in respect of 
all such entities are not presented as a 
separate component of equity. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on acquisition of such operations are 
regarded as assets and liabilities of the 
particular operation, expressed in the 
currency of the operation and recorded at 
the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction and subsequently retranslated 
at the applicable closing rates. 
E) Operating segments
Following the change in focus of the Coats 
Group plc Board to that of leading a global 
manufacturing business the format of the 
segmental reporting has changed to 
reflect the information viewed by the 
Board to allocate resources. As such the 
Group's reportable segments under IFRS 8 
are now Industrial and Crafts. The results 
of the operating segments are set out in 
note 2; the change has been applied 
retrospectively with comparative 
information restated on a consistent basis.
F) Operating profit
The Group has adopted a new policy for 
operating profit following the change in 
focus of the Group to a global 
manufacturing business. The new policy is 
as follows:
Operating profit is stated before the share 
of results of joint ventures, investment and 
interest income, finance costs and foreign 
exchange gains and losses from cash and 
cash equivalents used in investing 
activities.
The new policy has been applied 
retrospectively with restatement of 
comparative numbers in the consolidated 
income statement. The impact of the 
change in the policy on the results for the 
year ended 31 December 2014 is as 
follows:
• interest and other income – Parent 
Group of $9.2 million is now classified 
below operating profit as part of 
investment income;
• foreign exchange gains and losses on 
cash and cash equivalents used in 
investing activities of $18.9 million gain 
are now reported as part of finance 
costs rather than administrative 
expenses; and
• profit on sale of property of $3.1 million 
is now reported as part of other 
operating income rather than 
administrative expenses.

The impact of the change in operating 
profit policy on the results for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 is summarised 
below:
US$m
Consolidated income statement:
Interest and other income
 – Parent Group (9.2)
Administrative expenses (22.0)

There was no impact on profit before 
taxation from continuing operations or 
equity shareholders’ funds.
G) Exceptional items
The consolidated income statement format 
has been changed to include results both 
before and after exceptional items. The 
Group's accounting policy for exceptional 
items is as follows:
The Group has adopted an income 
statement format which seeks to highlight 
significant non-recurring items within the 
Group results for the year. Such items may 
include significant restructuring associated 
with a business or property disposal, 
litigation costs and settlements, profit or 
loss on disposal of property, plant and 
equipment, acquisition related costs, gains 
or losses arising from de-risking of defined 
benefit pension obligations, regulatory 
investigation costs, adjustments to 
deferred and contingent consideration and 
impairment of assets. 
Judgement is used by the Group in 
assessing the particular items, which by 
virtue of their scale and nature, should be 
presented in the income statement and 
disclosed in the related notes as 
exceptional items. In determining whether 
an event or transaction is exceptional, 
quantitative as well as qualitative factors 
such as frequency or predictability of 
occurrence are considered. This is 
consistent with the way financial 
performance is measured by management 
and reported to the Board.
The new policy has been applied 
retrospectively with restatement of 
comparative numbers in the consolidated 
income statement. The exceptional items 
for the prior year are set out in note 4.
H) Property, plant and equipment 
Owned assets 
Items of property, plant and equipment are 
stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated 
impairments. 
Leased assets 
Leases where the lessor retains 
substantially all the risks and benefits of 
ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases. Operating lease 
payments are recognised as an expense in 
the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term. 
Subsequent expenditure 
Expenditure incurred to replace a 
component of an item of property, plant 
and equipment that is accounted for 
separately, including major inspection and 
overhaul expenditure, is capitalised. Other 
subsequent expenditure is capitalised only 
when it increases the future economic 
benefits embodied in the item of property, 
plant and equipment. All other 
expenditure is recognised in the income 
statement as an expense as incurred. 
Depreciation 
Depreciation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of property, plant 
and equipment, and major components 
that are accounted for separately. Land is 
not depreciated. The estimated useful lives 
are as follows:
Freehold buildings –  50 years to  
100 years 
Leasehold buildings –  10 years to 
50 years or over 
the term of the 
lease if shorter 
Plant and 
equipment
–  3 years to  
20 years 
Vehicles and  
office equipment
–  2 years to  
10 years 
Assets’ residual values and useful lives are 
reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at 
each period end. 
I) Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation 
represents the excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the Group’s interest in the 
fair value of the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of a subsidiary at the date 
of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as 
an asset and reviewed for impairment at 
least annually. Any impairment is 
recognised immediately in the income 
statement. On disposal of a subsidiary, 
the attributable amount of goodwill is 
included in the determination of the profit 
or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating 
units (‘CGUs’) for the purpose of 
impairment testing. CGUs represent the 
Group’s investment in each of its business 
segments. 
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 
2004, goodwill is included on the basis of 
its deemed cost, which represents the 
amount recorded previously under UK 
GAAP. 
Negative goodwill is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 
Brands 
Brands with finite useful lives are carried at 
cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight-line method over their useful lives 
of up to 20 years. Brands with indefinite 
useful lives are carried at cost less any 
accumulated impairment charges. 
Other intangibles 
Acquired computer software licences 
and computer software development costs 
are capitalised on the basis of the costs 
incurred to acquire and bring to use the 
specific software and are amortised over 
their estimated useful lives of up to 
5 years. 
Intellectual property, comprising 
trademarks, designs, patents and product 
development which have a finite useful 
life, are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment charges. 
Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight-line method to allocate the cost 
over the assets’ useful lives, which vary 
from 5 to 10 years. 
Financial statements 81 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Impairment of assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life 
are not subject to amortisation and are 
tested annually for impairment. Assets that 
are subject to amortisation are reviewed 
for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment charge is recognised for 
the amount by which the asset’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not 
been adjusted. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are measured 
at the CGU level. 
Research and development 
All research costs are expensed as incurred. 
An internally-generated intangible asset 
arising from development is recognised 
only if all of the following conditions are 
met: 
• an asset is created that can be 
separately identified; 
• it is probable that the asset created will 
generate future economic benefits; and 
• the development costs can be measured 
reliably. 
Internally-generated intangible assets are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful lives. 
Where no internally-generated intangible 
asset can be recognised, development 
expenditure is recognised as an expense in 
the period in which it is incurred. 
J) Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
recognised when the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the 
relevant financial instrument. 
Financial assets 
(i) Available for sale investments 
Available for sale investments are 
recognised and derecognised on a trade 
date basis and are initially measured at fair 
value, plus directly attributable transaction 
costs and are remeasured at subsequent 
reporting dates at fair value. Listed 
investments are stated at market value. 
Unlisted investments are stated at fair 
value based on directors’ valuation, which 
is supported by external experts’ advice or 
other external evidence. 
(ii) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the 
statement of financial position comprise 
cash at bank and in hand and short-term 
deposits. For the purposes of the 
statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts. 
(iii) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and 
carried at original invoice amount less an 
allowance for any uncollectable amounts. 
An estimate for doubtful debts is made 
when collection of the full amount is no 
longer probable. Bad debts are written off 
when identified. 
Financial liabilities 
(i) Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest-bearing 
and are stated at nominal value. 
(ii) Borrowings 
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are 
initially measured at fair value, net of direct 
issue costs. These financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, with 
interest expense recognised over the 
period of the relevant liabilities. 
(iii) Compound instruments 
The component parts of compound 
instruments are classified separately as 
financial liabilities and equity in accordance 
with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement. At the date of issue, the fair 
value of the liability component is 
estimated using the prevailing market 
interest rate for a similar non-convertible 
instrument, and this amount is recorded as 
a liability at amortised cost. The equity 
component is the fair value of the 
compound instrument as a whole less the 
amount of the liability component, and is 
recognised in equity, net of income tax 
effect, without subsequent 
remeasurement. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial 
instruments or other host contracts are 
treated as separate derivatives when their 
risks and characteristics are not closely 
related to those of the host contracts, and 
the host contracts are not measured at fair 
value with changes in fair value being 
recognised in the income statement. 
(iv) Derivative financial instruments 
and hedge accounting 
The Group’s activities expose it to the 
financial risks of changes in foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates. 
The use of financial derivatives is regulated 
by the Board or that of the relevant 
operating subsidiary in accordance with 
their respective risk management 
strategies. Changes in values of all 
derivatives of a financing nature are 
included within investment income and 
finance costs in the income statement. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially 
measured at fair value at contract date and 
are remeasured at each reporting date. 
The Group designates hedging instruments 
as either fair value hedges, cash flow 
hedges or hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations. Hedges of interest rate 
risk are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
At the inception of each hedge transaction 
the issuing entity documents the 
relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item and the 
anticipated effectiveness of the hedge 
transaction, and monitors the ongoing 
effectiveness over the period of the hedge. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when 
the issuing entity revokes the hedging 
relationship, the hedge instrument expires, 
is sold, exercised or otherwise terminated, 
and the adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the hedged item arising from 
the hedged risk is amortised through the 
income statement from that date. 
(v) Fair value hedges 
Changes in the fair values of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as fair 
value hedges are recognised immediately 
through the income statement, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the 
related hedged items due to changes in 
the hedged risks. On discontinuation of 
the hedge the adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the hedged item arising from 
the hedged risk is amortised through the 
consolidated income statement from 
that date.
(vi) Cash flow hedges 
The effective portion of changes in the fair 
value of derivatives that are designated 
and qualify as cash flow hedges is deferred 
in equity. Once the related hedged item is 
recognised in the income statement, the 
amounts deferred in equity are recycled 
through the consolidated income 
statement. The gain or loss arising from 
Financial statements 82 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
Notes to the financial statements
continued
any ineffective portion of the hedge is 
recognised immediately through the 
consolidated income statement. 
(vii) Hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations 
Gains and losses on hedging instruments 
relating to the effective portion of such 
hedges are recognised through the 
translation reserve, and recycled through 
the consolidated income statement on 
disposal of the respective foreign 
operations. The gain or loss arising from 
any ineffective portion of such hedges is 
recognised immediately through the 
consolidated income statement. 
K) Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the 
sale of goods and services, net of sales tax 
and discounts, and after eliminating sales 
within the Group. Revenue is recognised as 
follows: 
(i) Sales of goods 
Sales of goods are recognised in revenue 
when the associated risks and rewards of 
ownership of the goods have been 
transferred to the buyer. 
(ii) Sales of services 
Sales of services are recognised in the 
period in which the services are rendered, 
by reference to the stage of completion of 
those services at the period end. 
(iii) Income from sales of property 
Income from sales of property is 
recognised on completion when legal title 
of the property passes to the buyer. 
L) Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Costs incurred in 
bringing each product to its present 
location and condition are accounted for 
as follows: 
Raw materials are valued at cost on a 
first-in, first-out basis. 
The costs of finished goods and work in 
progress include direct materials and 
labour and a proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal operating 
capacity but excluding borrowing costs. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, 
less estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the 
sale. Provision is made for obsolete, 
slow-moving and defective inventories. 
M) Employee benefits 
(i) Retirement and other post 
employment obligations 
For retirement and other post-employment 
benefit obligations, the cost of providing 
benefits is determined using the Projected 
Unit Credit Method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at the end of 
each reporting period by independent 
actuaries. Remeasurement comprising 
actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the 
asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return 
on scheme assets (excluding interest) are 
recognised immediately in the consolidated 
statement of financial position with a 
charge or credit to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income  
in the period in which they occur. 
Remeasurement recorded in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income is not recycled. Past service cost is 
recognised in profit or loss in the period of 
scheme amendment. Net interest is 
calculated by applying a discount rate to 
the net defined benefit liability or asset. 
Defined benefit costs are split into three 
categories: 
• current service cost, past service cost 
and gains and losses on curtailments 
and settlements; 
• net interest expense or income; and 
• actuarial gains and losses. 
The Group presents current and past 
service costs within cost of sales and 
administrative expenses in its consolidated 
income statement. Curtailment gains and 
losses are accounted for as past service 
cost. 
Net interest expense or income is 
recognised within finance costs. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. 
In addition, pension scheme administrative 
expenses including the PPF (Pension 
Protection Fund) levy and actuary, audit, 
legal and trustee charges are recognised as 
administrative expenses. 
The retirement benefit and other post 
employment benefit obligations 
recognised in the consolidated statement 
of financial position represents the deficit 
or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit 
schemes. Any surplus resulting from this 
calculation is limited to the present value 
of any economic benefits available in the 
form of refunds from the schemes or 
reductions in future contributions to the 
schemes. 
For defined contribution plans, the Group 
pays contributions to publicly or privately 
administered pension plans on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. 
The contributions are recognised as 
employee benefit expenses when they are 
due. Prepaid contributions are recognised 
as an asset to the extent that a cash refund 
or a reduction in the future payments is 
available. 
(ii) Share-based compensation
Cash-settled 
The Group operates a cash-settled 
share-based compensation plan for the 
benefit of certain employees. Cash-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair 
value (excluding the effect of non market-
based vesting conditions) at each reporting 
date. The fair value is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
with a corresponding increase in liabilities. 
Equity-settled 
The Group operates an equity-settled Long 
Term Incentive Plan for executives and 
senior management. Awards under this 
plan are subject to both market-based and 
non market-based vesting criteria. 
The fair value at the date of grant is 
established by using an appropriate 
simulation method to reflect the likelihood 
of market-based performance conditions 
being met. The fair value is charged to the 
consolidated income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
with appropriate adjustments being made 
during this period to reflect expected 
vesting for non market-based performance 
conditions and forfeitures. The 
corresponding credit is to equity 
shareholders’ funds.
The shares awarded under this plan are 
purchased in the market by the Employee 
Benefit Trusts over the vesting period.
(iii) Non-share-based long term 
incentive schemes 
The anticipated present value cost of 
non-share-based incentive schemes is 
charged to the consolidated income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the 
period the benefit is earned, based on 
remuneration rates that are expected to be 
payable. 
Financial statements 83 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
(iv) Termination benefits 
Termination benefits are payable when 
employment is terminated before the 
normal retirement date, or whenever an 
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in 
exchange for these benefits. The Group 
recognises termination benefits when it is 
demonstrably committed to either: 
terminating the employment of current 
employees according to a detailed formal 
plan without possibility of withdrawal; or 
providing termination benefits as a result 
of an offer made to encourage voluntary 
redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 
12 months after the period end are 
discounted to present value. 
N) Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the 
current tax and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on 
taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from net profit as reported in the 
consolidated income statement because it 
excludes items of income and expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years 
and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the period end. 
Deferred tax is provided using the liability 
method, providing for temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes. Deferred taxation is 
measured on a non-discounted basis. The 
following temporary differences are not 
provided for: goodwill not deducted for 
tax purposes, the initial recognition of 
assets or liabilities that affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit and 
differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that they will 
probably not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of 
realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the period end. A deferred tax asset is 
recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future profits will be 
available against which the asset can be 
utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer probable 
that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
taxable temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
and interests in joint ventures, except 
where the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it 
is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible 
temporary differences associated with such 
investments and interests are only 
recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that there will be sufficient taxable profits 
against which to utilise the benefits of the 
temporary differences and they are 
expected to reverse in the foreseeable 
future.
The carrying values of deferred tax assets 
are reviewed at each period end. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates 
to items charged or credited directly to 
other comprehensive income or equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in other comprehensive income or 
equity. 
O) Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of 
qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of 
time to prepare for their intended use or 
sale, are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use 
or sale. Investment income earned on the 
temporary investment of specific 
borrowings pending their expenditure on 
qualifying assets is deducted from the 
borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. 
All other borrowing costs, except where 
otherwise stated, are recognised in the 
income statement in the period in which 
they are incurred. 
P) Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of financial 
position when the Group has a legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation. If the effect is material, a 
provision is determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax 
rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money 
and, where appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability. Where discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a 
borrowing cost. 
Q) Onerous contracts 
A provision for onerous contracts is 
recognised when the expected benefits to 
be derived by the Group from a contract 
are lower than the unavoidable cost of 
meeting its obligations under the contract. 
R) Restructuring 
A provision for restructuring is recognised 
when the Group has approved a detailed 
and formal restructuring plan, and the 
restructuring has either commenced or has 
been announced publicly. Future operating 
costs are not provided for. 
S) Assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations 
Non-current assets and businesses which 
are to be sold (‘disposal groups’) classified 
as held for sale are measured at the lower 
of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell. Non-current assets (and disposal 
groups) are classified as held for sale if 
their carrying amount is expected to be 
recovered through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use. This 
condition is regarded as met only when 
such a sale is highly probable and the asset 
(or disposal group) is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. 
Management must be committed to the 
sale, which should be expected to qualify 
for recognition as a completed sale within 
one year from the date of classification. 
Non-current assets are classified as held 
for sale from the date these conditions are 
met, and such assets are no longer 
depreciated. 
Discontinued operations are classified as 
held for sale and are either a separate 
business segment or a geographical area 
of operations that is part of a single 
coordinated plan to sell. Once an operation 
has been identified as discontinued, or is 
reclassified as discontinued, the 
comparative information in the Income 
Statement is restated.

New IFRS accounting standards and 
interpretations adopted in the year
During the year, the Group has adopted 
the following standards and 
interpretations: 
• IFRIC 21 (’Levies’); and 
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011–
2013 Cycle. 
The adoption of these standards and 
interpretations has had no significant 
impact on these consolidated financial 
statements. 
New IFRS accounting standards and 
interpretations not yet adopted 
The following published standards and 
amendments to existing standards, which 
have not yet all been endorsed by the EU, 
are expected to be effective as follows: 
From the year beginning 1 January 2016: 
• IFRS 14 (‘Regulatory Deferral Accounts’); 
Amendments to IAS 1 (‘Disclosure 
Initiative’); 
• Amendments to IAS 1 (‘Disclosure 
Initiative’);
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 
(‘Clarification of Acceptable Methods of 
Depreciation and Amortisation’);
• Amendments to IAS 19 (‘Defined 
Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions’);
• Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and 
IAS 28 (‘Investment Entities: Applying 
the Consolidation Exception’); 
• Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 
(‘Sale or Contribution of Assets 
between an Investor and its Associate 
or Joint Venture’); 
• Amendments to IFRS 11 (‘Accounting 
for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint 
Operations’); 
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 
2010–2012 Cycle; and
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 
2012–2014 Cycle.
From the year beginning 1 January 2017: 
• Amendments to IAS 12 (‘Recognition of 
Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised 
Losses’); and
• Amendments to IAS 7 (‘Disclosure 
Initiative’).
From the year beginning 1 January 2018:
• IFRS 9 (‘Financial instruments’); and 
• IFRS 15 (‘Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers’). 
From the year beginning 1 January 2019:
• IFRS 16 (‘Leases’).
Other than IFRS 9, 15 and 16 the directors 
do not expect that the adoption of the 
Standards and Interpretations listed above 
will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group in future periods. 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ will impact 
both the measurement and disclosure of 
financial instruments. IFRS 15 ‘Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers’ may 
change the timing of revenue recognition. 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ will change how the 
Group recognises, measures, presents and 
discloses leases. The standard requires the 
Group to recognise assets and liabilities for 
all leases, unless the lease term is 12 
months or less or the underlying asset has 
a low value.

2 Segmental analysis 
The Group has two reportable segments: Industrial and Crafts. Both segments include businesses with similar operating and 
market characteristics. These segments are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Coats Group plc Board (the 
‘Chief Operating Decision Maker’).
The reportable segments have changed in the year and therefore comparative results have been restated on the same basis. The 
previous operating segments of Coats Group plc were Thread manufacturing and Investment activities.

(b) Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans around the world to provide pension benefits. The total cost relating to 
discontinued operations is $0.1 million (2014: $0.2 million).
(c) Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates three significant defined benefit schemes in the UK, namely the Brunel Holdings Pension Scheme (‘Brunel’), the 
Staveley Industries Retirement Benefits Scheme (‘Staveley’) and the Coats Pension plan (‘Coats UK’) which offer both pensions in 
retirement and death benefits to members. In addition, Coats operates the Coats North America Pension Plan (‘Coats US’) in the US as 
well as various pension and other post-retirement arrangements around the globe (most significantly in Germany). The assets of the 
Brunel, Staveley, Coats UK and Coats US plans are held under self-administered trust funds and hence are separate from the Group’s 
assets.
The following disclosures do not include information in respect of schemes operated by joint ventures.
The Group is exposed to actuarial risks including:
Interest rate risk – the present value of the defined benefit plan liabilities is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to 
high quality corporate bond yields. A decrease in bond yield rates will increase defined benefit obligations;
Longevity risk – the present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of member life 
expectancies. An increase in life expectancy will increase liabilities;
Inflation – the present value of the defined benefit liabilities are calculated by reference to assumed future inflation rates. An increase in 
inflation rates will increase defined benefit obligations; and
Salary risk – certain of the Group’s employee benefits are linked to salary and, hence, a faster than assumed increase in salaries may 
adversely impact on the defined benefit liabilities. However, this is not a significant risk to the Group.
Pension costs in respect of these plans are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The information provided below for defined benefit plans has been prepared by independent qualified actuaries based on the most 
recent actuarial valuations of the schemes, updated to take account of the valuations of assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2015. 
For the principal schemes, the date of the most recent actuarial valuations were 1 April 2012 for the Coats UK scheme, 31 December 
2015 for the Coats US scheme, 5 April 2011 for the Staveley scheme and 31 March 2013 for the Brunel scheme.

$9.7 million were extinguished and assets of $0.4 million were transferred as a result of the disposal.
The actual return on scheme assets was $15.3 million (2014: $192.7 million) for the Coats UK scheme, $9.3 million fall in asset values 
(2014: $26.6 million return) for the Coats US scheme, $1.4 million (2014: $8.5 million) for the Staveley scheme, $0.2 million (2014:

Included in the tables above are $185.8 million (2014: $85.3 million) of UK equity instruments, $234.1 million (2014: $217.7 million) of 
corporate bonds, $81.9 million (2014: $44.8 million) of government/sovereign instruments, derivative liabilities of $58.6 million  
(2014: $31.6 million), $32.3 million of diversified investment funds (2014: $Nil), $6.2 million (2014: $10.3 million) of insurance contracts 
and $0.7 million (2014: $4.9 million) of other assets without a quoted price in an active market. All other assets have a quoted price in 
an active market.
For the Coats UK Plan the investment policy is centred around establishing a cash flow-matching portfolio (‘CFM’) and a separate 
return-seeking asset portfolio (‘RSA’). The aim of the proposed investment policy is for the CFM to match a pre-determined number of 
years’ liability cash flows, with additional return being targeted via the RSA portfolio, so that the Plan has a high probability of being 
able to move to a fully matched position at some point in the future.
The CFM is targeted to be low risk relative to meeting the agreed number of years’ cash flows and the focus of the Plan’s investment 
risk will be in respect of the RSA portfolio. The Plan also holds inflation swap contracts to provide hedging against movements in 
inflation. Market implied inflation inside the CFM period is monitored against an agreed set of inflation triggers with the intention of 
implementing further inflation hedging should these triggers be breached.

The US scheme is fully funded and has a significant proportion of fixed income. The fixed income is invested directly to protect the 
funded status of the scheme. Trustees work with fixed income managers to consider the liabilities (including key period durations, credit 
spread duration and convexity) and have created a custom fix income benchmark to match the liabilities and protect the funded status.
The recoverable surplus on the US scheme has been recognised in line with the benefit from contribution holidays, plus annual refunds 
expected from the scheme to fund the US post-retirement medical scheme in accordance with relevant US legislation.
The Coats UK and US schemes as well as the Staveley and Brunel schemes are funded arrangements. Of the other schemes’ actuarial 
liabilities as at 31 December 2015, $100.4 million (2014: $127.0 million) related to wholly unfunded arrangements.

If members of the Coats UK scheme live one year longer the scheme liabilities will increase by $72.5 million (2014: $90.6 million). If 
members of the Coats US scheme live one year longer scheme liabilities will increase by $3.8 million (2014: $4.2 million), however, there 
would be no overall impact on the recoverable surplus. If members of the Staveley and Brunel schemes live one year longer the scheme 
liabilities will increase by $11.7 million (2014: $17.6 million) and $7.0 million (2014: $11.9 million) respectively.
In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected 
unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation 
liability recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in 
preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years.

The triennial valuation of the Coats UK pension plan as at April 2012 showed an actuarial deficit of £215 million, which equated to a 
funding level of 87%. A 14 year recovery plan has been agreed with the trustees, under which contributions of £14 million per annum 
are payable from November 2013 plus £2 million per annum relating to future service. This recovery plan and future service 
contributions will be reviewed at the next triennial valuation as at April 2015 which is ongoing. A triennial valuation for Staveley was 
undertaken as at April 2011 and finalised during 2012, resulting in an actuarial funding deficit of £20 million, which equated to a 
funding level of 90%. A recovery plan was agreed, comprised of an initial payment of £5 million followed by monthly payments 
commencing from July 2012 amounting to £1.3 million per annum for eight years. The trustee of the Staveley scheme has called for a 
funding valuation with an effective date of 31 December 2013. The last triennial valuation of the Brunel scheme, as at March 2013, was 
completed in 2015 resulting in an actuarial funding deficit of £94 million, which equated to a funding level of 56%. A recovery plan was 
agreed, comprised of an initial payment of £5.5 million followed by quarterly payments commencing from January 2016 amounting to 
£5.5 million per annum for 9 years.
The total estimated amount to be paid in respect of all of the Group’s retirement and other post-employment benefit arrangements 
during the 2016 financial year is $41.2 million.
The weighted average duration of benefit obligations is 15 years (2014: 15 years) for the Coats UK scheme and 9 years (2014: 9 years) 
for the Coats US scheme, 13 years (2014: 13 years) for the Staveley scheme and 12 years (2014: 12 years) for the Brunel scheme.
11 Earnings/(loss) per Ordinary Share
Basic (loss)/earnings per share (‘EPS’) from continuing and discontinued operations is calculated by dividing the (loss)/earnings 
attributable to equity holders of the parent company of $50.6 million (2014: $15.0 million profit) by the weighted average number of 
Ordinary Shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust, of 1,400,765,325 (2014: 1,407,431,333).
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity holders of the parent 
company of $24.9 million (2014: $42.2 million) by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year. The 
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares used for the calculation is the same as that used for basic earnings per Ordinary Share 
from continuing and discontinued operations.
For the calculation of diluted EPS, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential Ordinary Shares, being share options granted to employees. There are no differences between the calculated basic 
(loss)/earnings per share and diluted (loss)/earnings per share for either year.

Goodwill, brands and other intangible assets were acquired through acquisitions of businesses.
The carrying value of the Coats brands at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 is $239.6 million. There is no foreseeable limit to 
the net cash inflows from royalties, which are generated from continued sales of thread resulting from the Coats brands, and those 
brands are therefore assessed as having indefinite useful lives. The recoverable amount of these brands has been estimated using the 
relief from royalty method to calculate the fair value and is re-assessed annually by reference to the discounted cash flow arising from 
the royalties generated by those brands. The valuation has been based on the latest budget approved by the Board covering the period 
to 31 December 2016, applying a pre-tax discount rate of 10% and a terminal value including no growth. An increase in the pre-tax 
discount rate to 27% would reduce the value in use of these brands to book value.
The acquisition of GSD in May 2015 generated provisional goodwill of $3.4 million. In addition a further $2.5 million intangible assets 
were also identified (see note 31). GSD forms a single Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’) as it generates cash inflows that are largely 
independent from other CGUs. The carrying value of the GSD CGU of $5.5 million has been tested for impairment during the year by 
comparing the carrying value of the CGU to its value in use. The value in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived 
from the latest budget approved by the Board, discounted at CGU specific, risk adjusted, discount rates to calculate the net present 
value.
Financial statements 99 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015

The calculation of ‘value in use’ is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
– CGU specific operating assumptions that are reflected in the budget period for the financial year to December 2016;
– Discount rates; and
– Growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period.
CGU specific operating assumptions are applicable to the budgeted cash flows for the year to 31 December 2016 and relate to revenue 
forecasts, expected project outcomes and forecast operating margins. A short-term growth rate is applied to the December 2016 
budget to derive the cash flows arising in 2017 and 2018 and a long term rate is applied to these values for the year to December 2019 
and onwards.
The discount rate is based on estimations of the assumptions that market participants operating in similar sectors to Coats would make, 
using the Group’s economic profile as a starting point and adjusting appropriately. Management do not currently expect any significant 
change in the present base discount rate of 10%. The base discount rate has been adjusted for economic risks that are not already 
captured in the specific operating assumptions. This results in the impairment testing using a 12.5% pre-tax discount rate.
Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of 
either the GSD CGU or Coats brand to exceed its recoverable amount.

financial reporting purposes:
Deferred tax assets (note 16) (12.5) (15.3)
Deferred tax liabilities 33.0 39.2
20.5 23.9
At the year end, the Group had approximately $2.9 billion (2014: $3.1 billion) of unused tax losses available for offset against future 
profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of $260 million (2014: $285 million) of such losses. Of these losses, 
$230 million (2014: $230 million) have been recognised to offset the potential deferred tax liability recognised on the Group’s brands. 
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses due to lack of certainty regarding the availability of future 
taxable income. Such losses are only recognised in the financial statements to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that 
sufficient future taxable profits will be available for offset.
The Group’s income tax losses can be analysed as follows:

28 Contingent liabilities and environmental matters
Guarantees
The Group has guaranteed the banking facilities of Australian Country Spinners Ltd, on a joint and several basis with the other 
shareholder. The Group’s liability under that guarantee, which is limited to 50% of those facilities, amounts to $1.9 million (2014: 
$2.1 million).
The Group has guaranteed certain amounts that may become payable in respect of a former subsidiary in Australia. At 31 December 
2015, the Group’s liability under these guarantees amounted to $1.2 million (2014: $1.4 million). At the time of the sale of that former 
subsidiary, in 2013 the Group was paid $0.9 million (2014: $1.0 million) by the former subsidiary in support of any potential claims 
against the guarantee. The Group holds that $0.9 million (2014: $1.0 million) in an interest-bearing bank account on trust for the former 
subsidiary. On expiry of these guarantees any unutilised balance from the $0.9 million (2014: $1.0 million) bank balance, together with 
any interest received on that account, will be repaid to the former subsidiary. This liability is fully accrued in these financial statements.
Pensions
As described on page 4 in the Chairman’s statement, the Group is dealing with investigations by tPR into its three UK defined benefit 
pension schemes. The outcome of these investigations remain uncertain, but may result in changes to the current deficit recovery plans 
for these schemes.
Environmental matters
As noted in previous reports, the US Environmental Protection Agency (‘EPA’) has notified Coats & Clark, Inc. (‘CC’) that CC is a 
‘potentially responsible party’ (‘PRP’) under the US Superfund law for investigation and remediation costs at the 17-mile Lower Passaic 
River Study Area (‘LPR’) in New Jersey in respect of alleged operations of a predecessor’s former facilities in that area prior to 1950. 
Approximately 55 PRPs are currently members of a cooperating parties group (‘CPG’) of companies, formed to fund and conduct a 
remedial investigation and feasibility study of the area. CC joined the CPG in 2011.
CC has analysed its predecessor’s operating history prior to 1950, when it left the LPR, and has concluded that it was not responsible 
for the contaminants and environmental damage that are the focus of the EPA process. CC also believes that there are many parties 
that will participate in the LPR’s remediation that are not currently funding the study of the river, including those that are the most 
responsible for its contamination.
Financial statements 109 Coats Group plc Annual Report 2015
28 Contingent liabilities and environmental matters continued
In April 2014, the EPA released a Focused Feasibility Study and Proposed Plan (‘FFS’) for the lower 8 miles of the LPR. The FFS analyses a 
series of remedial alternatives. The EPA had estimated the cost of its preferred remedy under the FFS at approximately $1.7 billion on a 
net present value basis. The CPG submitted extensive comments opposing the FFS during the comment period.
In March 2015, CC and other companies submitted a petition to EPA, asserting that they are de minimis parties and seeking a meeting 
to commence settlement discussions. 
In February and April 2015, respectively, the CPG delivered a draft remedial investigation and a draft feasibility study to the EPA relating 
to the entire 17 miles of the LPR. The draft feasibility study sets out various alternatives for remediating the LPR with a targeted remedy 
which would involve removal, treatment and disposal of contaminated sediments from specific locations within the entire 17 miles of 
the river. The estimated cost for the targeted remedy ranged from approximately $518 million to $772 million on an undiscounted basis. 
On 4 March 2016 EPA issued a Record of Decision selecting a remedy for the lower 8 miles of the LPR pursuant to its FFS at an 
estimated cost of $1.38 billion on a net present value basis. The EPA’s Record of Decision did not include a remedial decision for the 
upper 9 miles of the LPR. The EPA may consider the CPG’s proposed remedial alternative for the upper 9 miles (for which a reserve has 
been established), or it may select a different remedy. Discussions with the EPA regarding the nature and timing of such a decision are 
ongoing.
The EPA is expected to begin negotiations with PRPs in H1 2016 to design the selected remedy for the lower 8 miles of the LPR. In 
addition to addressing the de minimis petition submitted by CC and other PRPs, these negotiations are likely to involve parties that are 
not currently in the CPG, including those most responsible for the contamination, as well as other PRPs who have previously been 
identified by the EPA and others. While the ultimate costs of the remedial design and the final remedy are expected to be shared 
among hundreds of parties, the allocation of such costs among these parties is not yet known.
As noted in previous reports, Coats has identified a number of insurance policies that could provide coverage for some of the legal and 
other costs previously incurred and to be incurred in respect of this matter. During the period, CC negotiated a settlement agreement 
with one insurer under which a proportion of previously incurred and to be incurred legal defence and remediation costs will be 
reimbursed up to a specified amount. Thereafter, either party could seek to renegotiate the terms of payment.
Based on the mid-point of the range of the estimated costs for targeted remediation under the remedial investigation and feasibility 
study proposed by the CPG, and CC’s estimate of its de minimis share of those costs, a provision of $2.2 million was recorded during 
the six months ended 30 June 2015. A separate provision of $6.8 million was recorded for associated legal and professional costs in 
defence of CC’s position. Both of these charges to the income statement were net of insurance reimbursements and were stated on a 
net present value basis. As at 31 December 2015, $1.5 million of this provision has been utilised. Following the EPA’s issuance of Record 
of Decision, an additional charge of $6.8 million has been recorded to reflect CC’s estimate of the same de minimis share applied to 
(a) the EPA’s larger selected remedy for the lower 8 miles of the LPR on 4 March 2016 and (b) the Sustainable Remedy proposed by the 
CPG for the upper 9 miles of the LPR. The total charge to the Income Statement in 2015, net of insurance reimbursements, is $12.8 
million. As noted, the process concerning the LPR continues to evolve and these estimates are subject to change based upon the scope 
of the remedy selected by EPA, the share of remedial costs to be paid by the major polluters on the river, and the share of remaining 
remedial costs apportioned among CC and other companies.
Coats believes that CC’s predecessor did not generate any of the contaminants which are driving the current and anticipated remedial 
actions in the LPR, that it has valid legal defences which are based on its own analysis of the relevant facts, that it is a de minimis party, 
and that additional parties not currently in the CPG will be responsible for a significant share of the ultimate costs of remediation. 
However, as this matter evolves, CC could record additional provisions and such provisions could increase materially based on further 
decisions by the EPA, negotiations among the parties, and other future events.
29 Capital commitments
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had commitments of $2.0 million in respect of contracts placed for future capital expenditure 
(2014: $3.9 million).

31 Acquisition of GSD Holdings Ltd
In May 2015 the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity of GSD Holdings Ltd (‘GSD’), a company based in the United Kingdom that 
specialises in management solutions that analyse time, cost and production capability in the sewn products sector with the focus on 
maximising productivity and controlling costs. The Group has acquired GSD in order to expand the offerings of Coats Global Services, 
helping customers realise productivity and supply chain improvements, develop technical skills and enhance corporate responsibility. The 
acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method. The consolidated financial statements include the results of GSD for 
the period from the acquisition date.
The consideration transferred net of cash and cash equivalents acquired was $5.5 million.

– the technical expertise of the acquired workforce;
– the opportunity to leverage this expertise across the Coats Global Services business; and
– the ability to exploit the Group’s existing customer base.
None of the goodwill arising on the acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
From the date of acquisition, GSD has contributed $1.0 million of revenues and a loss of $0.2 million (after amortisation charges) to the 
profit before tax from the continuing operations of the Group. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, revenue 
from continuing operations for GSD would have been $1.8 million and the profit from continuing operations for GSD for the period 
would have been $0.1 million.
Transaction costs of $0.2 million have been expensed and are included in administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement 
and are part of operating cash flows in the consolidated cash flow statement.
32 Sale of EMEA Crafts
As previously announced, in February 2015, Coats agreed to sell its EMEA Crafts business to the Aurelius Group for a consideration of 
$10 million receivable in cash on completion and adjusted for the net cash in the EMEA Crafts business at the date of disposal.
On 28 July 2015, Coats announced that the finalisation of the sale had been a complex, multi-jurisdictional, transaction and that 
completion had taken place against a backdrop of increasingly poor market conditions which had affected the trading performance of 
EMEA Crafts. Accordingly, Coats agreed to a nominal final consideration payable to Coats and adjusted for the net cash in the EMEA 
Crafts business at the date of disposal, broadly in line with the original terms of the sale.
The results of the EMEA Crafts business have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the income statement, including prior year 
amounts. The sale was completed on 31 July 2015, the date on which control passed to the acquirer.

Market values have been used as proxies for the fair value of all listed investments. Unlisted investments are stated at fair value. For 
floating rate financial assets and liabilities, and for fixed rate financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than 12 months, it has 
been assumed that fair values are approximately the same as book values. Fair values for forward foreign currency contracts have been 
estimated using applicable forward exchange rates at the year end. All other fair values have been calculated by discounting expected 
cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position
The following tables provide an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: 
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices); and 
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques which include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Level 1 financial instruments are valued based on quoted bid prices in an active market. Level 2 financial instruments are measured by 
discounted cash flow. For interest rate swaps future cash flows are estimated based on forward interest rates (from observable yield 
curves at the end of the reporting period) and contract interest rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the various 
counterparties. For foreign exchange contracts future cash flows are estimated based on forward exchange rates (from observable 
forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period) and contract forward rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk 
of the various counterparties. For equity instruments that are classified as Level 3 financial instruments the carrying value approximates 
to fair value.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are as follows:
– currency risk;
– interest rate risk;
– capital risk;
– market price risk;
– liquidity risk; and
– credit risk.
The Group’s policies for managing those risks are described on pages 118 to 124 and, except as noted, have remained unchanged since 
the beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate.
Currency risk
The income and capital value of the Group’s financial instruments can be affected by exchange rate movements as a significant portion 
of both its financial assets and financial liabilities are denominated in currencies other than US Dollars, which is the Group’s 
presentational currency. The accounting impact of these exposures will vary according to whether or not the Group company holding 
such financial assets and liabilities reports in the currency in which they are denominated.
The Board recognises that the Group’s US Dollar statement of financial position will be affected by short-term movements in exchange 
rates, particularly the value of the GBP Sterling, the Euro, Indian Rupee and Brazilian Real. The Board takes the view that the major 
currencies in which the Group is invested move within a relatively stable range and that currency fluctuations should even out over the 
long term. Cash held by the Parent Group is held in GBP Sterling pending finalisation of the Pension Regulator investigation into the 
Group’s three UK pension schemes.
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the currency exposure that arises on business transacted in currencies 
other than its own functional currency. Such foreign currency contracts are only entered into when there is a firm commitment to the 
underlying transaction. The contracts used to hedge future transactions typically have a maturity of between six months and two years.
Interest rate risk
In 2015, the Group financed its operations through shareholders’ funds, bank borrowings and overdrafts. The Group’s trading 
subsidiaries use a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt. The Group also has access to bank facilities amounting to some 
$680.0 million, of which $457.4 million had been drawn down at year end. This includes facilities negotiated by certain trading 
subsidiaries to meet their local needs.
Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings using interest rate swap 
contracts. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and risk appetite.
The Group’s interest income does not vary significantly from the returns it would generate through investing surplus cash at floating 
rates of interest since the interest rates are re-set on a regular basis.
A reasonably possible change of one per cent in market interest rates would change profit before tax by approximately $3.7 million 
(2014: $4.4 million), and would change shareholders’ funds by approximately $10.6 million (2014: $6.9 million).
Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are excluded from the following disclosure (other than the currency 
disclosures) as there is limited interest rate risk.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital so as to ensure that the Company and the Group will be able to continue as a going concern.
The Group’s capital structure comprises cash and cash equivalents and borrowings (see Summary of net cash on page 111), and share 
capital and reserves attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company.

Currency exposure
The tables below show the extent to which Group companies have financial assets and liabilities, excluding forward foreign currency 
contracts, in currencies other than their functional currency. Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation of these assets and 
liabilities are taken to the Group income statement. The table excludes loans between Group companies that form part of the net 
investment in overseas subsidiaries on which the exchange differences are dealt with through reserves, but includes other Group 
balances that eliminate on consolidation.

Market price risk
The Group has equity and bond available-for-sale investments at 31 December 2015 of $1.7 million ($3.4 million) held for strategic 
rather than trading purposes. The Group does not actively trade these investments and is not materially exposed to price risk.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to reasonably possible price changes for the investments 
held at the year end.

Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas and industries.
Customers requesting credit facilities are subject to a credit quality assessment, which may include a review of their financial strength, 
previous credit history with the Group, payment record with other suppliers, bank references and credit rating agency reports. All active 
customers are subject to an annual, or more frequent if appropriate, review of their credit limits and credit periods.
The Group does not have a significant credit risk exposure to any single customer.
Hedges
During 2015, the Group has hedged the following exposures:
– interest rate risk – using interest rate swaps; and
– currency risk – using forward foreign currency contracts.
At 31 December 2015, the fair value of such hedging instruments was a net liability of $1.1 million (2014: $3.8 million).

All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest rate amounts for fixed interest rate interest amounts are designated as 
cash flow hedges to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The amount 
accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss.

36 Non-GAAP financial measures
The non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘non-GAAP’) financial measures included in the Annual Report provide 
supplementary information to assist with the understanding of the Group’s financial results and with the evaluation of operating 
performance for all the periods presented. Non-GAAP amounts, however, are not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and 
should not be considered as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial 
measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below.
a) Adjusted earnings per share
The calculation of adjusted earnings per share is based on the profit from continuing operations attributable to equity shareholders 
before exceptional items and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on cash relating to the realisation of investments previously held 
by Coats Group plc as set out below.

Adjusted earnings per share (cents) 3.96 3.08
* Cash relating to the realisation of investments previously held by Coats Group plc.
The weighted average number of Ordinary Shares used for the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 
2015 is 1,400,765,325 (2014: 1,407,431,333), the same as that used for basic earnings per Ordinary Share from continuing operations 
(see note 11).
Adjusted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2014 on a like-for-like currency basis (restates 2014 figures at 2015 exchange 
rates) is 2.88 cents and is calculated on a basis consistent with the above. Like-for-like adjusted profit from continuing operations for the 
year ended 31 December 2014 was $40.4 million. The weighted average number of Ordinary Shares used for the calculation of adjusted 
earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2014 on a like-for-like basis is 1,400,765,325 being the weighted average number 
of Ordinary Shares for the year ended 31 December 2015.

1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding 
year.
A) General information and basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention, modified to include certain items at fair value, and in 
accordance with Financial Reporting standard 102 (‘FRS 102’) as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. FRS 102 was adopted during 
the year, the adoption of FRS 102 has not had a material impact on either the current or prior years.
The functional currency of Coats Group plc is considered to be Pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Company operates.
B) Fixed assets – investments
Investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are reflected at cost less provisions for any impairment.
C) Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
All financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at transaction price. If an arrangement constitutes a financing 
transaction, the financial asset or financial liability is measured at the present value of future payments discounted at a market rate of 
interest for a similar debt instrument.
D) Impairment of assets
Assets, other than those measured at fair value, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. If there is 
objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss and the asset is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
E) Share-based payments
Cash-settled
The Company operates a cash-settled share-based compensation plan for the benefit of certain employees of an operating subsidiary. 
Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at each 
reporting date. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
Equity-settled
The Group operates an equity-settled Long Term Incentive Plan for executives and senior management, settlement is in the form of 
Coats Group plc shares. Awards under this plan are subject to both market-based and non-market-based vesting criteria.
The fair value at the date of grant is established by using an appropriate simulation method to reflect the likelihood of market-based 
performance conditions being met. As the Long Term Incentive Plan relates to employees of a subsidiary, and there is no recharge of the 
cost, the fair value is charged to investments on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with appropriate adjustments being made 
during this period to reflect expected vesting for non market-based performance conditions and forfeitures. The corresponding credit is 
to shareholders’ funds.
The shares awarded under this plan are purchased in the market by the Employee Benefit Trusts (‘EBT’) over the vesting period. Coats 
Group plc is the sponsoring employer of the EBT and its activities are considered an extension of the Company’s activities. Therefore the 
shares purchased by the EBT are included as a deduction from shareholders’ funds and other assets and liabilities of the EBT are 
recognised as assets and liabilities of Coats Group plc.
F) Taxation
Provision is made for taxation assessable on the profit or loss for the year as adjusted for disallowable and non-taxable items. Deferred 
taxation is provided in full in respect of timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except that 
deferred tax assets (including those attributable to tax losses carried forward) are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not 
that they will be recovered. Deferred taxation is measured on a non-discounted basis.
G) Dividends
Dividends proposed are recognised in the period in which they are formally approved for payment.
H) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Carrying value of investments:
The carrying value of investments is assessed annually for indicators of impairment. If an impairment review is required judgement is 
involved in calculating the recoverable amount.
Provisions:
In determining the level of provisions held at year end the directors take advice from external experts as appropriate. The nature of the 
estimates adopted is such that the final liability that crystallises may differ from these estimates.

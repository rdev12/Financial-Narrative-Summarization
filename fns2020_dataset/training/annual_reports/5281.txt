ELAND AT A GLANCE
OVERVIEW
Eland is an independent oil and gas company focused on identifying, 
acquiring and developing interests in oil and gas assets in West Africa, 
focused initially on Nigeria.
Eland was formed in 2010 by Les Blair and George Maxwell who previously 
held senior management positions with Addax Petroleum Corporation. 
Since then the Company has assembled an experienced Board and 
management team with over 40 years of in-country experience and 
successful track records in acquiring and developing oil and gas interests.
KEY DEVELOPMENTS
Eland’s existing asset is an interest in the OML 40 licence, onshore  
Nigeria. Production began on OML 40 in February 2014 through the 
re-commissioning of two existing wells on the Opuama field, which had 
been previously shut in by SPDC since 2006.

OUR GROUP STRUCTURE
OML 40 LOCATION
The OML 40 licence is situated within the 
Niger Delta, approximately 75km north-
west of Warri and covers an area of 
498km
2
. The environment in OML 40 
consists of shoreline and coastal 
mangrove swamps to brackish and fresh 
water fluvial swamps. The region is lightly 
populated with the indigenes living in 
dispersed riverine communities mainly 
from the Ijaw and Itsekiri ethnic groups.
Oil production started in February 2014 
from two existing wells in the Opuama 
field. Oil is exported via the Shell-operated 
Trans Escravos Pipeline network running 
from the Opuama field south along the 
coastline to the Forcados Oil Terminal.
The OML 40 licence area has gross 1P 
reserves of 38.2 mmbbls, gross 2P reserves 
of 81.8 mmbbls, gross 2C contingent 
resources of 45.3 mmbbls and a best 
estimate of 119.5 mmbbls of gross unrisked 
prospective resources. Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 4
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Harry Wilson
Chairman
I am pleased to introduce Eland’s second annual report which has 
seen your Company make significant progress over the year on a 
number of fronts. This has not been an easy year but despite 
experiencing delays in operations on our OML 40 licence we 
achieved first oil in early 2014, with production from the Opuama 
field largely as a result of the experienced team we have in Nigeria. 
We are now starting to see the real value of our Nigerian asset.
The focus during 2013 has been on rehabilitating the Opuama field 
working with the Operator (NPDC) to put back in production the 
two wells which were shut-in in March 2006. This has involved 
re-commissioning the flowstation facilities and wellheads as well as 
laying new flowlines and repairing the export pipeline. This enabled 
us to start production in February 2014 somewhat later than hoped 
for but with very pleasing production rates. We have also 
undertaken a major review of the prospectivity of the licence largely 
through the extensive 3D seismic data which has not previously 
been used to identify drilling targets. This resulted in a significant 
increase in net 2P reserves and 2C resources in the report by our 
reserves auditor Netherland Sewell & Associates Inc. We are 
confident of further increases as the operational work proceeds. 
The financial performance for 2013 (a loss of $26.1 million) largely 
reflects the expected increased costs as our operations in Nigeria 
gathered pace. At the end of 2013 our cash and cash equivalents 
were $3.8 million with undrawn bank debt facilities of $22 million 
which have been extended to February 2015. More recently the two 
equity options were exercised in full raising a further £20 million. We 
have also made good progress on securing advantageous tax terms 
which may result in a five year tax-free period for OML 40 in Nigeria.
I would like to thank all our stakeholders for their support and 
particularly the management and staff for their hard work and 
persistence over the year. We have a very experienced Board which 
ensures that the highest levels of corporate governance are 
maintained in the conduct of our business. James Ede-Golightly and 
Gilles Krijger have both stepped down from the Board and I would 
especially like to thank them for their contribution during the 
start-up phase of Eland. Our team is still growing and our aspiration 
is to become the leading international oil company operating 
in Nigeria.
The strategy of Eland is based on the opportunities that Nigeria 
offers and the experience of our management team based on the 
ground. The increasing awareness of Nigeria’s potential is reflected 
in the scramble for assets being disposed of by the majors in recent 
months. We are of course looking at these and other assets and 
look forward to updating our shareholders on this front and with 
further progress on OML 40 over the coming months.

A PORTFOLIO IN A LICENCE
OML 40 is a world-class asset with production, booked oil reserves, an 
export pipeline and plentiful contingent and prospective resources. The 
OML 40 area currently produces light oil with low GOR and has a very 
strong aquifer drive resulting in high ultimate recoveries. 
The OML 40 partnership successfully recommenced oil production from  
the Opuama field in February 2014 through the re-commissioning of the 
existing infrastructure and the re-opening of two existing wells.
OML 40’s booked reserves are found in Opuama in the western, and 
Gbetiokun in the eastern, part of the licence. Our primary contingent 
resources lie in the Polobo and Abiala fields and in addition there are 
numerous prospects and leads across the whole of the OML 40 licence.

History
 ` OML 40 was awarded to SPDC in 1964.
 ` The Opuama field was in production from 1975 until 2006 and 
during that period produced 43.4 mmbbl. 
 ` In 2006, SPDC undertook a controlled shut down of OML  
40 due to community disturbances and pipeline disruption 
near the Forcados Oil Terminal.
 ` In September 2012 Elcrest Exploration & Production Nigeria 
Limited purchased a 45% interest in the OML 40 licence.
 ` The Opuama field was returned to production in  
February 2014.

The Opuama field was discovered in 1972 and hydrocarbons 
were found at 12 different levels. Of these 12 reservoirs, the 
largest four account for over 90% of the total field reserves.  
The reservoirs contain light crudes with API gravities ranging 
from 47.5� in the shallow reservoirs to 37.8� in the deep and 
saturated reservoirs. There has been very little pressure 
depletion over the 30 plus years of production, which indicates  
a strong aquifer support and consequently leading to very high 
total ultimate oil recoveries.
The oil production from the Opuama wells is received at the 
Opuama flowstation where it is, after initial treatment, pumped 
via the Otumara manifold into the Shell-operated Trans Escravos 
Pipeline network to the Forcados Oil Terminal.

FIRST OIL AND HOW WE GOT THERE
 ` Oil production from the Opuama field was re-started in 
February 2014 through the successful re-commissioning of 
existing infrastructure and the re-opening of existing wells 
Opuama 1 and Opuama 3 (dual completion).
 ` Replacement of the three flowlines of the start-up wells. These 
flowlines have been trenched and overlaid with protective 
concrete mats at major water crossings.
 ` Rehabiliation work on the flowstation.
 ` Repair of the 8” and 10” sections of the export pipeline which 
make up the first 12km of the export pipeline as well as the 
24km long final 12” section leading to the custody transfer 
point at Otumara.
WHAT NEXT?
A detailed field review was undertaken in 2013 resulting in a Field 
Development Plan (‘FDP’) for the exploitation of the remaining 
reserves. The FDP defines drilling a total of seven new 
development wells, which aim at infill targets in the main reservoirs 
D1000, D2000, D5000 and E2000. It also includes carrying out 
appraisals with the possibility of developments on three so-called 
intra reservoirs, which carry at present total contingent resources 
of some 8 mmbbl. All new wells will be drilled from a central 
location near the flowstation minimising the environmental and 
social impact, increasing efficiency and ensuring security and 
safety of the facilities.
The development concept is:
 ` Drill seven new wells 
 − Four slightly deviated wells on the D1000 and D2000 
reservoirs, 
 − Two horizontal wells on the E2000 reservoir,
 − One deviated well on the D5000 reservoir.
 ` Appraisal of deeper reservoirs in the earlier development  
wells to assess further development potential and to obtain 
depth control. 
The wells will be drilled with a swamp rig after dredging of the 
existing access canals to enable easy access. After completion of 
the wells the Opuama gross production is expected to reach over 
25,000 bopd.

OTHER RESERVES IN OML 40
OML 40 is an underdeveloped asset and currently has one producing 
field, the Opuama field. The Gbetiokun field has been fully appraised and 
a number of development drilling locations identified, as part of a full Field 
Development Plan.
2. GBETIOKUN
Highlights
Discovered: 1987
Gross 2P: 27.6 mmbbl
Location: 63km NW of Warri
Reservoir Depth: 4,500 – 10,000ft
Distance from Opuama flowstation: 27km to the SE
History
 ` Gbetiokun is located 63km North West of Warri on the 
boundary of OML 40 and OML 49, which is operated by 
Chevron. The field is known as Gbetiokun in OML 40 whilst the 
extension of the field in OML 49 is called Bime.
 ` The field was discovered by well Gbetiokun 1 in 1987 and 
presently four wells have been drilled on the structure (two in 
OML 40 and two in OML 49).
 ` The Bime wells are located close to the licence boundary 
between OML 40 and OML 49 and provided valuable 
information about the eastern flank of the field. The extension 
to the east is very limited with the second Bime appraisal well 
not finding any hydrocarbons. 
 ` The latest appraisal well Gbetiokun 2 was drilled in August 1991 
on the western flank of the field where it found a significant 
number of reservoirs containing hydrocarbons. 
A total of 20 hydrocarbon reservoirs have been identified  
in the Gbetiokun field. The crude is generally characterised as 
having a low viscosity, high API gravities from 39-41� and also 
being under-saturated.
PVT samples were taken in the discovery well and the results  
of the PVT analysis have indicated the presence of good quality 
oil. The reservoirs are similar to those found in Opuama and it  
is considered very likely that they will have moderate to strong 
aquifer drive.
Detailed geological studies, supplemented with development 
studies, resulted in a Field Development Plan (FDP). The field is 
planned to be produced through an early production facility 
which contains equipment needed for oil treatment, pumping 
and gas compression. A 30km wet crude export pipeline is 
planned to join the Opuama-Otumara export pipeline system.

CONTINGENT RESOURCES
In addition to Opuama and Gbetiokun, there are five other discovered and 
undeveloped fields in OML 40, the largest of which are discussed below. 
These fields may provide a conveyor belt of reserve additions as they are 
appraised further. 
3. POLOBO
Highlights
Discovered: 1972
Gross 2C: 21.5 mmbbl
Location: OML 40 West
Reservoir Depth: 6,000 – 6,100ft
Distance from Opuama flowstation: 11km to the NW
The Polobo discovery was made in 1972 based on 2D seismic. 
The full structure was probably not evident from the 2D seismic 
interpretation. However, following the acquisition of 3D seismic, 
Polobo has been upgraded to an exciting contingent resource.
Polobo is 11km north-west of the Opuama flowstation and could 
be easily tied into the existing facilities. The Polobo discovery 
well was drilled to a depth of 9,712ft. Oil was found over a 96ft 
thick interval. RFT tests confirmed the presence of under-
saturated oil with an API gravity of 47�. An appraisal well is 
planned in the near future and, if successful, provides the 
opportunity for an accelerated development with production 
through the Opuama flowstation.
4. ABIALA
Highlights
Discovered: 1989
Gross 2C: 16.1 mmbbl
Location: OML 40 North East
Reservoir Depth: 6,800 – 11,000ft
Distance from Opuama flowstation: 24km to the NE
The Abiala discovery was made in 1989 and is located in the 
north-east of OML 40 near the northern boundary of the licence. 
Using 3D reprocessed seismic in 2009 it became clear that the 
Abiala discovery well had crossed a fault between the Abiala 
North and Abiala South blocks effectively proving up further 
potential in both fault blocks. Abiala therefore has significant 
near-field potential which will need to be appraised. 
Future development wells will be designed to capture all the 
reservoirs within a particular fault block, whilst pilot holes will be 
drilled and plugged back as a cheap and efficient way of exploring 
the near-field prospective upside. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information

OML 40’s other contingent resources are the Ugbo and 
Adagbassa Creek fields. Ugbo was discovered in 1991 and is 
located in the central-eastern part of OML 40. Ugbo 1 
discovered a shallow oil-bearing reservoir of some 24ft above a 
possible oil-water contact. The top 10ft was tested and flowed 
200 bopd with an API gravity of 37.8° and a 5% water cut. 
Seismic analysis poses some challenges, and Ugbo is still under 
study. Currently the hydrocarbon volumes around the well are 
considered relatively small. However, it carries significant 
prospective resources with a best estimate of 15.7 mmbbl, 
which makes it an attractive target to explore further. 
Adagbassa Creek was discovered in 1971 and is located in the 
centre of OML 40. Three wells have been drilled by the previous 
operator, SPDC. The discovery well found two hydrocarbon 
intervals: the shallow C4 reservoir at 4,875-4,910ft, and a deeper 
E3 reservoir at 9,132-9,178ft. The C4 reservoir was reported to be 
oil bearing, but RFTs taken only recovered drilling fluids. The E3 
reservoir was production tested and produced 1,300 bopd with 
a GOR of 1,850 cu ft/bbl. Estimated contingent resources are 
1.5 mmbbl of oil and 294 Bcf of gas. It is planned to acquire 
additional 3D seismic over this area with further subsurface 
studies determining the potential for future appraisal drilling. 
This well is likely to be deepened to explore the potential of 
Adagbassa Deep.

PROSPECTIVE RESOURCES AND LEADS
Beyond the discovered fields is a larger prize consisting of 
already identified near-field opportunities and prospects, which 
can be drilled in the near future using the drilling rigs scheduled 
for the Opuama and Gbetiokun development drilling.

 Oil field
 CR – Oil Discoveries
  PR – Based on 
3D seismic
  Leads – Based on 
2D seismic
 Gas discovery
In the longer term the resource base will be augmented through 
developing leads (additional 3D surveys and detailed studies) 
into drillable prospects. Many of these were already identified by 
the previous operator SPDC. In-house studies by Eland based on 
reprocessed 3D surveys have not only confirmed these SPDC 
concepts, but added additional prospects and leads. The 
recoverable volumes of the prospects and leads qualify as 
prospective resources. 
In the western area of OML 40 the prospects are Amobe, Polobo 
South and Opuama North. Furthermore, there could be possible 
extensions of Ojumole and Tsekelewu (outside OML 40) into the 
OML 40 block. Also, a number of isolated closures have been 
identified but these are generally too small on their own to 
warrant an economic development. The possible extensions and 
isolated closures have not been incorporated in our present 
analysis, nor in the prospective resources.
In the eastern area of OML 40 there are a large number of 
prospects covered by 3D seismic surveys. The central part of 
OML 40 is not covered by 3D seismic surveys. In this corridor, a 
number of 2D seismic lines have been shot. The previous 
operator has identified significant prospects in this area, which 
have been classified as leads until this corridor is covered by 3D 
seismic as well. 
Finally, a number of deep turbidite plays are recognised, namely 
Adagbassa Deep, Polobo Deep, Abiala Deep, and Gbetiokun 
Deep, but these studies are too immature to carry prospective 
resources and require further detailed studies to mature as 
drillable prospects. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT
Les Blair
Chief Executive Officer
Eland, from its formation in 2010, has been focused on building 
a portfolio of upstream oil and gas assets in West Africa, 
particularly in Nigeria. In September 2012 we completed the 
acquisition of the initial part of that portfolio when the Group 
acquired a 45% equity in OML 40, through a special purpose 
vehicle, and listed the Company on the AIM market in London.
Re-commencement of Production
In 2013 our key focus was the restart of production from the two 
existing wells on the Opuama field. This consisted of relaying the 
field flowlines from wells 1 and 3 to the Opuama flowstation and 
the rehabilitation of the flowstation itself.
In addition the 36km export pipeline from Opuama to Otumara, 
where it joins the Shell-operated Trans Escravos Pipeline 
network, was repaired and tested.
In the early part of 2014 we commenced production on OML 40. 
Our initial production analysis has been encouraging with 
average production stabilising at over 3,500 bopd.
Our initial production has been restricted due to multiple factors. 
One of the most significant factors was a subsea pipeline leak at 
Shell’s Forcados Terminal in early March. This resulted in 
Opuama being shut in for most of March and early April. The 
Terminal re-commenced operations in mid April.
As expected with a re-entry and rehabilitation programme there 
have been a number of teething issues on the field with 
infrastructure and the 36km export pipeline which have 
necessitated shut downs of between one and three weeks to 
carry out repairs. Despite these enforced delays the 
commencement of production is a significant step forward for 
the Company. The task now is to improve on the reliability of the 
infrastructure and attain the consistent production levels which 
are achievable and maximise the value of the ensuing revenue.
The OML 40 Licence
OML 40 is a portfolio in itself, located in a highly prospective oil 
basin. It has sizeable reserves and a contingent resources base with 
significant exploration upside. The new competent person’s report 
(CPR), commissioned during the year, was issued by Netherland 
Sewell & Associates Inc. and contains significantly higher volumes 
than previously certified following a detailed re-evaluation of the 
full technical database provided by the previous operator. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 15
The new CPR details gross 1P and 2P reserves of 38.2 mmbbls and 
81.8 mmbbls respectively. Furthermore, we have seen an increase in 
our contingent resources (2C) from 15.5 mmbbls to 45.3 mmbbls 
and a best estimate for unrisked prospective resources of 119.5 
mmbbl. These details have been determined on 3D seismic 
interpretation and information from the eighteen wells drilled on 
the licence.
We anticipate that there are significant gas volumes on the 
licence particularly at deeper levels. In the future we will look to 
source commercial opportunities for this gas.
The Nigerian Oil & Gas Landscape
The past few years have seen a period of dramatic change in the 
onshore licence landscape of Nigeria. The IOCs, which have held 
the majority of the onshore licences since the inception of oil and 
gas production in Nigeria, have started divesting many of these 
interests. The IOCs have either sold, or are in the process of selling, 
participating interests in licences considered as non-strategic.
The majority of the export pipeline network for the onshore fields in 
Nigeria was installed in the mid-1970s and will require to be fully 
replaced in the years ahead. The Nigerian Government has 
provided significant tax incentives to encourage such regeneration 
and redevelopment of the onshore oil and gas sector. 
Onshore drilling activity has been at a low level in Nigeria for a 
number of years. The advent of improved drilling technologies 
provides an opportunity to increase flow rates and maximise 
recovery from these onshore fields. This opportunity exists 
within OML 40 as all of the existing wells were drilled in the 
1970s. Utilising modern drilling and production technologies 
allows greater recovery and significantly lower finding and 
development costs for every barrel produced.
The divestitures by the IOCs that have taken place over the last 
three years have resulted in the creation of a number of smaller 
Nigerian based independents. Further divestitures will increase 
the opportunities for these companies.
Health, Safety, Environmental and Social Responsibility
We owe a duty of care to the communities and the environment 
in which we operate and we stand to be held accountable for 
our actions.
We maintain focus in our communities on their right to good 
health, education and employment in the development of the 
natural resources.
Some of the key deliverables within our community programmes 
are the provision of electricity, drinking water, education, medical 
care and employment, all of which are absent to a large degree 
throughout much of the Niger Delta.
One of our key planned community projects is the provision 
of free electricity to the community surrounding the Opuama 
flowstation. This particular project has the added benefit that the 
electricity is produced using associated gas from oil production. 
Utilising the associated gas in this way also significantly reduces 
the flare gas produced at the flowstation, reducing the impact on 
the environment. This particular community project creates a 
mutually beneficial interdependency between the oil company 
and the local community.
Major activities planned in 2014
Throughout 2013, planning for the 2014 drilling campaign was 
progressed with the preparation of a Field Development Plan (FDP) 
on the Opuama Field. This drilling campaign will include significant 
dredging activities to allow access for the drilling rig which will drill 
horizontal and directional wells to fully develop the field.
We also plan to replace the export pipeline to allow an increased 
capacity of up to 100,000 bopd and we are also considering the 
installation of an additional export route from OML 40. The 
drilling campaign on Opuama is planned to start during the 
second half of 2014 and will continue into 2015. With existing 
production and the planned new wells we expect an 
approximate exit rate of 7,000 bopd.
Outlook
The oil and gas business has always been very competitive in 
Nigeria and in West Africa and never more so than in recent 
years of sustained high oil prices. We continue to evaluate new 
venture opportunities, but our primary focus remains on 
maximising the value of our existing assets. 
I would like to sincerely thank our management and staff, who 
with the full support of our Board, business partners and 
shareholders, have made our significant progress since listing in 
September 2012 possible. I have no doubt that during 2014 we 
will continue to develop a business of which we can all be proud 
and deliver the value that is in OML 40.

NIGERIA AT A GLANCE
Nigeria is located in West Africa sharing borders 
with Niger in the north, Chad and Cameroon in the 
east and Benin in the west. Nigeria is estimated to 
be the most populated country in Africa and 
8th most populated in the world.**
The southern coast of Nigeria, dominated by the 
Niger Delta, lies on the southern Atlantic Ocean in 
the Gulf of Guinea. The Delta is an oil-rich region 
and where the majority of Nigeria’s 37 billion 
barrels of reserves are located.*
Daily production of oil in Nigeria currently exceeds 
2.4 mmbbl per day. 95% of commodities exports 
are attributed to petroleum and petroleum 
products with exports revenue from Nigeria 
totalling a value of $93 billion.**
Nigeria’s other natural resources include natural 
gas, tin, iron ore, coal and limestone.
GEOLOGY
Nigeria is geologically low risk with world-class 
exploration and production. It has extensive 3D 
seismic coverage, stacked reservoirs and deviated 
wells which offer a very high chance of success 
(typically 75-90%). The reservoir properties in 
Nigeria and the oil recovery rates are amongst the 
best in the world. Due to the abundance of oil and 
gas development there is a large established 
pipeline and export infrastructure.

months from the balance of the shareholder option exercised.
 ` Maintained positive progress towards production throughout 
2013 within available funding resources.
Review of 2013
During the year we have responded to a number of planned and 
unplanned changes to the initial budget and plan to restore 
production on OML 40, which was achieved in 2014. The initial 
funding plan and budget called for production within the first 
half of 2013, in order to maintain the drilling programme later in 
the year. The enforced changes, due to delays in 
recommencement of production, resulted in numerous 
reforecasts of the project and changes within the control 
environment in order to deliver the production plan within the 
available funding. Funds have been prudently expended to 
ensure that the progress towards first oil is maintained, despite 
the delays which were beyond the Company’s control.
The Group performance in 2013 was significantly impacted by 
the delay in securing initial production from OML 40. The delay 
in production resulted mainly from contracting and procurement 
issues throughout the year. This also forced a change in planning 
activity and a change to the original drilling programme. The 
Company, by effecting the change to the drilling programme, in 
conjunction with rescheduling of other planned expenditures, 
managed to conserve cash to focus all resources on returning 
production to OML 40.
The loss in 2013 of $26.1 million was mainly attributable to the 
increase in operating expenses during the year. This increase 
of $12.2 million to $16.5 million related largely to operating 
expenses in Nigeria. This included technical studies and 
in-country resources reviewing new opportunities. 
Administrative expenses in the year of $8.4 million have 
reduced by $0.3 million from the previous year due to 
lower consulting costs.
The Group began the year with cash and cash equivalents of 
$24.5 million and during 2013 used $19.4 million. This is mainly 
attributable to funding the operating expenses in Nigeria and 
the capital expenditure for replacement parts and repair 
enhancements in the flowstation and export pipeline, resulting 
in capital additions totalling $6.1 million in the year.
The new decommissioning study performed during 2013 by 
RPS provided the Group with the first updated 
decommissioning study post-OML 40 acquisition. This study 
has largely resulted in a reduction in the decommissioning 
provision of $6.7 million.
During 2013 the Company received a non-cash dividend of 
$6.5 million from Westport Oil Ltd, a wholly-owned Jersey 
subsidiary. Payment of this dividend gave rise to a minimal tax 
charge in 2013 of $0.3 million.
Eland upgraded and installed new accounting and business 
management software which was rolled out to the whole 
group and is being used both in the UK and Nigeria. Included 
within this system are a procurement and management 
module which has improved the efficiency of the process and 
visibility of all the transactions. This system has expandable 
modules providing both project management and contracts 
management which will be invaluable during the more 
complex drilling phase of the OML 40 development.
FINANCIAL REVIEW Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 19
In accordance with the obligations under the Standard Chartered 
Bank debt facility we rationalised our banking relationships 
across the group. This has provided greater visibility to all 
transactions and has improved the speed and efficiency of 
cross-border money movements.
A review of the functional currency of Eland Oil & Gas PLC was 
undertaken during 2013 in accordance with IAS 21. The outcome 
of this review determined that a change in functional currency 
from Sterling to US Dollars was appropriate, and subsequently 
the financial statements of Eland Oil & Gas PLC have been 
prepared on this basis.
In summary 2013 has been a year of challenges and changes as we 
developed and redeveloped the plans on OML 40 towards 
establishing production. The key success has been managing the 
revised programmes within the resources available to the Company. 
2014 Financial Outlook
2014 has already delivered the key milestone of production on 
OML 40 and this delivery is the main testament to the efforts by 
the Company in 2013. 
During the first quarter the Company secured an extension to the 
debt facility with Standard Chartered Bank. The existing facility of 
$22 million remains undrawn at this time and subject to the 
conditions precedent in note 15 of the financial statements. This 
facility has been extended through February 2015. This facility and 
extension provides the additional funding required to allow the 
commencement of the planned drilling programme in 2014. The 
Company will seek to replace this facility prior to the expiry date of 
February 2015 with a reserve-based lending facility and increase 
the debt level above the current $22 million to be in line with the 
revised CPR. The revised CPR indicates a 195% increase in 
discounted net asset value which, in management’s opinion, 
should provide the opportunity to double the debt level subject to 
market conditions. Securing this new and increased facility will 
ensure that the drilling programme for 2014/2015 can be 
completed in full.
The Group has also entered into discussions with relevant 
government departments in Nigeria about its tax status. Good 
progress has been made and the Group expects to benefit from 
a significant reduction in underlying tax rates. This fiscal 
development will support an increase in the planned investment 
and accelerated development of the 2P production profile in 
OML 40.
The Company also exercised the Shareholder options in early 
2014. This has provided it with the additional resource of 
£16 million, with a further £4 million due to be received over the 
next 3 months, that is being employed to ensure that the 
Company can capitalise on opportunities and incentives as they 
become available.
The recent events within the Nigerian E&P sector ensure that 
this remains an exciting and vibrant market sector. Eland is well 
placed for the future as part of this market.

The Company have outlined below the Key Performance Indicators which 
will be used to provide an understanding of the development and 
performance of the business.
The Company has yet to establish full production on OML 40 and therefore 
a number of the key indicators have been impacted by this delay.
RESERVES AND RESOURCES
The Company had an initial reserves and 
resources base for OML 40 in 2012. This 
position was re-evaluated through detailed 
study and seismic re-processing during 
2013. The results are shown in the graphs 
below for both reserves and resources and 
are compared to the 2012 position.
This indicator highlights the increase in the 
net reserves and resources base in the 
business which provides the majority of 
the Net Asset value within the Company.
The Company had planned to be in 
production during 2013, however 
operational issues delayed this until 
February 2014. A key indicator for the 
business is production performance year 
on year and as compared to Budget.  
In this regard the Company did not  
achieve the target.
Included within the production section is a 
cost control metric over produced volume. 
This is measured in Operating Costs per 
Barrel of Oil produced. The key target is to 
improve the efficiency of production with 
lower per unit operating costs.
The key financial metrics for the business 
include comparison for Revenue, EBITDA 
and Cash Flow (before Capex)
The tables above show the comparison to 
2012 Actual, 2013 Actual and 2013 
planned performance.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
PRINCIPAL RISK DETAIL MITIGATION
Exploration & 
Appraisal Risk
The Group’s strategy is driven by the acquisition, 
exploration and development of oil and gas assets in 
Nigeria. There are risks inherent in exploration and 
development of oil & gas reserves and resources. 
Appraisal results for discoveries are also uncertain. 
Exploration, appraisal and development activities, 
involving the drilling of wells within a field, may be 
unpredictable and may not result in the outcome 
planned, targeted or predicted. Only by extensive 
testing can the properties of the entire field  
be understood.
The Group has a very experienced management team with 
considerable technical experience in Nigeria.
The technical programmes and budgets are the 
responsibility of the Technical & Reserves Committee of 
the Board and a rigorous review process is undertaken 
by the committee when reviewing and approving the 
work programmes.
Corporate 
Governance &  
Ethical Conduct
The Group operates in West Africa and in Nigeria in 
particular. Nigeria is one of the highest ranking countries  
in the OECD table for risk of Bribery and Corruption.
The Group has introduced a Code of Conduct manual 
which provides for full compliance and transparency 
throughout the groups operations and has obtained 
membership of the QCA (Quoted Companies Alliance).
Plans are in place to introduce a full programme of 
compliance and training for the UK Anti-Bribery Act 
and the US FCPA.
Environmental 
Risks
Pollution arising from drilling and/or production 
operations, which could result in loss of reputation, 
financial loss and the risk of loss of life due to process or 
equipment failure.
The Group operates on an industry best practice basis 
for all drilling and production operations. The Group 
performed a full EIA on OML 40 prior to the 
acquisition and prior to any remedial work being 
undertaken on existing facilities in OML 40. The Group 
has developed a system and process to plan drilling 
operations with all contractors and suppliers prior to 
arrival at each well location. 
Health & Safety A significant event could impact the reputation of the 
Group and/or the safety of the Group’s employees 
and contractors. The Group operates in Nigeria which 
has experienced incidents of robbery and kidnap in 
recent years.
The Group performs a full security review and risk 
assessment for each full time and temporary location in 
which it operates. The Group also fully engages with the 
host communities in which it operates to minimise the 
risk to employees and equipment in these areas. The 
Group has a detailed security plan in place for each site 
and these plans are continually reviewed as the risk 
levels change. A risk management plan is prepared for 
each project prior to any active operations.
Loss of Key 
Employees
Loss of key individuals could cause a delay or impact on 
the Group’s plans and operations.
The Group has a competitive compensation package that 
is reflective of market conditions for these key roles and is 
constantly under review as conditions change. The Group 
operates a long-term incentive plan for key employees. 
The Group has also undertaken a succession planning 
review of these key roles.
Oil Price A significant fluctuation of the oil price could have an 
impact on the Group’s plans and expected returns.
The Group is focused on effective working capital 
management to ensure that programmes and plans are 
achieved. These plans are under constant review and will 
be delivered to the extent that sufficient liquidity is 
maintained within the Group.
Community 
Relations
Host communities could cause disruption to operations 
and adversely impact production.
The Group works closely with all host communities to 
ensure that engagement is achieved at all levels. 
Agreements with host communities are in place or 
under negotiation to ensure harmonious working 
relationships. The Group is also committed to a number 
of community related projects to enhance the 
wellbeing of these host communities.
The Directors are responsible for the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management activities 
and internal control processes. As a participant in the upstream oil and gas industry, the Group 
is exposed to a wide range of risks in the conduct of its operations. 
A summary of the Group’s key risks as identified by the management are outlined within this 
report together with the mitigation plans currently employed by the Group. The responsibility 
for risk review and management remains a function of the full Board.
The process of risk management is continually reviewed by the Board and management and 
complies with the practice as set out in the QCA guidelines. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information

PRINCIPAL RISK DETAIL MITIGATION
Production 
Operations
The planned production operations involve risks common 
to the industry, including oil spills, pipeline disruption, oil 
storage and terminating, explosions, fires, equipment 
damage or failure, natural disasters. In the event that any 
of these occur, environmental damage, injury to persons 
and loss of life or failure to produce oil could result.
The Group employs an experienced management team 
with a proven track record in managing oil and gas 
production and drilling operations throughout West Africa 
and in particular in Nigeria. Contingency plans are in place 
to allow oil production to continue should there be a 
prolonged disruption to the producers, facilities, pipeline 
or other disruptions impacting oil evacuation.

The Group’s business necessarily involves significant 
capital expenditure. If the Group is required to provide 
further capital in pursuit of additional opportunities, or 
fully develop OML 40 within the planned time frame, the 
Group will have a need to seek further external debt or 
future equity financing. There is no guarantee that such 
additional financing, if required, will be available on 
acceptable terms at the relevant time. Furthermore any 
additional debt financing may involve restrictive 
covenants, which may limit or affect the Group’s 
operating flexibility.
The Group currently have access to sufficient cash 
resources and debt to initiate the development of OML 40. 
An extension to the existing debt facility and an expansion 
of this facility would be required to fully exploit the 2P 
resources within the planned time frame. However, should 
such debt sources be unavailable to the Group, the 2P 
resources can still be fully developed but in a much 
extended time frame. On execution of the planned 
activities, it is anticipated that OML 40 can be fully 
developed utilising the cash flow from operations. The 
Group remains focused on new opportunities and will 
review and evaluate these opportunities in line with the 
funding available to pursue these ventures at the 
appropriate time in the market.
Licensing and 
other regulatory 
requirements
The Group’s direct and/or indirect intended future 
operations will be subject to mineral leases, petroleum 
leases, licences, production sharing contracts, 
regulations and approvals of governmental authorities 
for exploration, development, construction, operation, 
production, marketing, pricing, transportation and 
storage of oil, taxation, and environmental and health 
and safety matters. The Group cannot guarantee that 
such documents applied for will be granted or, if 
granted, will not be subject to potentially onerous 
conditions. Any changes to exploration, exploration and 
production, or production licences, regulations and 
approvals, or their availability to the Group or its 
associated companies may adversely affect the Groups 
assets, plans, targets or projections.
The Group’s activities and operations are subject to 
various rules, regulations, laws and custom in all countries 
in which we are present. The Group always will remain 
compliant with these rules, laws and regulations when 
undertaking its activities and works to respect local 
customs in these areas. The Group has employed a highly 
skilled team to manage the activities and mitigate any 
negative impact such changes in rules, laws, regulations or 
customs may have on existing or future operations.
Increase in 
drilling costs and 
the availability of 
drilling 
equipment
The oil and gas industry historically has experienced 
periods of rapid cost increases. Increases in the cost of 
exploration and development would affect the Group’s 
ability to invest and to purchase or hire equipment, 
supplies and services. In addition, the availability of 
drilling rigs and other equipment and services is 
affected by the level and location of drilling activity 
around the world. An increase in drilling operations 
outside the Group’s intended area of operations may 
reduce the availability of equipment and services to the 
Group and to the companies with which it operates. The 
reduced availability of equipment and services may 
delay the Group’s ability, directly or indirectly, to exploit 
reserves and adversely affect the Group’s operations 
and profitability.
The Group’s management is constantly monitoring the 
market situation with regard to drilling equipment and 
services. The opportunities to exploit existing assets rely 
upon securing the necessary rigs, equipment and services 
in a timely manner. The Group has also initiated a number 
of remedial action plans to provide additional 
opportunities to secure equipment and services if these 
are not available in the market within a reasonable time 
frame.
Fiscal changes Adverse changes in fiscal terms could impact the Group’s 
operations and profitability.
The Group’s management reviews all proposed changes to 
fiscal terms in the areas in which it operates and actively 
participates in industry forums to promote transparency 
and inward investment in the area of operations.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 28
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The UK Corporate Governance Code
Companies listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange are required to comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Eland Oil & Gas PLC’s shares are traded on AIM and as such, the Company is not subject to the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code on corporate governance, nor is it required to disclose its specific policies in relation to corporate governance. 
However, as a publicly quoted company, the Company will maintain appropriate standards of corporate governance.
The UK Corporate Governance Code represents the ‘gold standard’. However, the UK Corporate Governance Code was not 
designed with smaller companies in mind. Adherence to the full UK Corporate Governance Code is often impractical for smaller 
companies. In the past, in the absence of an alternative code, many AIM companies have adopted the UK Corporate Governance 
Code “to the extent applicable”.
In July 2005, the QCA introduced a simple set of guidelines for corporate governance for AIM companies, which were updated in 
July 2007 and again in September 2010. According to the QCA, the guidelines have been devised in consultation with a number of 
significant institutional smaller company investors.
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance and the Company holds membership of the QCA and 
complies with the QCA Guidelines and the main provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, insofar as is practicable to do 
so for a company of Eland’s current size and stage of development, save in relation to certain of the Directors, who will not be 
independent because of the grant or proposed grant of options to them by the Company.
The Board of Directors operates within the framework described below.
Table of Committees
The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Company’s strategy, budgets and corporate actions. Board 
meetings are held at least every two months and at such other times as the Directors deem necessary.
The Company has appointed Robert Lambert as the Company’s Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
The Board has created a Remuneration Committee, an Audit Committee, a Technical and Reserves Committee and a Nomination 
Committee where the current composition and responsibilities of the committees are as follows:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of Louis Castro as Chairman, Robert Lambert and Harry Wilson.
It meets at least twice each year and is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Company is properly 
monitored and reported on and for meeting with the auditor and reviewing findings of the audit with the external auditor.
It is authorised to seek any information it properly requires from any employee and may ask questions of any employee. It meets 
with the auditor at least twice a year without any members of management being present and is also responsible for considering 
and making recommendations regarding the identity and remuneration of such auditor.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of Russell Harvey as Chairman and Harry Wilson, Andrew Bartlett and Louis Castro.
It meets at least once each year and considers and recommends to the Board the framework for the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors of the Company and any other senior management.
It further considers and recommends to the Board the total individual remuneration package of each Executive Director including 
bonuses, incentive payments and share options or other share awards. In addition, subject to existing contractual obligations, it 
reviews the structure of all share incentive plans for approval by the Boards and, for each such plan, recommends whether awards 
are made and, if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards to Executive Directors and the performance targets 
to be used. No Director is involved in decisions concerning his own remuneration.
Technical and Reserves Committee
The Technical and Reserves Committee consists of Robert Lambert as Chairman and Andrew Bartlett, Louis Castro and 
Russell Harvey.
The committee meets at least twice a year and is responsible for reviewing the technical performance and plans of the Company 
and to review and approve the annual reserves audit to be performed by a competent technical auditor. The committee is 
responsible for the selection and appointment of the technical auditor based on the recommendation provided by the Company 
or independently sourced by the committee. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 29
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee consists of Harry Wilson as committee Chairman and Robert Lambert and Russell Harvey.
The Nomination Committee meets at least once each year and considers the selection and re-appointment of Directors. It 
identifies and nominates candidates to all Board vacancies and regularly reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board 
(including the skills, knowledge and experience) and makes recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes.
The Company has adopted a share dealing code (based on the AIM Rules) and the Company takes all proper and reasonable steps 
to ensure compliance by the Directors and relevant employees.
The Board is also responsible for ensuring the Company’s compliance with all applicable anti-corruption legislation, including, but 
not limited to, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977. The Company complies and always has 
complied with all applicable anti-corruption laws. In view of the requirement in the UK Bribery Act 2010 for relevant companies to 
have adequate anti-bribery procedures, the Company has devised and implemented a suite of anti-corruption policies and 
procedures designed to prevent corruption by anyone working on its behalf. The Company has adopted a ‘zero tolerance’ 
approach to corruption and is committed to ethical business practices.

Internal Control
The Company has introduced policies on internal control and corporate governance. These have been prepared in order to ensure that:
 ` proper business records are maintained and reported on, which might reasonably affect the conduct of the business; 
 ` monitoring procedures for the performance of the Group are presented to the Board at regular intervals; 
 ` budget proposals are submitted to the Local Board no later than two months before the start of each financial year; 
 ` budget proposals are submitted to the Board no later than one month before the start of each financial year; 
 ` accounting policies and practices suitable for the Group’s activities are followed in preparing the financial statements; 
 ` the Group is provided with general accounting, administrative and secretarial services as may reasonably be required; and 
 ` interim and annual accounts are prepared and submitted in time to enable the Group to meet statutory filing deadlines.
Communication with Shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given a high priority by the Board of Directors who take responsibility for ensuring that 
a satisfactory dialogue takes place. This is achieved through its Annual Report, Interim Report and comprehensive website  
(www.elandoilandgas.com). There is also a regular dialogue between the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and 
institutional investors and other financial institutions in addition to the required public announcements. A constant and up-to-date 
information flow is maintained on the website containing all press announcements and financial reports. Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 30
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and have also chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements under IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU. Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 ` properly select and apply accounting policies;
 ` present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
 ` provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 ` make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 ` the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 ` the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 31
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) is comprised of Russell Harvey (Chairman), Louis Castro, Henry Wilson and Andrew 
Bartlett. The Committee is responsible for determining and making recommendations to the Board on the structure and overall 
remuneration package for Executive Directors and reviews the remuneration for the Company’s senior employees. It is responsible for 
determining individual remuneration packages including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and  
share options.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Board on the basis of a proposal prepared by the Remuneration 
Committee. No Director may participate in any meeting at which discussion or any decision regarding his own remuneration takes 
place. The Remuneration Committee also administers the Company’s share option and share award schemes. The Committee keeps 
itself fully informed of all relevant developments and best market practice in the field of remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee is permitted to appoint independent advisers to assist in the determination of the remuneration.
In April 2014 Russell Harvey took over from Harry Wilson as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The members of the 
Remuneration Committee are as stated above.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee, in forming its policy on remuneration, has given due consideration to the needs of the Company, the shareholders and 
the provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’). The ongoing policy of the Committee is that the overall 
remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high quality employees capable of achieving 
the Group’s objectives and to incentivise them effectively, so as to deliver long-term shareholder value.
It is the aim of the Committee to reward key employees on a basis which is linked, to a significant extent, to the performance of the 
individual and of the Company. Also, the remuneration is subject to the broader principle that their remuneration should be competitive 
with that received by professionals of comparable companies.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package:
 ` Base salary 
 ` Employee benefits 
 ` Performance-related cash bonus 
 ` Performance-related share award 
 ` Long-term share options 
The Group bonus performance measurement for Executive Directors and staff is based upon personal performance, linked to personal 
development plans and Group performance achieving the key operational targets. The key operational targets relate to production, 
reserves and budget performance. The Group continues to monitor key metrics on share performance versus its peer group companies 
and key indices such as the AIM 50, and AIM E&P Indices.
The share option plans also have key performance measurements in place which include achievement of a significant increase in share 
price in addition to a vesting period of between two and three years in order for the options to be exercised.
Base Salary
The policy is to pay a fair and reasonable base salary, taking into account comparable salaries for similar roles in similar 
companies. The base salary is reviewed annually by the Committee having regard to the performance of the Company, individual 
performance, market data, levels of increases applicable to other employees of the Company and economic conditions. A salary 
and bonus review for staff and Executive Directors has been conducted post the year end following the commencement of

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
OF ELAND OIL & GAS PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Eland Oil & Gas 
PLC for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related 
notes 1 to 31. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK  
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 ` the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2013 and of the Group’s loss for the year  
then ended;
 ` the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 ` the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 ` the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and 
the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 ` adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 ` the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 ` certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
 ` we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year ended 31 December 2013
1. General information
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and 
preceding year.
Eland Oil & Gas PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the 
registered office is given on page 62. The nature of the Company’s operations and its principal activities are set out on pages 1 to 
17 of this Annual Report.
The Company and the Group’s financial statements cover the year to 31 December 2013.
Restatement of Consolidated Income Statement for year ended 31 December 2012
The Board have decided that the categorisation of expenditure previously reported in the Consolidated Income Statement for the 
year ended 31 December 2012, did not properly reflect the nature of the costs incurred by the business. Accordingly costs totalling 
$4,262,000, which were previously reported as Administrative expenses, have been transferred to Other operating expenses with 
the effect of reducing Administrative expenses from $12,945,000 to $8,683,000. This recategorisation has been applied again in 
2013 and will be applied on a consistent basis going forward.
Restatement of Cash Flow Statements for year ended 31 December 2012
In response to questions arising from a review of the Company’s Annual Report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 
2012 by the Financial Reporting Council’s Conduct Committee, the Directors decided that it was necessary to restate the 
comparative Company and Consolidated Cash Flow Statements to correct the following items:
Company Cash Flow Statement
Within Financing activities, Net proceeds on issue of shares has been restated from $200,781,000 to $181,210,000 by excluding a 
non-cash transaction relating to the conversion of convertible loan notes and preference shares to equity. Repayment of 
borrowings, relating to the same non-cash item, has been removed from Financing activities (previously an outflow of 
$19,571,000). Net cash from financing activities remains unchanged at $181,267,000.
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
Cash used in Operating activities has been restated from $1,835,000 to $19,570,000 by removing a non-cash adjustment relating 
to an increase in provisions of $17,735,000.
Within Investing activities, Purchases of property, plant and equipment has been adjusted by a corresponding amount of 
$17,735,000 restated from an outflow of $157,729,000 to an outflow of $139,994,000.
Within Financing activities, Net proceeds on issue of shares has been restated from $200,781,000 to $181,210,000 by excluding a 
non-cash transaction relating to the conversion of convertible loan notes and preference shares to equity. Repayment of 
borrowings, relating to the same non-cash item, has been removed from Financing activities (previously an outflow of 
$19,571,000). Net cash from financing activities remains unchanged at $181,267,000.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU Regulations.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for the assets at the date of transaction. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out 
below.
As permitted by section 408 of the Act, the Company has elected not to present its income statement for the year. Eland Oil & 
Gas PLC reports a profit for the year ended 31 December 2013 of $0.8 million (2012: loss of $4.8 million).
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Elcrest Exploration and Production Nigeria 
Limited has been consolidated because it is controlled by the Company. The Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies for the following reasons:
 ` the Company is entitled to appoint a number of Directors to the Board such that it can control decision making.
 ` in the event of disagreement amongst the Board of Directors, decisions are reached by shareholder vote and the Company has 
the ability, through the combined effect of a Shareholders Agreement, Loan Agreement and Share Charge, to direct the votes 
of the 55% shareholding that it does not own. Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 44
2. Significant accounting policies continued
New IFRS standards and interpretations
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted. Their application has not had 
any significant impact on the amounts reported or the disclosures in these financial statements.
 ` Amendments to IFRS 7 on Financial instruments asset and liability offsetting (effective 1 January 2013) - the Group does not 
have any offsetting arrangements in place.
 ` IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurements – the application of IFRS 13 has not had any material impact on the amounts recognised in 
the financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the 
European Union):
 
 ` IFRS 9 Financial Instruments

The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group in future periods, except for extra disclosures in respect of IFRS 12.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a 
detailed review has been completed.
No new standards or interpretations were early adopted by the Group or Company during the year.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which impact these activities, such as the risk of interruptions to production 
are included within the Chief Executive’s Report and the risk factors contained within the annual report. The financial position of 
the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officer’s Review of the 
annual report. Having regard to the matters above, and after making reasonable enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. For that 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation of the accounts.
Oil and gas assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the 
commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production. The cost of development and production assets also includes 
the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of 
recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Other property, plant and equipment
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using 
the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Fixtures and equipment 10% – 30% per annum
Motor vehicles  30% per annum
Depreciation of producing assets
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method by 
reference to the ratio of production in the year and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account future 
development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production. Producing assets are generally grouped with other 
assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing 
assets that serve other reserves.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Impairment of development and production assets
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase 
indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present value 
of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash generating unit applied for 
impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash generating 
unit where the cash inflows of each field are interdependent.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable oil and gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, 
natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of 
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially viable. There should be 
a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated as proven 
and probable reserves and a 50% statistical probability that it will be less.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depreciation. Where conditions giving rise to 
impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, 
net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
Acquisitions, asset purchases and disposals
Acquisitions of oil and gas properties are accounted for under the acquisition method when the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed constitute a business. 
Transactions involving the purchase of an individual field interest, or a group of field interests, that do not constitute a business, 
are treated as asset purchases irrespective of whether the specific transactions involve the transfer of the field interests directly 
or the transfer of an incorporated entity. Accordingly, no goodwill and no deferred tax gross up arises, and the consideration is 
allocated to the assets and liabilities purchased on an appropriate basis.
Proceeds on disposal are applied to the carrying amount of the specific intangible asset or development and production assets 
disposed of and any surplus is recorded as a gain or loss on disposal in the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured 
using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a 
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable 
can be measured reliably.
Decommissioning provision
A provision for decommissioning the Group’s oil and gas assets is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed or 
acquired. The extent to which a provision is required depends on the legal requirements for decommissioning, the costs and 
timing of work and the discount rate to be applied.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to 
income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 46
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until 
such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 
To the extent that variable rate borrowings are used to finance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective cash flow hedge of 
interest rate risk, the effective portion of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and released to profit or loss when 
the qualifying asset impacts profit or loss. To the extent that fixed rate borrowings are used to finance a qualifying asset and are 
hedged in an effective fair value hedge of interest rate risk, the capitalised borrowing costs reflect the hedged interest rate.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is 
deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed 
in US Dollars, which is the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
The Group’s income, and the majority of its costs, are denominated in US Dollars. The remainder of the costs are denominated in 
other currencies, predominantly Sterling, Naira (Nigerian currency) or Euros. The Group also has foreign currency denominated 
liabilities. Exposures to exchange rate fluctuations therefore arise. The Directors currently believe that foreign currency risk is at an 
acceptable level.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at 
the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity.
Taxation
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the Company or Group has become a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables
Accounts payable are measured at amortised cost.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement.
Capital risk management
Details of significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity 
instrument are disclosed in note 29 to the financial statements.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Compound instruments
The component parts of compound instruments (including redeemable convertible preference shares and redeemable convertible 
loan notes) issued by the Company are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of 
the contractual arrangement. At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market 
interest rate for a similar non-convertible instrument. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using the 
effective interest method until extinguished upon conversion or at the instrument’s maturity date. The equity component is 
determined by deducting the amount of the liability component from the fair value of the compound instrument as a whole. This is 
recognised and included in equity, net of income tax effects, and is not subsequently remeasured.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense 
recorded on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the 
expected life of the financial liability to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Share-based payments
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value 
includes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity settled 
share-based transactions are set out in note 28. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the 
Group revises its estimate of the number of the equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
In the application of the Company and the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to 
make critical accounting judgements and assumptions. The assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that 
are considered to be relevant.
The following are the critical judgements that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Company and the Group’s 
accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
Decommissioning provision
The Group has significant obligations to decommission and remove oil & gas facilities from its existing licence at the end of the 
production period. Legal and constructive obligations associated with the retirement of non-current assets are recognised at their 
fair value at the time the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, that cost is capitalised as part of the related 
non-current asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. Management apply judgement in deciding on an 
appropriate inflation rate to estimate costs in the future and also apply judgement in selecting a discount rate that reflects the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 48
3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued
The costs of decommissioning are reviewed annually. A review of all decommissioning cost estimates was undertaken by an 
independent specialist in 2013 which has been assessed and updated internally for the purposes of the 2013 financial statements. 
Provision for environmental clean-up and remediation costs is based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology 
and price levels.
It is difficult to estimate the costs of these decommissioning and removal activities, which are based on current regulations and 
technology, considering relevant risks and uncertainties. Most of the removal activities are many years into the future and the 
removal technology and costs are constantly changing. As a result, the initial recognition of the liability and the capitalised cost 
associated with decommissioning and removal obligations, and the subsequent adjustment of these balance sheet items, involve 
the application of significant accounting judgement, further details of which are provided in note 18.
Share-based payments
In valuing the share-based payments realised in the Group’s accounts, the Company has used the Black-Scholes calculation 
model, which makes various assumptions on factors outside the Group’s control, such as share price volatility and risk-free interest 
rates. Details of the options and assumptions used in deriving the share-based payments are disclosed in note 28.
Carrying value of oil and gas assets
The carrying value of oil and gas assets is subject to judgement over their recoverable value. The calculation of recoverable value 
requires estimates of future cashflows within complex value in use models. Key assumptions and estimates in the cashflow models 
relate to commodity prices, discount rates that are adjusted to reflect risk specific to individual assets, commercial reserves and 
the related cost and production profiles. 
Management assesses the Group’s oil and gas assets for indicators of impairment at least annually with reference to indicators as 
defined in IAS 36. Management do not believe the delay in first oil production was an indicator of impairment as there has been no 
reduction in the reserves to be recovered, and accordingly a full impairment review was not performed. 
Commercial Reserves
Proven and probable reserves are estimates of the amount of oil and gas that can be economically extracted from the Group’s oil 
and gas assets. The Group estimates its reserves using standard recognised evaluation techniques. The estimate is reviewed annually. 
Proven and probable reserves are determined using estimates of oil and gas in place, recovery factors and future commodity prices, 
the latter having an impact on the total amount of recoverable reserves. Future development costs are estimated taking into account 
the level of development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.

Total taxation 315 –
The Group has taxable losses of $76,824,000 (2012: $28,124,000) for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. 
Management expect that Group company Elcrest Exploration & Production Nigeria Limited, which accounts for the majority of 
these losses, will be granted favourable tax status during 2014. If granted, that company will then benefit from a five year tax 
holiday but as a result the existing tax losses will no longer be available to utilise against future profits, hence management 
believe it is not appropriate to recognise an asset in respect of these tax losses at 31 December 2013.
10. Earnings/(loss) per share
Earnings/(loss) per share (‘EPS’) is the amount of post-tax profit/(loss) attributable to each share.
Diluted EPS takes into account the dilutive effect of all equity options and share option plans being exercised.

allow Elcrest (the group company which holds a 45% interest in OML 40) to meet its general working capital requirements.
Interest is payable on amounts outstanding from time to time at a rate equivalent to USD LIBOR plus a margin of 9%. It is condition 
precedent to the availability of the facility that First Oil has been achieved. First Oil means the production of crude oil at an average 
rate of 2,000 bopd for a cumulative 30-day non-consecutive period in a 90-day period following the restart of production, being the 
date on which 2,000 bopd is first measured to have been achieved, in addition to receipt of 50,000 bbls into the Forcados terminal

were converted to Ordinary Shares of the Company on 3 September 2012 at par. A dividend at a coupon rate of 8% was payable 
annually up until the date of settlement or conversion.
At issue, the net proceeds received in respect of convertible redeemable preference shares were split between the financial 
liability element and an equity component, representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the financial liability into 
equity of the Company. The movement in the liability component in the preceding year was as follows:

Accrued coupon interest (148)
Exchange differences 122 
Conversion to Ordinary Shares (2,750)
Liability component as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 – 
The interest expensed was calculated by applying an annualised effective interest rate of 15.38% to the liability component until 
March 2012, at which point it was fully unwound. The liability component was measured at amortised cost.
17. Convertible redeemable loan notes
The First Loan Notes and Second Loan Notes were issued on 12 January 2011 and 10 March 2011 respectively, at an issue price of 
£50,000 per note. The Third Loan Notes were issued on 20 December 2011, at an issue price of £10,000 per note. 
The First Loan Notes and the Third Loan Notes were converted into Ordinary Shares of the Company on 3 September 2012. Round 
One, Two and Three Loan Note interest of £2,081,982 converted into Ordinary Shares at par on 3 September 2012. Further loan 
note interest with an aggregate value of £391,232 converted into Ordinary Shares at par on 17 September 2012. The Second Loan 
Notes were fully redeemed in October 2011. 
At issue, the net proceeds received in respect of the convertible loan notes was split between the financial liability element and

Loan Notes and 20.38% in respect of the Third Loan Notes, to the liability components of each respective Loan Note round for the 
period up until conversion on 3 September 2012. The liability components are measured at amortised cost.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Year ended 31 December 2013
18. Decommissioning provision continued
The provision for decommissioning is in respect of OML 40. The provision represents the present value of amounts that are 
expected to be incurred in 2026, discounted to the present value using a 2.75% discount rate. 
A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is recognised as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment 
(within additions). The amount recognised is the estimated cost of decommissioning, discounted to its net present value, and is 
reassessed each year in accordance with local conditions and requirements, reflecting management’s best estimates.
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning is included in the Income Statement as a finance cost.
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording an 
adjustment to the provision and a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment.
During 2013 an independent specialist evaluated the decommissioning costs for the licence and the study led to the adjustment of 
the amounts previously provided for. Management believe the estimates continue to form a reasonable basis for the expected 
future costs of decommissioning, which are now expected to be incurred in 2026. The effect of this change along with revisions to 
the assumed inflation and discount rates, is reflected in the above table. The effect in future periods is impractical to calculate, as 
the provision in future periods may be affected by the drilling of future wells, and changes to inflation or discounting assumptions. 
Previously it was assumed that costs would be incurred at the expiry of the licence in 2019. There is precedent for extension of 
licences in Nigeria and management are now confident that an extension can be obtained. The date the costs are expected to be 
incurred has therefore been reassessed as 2026.

Equity settled share option scheme
The Company has a share option scheme for all Directors and key personnel of the Group. The options were granted on  
3 September 2012. 2,669,763 Founder options are exercisable at £1.00 each. 8,210,000 share options are exercisable at £1.00 each and 
368,500 share options are exercisable at £1.13 each. The options will be exercisable in full if the average closing price per Share over any 
continuous thirty (30) day period, ignoring any days which are non-dealing days for AIM, occurring wholly during the period of 10 years 
from the date of grant, is equal to or greater than one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the Placing Price. Management has 
determined a 70% probability of this condition being satisfied. All of the share options, except for Founder Options which have a 
vesting period of two years, have a vesting period of three years from the date of grant. The £1.00 Founder options are exercisable for a 
period of eight years (less one day) from the second anniversary of the date of the grant. The other options are exercisable for a period 
of seven years (less one day) from the third anniversary of the date of grant. If the options remain unexercised after the day preceding 
the tenth anniversary of the date of the grant the options expire. Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2013 had a weighted average exercise price of £1.00, and a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of 8 years and 9 months. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted in 2012 was 
£2.557 million. The inputs into the Black-Scholes model during 2012 were as follows:
Year-end closing share price 116.25p
Weighted-average exercise price 100p
Expected volatility 28%
Expected life 3 years
Risk-free rate 2.5%
Dividend yield nil
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price from the date of admission 
to AIM to the financial year end. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for 
the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of $1,456,000 (2012: $511,000) related to equity settled share-based payment transactions

29. Financial instruments
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return 
to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2012.
The capital structure of the Group includes no debt as at 31 December 2013. Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent 
comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 19 to 23.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group and the Company, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
 ` Trade and other receivables
 ` Trade and other payables
 ` Cash and bank balances
Categories of financial instruments
At 31 December 2013, the Group and Company held the following financial assets:

Of the cash balances of $3.8 million (2012: $24.5 million), $1.1 million (2012: $0.3 million) was denominated in US Dollars and 
$2.7 million (2012: $24.2 million) was denominated in Sterling. Naira denominated balances were immaterial.
Credit risk management
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks. Cash balances are held with banks with an ‘A’ rating or 
better where possible. There is no credit risk associated with trade, other debtors and prepayments.
At 31 December 2013, the Group and Company held the following financial liabilities at amortised cost:

Market risk
The Group’s and Company’s activities expose them primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risk or the manner in which these risks are measured and managed.
Foreign currency risk management
With effect from 1 January 2013, the functional currency of the Company changed from Sterling to US Dollars. The functional 
currency of all the Group companies is now US Dollars. The change was triggered by the increasing influence of the US Dollar on 
its operations as its borrowing facilities and income are now US Dollar denominated.
The Group’s income, and the majority of its costs, are denominated in US Dollars. The remainder of the costs are denominated in other 
currencies, predominantly Sterling and Naira (Nigerian currency). The Group also has foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. 
Exposures to exchange rate fluctuations therefore arise. The Directors currently believe that foreign currency risk is at an acceptable level. 
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
Although the Group reports in US Dollars, elements of its business are conducted in Sterling and Naira. The current exposure to 
foreign currency risk is minimal due to the low value of expenses transacted in both these currencies. 
If the US Dollar had strengthened by 10% against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, post tax loss for the year would 
have been $0.5 million lower mainly as a result of differences of translation of Sterling denominated expenditure at higher rates.
If the US Dollar had weakened by 10% against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, post tax loss for the year would have 
been $0.6 million higher mainly as a result of translating Sterling denominated expenditure at lower rates. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 59
29. Financial instruments continued
If the US Dollar had strengthened by 10% against Naira, with all other variables held constant, post tax loss for the year would have 
been $0.2 million lower mainly as a result of translating Naira denominated expenditure at higher rates.
If the US Dollar had weakened by 10% against Naira, with all other variables held constant, post tax loss for the year would have 
been $0.2 million higher as a result of translating Naira denominated expenditure at lower rates.
Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or Company will encounter difficulty in meeting their financial obligations as they fall due. 
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of Directors. In order to mitigate this risk the 
management regularly reviews the upcoming liabilities to ensure these can be met as and when they fall due. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and reserve borrowing facilities and by continuously 
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. Details of undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduced 
liquidity risk are set out in Note 15.
Financial facilities
Loan facility
The Group has a loan facility with Standard Chartered Bank. Details are given in note 15.
Equity options
The Company negotiated equity options with two key investors in August 2012. These equity options were with Solstice 
International Investments Inc. and Helios Natural Resources Limited, both substantial shareholders in the Company. The equity 
options were each for £10 million and were available to the Company from September 2013 to September 2014 in exchange for 
shares priced at par. These investors also had the option to subscribe for these shares, priced at par from September 2012 through 
to September 2014. These equity options provide additional working capital for the Company. The options were partially exercised 
by the Company in February 2014 and the remaining balance exercised in March 2014. Details are given in note 19 Share Capital
Fair value of financial instruments
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their fair values, unless 
otherwise stated.
Maturity of financial assets and liabilities
All of the Group’s and Company’s financial liabilities and their financial assets as at 31 December 2013 are either payable or 
receivable within one year. On this basis no maturity analysis has been disclosed.

Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements
This Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements which are made in good faith and are based on current expectations

a date in the future or such words as “will”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “project”, “intend”, “plan”, “should”, “may”, “assume” 
and other similar words. By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive and speculative and involve risk and 
uncertainty because they relate to events, and depend on circumstances, that will occur in the future. You should not place undue

Prospective Resources/PR Those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially 
recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development 
projects. Prospective Resources have both an associated chance of recovery and a 
chance of development. Prospective Resources are further subdivided in accordance 
with the level of certainty associated with the recoverable estimates assuming their 
discovery and development and may be sub-classified based on project maturity
Proved Developed Reserves Proved Reserves that can be produced with existing wells and perforations, or from 
additional reservoirs where minimal additional capital investment is required
Proved Undeveloped Reserves Proved Reserves that require additional capital investment to bring the oil to the 
surface
Proved Reserves (‘Proved’) Those quantities of petroleum, which by analysis and geoscience, can be estimated with 
reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable. It is likely that the actual 
remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated Proved Reserves
Probable Reserves (‘Probable’) Those additional reserves that are less likely to be recovered than Proved Reserves but 
more certain to be recovered than Possible Reserves. It is equally likely that actual 
remaining quantities recovered will be greater than or less than the sum of the 
estimated proved plus Probable Reserves
Possible Reserves (‘Possible’) Those additional reserves which analysis and geoscience and engineering data suggest 
are less likely to be recovered than Probable Reserves. The total quantities ultimately 
recovered from the project have a low probability to exceed the sum of proved plus 
probable plus Possible Reserves

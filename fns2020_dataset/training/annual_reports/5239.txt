Key Business Highlights
> After achieving good progress in the ﬁ rst half of the year, the Company was 
affected increasingly by the rapid onset of the crisis in the ﬁ nancial services sector, 
which is its main marketplace, resulting in a loss before tax of £753,000.
> The combination of software licences, software services and maintenance 
increased their contribution to 66% of revenue for the full year with the balance 
coming from implementation services. This compares with 56% for 2008 and 
36% in 2007.
> Net cash at the year-end was £262,000 (2008: £878,000) and has increased 
since then.
> A tight control on overheads was maintained during the year with administrative 
costs being reduced by 26% to £2.6 million.
> A move to new open plan ofﬁ ces in July 2008 has improved staff morale and team 
working as well as providing excellent new customer training facilities.
> New contract wins announced during the year demonstrate continued interest in 
our products in core markets and internationally. 
> The Company’s sales efforts have been increased by the appointment of Robert 
Maxﬁ eld as Head of Sales in November 2008. The Company has reported that its 
pipeline of potential sales is stronger now than at any time in the past 24 months

Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
After a good first half year in which the Company made 
progress in meeting its objectives, the second half year 
deteriorated progressively as the crisis deepened within the 
financial services sector — our principal market. Although 
our products are firmly within the ‘spend to save’ category, 
and there is increasing evidence of demand, our clients have 
subjected expenditure on new and existing IT projects to more 
intense scrutiny since October 2008. This has led to delays 
in placing orders and, in certain instances, cancellation of 
projects which were at a late stage of negotiation. As a result, 
performance in the last quarter of the year was significantly 
below forecast, affecting the results for the year as a whole 
which were below expectations.
Results and finance
Following the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the 
Company’s new Auditors in September 2008, the opportunity 
was taken after the year end to review the detailed treatment 
of R&D capitalisation and amortisation policies under IFRS. 
This led to a restatement of the results for the year to 
31 January 2008, reducing the amount charged to the Income 
Statement for development expenditure and amortisation by 
an aggregate £231,000, thereby reducing the stated loss for 
that year.
After recording an increase in revenue during the first half 
year, a very quiet last quarter of the year resulted in total 
revenue for the year to 31 January 2009 of £3.7m (2008: 
£4.1m) and an operating loss of £792,000 (2008: previously 
stated: £897,000; restated: £683,000). The loss before tax 
was £753,000 (2008: previously stated: £815,000; restated: 
£601,000). The loss per share was 5.5p (2008: previously 
stated: 5.0p; restated: 3.8p).
Net cash at the year end was £262,000 (2008: £878,000) and 
cash balances are currently at a higher level.
Dividend
The Board will not be declaring a dividend for the year ended 
31 January 2009. 
Board and senior management
During the second half of the year, Robert Maxfield joined 
the Company as Head of Sales with a brief to help convert a 
promising pipeline of potential business into firm orders. 
I am pleased to report that Robert is making good progress.
More recently we announced that Violetta Parylo had resigned 
as Finance Director and has now left the Company to take up 
a position in a larger organisation. Given the current size of 
eg solutions, it has become apparent to the Board that the 
role of Finance Director does not warrant a full-time executive 
position. Accordingly, the Company has decided that the 
position of Finance Director will become a part-time position 
supported by the current Financial Controller and accounts 
staff.
Andy McRae, currently a Non-executive Director of the 
Company and a qualified UK Chartered Accountant, has 
assumed the position of part-time Finance Director until a 
suitable replacement with public company experience has 
been appointed.

Current trading and outlook
In the period end trading update issued in January 2009, we 
noted that our pipeline of potential sales was stronger than 
at any time in the past 24 months. That continues to be the 
case and our focus is on converting this potential into signed 
contracts. While trading conditions are difficult and customer 
decision times are longer, steady progress is being made in 
closing new sales contracts.
Meanwhile, the Company’s net cash deposits have increased 
since the year-end; and together with a bank facility for the 
forthcoming year, this provides adequate financing for the 
foreseeable future.

“there is now increasing interest in our 
applications and services as they help 
our customers to reduce costs and 
deliver guaranteed return on investment 
in six months.”
Chief Executive’s Statement
Introduction
Some two years ago we promised shareholders that a 
turnaround would be achieved in three half-year trading 
periods together with the creation of a platform for profitable 
growth. The Company was on track to deliver on this promise 
until the start of the last quarter of our financial year. 
Inevitably, we were affected by the rapid onset of the crisis in 
the financial services sector which is our main marketplace.
With an immediate focus by our customers on short-term 
reactions to the developing problems, decision times on new 
projects lengthened significantly in the closing months of the year 
under review. Some client companies sought to reduce capital 
expenditure on IT; others deferred projects on account of an 
unprecedented level of M&A activity in the sector. This resulted in 
some potential sales being deferred and others being cancelled. 
Also, some customer support contracts were lost when these 
customers ceased trading or were merged into other entities.
Within the past few months, the stronger financial services 
businesses have begun to recognise the need for investment 
in IT projects which will reduce their costs, improve service 
levels and achieve payback in short time periods.
Business review
Strict control of costs
A tight control of costs has been maintained during the 
year. The increase in the total cost of sales to £1.8m (2008: 
£1.4m; restated 2008: £1.2m) reflects an increased use 
of IT sub-contractors during the year which, together with 
higher amortisation of development expenditure, resulted in 
a reduction in gross margins to 51% (2008: 65%; restated 
2008: 70%). Administrative costs were reduced to £2.6m 
(2008: restated £3.6m) and are budgeted to reduce further 
this year.
The Company moved into new offices in July 2008, incurring 
a one-off cost of £55,000. These new open plan offices have 
improved staff morale and team working as well as providing 
excellent new customer training facilities. 
Total one-off costs in the year were £112,000 (2008: 
£392,000) including the office move and a prior-year provision 
for ‘ex-pat’ tax equalisation.
A review of the treatment of capitalisation and amortisation of 
R&D expenditure under accounting standard IAS 38 resulted in 
an adjustment to the accounts for the year ended 31 January 
2008. Additional R&D capitalisation of £103,000 from direct 
costs and a £128,000 reduction in amortisation is reflected in 
a £231,000 increase in retained earnings on the balance sheet. 
These changes are non-cash items.
Market and business development
The Company’s sales efforts have been increased by the 
appointment in November 2008 of Robert Maxfield as Head 
of Sales. With greater focus on Business Development, 
together with an increased number of enquiries, the pipeline 
of potential sales is now stronger than at any time in the 
past 24 months as companies in the financial services sector 
seek to reduce their cost base. It is evident that the stronger 
companies in UK financial services have realised that improved 
operational management capability can help them to reduce 
costs, whilst also improving customer service and regulatory 
compliance.
The combination of software licences, software services and 
maintenance increased its contribution to 66% of revenue for 
the full year with the balance coming from implementation 
services. This compares with 56% for 2008 and only 36% 
in 2007.
Despite considerable restructuring amongst the eg customer 
base and some pressure to reduce the costs of contracted 
support, maintenance revenues have held up well and are 
expected to do so in the current year. 
New contract wins announced during the year under review 
included Nationwide Building Society’s Specialist Lending and 
Regional Brands, a software services project for The Co-
operative Financial Services, as well as implementations in 
The Co-operative Group and Resolution Health in South Africa.

Elizabeth Gooch
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer
These contract wins demonstrate continued interest in our 
products in core markets and internationally. 
During the year, work was undertaken on 25 software 
services projects for 11 clients including Aviva, The Co-
operative Financial Services, Capita, Liberty Life, Nationwide 
and Wesleyan Assurance. These projects largely involved 
integrating eg work manager® and eg operational 
intelligence® with enterprise workflow and content 
management systems, process modelling and simulation tools 
and corporate performance measurement tools.
Currently 10 customers are now using the latest releases of eg 
work manager® and eg operational intelligence® — the 
fastest take-up of a new product release in the Company’s history.
Product development & support
Investment in capitalised software development in the year 
was £528,000 (2008: £0.71m; restated 2008: £0.82m) and 
included a major project to improve the efficiency and quality 
of software developments to enable eg to undertake more 
development projects at lower cost.
Development to existing software products included:
> enhancement to eg activity manager™ using Microsoft 
Silverlight technology;
> increased archiving capability;
> implementation of fully automated work allocation to 
support large-scale work throughput volumes; and
> improved reporting for clients to provide B2B service level 
reports direct from eg work manager®.
Development of new software products included:
> development of eg work manager® (v5.1) and eg 
operational intelligence® (v2.1) for release in 2009, 
including conversion of report production to Microsoft SQL 
Server Reporting Services; and
> eg operational data views™ — a new product enabling 
clients to use eg work manager® data in other 
systems, develop customised reports and embed eg work 
manager® data in enterprise IT platforms.
During the year and since the year-end, good progress has 
been made in certification and accreditation including:
> Microsoft certification for eg work manager® v5.0 and 
eg operational intelligence® v2.0; 
> BBBEE (Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment) 
level 2 accreditation in South Africa (score out of 10 
with 1 being the highest. 2 is a high score for small/new 
enterprises, particularly a foreign entity); and
> Banking Sector Training and Education Authority 
(BANKSETA) accreditation in South Africa for eg 
Operational Management training.
Priorities for the future
Our plans to restore the Company to profitable growth were 
on track in the first half of the year but were interrupted by 
the challenging conditions in the financial services sector in 
the last six months.
However, there is now increasing interest in our applications 
and services as they help our customers to reduce costs and 
deliver guaranteed return on investment in six months.
Our strategy remains to continue our plans to achieve 
profitable growth for our shareholders by securing further 
new business in UK core markets and specific international 
markets, strict control of overheads and the pursuit of further 
opportunities to reduce costs.

Overview
In the year ended 31 January 2009, turnover was £3.67m, 
a reduction of £0.45m (2008: £4.12m). Operating losses 
decreased by £0.11m in 2009 to produce a loss of £0.79m 
(2008: loss £0.90m; 2008: restated £0.68m).
Revenue Analysis
The Group produced a pleasing first half result with revenues 
of £2.27m, a 10% increase on 2008 £2.07m. Revenue earned 
in the second half of the year was £1.40m compared with 
£2.06m in the same period for the prior year.
The Group segments its operations on the basis of 
‘geographical segmentation of operations’. The Group has 
determined that this is the most appropriate segmental split 
to reflect the nature of the Group’s operations. The Group has 
two distinct companies operating in different geographical 
areas with different economic and political conditions and a 
different maturity of client and client requirements.
Research and Development — Prior Year Adjustment
During 2008, following a review of its research and 
development policy, eg solutions plc identified that some 
software subcontractor costs relating to the year ended 
31 January 2007 had not been capitalised. The total cost of 
this under capitalisation amounted to £103,000.
During this review eg also identified that the amortisation of 
its products had commenced too early. The three products 
in question were not available for general release until late 
January 2008. The total of this error amounted to £128,000.
These adjustments resulted in a deferred tax liability of 
£65,000, of which £60,000 related to the prior year and 
£5,000 related to earlier periods.
The above amounts have been adjusted through reserves as a 
prior year adjustment.
2008 opening retained earnings were £0.3m and closing 
retained earnings were (£0.2m).
The impact of the prior year adjustment on restated basic 
EPS is (3.8)p (2008: (5.0)p) and restated diluted EPS is (3.8)p 
(2008: (5.0)p).
The financial statements and all the related notes have been 
restated to reflect the changes that have been made.
Loss Before Taxation
The loss before taxation was £0.75m (2008: £0.81m; restated 
2008: £0.58m). 
Taxation
The Group has benefited from the favourable tax relief given 
on development expenditure. The effective rate of taxation 
credit is 4% (2008: effective rate of tax credit 16%).
Earnings Per Share
Loss per share on a basic and fully diluted basis was (5.5)p 
and (5.5)p respectively. In the prior year the basic earnings 
per share was (5.0)p (2008: restated (3.8)p) (and on a fully 
diluted basis (5.0)p (restated (3.8p)).
Dividend
The trading results are set out on page 24. The Directors 
do not recommend the payment of a final dividend on the 
ordinary shares (2008: Nil).

Research and Development & Capital Expenditure
The Group spent £1.12m on direct staff and contractor 
costs for research and development, of which £0.42m 
was capitalised. An additional £0.11m, in relation to direct 
costs, was also capitalised. In 2008 the Group expended 
£1.24m on direct staff and contractor costs developing its 
software product, of which £0.59m (2008: restated £0.69m) 
was capitalised. An additional £0.03m, in relation to direct

Corporate Social Responsibility
eg is committed to managing 
its business in a socially 
responsible manner. 
eg’s Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) policy has 
been produced in collaboration 
with employees and reflects 
the areas the Company feels 
are most closely aligned to its 
business operations.
Employees
eg’s intention is to listen to and involve staff — employee 
feedback is an important way of ensuring the continuous 
improvement of the business and can help improve staff 
satisfaction. Employees are fully supported by the Company 
should they choose to undertake further study and training.
Environment
It is Company policy that all waste materials are recycled. 
Wherever possible eg uses FSC-certified paper products 
and sustainable suppliers. We introduced ethical external 
Christmas cards in 2008 and a digital card for employees to 
reduce waste.
Company charity
Due to its involvement in South Africa since launching a 
subsidiary in Johannesburg in 2007, eg has chosen the 
Doornkop Needy Children’s Centre as its Company charity. 
The centre provides safety and shelter for orphaned or 
fostered children aged 1 to 5 years old, some of whom are 
HIV positive. eg supports fundraising activities with staff and 
clients, as well as making its own financial contributions to the 
charity. The Company also organised a Christmas party for the 
children in 2008.
The Doornkop Needy Children’s 
Centre looks after 160 poor 
children. The money eg has 
donated and helped to raise over 
the last 12 months helps provide 
food, toys, clothes, learning 
materials, equipment and outings 
for the children.

South Africa
The South African government has introduced a 
comprehensive system to help integrate black people into 
society, post-apartheid, and therefore encourage and assist 
the transition of economic empowerment. Companies 
operating in South Africa have to achieve Broad Based Black 
Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) accredited status in support 
of these objectives. Businesses are classified by their size and 
measured in terms of how successfully they comply with a 
range of seven measures.
We are currently accredited with level 2 status (out of 10, 
1 is the highest score). This is considered to be a great 
achievement considering the size of our organisation and the 
short length of time we have been operating in South Africa.

Directors’ Report
The Directors submit their report and the financial statements 
of eg solutions plc for the year ended 31 January 2009.
Principal Activities
The principal activity of the Group is that of an IT and 
software support services business delivering guaranteed 
improvements in operations management. The Group uses 
proprietary software packages and an operations management 
methodology based on production management techniques. 
The Group delivers measurable operational improvements in 
large back office environments.
Business Review
Revenue in the period was £3.7m which was £0.4m lower than 
in 2008. The retained loss for the year is £0.7m (2008: loss 
£0.7m; restated 2008: £0.5m).
The information that fulfils the requirements of the Business 
Review including Key Performance Indicators below can be 
found in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s 
Statement on pages 8 to 11 which are incorporated in this 
report by reference. 
The purpose of this Annual Report is to provide information 
to the members of the Group. The Annual Report contains 
certain forward-looking statements with respect to the 
operations, performance and financial condition of the Group. 
By nature these statements involve uncertainty since future 
events and circumstances can cause results and developments 
to differ materially from those anticipated. The forward-looking 
statements reflect knowledge and information available at 
the date of preparation of this Annual Report and the Group 
has/makes no obligation to update these forward-looking 
statements. Nothing in this Annual Report should be construed 
as a profit forecast.
Results and Dividends
The trading results for the year are set out on page 24. The 
Directors do not recommend the payment of a final dividend 
on the ordinary shares (2008: Nil).
Prior Year Adjustment
During 2008, following a review of its Research and 
Development policy eg solutions plc identified that some 
software subcontractor costs relating to the year ended 
31 January 2007 had not been capitalised. The total cost of 
this under-capitalisation amounted to £103,000.
During this review eg also identified the amortisation of its 
products had commenced too early. The three products in 
question were not available for general release until late 
January 2008. The total of this error amounted to £128,000.
The above amounts have been adjusted through reserves as 
a prior year adjustment.
Future Developments
The Group has embarked upon a growth strategy which will 
extend its activities in financial services into other new UK 
market sectors, in addition to developing its activities outside 
of the UK. In addition, the Group is planning to expand upon 
its entry in Northern Europe over the coming period.
Key Performance Indicators
The Group’s progress on its strategic objectives is monitored 
by the Board of Directors by reference to the following 
key performance indicators. The matters mentioned in the 
Chairman’s Statement are a reflection of the performance of 
the business set out in the table below along with comparative 
prior year performance data.

A Revenue, Cash at bank and in hand, Cash flow from operating activities and research and development staffing 
expenditure are as extracted from the financial statements.
B Revenue Growth/Reduction compares the change in revenue from one year to the next expressed in percentage terms.
C Gross Margin is the gross profit as a percentage of revenue. Gross profit and revenue are taken from the income 
statement in the financial statements.
D Loss from operations is the loss from operations as a percentage of revenue.
E Loss after tax is the loss after tax as a percentage of revenue.
F Debtor days represent the length of time taken by customers to pay their bills and Creditor days represent the length 
of time taken by the Group to pay its suppliers. The number of days outstanding has been calculated by comparing the 
outstanding balance for trade debtors and trade creditors with the average value of sales or purchases for the previous 
twelve months respectively, inclusive of VAT, and multiplying by the number of days in the year. 
Political and Charitable Contributions
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £840 
(2008: £7,050) to a local charity in South Africa. No political 
donations were made.
Research and Development
The Group invests in new product development and the 
continual modification and improvement of its existing 
products to meet technological advances and customer and 
new market requirements.
Employee Involvement and Disability
The Group’s policy is to consult and discuss with employees 
any matters likely to affect their interests. Information on 
matters of concern to employees is provided in order to 
achieve a common awareness of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the Group’s performance.
The Group’s policy is to recruit disabled workers for those 
vacancies that they are able to fill. All necessary assistance 
with initial training courses is given. Once employed, a career 
plan is developed so as to ensure suitable opportunities for 
each disabled person. Arrangements are made, wherever 
possible, for retraining employees who become disabled to 
enable them to perform work identified as appropriate to 
their aptitudes.
Risks and Uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties 
which could have a material impact on the Group’s long-term 
performance and cause actual results to differ materially from 
expected and historical results. Management seeks to identify 
material risks and put in place contingency plans to mitigate 
the Group’s potential exposure. 
Competitor Risk
The market for operations management improvement is 
becoming increasingly competitive. To mitigate this risk, 
management works to build strong customer relationships and 
develop the Group’s product offering. 
Commercial Relationships
Some of the products utilise interfaces with proprietary 
software licensed by independent, third party software 
developers. Any absence of key third party products could 
have a material impact on the business.
To mitigate this risk, all key commercial relationships and 
developments in technology in the marketplace are kept under 
review. The Group also works with a diversity of partners to 
mitigate the risk inherent in working with a single partner.
Operations
The Group’s facilities could be disrupted by events beyond its 
control such as fire or other issues.
The Group prepares recovery plans for most foreseeable 
situations so that our business operations would continue 
should these situations occur.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The Group’s activities will expose the Group to a number of 
risks including market risk (foreign currency risk, price risk 
and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group 
manages these risks through an effective risk management 
programme. Exposures to financial risks are monitored by 
management and they are required to produce a quarterly risk 
report comprising all risks and an indication of the business 
impact of those risks.
The risk reports are provided to the Board of Directors in 
advance of the Board meetings and are discussed by the 
Board to ensure that the risk mitigation procedures are 
compliant with the Group policy and that any new risks are 
appropriately managed.
Price Risk
The Group’s products are tailored to realise benefits for 
customers and to meet individual requirements. Prices 
are negotiated with each customer on the basis of their 
specification of the product. 
Credit Risk
The Group has focused on selling to a “blue-chip” customer 
base thereby minimising the risk of incurring bad debts.
Liquidity
At the year end the Group had £0.26m in net cash balances.  
The objective is to ensure that operating profits are turned 
into cash balances during the year. The Group has an overdraft 
facility to provide additional liquidity if required.
Cash Flow Risk
The Group’s objective is to remain broadly cash neutral over 
the coming financial year.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to minimal foreign currency risk through 
transactions with overseas customers.
The Group is also exposed to exchange fluctuations which 
affect the value of its overseas subsidiary.

Policy on Payment of Creditors 
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in 
accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between 
the Group and its suppliers, provided that all trading terms 
and conditions have been complied with. 
Trade creditor days based on creditors at 31 January 2009 
were 35 days (2008: 47 days).
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information 
to Auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time 
of approving the Directors’ report are listed on pages 14 to 
15. Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the 
Company’s Auditors, each of these Directors confirms that:
> to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there 
is no information relevant to the preparation of their report 
of which the Company’s Auditors are unaware; and
> each Director has taken all the steps a Director might 
reasonable be expected to have taken to be aware of 
relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s Auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP resigned as Auditors during the year 
and Ernst & Young LLP were appointed by the Directors to fill 
the casual vacancy.
Going Concern
The Group manages its day-to-day working capital 
requirements through a combination of cash inflows from 
sales, tight management of expenses and when required 
an overdraft facility. The overdraft facility has recently been 
extended to 31 January 2010.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, which take account of 
both positive and negative variations in trading performance, 
show that the Group has sufficient headroom to operate within 
the level of its current facility. Should the facility be required 
beyond 31 January 2010 the Directors currently have no 
reason to believe that it will not be extended.
The current economic conditions create uncertainty over 
the level of demand for the Group’s products within its core 
market of financial services. Nevertheless, after considering 
this uncertainty, the Directors have a reasonable expectation, 
based on both recent past performance and the current 
pipeline of possible future business that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the annual report 
and accounts.
Annual General Meeting
A resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as Auditors will 
be put to the members at the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company which will be held at 10.30 am on 16 June 2009 at 
the offices of TLT Solicitors, Sea Containers House, 20 Upper 
Ground, Blackfriars Bridge, London, SE1 9LH.

Directors’ Responsibilities in the Preparation of the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law.
The Directors are required to prepare Group financial 
statements for each financial year which present fairly the 
financial position of the Group and the financial performance 
and cash flows of the Group for that period. In preparing 
those Group financial statements the Directors are required to:
> select suitable accounting policies in accordance with 
IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors and then apply them consistently;
> present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
> provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the Group’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
> state that the Group has complied with IFRSs, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group and enable them 
to ensure that the Group financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of eg solutions plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements (the “financial statements”) of eg solutions plc 
for the year ended 31 January 2009 which comprise the 
Group Income Statement, the Group and Parent Company 
Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Cash Flow 
Statements, the Group Statement of Recognised Income 
and Expenses and the related notes 1 to 34. These financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies 
set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an Auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set 
out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial 
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in 
our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is 
consistent with the financial statements. The information 
given in the Directors’ report includes that specific information 
presented in the Chairman’s Statement that is cross-referred 
from the Business Review section of the Directors’ report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions are not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
financial statements. The other information comprises only 
the Directors’ report, the Chairman’s Statement, Financial 
Review and Chief Executive’s Statement. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test 
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors 
in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and 
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 Janaury 2009 
and of its loss for the year then ended;
> the Parent Company financial statements give a true 
and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the 
Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 January 2009;
> the financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
> the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent 
with the financial statements.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 January 2009
1 Accounting Policies 
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS”). 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis and have been applied on a consistent basis as discussed 
in the Financial review. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Company made a loss after tax of £0.04m for the financial year. The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available 
under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and not presented an income statement for the Company.
New Accounting Standards
From 1 February 2008, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” and the complementary amendment 
to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements — Disclosures”. IFRS 7 introduces new requirements aimed at expanding the 
disclosure of information about the Group’s financial instruments. It requires disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information 
about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments. The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about the level and 
management of an entity’s capital. The Group has applied IFRS 7 and the amendments to IAS 1 in these financial statements, with 
the relevant disclosures included in note 31.
We have considered new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations, none of which have a material impact on the 
Group’s reported results or financial statements.
 
Basis of Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of eg solutions plc and the enterprises controlled by the Group 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 January each year. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and have been 
rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue 
to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company and are based on consistent 
accounting policies. All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated.
Segmental Reporting
The Group has elected to segment its operations on the basis of ‘geographical segmentation of operations’. The Group has 
determined that this is the most appropriate segmental split to reflect the nature of the Group’s operations. The Group has two 
distinct companies operating in different geographical areas with different economic and political conditions and a different maturity 
of client and client requirements. These are:
> EGUK — United Kingdom
> EGSA — South Africa
Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write each asset down to its estimated residual value over 
its expected useful life, as follows:
Computer Equipment —  50% straight-line
Office Equipment —  15% reducing balance
Fixtures and Fittings —  15% reducing balance
Motor Vehicles —  25% reducing balance
Land and buildings —  20% straight-line

1 Accounting Policies continued
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication 
that the asset may be impaired.
Development Assets 
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s software development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
> an asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes);
> it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; 
> the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably;
> the product or process is technically and commercially feasible; and 
> sufficient resources are available to complete the development and to either sell or use the asset.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which it is incurred. 
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives (6 years).
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Retirement Benefits
The Company operates a defined Contribution Pension Scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the 
Company in an independently administered fund. The amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs and 
other post retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments 
in the balance sheet. 
Foreign Currencies
Transactions in currencies other than sterling, the presentational and functional currency of the Group, are recorded at the rates 
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on 
retranslation are included in the income statement for the period, except for exchange differences on non-monetary assets and 
liabilities, which are recognised directly in equity, where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences 
arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised 
as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
The results of overseas operations have been translated into sterling at the monthly weighted average rate of exchange for the 
period. Rand denominated assets and liabilities have been translated at the relevant rate of exchange at the balance sheet date of 
£1 = ZAR14.6971 (2008: £1 = ZAR14.4005).

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which 
affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in equity.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank and other short-term deposits held by the Group with maturities of 
less than three months.
Share-based Payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 
has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were had not vested as of 1 February 2006.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date 
of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate 
of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes model. The expected life used in the model 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural 
considerations.
Employee Share Ownership Plans
The Company operates an ESOP trust and has de facto control of the shares held by the trust and bears their benefits and risks. 
The Group records certain assets and liabilities of the trust as its own. Finance costs and administrative expenses are charged as 
they accrue.

Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The Group has no finance leases.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of Group financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires the use of 
accounting estimates and management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. These 
judgements and estimates are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. Intangibles 
are tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. Other non-financial assets are tested for 
impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other 
sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Maintenance Contracts
Income in respect of maintenance contracts is invoiced on an annual basis and recognised as earned.
Software Licences
For perpetual licences revenues are recognised once the software has been fully installed.
For fixed term licences revenues are recognised on a straight-line basis.
Implementation and software services
Revenues in respect of implementation and software services are recognised on a percentage completion basis.

2 Prior Year Adjustment
During 2008, following a review of its Research and Development policy, eg solutions plc identified that some software 
subcontractor costs relating to the year ended 31 January 2007 had not been capitalised. 
The total cost of this under capitalisation amounted to £103,000, which has increased intangible assets and reduced cost of sales.
During this review eg also identified that three of its products had been amortised too early. The three products in question were 
not available for general release until late January 2008. The total of this error amounted to £128,000, of which £107,000 related to 
the prior year and £21,000 related to earlier periods, which reduced cost of sales and increased intangible assets.
These adjustments resulted in a deferred tax liability of £65,000, of which £60,000 related to the prior year and £5,000 related to 
earlier periods.
The above adjustments have been adjusted through reserves.
2008 opening retained earnings were £0.3m and closing retained earnings were £(0.2)m.
The financial statements and all the related notes have been restated to reflect the changes that have been made.
The prior year adjustment resulted in a decrease in the loss for 2008 of £154,000 and an increase in net assets, at 31 January 2008 
of £166,000. This also changed the loss per share from 5p to 3.8p.

Basic  (5.5p) (3.8p)
Diluted  (5.5p) (3.8p)
EPS has been calculated using the following methodology:
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the number of weighted 
average ordinary shares during the period. The number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust (see note 28 
share-based payments).
For diluted earnings per share, the number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees.
As the Basic EPS is a negative value, the effects of anti-dilutive potential ordinary shares are ignored in calculating diluted EPS.

Expected dividend yield  1.0% 1.0%
Weighted average fair value of options granted during the year  £0.22 —
  
 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of a comparable business, prior to the period when the 
Company’s shares were listed on the AIM market. Volatility since listing has been calculated using the daily mid-market share

31.  Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures — Group
An explanation of the Group’s financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the Directors’ 
Report on pages 18 to 21.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures. Any proposed changes will be 
considered by the Board prior to such changes being implemented.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows:
Liquidity Risk
Cash flow is managed on a daily basis, short-term and longer-term basis and management is therefore able to ensure that the 
Group has sufficient cash or facilities to meet all its commitments. The Group ensures that there is sufficient cash or working 
capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group from the current business plan.
Forecast liquidity is reviewed weekly by management.
The Group has an agreed overdraft facility to 31 January 2010.
Banking covenants are monitored on a weekly basis to ensure that there are no current or potential future breaches. There have 
been no breaches of covenants during the reporting period.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to minimal foreign currency risk through transactions with overseas customers.
The Group is also exposed to exchange fluctuations which affect the value of its overseas subsidiary.
Credit Risk of Customers
With eg’s exposure to the financial services sector detailed reporting is provided weekly on the debt position and if required the 
Group will resort to legal action to recover any moneys due after a sufficient period of time.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and operate 
within current available facilities. This is reviewed by the Board on a monthly basis.
The Group manages its share capital and reserves as its Group capital.

Notes
a.  A member of the Company is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of his rights to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting of the Company. A member may appoint 
more than one proxy, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attaching to different shares. A proxy need not be a member.
b.  To be effective, the instrument appointing a proxy and any authority under which it is signed (or a notarially certified copy of such authority) for the annual general meeting to be 
held at the offices of TLT Solicitors, Sea Containers House, 20 Upper Ground, Blackfriars Bridge on Tuesday 16 June 2009 at 10.30 am and any adjournment(s) thereof must be 
returned to the office of the Registrars by 14 June 2009. In each case the proxy appointments must be received not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the 
meeting or any adjournment thereof. The appointment of a proxy does not preclude a member from attending the meeting and voting in person, in which case any votes of the 
proxy will be superseded.
c.  A corporation must execute the Form of Proxy under either its common seal or the hand of a duly authorised officer or attorney.
d.  The ‘Abstain’ option is to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution. Such a vote is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the votes ‘For’ and ‘Against’ a resolution.
e.  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, only those members entered on the register of members of the Company as at 10.30 am on 14 June 
2009 shall be entitled to attend or vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries on the register of members 
after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
f.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that:
(i)  if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of 
all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and 
the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and
(ii)  if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the 
meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll 
and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk).
g.  Copies of the Directors’ service contracts and Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment with the Company will be available for inspection at the Registered Office of the 
Company during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays and public holidays excluded) from the date of this Notice to the date of the meeting and from 15 minutes prior 
to and until the close of the meeting.

BEING P ART OF  
ALL OUR LIVES WHAT WE DO
Innovation is critical  
to our success.
Yule Catto is a trusted partner of its customers around the world. We don’t sell chemicals –  
we sell formulations. Our innovative formulations and application know-how are an integral  
part of our customers’ products which cover a wide range of industries, including coatings, 
building products, gloves, carpets, paper, adhesives, plastics, PVC and many more.
Our approach
Our approach is to work closely with our customers. We understand their product and  
process requirements. The combination of this intimate understanding and our technology  
and process know-how are the key to our, and our customers’, business success.
Reshaped business
During 2011, we completed the acquisition of PolymerLatex and sold the Group’s 
remaining non-core business – Pharma. This completed a transformation started  
in 2007, which has taken the Group from a small diversified chemical business  
to being a substantial, focused, leading producer of specialty aqueous polymers.

Underlying performance
The Group’s management uses underlying performance to plan for, control and assess the performance of the Group. Underlying performance differs from the statutory  
IFRS performance as it excludes the effect of special items, which are defined in note 2. The Board’s view is that underlying performance provides more meaningful information 
for the Group’s investors and so it is the primary focus of the Group’s narrative reporting. Where appropriate, statutory performance inclusive of special items is also described.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Overview
2011 was an exceptional year for Yule Catto. We delivered a very 
strong set of financial results. Just as importantly though, it marked 
the end of a process of transformation for the Group from a small 
diversified chemical business in 2007 through to a much larger 
focused specialty Polymer business in 2011, with a broad product 
offering and exposure to high growth markets.
At the end of March, we completed the acquisition of PolymerLatex, 
effectively doubling the size of our business. Subsequently, in 
November, we concluded the sale of our Pharmaceutical business, 
the last non-core asset we needed to divest to complete  
the transformation process to become a focused specialty  
Polymer business.
Strategy
Our broad strategy remains unchanged. We are focused on 
geographic expansion around existing business hubs, further 
increasing our presence in emerging markets, and in developing 
market sectors where our technology, new product development 
and manufacturing capabilities give us a real competitive advantage. 
Consistent with this strategy we commenced construction of 
70,000 tonnes of new nitrile latex capacity in the year in Malaysia, 
due on line in the fourth quarter of 2012, and completed the 
acquisition of a small dispersion manufacturer there in late 2011.
Performance
We delivered a very strong set of financial results. The Group 
reported underlying profit before tax of £84.8 million, an increase 
of some 100%, and underlying sales were £1,117 million an 
increase of 92% over 2010. Throughout the year the Board has 
reviewed the performance of the business on a pro-forma basis, 
which includes the results of PolymerLatex for 2010 and 2011 in 
full, with an allowance for the finance cost of the acquisition for the 
periods we did not actually own the business. On this basis, and 
excluding the divested Pharma business, the comparisons are more 
representative, and are very strong with sales of £1,269 million,  
up 18%, and underlying profit before tax of £96.0 million, up 25%.
Integration progress
When we announced the acquisition of PolymerLatex we  
committed to deliver hard synergies of at least £20 million from  
the combination of both polymer businesses. I am pleased to say 
that, at the end of 2011, only nine months after the acquisition,  
we had already established a synergy run rate (annualised rate  
of delivery) of £15 million. The Board now anticipates we will  
achieve an annual run rate of £25 million by March 2013.
Balance sheet
The acquisition of PolymerLatex was structured so as to ensure  
that the enlarged Group had a solid balance sheet, with an 
estimated ratio of net borrowings to EBITDA at the date of 
acquisition of just below 2.0. The strong performance during the 
year, and the divestment of the Pharma business, have resulted in 
net borrowings reducing substantially from the position at the date  
of acquisition, and our closing net borrowings was £164.3 million. 
This represents a pro-forma underlying net borrowings to EBITDA  
of 1.2, which the Board considers to be a prudent leverage position. 
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 2.3p per share, 
making a total dividend per share for the full year of 3.5p.  
This represents growth of 35% on the adjusted full year dividend  
per share for 2010. Looking ahead, the Board expects to increase 
the dividend ahead of earnings growth in accordance with the 
Board’s stated intention of pursuing a progressive dividend policy.
Safety, health and environment
The Group is absolutely committed to the continuous improvement 
of its performance in respect of safety, health and the environment.  
I am pleased that most of the metrics that we measure in this  
area showed good improvement over the course of the year. 
People
The Group’s employees, including those who have left as part  
of the restructuring, have worked extremely hard this year to deliver  
the transformation of the Group, and the Board thanks them  
for all their efforts.
Board composition
At the forthcoming AGM, I shall not be seeking re election  
as Chairman. After eleven years as a Director, the last three  
being as Chairman, and after the transformational year of 2011,  
I feel this is the right time for a change. Dr A A Dobbie has  
also indicated he will not be seeking re-election. He has been  
a director for five years and Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee for the last three. We thank him for his valuable 
contribution and wish him well in the future.
In January 2012, Dominique Fournier joined the Board as  
a non-executive director. Dominique subsequently became  
potentially conflicted and he decided to step down from the  
Board on 13 March 2012.
The appointment of three new non-executive directors is well 
advanced and we expect to make further announcements shortly.
During 2011, we brought Neil Johnson onto the Board as our  
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, and I am very  
pleased he has agreed to succeed me as Chairman.
Current trading and outlook
Looking forward, we continue to anticipate several years of  
low growth in western economies with global growth generally 
driven by emerging markets, where we have a significant and 
increasing presence.
Whilst the general economic environment requires a degree  
of caution, I am pleased that the business has made a solid  
start to the year. Earnings will benefit from the synergies from  
the PolymerLatex acquisition coming through over the course  
of 2012, and the Board remains confident about the prospects  
for the Group in 2012 and beyond.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
Overview
2011 was a pivotal year in the development of the Yule Catto 
Group. The acquisition of PolymerLatex was announced in 
December 2010 and completed at the end of March 2011 when 
we received the relevant clearances. With the sale of our Pharma 
business in November 2011, and the increased scale created by the 
PolymerLatex acquisition, Yule Catto has now become a substantial 
focused specialty Polymer business, with a strong and diversified 
portfolio of products, and well invested facilities in Europe and Asia.
As part of the integration the combined Polymer business has 
adopted the Synthomer brand name, and we now operate all of  
our Polymer operations around the world under this well recognised 
and respected name.
The integration process between PolymerLatex and Synthomer 
started in April following completion of the acquisition. This has  
been an intense process covering all operating regions. In Europe 
this has so far resulted in the closure of the Mouscron site in 
Belgium and the exit from Latex production in Stallingborough in  
the UK. In addition to this manufacturing network rationalisation 
there have been significant changes to the Commercial and 
Technical organisations with the closure of Synthomer’s technical 
service and research laboratories in Frankfurt, Germany and 
Dispersion research laboratories in Harlow, UK. Every effort  
has been made to retain core skills and fill defined vacancies as  
a result of these changes. During the year some 200 people left  
the business as a result of these changes. The resulting savings  
will be mainly seen in 2012.
In Asia the operations of Synthomer in Kluang and PolymerLatex 
in Pasir Gudang have also been brought under one management 
structure. In R&D the implementation of a combined innovation 
process is well underway with the very clear aim of pursuing strong 
market needs, fast speed to market and delivering added value  
to our customers.
The integration process absorbed a lot of management effort in 
2011. Clearly much of the focus was on delivering the synergies 
we committed to on launching the acquisition. However, and just as 
importantly, it has been about building a strengthened management 
team and greater capability throughout the organisation. Overall this 
process has been very successful. In parallel with the integration 
process, we have remained very focused on driving performance, 
where we have seen very good results, with Group pro-forma 
operating profit of £109.7 million, 18% ahead of 2010.

When we announced the acquisition of PolymerLatex we anticipated 
at least £20 million of annual synergies. As at the end of December 
2011 the annualised run rate from synergies stood at £15 million. 
We now anticipate that by the end of March 2013 the annual run 
rate of synergies will be £25 million. This should result in a benefit  
to operating profit in 2012 of some £15 million compared to 2011.
The macroeconomic environment deteriorated over the course of 
2011 as the sovereign debt crisis developed. End market demand 
for our products was generally good through the first half of the 
year, with volumes ahead 3%, with European volumes broadly flat 
but strong growth in Asia. The second half however saw significant 
destocking. This arose from a combination of the macroeconomic 
uncertainties and customers delaying orders to take full advantage 
of the benefits of falling input costs. This was most noticeable  
in the fourth quarter, where demand was down by some 13%.  
This was a similar pattern to what we saw in 2009 and, as then, 
margin management generally compensated for the volume 
shortfall, resulting in our strong overall financial performance.
Raw material price volatility in basic monomers created difficulties 
through the year, which the business worked hard to overcome. 
Most monomer prices moved up strongly during the first half of 
the year and this, combined with a tight supply situation created 
a challenging environment for the business. Raw material prices 
fell sharply in the fourth quarter, creating different challenges as 
customers destocked. Throughout this volatile period, the business’ 
priority has remained on ensuring a balanced approach to margin 
and volume with a continued focus on value delivery, which was 
broadly successful.
We manage the business in two segments. ‘Europe & North 
America’ and ‘Asia & Rest of World’. The reported results are  
on an ‘origination basis’, meaning the segmental sales and operating 
profits are reported based on where the product is manufactured. 
We export many specialty products from Europe to Asia. Looking 
at sales on a destination basis, Europe & North America comprises 
63% of Group turnover with Asia & Rest of World accounting  
for 37%.

Pro-forma operating profit in our ENA business was ahead by 10%.
Volumes for the year were down, affected by the destocking activity 
we saw over the second half of 2011. The destocking was broad 
based with volumes down across almost all segments. Our focus 
on margin management and benefits from our innovation pipeline 
ensured that overall profitability still increased substantially.
Alongside the plant closures in Europe we are investing in our 
Stallingborough Dispersions facility to raise the overall capability  
of the site. During the year we made some modest increases  
to our HSSBR capacity by debottlenecking. These changes  
have created a much more capable, robust manufacturing  
network in Europe.
Some £3 million of synergy benefits from cost reductions came 
through in the Group results for the year, and these are almost 
entirely reflected in the ENA segment.
The coming together of PolymerLatex and Yule Catto’s R&D 
activities has created a stronger R&D capability in Europe.  
We now have a broad portfolio of projects primarily focused  
on commercially driven projects to develop technically leading 
products in both key growth segments and traditional business 
segments where our strong market positions can be maintained. 
The development programme has led to new product launches in  
a number of segments during the year including specialty adhesives, 
construction, paper coating and synthetic grass applications.

INTO ASIA
We have been in Asia for over 100 years.  
Leveraging our capabilities there is key  
to the Group’s future growth.
Product

Our R&D facility is heavily 
focused on Nitrile (NBR) 
Latex, which we supply to  
the medical glove industry –  
a market growing  
at some 15% a year.

Pro-forma operating profit in our ARW segment was ahead by 29%. 
Manufactured volumes in ARW were 9% up at the half year, but 
destocking, particularly in Nitrile, resulted in full year volumes 
showing no growth.
In order to maintain leadership in the fast growing Synthetic Glove 
market a 70,000 tonne nitrile latex expansion to the Pasir Gudang 
plant was sanctioned during the year and is now under construction. 
The new capacity will come on stream in Q4 2012. This expansion 
will also be structured to allow SBR production, and we are aiming 
to build a growing presence in Asia in SBR, leveraging our leading 
technology, over the coming years. This was one of the strategic  
objectives we set ourselves at the time of the PolymerLatex 
acquisition, taking advantage of our greater financial flexibility  
and scale.
Our Dispersions facilities in Asia operated near capacity through 
most of 2011. In October we completed the acquisition of Quality 
Polymer, a Malaysian Dispersions manufacturer owned by one of 
our major customers. 
This has resolved our near-term Dispersion capacity issue in the 
region, whilst improving our market share in Malaysia.
In Asia, the integration of the R&D activities has been focused on 
optimising the combined range of NBR latex to ensure the best and 
most comprehensive of offerings to our customers for glove dipping 
applications and also on improvements in product consistency 
and quality to deliver improved operational efficiencies. In parallel, 
to support the changing needs of the market and drive sustained 
growth in the region, extensive research and applications work is 
ongoing to develop the next generation of latices. This development 
work is focused on improving the strength and feel of gloves, whilst 
maintaining the key barrier and chemical resistance properties  
of the latex.

70,000 tonnes  
of capacity
We are constructing another 
70,000 tonnes of NBR latex 
capacity, due for completion  
by the end of 2012. This will  
allow us to both support the  
fast growing nitrile market,  
and sell SBR latex products  
into the region.
State of the  
art production 
facilities
Our latex facility in Pasir  
Gudang is only three years  
old – and will deliver over 
200,000 tonnes of NBR  
and SBR latex emulsion 
when the new expansion  
is complete.
Acquisition
In 2011 we expanded our 
dispersion polymerisation 
capacity with the purchase  
of Quality Polymer from  
one of our major customers  
in the region.
China
Our ability to sell into China  
was enhanced in 201 1 with  
the creation of our new subsidiary 
which will promote our high  
value specialty products into  
the country.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Income statement
The acquisition of PolymerLatex substantially changed the size 
of the Group. The acquisition was completed on 31 March 2011 
after competition clearance was received. To allow a meaningful 
comparison of the results for 2011, the table below shows pro-
forma results by adjusting the underlying performance of the Group 
to include the underlying results of PolymerLatex for 2010 and 
2011, and to allow for an estimated interest cost of £2.1 million per 
quarter for the periods that the business was not actually owned. 
The underlying pro-forma results provide the most meaningful 
comparison of year on year performance.
Sales, operating profit and profit before tax –  
underlying pro-forma
Total sales increased by 18% to £1,269 million. Volumes for the 
year were 3% lower and the increase in sales value was driven in 
the main by the recovery of monomer price increases. Translation 
increased turnover by 1%.
Underlying pro-forma operating profit of £109.7 million was ahead 
by 18%, with strong profit growth in both segments.
Had PolymerLatex been bought on 1 January 2011 then it is 
estimated that the finance costs for the year would have been some 
£2.1 million higher, resulting in a pro-forma underlying profit before 
tax for the Group of £96.0 million, an increase of 25% on the 
equivalent result, calculated on the same pro-forma basis in 2010.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
continued
Sales, operating profit and profit before tax –  
underlying non pro-forma
Total sales increased by 92% to £1,117 million, whilst Group 
operating profit increased by 91% mainly due to the PolymerLatex 
acquisition. Finance costs increased due to higher borrowings for 
the acquisition, partly mitigated by the beneficial impact of the 
repayment of some high coupon fixed rate debt in September 2010. 
As a result, profit before tax increased by 99% to £84.8 million.
Tax and EPS
The underlying tax rate of 23% (2010 20%), was low, reflecting 
the benefits of pioneer status (extended tax holiday) on our nitrile 
investments in Malaysia, and a zero rate in the UK as a result 
of losses after deduction of the contributions to the UK pension 
scheme. The overall rate, whilst low, has increased as a result of  
the PolymerLatex acquisition, as much of the acquired business’ 
profits are made in Germany, which has an overall corporate rate  
of the order of 32%.
Profit attributable to minority interests was £1.6 million  
(2010 £1.3 million).
As a result, overall underlying earnings per share for 2011 was 
18.8p per share, compared to a 14.5p per share for 2010, as 
adjusted to reflect the rights issue in December 2010. This is an 
increase in underlying earnings per share of 30%. On a pro-forma 
basis, including the first quarter’s results of PolymerLatex, EPS 
would have been 21.1p, an increase of 46%.
Dividend
The Group committed to a minimum dividend per share of  
3.0p for 2011, at the time of the interim announcement with an 
interim dividend of 1.2p. The Board has recommended a higher 
full year dividend of 3.5p and therefore a final dividend of 2.3p per 
share is recommended, payable on 6 July 2012 to shareholders  
on the register on 8 June 2012.
Special items and IFRS
The Group reports its financial results according to International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, to provide a 
clearer indication of the Group’s underlying performance, a number 
of special items are split out and shown in a separate column 
of the consolidated income statement due to their one-off or 
non-economic nature, and are excluded from the comments on 
underlying performance above and throughout the Chief Executive’s 
review of business performance. Special items comprise:
•  Restructuring costs associated with delivering the synergy targets 
for the PolymerLatex acquisition. At the time of the acquisition  
the Group announced an estimated total cash expenditure  
of £20 million to deliver these synergies of which £15.8 million  
was incurred in 2011. Some £4.4 million of non-cash asset write 
downs have also been expensed as a result of the plant closures 
giving a total expense of £20.2 million.
•  Acquisition costs relating mainly to the purchase of PolymerLatex 
of £1.4 million charged in the year.
•  Various cross currency and interest rate swaps for hedging 
purposes, which involve maturities of up to five years. IFRS 
requires that where the strict requirements of IAS 39 are not met, 
changes in the market value should be recognised annually in the 
income statement. However, such financial instruments are 
maintained by the Group for the length of the contract and over 
their lifetime have a fair value of nil. Hence the notional annual 
adjustment, a loss of £0.9 million (2010 gain £2.6 million)  
is segregated from the underlying performance. During the year 
the Group also settled the mark to market position on a number  
of interest rate swaps acquired with the former PolymerLatex 
business. The associated charge to special items was £2.4 million.
•  Amortisation of intangibles of £20.4 million (comprising £19.1 
million in the Company and subsidiaries and £1.3 million in share  
of joint ventures). IFRS acquisition accounting requires an explicit 
number to be placed on certain intangibles and amortised through 
the consolidated income statement, with the balance of the 
excess of the purchase price over the physical assets being 
carried as goodwill, which is subject to annual impairment testing. 
The amortisation expense arising from this in 2011 represents  
nine months’ amortisation, and has been treated as a special item 
and will continue to be so as the associated intangible assets  
are amortised down to zero.
•  Tax credits of £15 million of which £7.5 million related to historic 
issues that were closed during 2011, £5.1 million was in respect  
of the release of deferred tax associated with the amortisation  
of acquired intangibles and £2.4 million represented the tax relief 
from restructuring and site closure costs incurred during the year.
On an IFRS reported basis, Group revenue increased by 86% to 
£1,059 million, reflecting the effect of the PolymerLatex acquisition, 
and profit before tax declined to £39.4 million (2010 £54.2 million). 
Whilst underlying profit before tax doubled with the PolymerLatex 
acquisition, the IFRS results include the special items above.  
A loss from discontinued operations of £40.3 million was recorded 
in the year which principally represents the impairment of the  
non-core Pharma business offset by £4.1 million of operating  
profits prior to sale.
Balance sheet
Goodwill increased to £244.7 million at the end of 2011 from 
£124.0 million at the end of 2010. £164.2 million was recognised  
on acquisition of the PolymerLatex Group during the year, offset 
by a recognised impairment on the non-core Pharma business of 
£36.9 million at 30 June 2011, prior to its disposal on 30 November 
2011. Currency translation reduced goodwill by £6.6 million.
Acquired intangible assets increased to £165.4 million at 
31 December 2011 from £nil in the prior year. Acquired intangibles 
of £191.2 million were recognised as a result of the acquisition of 
the PolymerLatex Group and Quality Polymers Sdn Bhd, relating  
to customer relationships and technology. These additions were 
offset by amortisation charges of £19.1 million and currency 
translation adjustments of £6.7 million.
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) was £183.6 million at 
31 December 2011 compared to £102.6 million at 31 December 
2010. Additions during the year comprised £25.5 million of capital 
expenditure and £120.4 million due to acquisitions. £31.8 million  
of the acquired asset value resulted from fair value adjustments. 
These additions were offset by depreciation, exchange adjustments 
and an impairment on the Pharma assets prior to sale. Business review Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 19
Deferred tax liability has increased from £6.7 million to £61.4  
million during the year. The primary driver of this movement  
was the recognition of deferred tax liabilities on the recognised 
intangible assets and PPE fair value uplifts.
Pensions
In the main UK defined benefit pension scheme the majority  
of investments are in equities. Equities were little changed over 
the course of 2011. The yield on high-quality corporate bonds 
decreased substantially (0.6%) during the year, which increased 
liabilities. The Company made cash contributions to the fund  
in the year of £12.6 million. The overall effect of these changes  
was that there was an increase in the accounting deficit of  
the scheme, which stood at £73.9 million at the end of 2011  
(2010 £56.5 million).
The UK scheme was closed to future accrual during 2009 and 
there are no active members in the scheme. 
Overseas net pension liabilities increased to £44.1 million (2010 
£9.5 million) reflecting the inclusion of liabilities in the PolymerLatex 
Germany scheme of some £34.5 million. The PolymerLatex scheme 
is a traditional German unfunded ‘on balance sheet’ arrangement.

Underlying net borrowings increased significantly during the  
year to £164.3 million with the additional leverage for the 
PolymerLatex acquisition.
Group pro-forma EBITDA increased substantially to £132.2 million 
reflecting the PolymerLatex acquisition.
Capital expenditure increased substantially in 2011 to £24.2 million 
(£21.9 million net of proceeds from asset disposals). This reflects 
the increased scale of the Group.
Underlying working capital outflow for the year was an outflow  
of £5.0 million (IFRS basis £14.8 million). After a substantial  
outflow in the first half of 2011, the position mainly reversed  
on the back of lower input costs and volumes over the second 
half of the year. Control of working capital is a core focus of the 
business management.
Cash spend on acquisitions comprised the £386.1 million we 
spent on PolymerLatex (of which £216.9 million was funded from 
the rights issue) and £10.1 million spent on Quality Polymer, the 
Malaysian dispersion business purchased in October. Divestment 
proceeds of £34.2 million were received for the sale of the  
Pharma business (comprising £28.5 million in cash and £5.7  
million deferred consideration).
Whilst net borrowings overall increased to £164.3 million, this 
closing position represents a reduction of over £70 million from  
the position at the date of the PolymerLatex acquisition.
Financing and liquidity
As at the year end the Group had US private placement debt  
(net of derivatives) of £75 million, and £14 million in a four year 
amortising loan in Malaysian ringgit. In December 2010 the Group 
agreed a new three year £210 million loan facility (comprising  
a term loan of £150 million, and an undrawn revolving facility of  
£60 million) for the acquisition of PolymerLatex. This loan facility 
had an original maturity of December 2013, but during 2011 this 
date was extended to March 2015. In aggregate this amounts to 
£299 million of term debt at the end of year of which £239 million 
was borrowed.
Alongside the undrawn £60 million loan facility, the Group had 
£86 million of cash in hand. Repayments due in 2012 under loan 
arrangements comprise £24 million (net of derivatives) of US private 
placements and £4 million under the Malaysian loan facility.
In arriving at the Group’s net borrowings, some £20.9 million 
of non recourse off balance sheet factoring has been added 
back. Excluding this adjustment net borrowings would have been 
£143.4 million.
Underlying pro-forma net borrowings to EBITDA, the Group’s  
key leverage metric, was 1.2 at the end of 2011.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Introduction
2011 was a year which saw very significant changes for the  
Yule Catto Group with the integration of PolymerLatex from  
April onwards and the sale of Uquifa at the end of November.  
The sale of Uquifa in particular, following the sale of other chemical 
businesses operating in a range of sectors, changed the Group to 
an almost exclusive focus on relatively high-volume water-based 
polymers. This change in structure, coupled with the location of 
most of the PolymerLatex sites on integrated chemical parks, 
means that comparisons with previous years are harder to make 
than usual. Nonetheless the outturn figures on many of our headline 
environmental measures, especially water and energy use per tonne 
of production, are very significantly better than previous years.
For the Yule Catto Group, water use per tonne of production fell  
by 26.5% and energy use fell by 10.5% in 2011 compared to 2010. 
The fall in energy use led to a fall in carbon dioxide emitted per 
tonne of 10.7% and this was accompanied by a further reduction 
of 78.6% in the sulphur dioxide emissions per tonne of production. 
This latter figure comes on top of the >99% reduction in sulphur 
dioxide production already achieved by the Group in the 10 years  
to 2010. For continuing activities the production of waste was  
also sharply better, seeing a reduction of more than a third in the 
waste produced per tonne. However, there was an exceptional 
amount of waste exported by the Kluang site as material previously 
deposited in an on-site landfill was moved to a secure landfill off-
site. It should be noted that the waste was included in the figures  
for waste production in previous years; and that the movement  
was a one-off event which will not be repeated. It has therefore 
been treated as an exceptional item and excluded from the 
environmental KPI tables and the year on year graphs.
There was a rise in the number of personal injury accidents in  
the Group for the second year in a row, though the rate achieved  
is considerably less than half the rate being achieved 10 years ago. 
This rise has been discussed in the Group from shop floor to the 
Board and programmes are being developed, involving staff at all 
levels, to return our performance to our previous best – and then  
to improve it further. It is also notable that the absolute total costs  
of water and energy both more than doubled during the year –  
the Group’s energy bill rose to £23.25 million – and that, despite  
the improved performance achieved, the cost per tonne of each  
one rose by 21%. Achieving the Group’s environmental targets 
remains a very high priority both for social responsibility and for 
business reasons. 
The UK Chemical Industries Association (CIA), in common with 
other national associations, set the industry sustainable development 
targets for its 2010 performance. Given the changing nature of the 
UK chemical industry these targets are difficult to carry forward 
for the industry as a whole but we have continued to use them 
as one marker of our performance. On the measures we focus 
on we continue to improve and the Group has remained ahead 
of the notional 2011 targets on all the measures. We have also 
continued to meet our targets on involvement in our Safety Health 
and Environments (SHE) system as measured by staff ‘Near Miss’ 
reporting (more properly hazard reporting and removal) rates.  
These achievements are a continuing tribute to the hard work  
and commitment of our staff to SHE improvement.
Our policy commitments
Yule Catto’s central commitments to good SHE performance  
remain unchanged. The Group remains committed to both the  
global chemical industry’s Responsible Care
®
 initiative and to the 
principles of Sustainable Development as set out in the UK CIA 
Sustainable Development (SD) guiding principles.
Responsible Care
®
 aims to improve and enhance the chemical 
industry’s SHE performance, year on year. Yule Catto has  
been committed to Responsible Care
®
 since the 1990s and this 
commitment remains at the core of our efforts towards excellence  
in Corporate Social Responsibility. All Yule Catto sites are required 
to adhere to these principles and actively support the Group’s efforts 
to achieve continuous improvement in our SHE performance.
The Yule Catto Group has been committed to the CIA’s SD guiding 
principles since they were published in 2005 and we have reported 
annually against the targets set out in those principles each year 
since then. The commitment was re-confirmed in 2010 when 
the SD principles were re-signed by the current Chief Executive 
and the Chairman of the Yule Catto Board. The SD principles are 
followed by the Group’s sites around the world and are used both 
to set annual improvement targets, especially for our environmental 
performance, and to help the Group to define its route to a safe 
and sustainable business. Yule Catto’s principles include a strong 
commitment to open reporting of our environmental performance, 
reflected in this Annual Report, and full respect for the people and 
communities amongst whom we work.
As with quality systems, we accept the importance of demonstrating 
the strength of our environmental management systems through 
external accreditation. By using the strengths of the new 
enlarged Group, Yule Catto has set itself the target of achieving 
uniform accreditation of the whole company to the environmental 
management standard ISO 14001 by the end of 2014.  Business review Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 21
With a significant part of our operations being in Europe, Yule Catto 
is heavily affected by the EU’s carbon reduction commitments. 
These require very significant absolute reductions in carbon dioxide 
production over the period to 2020 and then an 80% reduction 
by 2050. As reported below, Yule Catto has already achieved 
very significant reductions in specific energy use (that is energy 
consumption per tonne of production). We also already have  
a long-term commitment to take low carbon energy (electricity)  
from the waste incinerator built next to Synthomer’s Stallingborough 
plant, which was built expressly for this purpose. To continue this 
improvement, and safeguard our operations in the changing energy 
environment, Yule Catto is committed to seeking to decarbonise 
our energy supply and will continue to seek to use carbon-neutral 
energy supply options where feasible.
Yule Catto has been a member of FTSE4Good for a number  
of years and is committed to maintaining our membership of  
that index.
SHE performance and achievements during 2011
The long-term performance of Yule Catto against our targets and 
metrics improved noticeably in 2011 and in nearly all areas set high 
standards of performance for the new Group. Of the five ‘headline’ 
measures used to monitor Group performance two showed 
significant improvement over 2010, two were broadly neutral  
and one deteriorated.
Both energy and water use showed very significant gains, with 
energy use per tonne of production improving by 10.5% and water 
use by 26.5%. Both energy and water use are less than 50%  
of what they were in 2001. Despite these gains the cost of energy  
and water both rose by 21% per tonne. ‘Near Miss’ reporting –  
a leading indicator of both staff involvement and sites’ intent to 
spot and remove hazards – remained strong overall with the Group 
achieving nearly four ’Near Miss’ reports per employee during 
the year, easily exceeding the target of three. Further, different 
measures of staff involvement in the SHE system are being 
discussed, particularly with the newer sites, to ensure maximum 
involvement by staff in all regions.
The total amount of hazardous waste produced in 2011 was the 
same as in 2010, despite production being 68% higher. Of this 
waste 63% was able to be either recycled or recovered, or burnt 
as a fuel – in a cement kiln for example. The most difficult of the 
remaining hazardous wastes have to be incinerated, which is energy 
consuming and environmentally unpopular. In 2011, over 1,200 
tonnes less had to be incinerated, despite the increased production. 
However, this reduction in incineration meant that the amount  
to be disposed of to landfill increased more than the increase  
in production, giving a rise in the amount of hazardous waste sent  
to landfill for the second year in a row. Whilst the amount sent  
to landfill per tonne of production was above that seen in 2008/9,  
the absolute quantity was less than 60% of the 2000 amount, 
despite production having over doubled, and less than 35% of  
the extrapolated SD target.
The number of Reportable Lost Time Accidents (RLTAs) increased 
compared to 2010 with the Group’s RLTA frequency rate increasing 
to 0.42 per 100,000 hours worked. On a positive note, our site at 
Oulu in Finland achieved 10 years without a single day lost due to 
an accident. On many other measures environmental performance 
improved: despite increasing production at our Accrington site in 
2011 our measured discharges of heavy metals are less than 6% 
of the figures for 2000; our releases of acid gases to atmosphere 
reduced again and are now less than 0.2% of their 2000 values; 
and our releases of phosphorous to water were down by more  
than 50% compared to 2010 to just over 10% of their 2000 value 
(all on a per tonne basis).
Following further improvements to our measurement systems  
and increased output in Kluang, our recorded discharge of Volatile 
Organic Compounds (VOCs) increased again in 2011. A project to 
abate these releases is progressing and the recovery plant should 
be operational by the end of 2012 giving major reductions in 2013.
There were more reportable safety incidents in 2011 but the number 
of reportable environmental incidents fell.
The Yule Catto Board and the Group Executive Committee continue 
to monitor performance in all these areas and provide leadership  
in driving the Group to continued improvements across all aspects  
of SHE performance.
Managing safety and environmental performance
Safety and environmental performance is the responsibility of all 
Yule Catto staff and all staff are expected to be responsible for 
their own safety and to take care of those around them. Likewise 
all staff have a role to play in the environmental performance of our 
sites, whether it is in recycling, energy conservation or managing 
their site’s environmental performance. The management of safety 
and environmental performance is fully integrated into Yule Catto’s 
management structure with all staff having responsibility for those 
who report to them.
Yule Catto has two principal systems to assist in the management 
of SHE. All accidents (events which cause personal injury) and 
incidents (events which cause property damage, environmental 
release, cause complaints or result in other harm) are recorded  
in the Group’s AIMS (Accident and Incident Management System) 
database. AIMS has been in place for nearly 10 years and the 
system is used both to record and categorise, then to manage  
the investigation of all accidents and incidents. The system is also 
used to record and manage Near Misses: events or hazardous 
situations which under other circumstances could have caused  
an accident or incident. The system provides a way of tracking 
events and examining what is happening on our sites for trends  
or common failings. Business review Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 22
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
continued
The second system is a set of management policies and procedures 
which make up the Yule Catto SHE Management System (SHEMS). 
The elements of this system set the standards sites are expected 
to achieve and provide guidance on how they should achieve those 
standards. It covers most areas of SHE performance and provides 
comprehensive coverage of the procedures Yule Catto expects 
all sites to have in place. Sites are expected to operate to these 
standards, or to equivalent standards when they have their own 
suitable standards already in place.
SHE performance is always a primary duty for management at all 
levels in the Group. The practices adopted in previous years remain 
a cornerstone of our efforts towards continuous improvement in 
SHE performance. The practices include:
•  SHE performance is discussed in all management meetings,  
as the first agenda item;
•  Yule Catto conduct regular, in-depth SHE audits of all sites to 
assess performance and identify opportunities for improvement. 
The results of the audits are discussed both with the site  
involved and with wider management, for example at the Group 
Executive committee;
•  The Group AIMS is used to collect and analyse data on all 
accidents, incidents and ‘Near Misses’ on our sites. The system 
ensures that all of these are appropriately investigated, with  
the most serious or potentially serious incidents being fully 
investigated to root causes. The system is then used to ensure 
that the identified actions to prevent recurrence are put in place;
•  Sites are expected to implement policies, procedures and 
practices in line with the Group’s Safety, Health and Environment 
Management System (SHEMS), and to provide training for all  
their staff to ensure that these are used by staff at all times;
•  Key measures of SHE performance are collected monthly or 
quarterly as appropriate and reported to the Group Executive and 
to the Board. This process is mirrored at company and site level to 
give management and staff a clear picture of current performance;
•  Key leading performance indicators, covering items such as 
inspections and engineering performance metrics, are being 
collected and reported to senior management to give assurance  
of good performance at site hardware level;
•  Senior managers have SHE targets as part of their annual 
objectives. Other employees have similar objectives set,  
either on an individual or a site basis; and
•  Group SHE visits sites to carry out training and development  
of key staff.
Health, safety and accident performance
The most widely used comparative measures of Occupational  
Safety are lost time accident rates, either all Lost Time Accidents 
(LTAs) or ‘Reportable’ – that is over three days away from work – 
Lost Time Accidents (RLTAs). Yule Catto has for many years used 
RLTAs as our primary measure and it is disappointing to report  
that the Group’s performance on RLTAs was slightly worse in 2011 
than in 2010. There were 23 RLTAs in the year and, although this 
is for a larger company, there was a consequent rise in the Group’s 
RLTA frequency rate from 0.36 to 0.42 per 100,000 hours worked 
(100,000 hours is, very broadly, a working lifetime). Despite this 
rise, in 2011 a Yule Catto employee was still much less than half  
as likely to have a reportable accident in 201 1, as they were in 2001.
The number of accidents resulting in less than three days lost time 
(LTA’s) also increased in 2011. This meant that the Group was just 
below the most recently reported frequency rate for all lost time 
accidents quoted by the European Chemical Industry Council, 
(Cefic) in their Responsible Care report for 2010. The UK chemical 
industry remains amongst the safest manufacturing industries in  
the world and the UK Chemical Industries Association (CIA) collects 
data on its member’s performance. Yule Catto’s objective remains  
to be operating at or below the average accident frequency rate  
for CIA member companies, in all our operations around the world.

Process safety and reportable safety incidents
Process safety – the set of procedures and practices which ensure 
that our processes are safe to operate – is an essential topic in 
the chemical industry. Process incidents have the potential to be 
very damaging to people, plant and the environment – our aim is 
always to have multi-layered systems and procedures to prevent 
serious incidents. Process incidents and upsets which could lead to 
significant incidents are analysed and the lessons shared, internally 
and externally. This understanding is why Yule Catto contributed 
to and has benefited from the Institution of Chemical Engineers 
(IChemE) Process Safety Courses, for both operational staff and  
for senior managers.
There were an increased number of process safety incidents in 
2011. This included the failure of a pressure filter in our divested 
Pharma business, Uquifa, a reaction runaway in Kluang, and striking 
an unmarked 11kV cable during the removal of diseased trees on 
the Kluang plantation. Only the first of these caused any injury and 
none of these incidents caused any lasting environmental damage. 
The secondary safety system contained nearly all material in the 
reaction runaway in Kluang, and no material was lost off-site  
in Uquifa. 
Improved process safety procedures are a focus of work in Yule 
Catto, learning from the work done between HSE, EA and William 
Blythe in the last five years. A Process Safety Manager has been 
appointed in Malaysia and the strengthened central SHE team 
in Synthomer includes a process safety specialist. Two Process 
Safety training courses were run in-house in 2011, one for the Yule 
Catto Executive and senior managers; the second for technical, 
engineering and production staff across the Group. Staff in South 
Africa and Malaysia attended IChemE public courses in those 
countries. Further courses are planned for 2012.

Occupational health and hygiene
All of our sites have programmes to limit the exposure of our staff 
to hazardous materials and these programmes have shown notable 
progress over the last couple of years with significant improvements 
in handling systems at our Kluang site, for example. Our aim is 
always to limit the exposure of our staff to the chemicals they 
handle, using the standard hierarchy of removal, reduction, control 
and protection. Much of our chemistry is complex and precise, 
necessarily using hazardous materials to give our products the exact 
qualities required to satisfy our customers’ needs. For this reason 
it will never be possible to remove all hazardous chemicals from our 
sites and this in turn means that control of exposure by engineering 
means, backed up by the extensive use of Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE), will always be a focus of activity for operational 
and SHE staff. To assist in the thorough assessment of the risk to 
our staff from exposure to hazardous chemicals, the Group has an 
assessment programme based on the principles of the UK Control 
of Substances Hazardous to Health regulations. This system  
has continued to be rolled out to our sites and is now in use on  
all sites except the former PolymerLatex sites. Assessment of  
the adequacy of controls at site level, and the provision of advice  
on how to improve controls on chemical exposure, has continued  
to be a matter of discussion during – and recommendations 
following – the Group SHE audits.
The health of our staff is monitored by a comprehensive set 
of medical arrangements on each site. Staff who work with 
chemicals are provided with regular medical examinations by trained 
occupational health nurses or doctors. Whilst always respecting 
medical confidentiality, the occupational health personnel who 
provide the service to each site, inform the local company in the 
case of a Reportable Disease which could be caused by a work 
activity. They are also asked to inform the company if their overview 
of the health of our staff causes them concern. 
Audit programme
Yule Catto has an internal SHE auditing programme whereby an 
internal team reviews the SHE performance of sites on a two year 
rolling cycle. The reports from the audits are used to provide  
senior management – at site, Divisional and Group level – with  
a consistent view of the SHE performance of Group operations.  
The audits incorporate a scoring system and were developed from 
the principles of the CIA’s Responsible Care
®
 management system. 
The audits are used to provide recommendations to each site on 
priority areas for improvement.
The results of the audits are monitored closely by the Group 
Executive Committee, who are committed to achieving high 
standards of SHE performance on all Yule Catto sites. An overview 
of the outcome of the audits is also discussed by the Yule Catto 
Board. During 2011 some auditing resources were reallocated at 
both site and Group level, to give support to sites to improve their 
SHE performance where problems have been identified. The audit 
programme in 2012 will mainly focus on sites which have recently 
joined the Yule Catto Group. Business review Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 24

Asset protection and insurance inspections
There were no major insured losses in 2011 and the re-instatement 
of the Stallingborough Latex plant, after a fire in 2010, was 
completed. The Group has continued to work closely with our 
property insurers to ensure that our risks are accurately understood 
by the underwriters and the correct insurance is in place. This  
process continues to be aided by the series of twice-yearly 
meetings held with the insurer’s risk management team to discuss 
the Group’s risk profile; and by the biennial insurance surveys  
carried out during a joint visit by the insurers and Yule Catto’s 
internal auditors. The surveys are a useful opportunity for the  
Yule Catto auditors to discuss current standards and thinking with 
the insurance surveyors, and have identified areas where sites  
can make improvements. The improvements made following these 
visits have enabled our sites to improve the insurer’s rating of our 
risk profile and this improvement has enabled the Group to control 
our insurance costs.
Regulatory Affairs: REACH and GHS
2011 was a year of reduced external regulatory pressure as 
the 2010 deadline for GHS (Globally Harmonised System) 
implementation had passed and the next deadline for REACH  
(The EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction  
of Chemicals regulations) registration is not until June 2013.  
Despite this the regulatory workload was significant with a 
continuing rise in customer expectations, the need to consolidate 
GHS and be ready for the next stages of REACH; and – for 
Synthomer – the need to integrate all Synthomer’s sites across  
the world in a new global structure.
All Yule Catto’s European operations have successfully switched  
to GHS as the new system for labelling chemicals with their 
hazards. So far the switch has only applied to single chemicals,  
with mixtures not due to change until 2015. Nonetheless the impact 
was significant and work is continuing to be ready for the next 
change. The impact of the new system was also seen on our sites 
around the world as other countries adopted the new system.  
The switch meant submitting dossiers on 60 chemicals to the 
European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which was done on time 
without problem.
Preparatory work has continued for the next round of REACH 
registrations in 2013, though the bulk of the work will fall into 2012. 
The costs in 2012/3 are expected to be around £1 million for the 
registrations Yule Catto companies need to make.
Feedback from customers and suppliers on our Regulatory Affairs 
work continues to be very good and the service we give in this area 
is recognised as an essential part of our business offering. The new 
Group structure has provided the opportunity for the concentration 
of expertise into a central Regulatory Affairs Group, mainly in 
Harlow, serving the whole of the polymer business. This centre 
of excellence in the Company provides an ‘Only Representative’ 
service to the whole polymer business, easing access to European 
markets. It also ensures that the right information is provided to 
all our customers around the world and that the Group remains 
compliant in the changing regulatory landscape.
Sustainable Development  
Performance Report 2011
Managing our environmental responsibilities
As a company Yule Catto is committed to operating in conformity 
to local laws and regulations and to improving its environmental 
performance year on year. The Group are also signatory to the 
programme of Sustainable Development (SD) goals put forward by 
UK Chemical Industry Association (CIA) to its member companies in 
2005 – indeed Yule Catto were one of the first signatory companies 
to those principles. The Company’s commitment to these SD goals 
has led to a significant reduction of our environmental impacts since 
2000. The commitment has also been shown by our continuous 
record of investment in environmental improvement and an equally 
continuous record of achievement against the targets set. The targets 
used internally over the last five years have been those which were 
set by CIA: these were set for the period up to 2010. The chemical 
industry, at both national and European level is currently discussing 
how SD targets should be set for the future and so, until these 
discussions are completed Yule Catto have extrapolated the existing 
targets forward for 2011.
Not all of the Group’s measures of our SD performance are 
recorded in the graphs presented in this report. Most of the  
other measures which we use internally also show very significant 
improvement over the last 10 years. As examples: our releases of 
nitrogen oxides to air have fallen by more than 75% per production 
tonne since 2000; our releases of phosphorous to water have  
fallen by nearly 90% since 2000; and our releases of heavy  
metals are down from 4.5 gm/tonne to 0.106 gm/tonne, a better 
than 96% reduction. These have been achieved by investment  
in better systems for environmental control; the development  
of better processes; better process control focusing on avoiding 
releases and other losses; and incremental improvement in the 
operational systems on our sites. All of this is underpinned by the 
performance of our site staff, who have driven improvement and 
whose aims are to produce better quality product, using more 
carefully husbanded resources, whilst producing less waste.
This record of success is reflected in the formally reported SD 
measures, all of which have improved both in 2011 and very 
considerably since 2000. All of the SD targets set for the Group 
have been comfortably bettered. There were three measures on 
which the Group performed less well in 2010: energy, waste and 
VOC releases. In 2011 the Group significantly improved its energy 
performance and regained its long-term trend. For our continuing 
operations waste production per tonne of product was down and  
the proportion being recycled was up. On absolute VOC releases, 
there was a further increase in the declared quantity but schemes 
now in place are expected to significantly reduce releases from  
the end of 2012. Business review Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 25
Energy
Specific energy consumption measured across the Yule Catto  
Group improved by over 10% in 2011. This continues the long-term 
trend and means that in 2011 the Group used less than half the 
energy per tonne that was used in 2001, and that consumption  
was 38% better than the extrapolated 2011 target. The reduction  
in 2011 has been helped by different technologies brought into  
the Group from PolymerLatex and the use of these across the 
Group offers opportunities for further improvements in future.
Despite the improvements achieved, the cost of energy remains 
a significant challenge to Yule Catto with the energy bill rising 
to £23.25 million. This represented a 21% increase in the cost 
of energy per tonne of production compared to 2010. The most 
significant part of this was electricity use where the electricity 
consumed fell by 16% per tonne of production but the cost  
of electricity rose by 17% per tonne of production.
The reduction in specific energy use has improved the Group’s 
carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions per tonne and this is reflected in  
the Global Warming burden discussed below. The CO 2 release 
figure quoted in the environmental KPI section does include both the 
direct release from carbon fuels burned on-site and the calculated 
release from the electricity consumed. Yule Catto’s CO 2 releases 
have fallen in line with the reduction in energy used and this is a 
significant contribution to reducing overall CO 2 emissions. However, 
in line with our goal of decarbonising the Group’s energy use, we 
will be exploring different energy supplies with the aim of reducing 
CO 2 releases faster than improvements in our energy consumption. 
This will put the Group in line with the EU’s commitment to 
decarbonisation of energy supplies and help us meet national 
governments’ targets, most notably in Britain and Germany.

Global warming
There are two significant releases from Yule Catto companies 
which contribute to global warming: CO 2 released during energy 
generation and the release of VOCs. The improvement in  
energy consumption has been discussed above and this led  
to a 10.6% improvement in CO 2 releases. Unfortunately reported 
VOC releases increased for the third year in a row. The increase  
was concentrated at our Kluang NBR plant and was due to 
continued improvements in the measurements and calculation  
of VOC releases, and to further increases in the production of 
nitrile latex to supply the rapid expansion of glove manufacturing 
in Malaysia. Across the Yule Catto Group, absolute VOC releases 
increased by over 50% in 2011, though per tonne of production 
VOC releases fell by just over 8%.
The combination of these two improvements meant that the  
global warming burden of the Group’s activities improved in 2011 
by some 10%, reversing the slight upward trend seen in the last 
two years and giving the Group its best ever performance. In 2011 
Group performance was nearly 60% better than it was in 2001  
and the Group was just less than 25% below the extrapolated  
target for 2011.
After a period spent examining different options a scheme to 
recover a large proportion of the VOC released from the NBR plant 
at Kluang has been developed and the project is expected to be 
constructed during 2012. Significant reductions in VOC release 
should be seen once the recovery plant is running.

Atmospheric acidification
There was a further sharp reduction in the Group’s emissions of 
acid gases in 2011 with the amount of sulphur dioxide (SO
2
) falling 
by a further 65% to less than 10 tonnes for the year. The Group’s 
emissions per tonne of SO
2
 are now less than 0.2% of what they 
were in 2000 and less than 0.4% of the extrapolated 2011 target.  
It is worth stressing that the change is due to real reduction 
achieved by Yule Catto companies over the 10 year period, not just 
changes due to the structure of the Group. The residual emissions 
are almost entirely due to the quality of gas and oil used in sites’ 
boilers or electrical generation sets. Given the variable quality of gas 
and oil in different countries, further reductions will be quite difficult 
to achieve in future.

Water use
Water consumption by Yule Catto’s companies underwent a step 
change in 2011, reducing by 26.5% compared to the year before. 
Whilst a large part of this is due to different technology used on 
the former PolymerLatex sites, requiring far less cooling water, it is 
notable that the other European sites in Synthomer also reduced 
their water consumption significantly during the year. Water use  
per tonne of production has now reduced by nearly two thirds since 
2000 (64.5% reduction) and is less than 45% of the extrapolated 
target for 2011. Despite this very large improvement, the cost of 
water increased by 21% on a per tonne basis.
Water is a vital resource for nearly all chemical plants and this is 
especially true for our polymer manufacturing units, where the final 
product is a dispersion in water. The water is also an essential part 
of the safety system in our polymer reactors, ensuring that heat can 
be absorbed and transferred out of the system. For both of these 
reasons secure and high quality water is a vital resource for our 
plants. We are fortunate in Malaysia that on our Kluang site we have 
on-site water collection systems which provide the great majority  
of our water. This on-site supply has now been strengthened by the 
provision of a further piped supply from off-site sources. Elsewhere 
in the Group we are aware that there is significant growth in demand 
for water in the areas around our sites, as improvements to living 
standards and further industrialisation continue.  
There are also constraints on supply which exist currently and  
which may become more severe if weather patterns change with 
global warming. The Group continues to target a 4% reduction  
in water use per tonne each year and further initiatives to reduce  
water usage are underway, with trials re-using cleaned effluent 
water for vessel washing – which is a constant and important use  
of water on our polymer plants – proposed in 2012.

Waste disposal
For a number of years the site in Kluang operated an on-site landfill 
in a disused part of the plantation which, whilst acknowledged by 
the authorities, was not fully licensed. In recent years the landfill  
was only used for non-hazardous waste and there is no known harm 
resulting from this activity. However in 2010 it was decided between 
the Malaysian authorities and the site that the landfill should be 
closed and the land returned to beneficial use. This operation 
involved the removal of 29,599 tonnes of material. Though some 
natural rubber was able to be recovered for beneficial use, the great 
majority went to an off-site landfill. The operation lasted for several 
months and the site has now been restored. Monitoring protocols  
to confirm that there is no environmental impact have been agreed 
with the Malaysian Department of the Environment and the land  
is likely to return to being part of the plantation, once settlement  
has finished.
This material from the landfill, was included in the figures for waste 
production in previous years and declared as ‘waste disposed  
to on-site landfill’. This waste movement has therefore not been 
included in the figures for 2011.
The total amount of hazardous waste produced in 2011 was the 
same as in 2010, despite production being 68% higher. Of this 
waste 63% was able to be either recycled or recovered, or burnt  
as a fuel – in a cement kiln for example. Over 1,200 tonnes less  
had to be incinerated, despite the increased production. This left  
an amount to be disposed of to landfill which increased in line with 
the increase in production. Whilst the amount sent to landfill per 
tonne of production was above that seen in 2008/9, the quantity 
was roundly one quarter of the figure in 2000 and less than 35%  
of the extrapolated Sustainable Development target. Business review Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 27

10 Year Target Actual
Hazardous waste disposed to land
(Tonnes waste per production tonne)
The quantity of non-hazardous waste going to landfill fell again  
in 2011 and is now little more than 10% of the quantity disposed  
of to landfill in 2000. This has been achieved by the imaginative  
use of recycling, recovery and reuse of waste materials, in particular 
the use of polymer waste as a soil improver when incorporated  
into compost. This process suffered a hiccough in 2011 while the  
UK DoE reassessed the process to ensure its acceptability. For a 
period material previously going to composting, had to go to landfill, 
which significantly increased the quantity sent to landfill during  
the year. However DoE re-authorised the process and composting 
has recommenced, with an improvement in UK site performance 
and genuine environmental benefits.
The use of imaginative, environmentally friendly disposal routes  
has been so successful that for a number of Synthomer’s sites,  
the net production of waste is now zero – all their waste is recovered, 
recycled or reused. The lessons learned by these sites are being 
shared with other sites in the Yule Catto Group, to reduce the 
quantity of waste requiring final disposal still further.

Environmental incidents 
The headline number of environmentally reportable incidents 
which led to a release which involved the environmental regulators, 
fell to seven in 2011. All of the incidents have been investigated 
to determine their cause, and to determine what preventive 
or mitigation measures should be put in place to prevent any 
environmental harm. None of the incidents during the year were 
found to have caused more than transitory environmental harm.
Five of these releases were problems in the outflow from the 
Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) in either Kluang or Durban,  
South Africa. The Durban site planned to construct a new ETP 
during 2011 but this was not possible due to delays in receiving 
regulatory approval. Approval has now been received and the 
scheme will be completed in 2012, which should give an outflow 
well below the current consent limits. It should also ensure that 
excursions away from the consent limits are much less likely.
In Kluang, the NBR plant ETP was significantly improved during  
the year by putting an ammonia stripper unit in the outfall.  
This deals directly with one of the environmental incidents in 2011. 
Improvements are currently being planned for both of the ETP  
at Kluang to deal with the other environmental incidents which 
have occurred there over the past two years. Also, although the 
site is currently in consent, Synthomer’s Vietnam plant is currently 
investing in a new combined chemical and biological ETP to  
meet tightening consent limits.

Environmental KPIs
The UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) published guidelines for reporting environmental key performance 
indicators in 2006. The key measures suggested were energy use, emissions to air, waste disposal and water consumption, on an absolute 
and a per tonne basis. Yule Catto has reported on these indicators for a number of years, and to aid transparency in environmental 
performance reporting Yule Catto adopted DEFRA’s preferred format in 2008 for the report on our 2007 performance. This format  
is used in the table below which gives the data for the period 2009/2011.

Director indemnity provisions
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, the directors of the 
Company have the benefit of a qualifying third-party indemnity 
provision which provides that they shall be indemnified by the 
Company against certain liabilities as permitted by Sections 232

by them in relation to any liability for which they are indemnified.  
The Company has purchased and maintains insurance against 
directors’ and officers’ liabilities in relation to the Company.
Share capital and control
Details of the Company’s share capital are contained in note 26 
to the financial statements. On 31 December 2010 194,217,582 
shares were provisionally allotted nil paid in connection with the 
rights issue announced on 13 December 2010. On 17 January 2011 
such 194,217,582 shares were allotted fully paid. No shares were 
re-purchased in 2011. A total of 38,517 shares were purchased 
on the open market on behalf of the shareholders who elected to 
participate in the dividend re-investment plan.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares, being the only class of issued share capital, as well as the 
powers of the Company’s directors, are set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained from 
Companies House or can be downloaded from the Company’s 
website. There are no restrictions on the voting rights attaching 
to the Company’s ordinary shares or on the transfer of securities 
in the Company. No person holds securities in the Company 
carrying special rights with regard to the control of the Company. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of 
securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights. Unless expressly specified to the contrary  
in the Articles of Association of the Company, the Company’s 
Articles of Association may be amended by special resolution  
of the Company’s shareholders.
Other than in relation to its borrowings which, unless certain 
conditions are satisfied, become repayable on a takeover, the 
Company is not party to any significant agreements that would  
take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following  
a takeover bid.
The Company does not have agreements with any director  
or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office  
or employment resulting from a takeover.
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating to  
a change of control. Outstanding options and awards would normally 
vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the 
satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time. Governance Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 32

Contractual arrangements
The Group has contractual and other arrangements with numerous  
third parties in support of its business operations. The disclosure  
in this report of information about any such third parties is  
not considered to be necessary for an understanding of the 
development, performance or position of the Group’s business.
Major shareholdings
Other than the shareholdings disclosed as directors’ interests in  
the Remuneration report as at 17 February 2011, the Company had 
been notified under Section 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority of the following significant

Employment policies
The Group gives every consideration to applications for  
employment from disabled persons. Employees who become 
disabled are given every opportunity to continue employment  
under normal terms and conditions with appropriate training,  
career development and promotion wherever possible. The Group 
seeks to achieve equal opportunities in employment through 
recruitment and training policies.
Authority to purchase own shares
The Company has a general authority, which expires at the 
conclusion of the 2012 Annual General Meeting, to make market 
purchases of not more than 33,988,076 of the Company’s ordinary 
shares in accordance with the terms of the special resolution passed 
at the 2011 Annual General Meeting. A resolution will be tabled  
at the 2012 Annual General Meeting to renew this authority.
Employee involvement
The Group is organised on a decentralised basis so as to promote 
greater employee involvement and better communications with 
employees. Each Group company is encouraged to make its 
employees aware of the financial and economic factors affecting  
the performance of the Company. Performance related bonus 
schemes are in operation in a number of Group companies.
A new long-term share incentive plan for directors and senior 
executives was introduced in 2011 with the approval of shareholders.
UK pension funds
The trustees have reviewed the independent investment 
management of the assets of the Company pension schemes in  
the UK and assured themselves of the security and controls in place. 
In particular, it is the trustees’ policy not to invest in Yule Catto 
shares nor lend money to the Company.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy is to make payments to creditors and other 
suppliers in accordance with terms of payment agreed at the 
time the contract of supply is made, subject to all the terms and 
conditions of the order being satisfied by the supplier. Trade creditor 
days of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2011 were 
28 days (2010 31 days) based on the ratio of trade creditors at the 
year end to the amounts invoiced during the year by trade creditors.
Charitable donations
Charitable donations in the year amounted to £53,500 (2010 
£73,507) There were no political donations during the year.
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditor
Each director of the Company confirms that, so far as he is aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor 
is unaware and that he has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor 
is aware of that information. For these purposes, relevant audit 
information means information needed by the Company’s auditor  
in connection with preparing their reports on pages 47 and 90.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Corporate governance
The Corporate Governance report is set out on pages 34 to 38  
and forms part of the report of the directors.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The directors have appropriately considered the Group’s principal 
risks and uncertainties including the following:
•  Conditions in the global economy, economic fluctuations in 
customer industries and volatility and cyclicality of the global 
chemicals and polymers markets may adversely affect the results 
of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Group;
•  Volatility in raw material prices and energy prices may adversely 
affect the profitability of the Group and its working capital position;
•  The failure of the Group to procure key raw materials may lead to 
production interruptions that may adversely affect the profitability 
of the Group and its working capital position;
•  The markets in which the Group operates are highly competitive 
and the Group may lose market share to other producers or  
sellers of water based polymers or to other products that can  
be substituted for the products of the Group; Governance Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 33
•  The Group operates in a number of different geographies  
which may present different legal and regulatory risks. In addition,  
the Group operates in a number of different tax regimes, which 
may increase the volatility of the effective tax rate and cash  
tax rate of the Group;
•  The ability of the Group to compete is highly dependent on its 
ability to develop technological innovations, to introduce new 
products and to protect its intellectual property, trade secrets  
and know-how. Failure to do so could have an adverse affect  
on the Group;
•  The Group may be liable for damages based on product liability 
claims brought against its customers in end-use markets. In 
addition, compliance with extensive environmental, health and 
safety laws and regulations could require material expenditure, 
changes in the operations of the Group or site remediation;
•  The manufacture, storage and transportation of chemicals is 
inherently dangerous and any incidents relating to the hazards 
which the Group faces may adversely affect its financial  
condition, results of operations and reputation;
•  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly  
impact the results of the operations of the Group and may 
significantly affect the comparability of financial results  
between financial periods;
•  Credit market conditions and credit ratings may restrict the  
ability of the Group to obtain credit facilities or to refinance  
its existing debt facilities in the longer term. In addition, interest  
rate fluctuations and increases in bank lending margins may 
increase the Group’s costs of borrowing in the longer term; and 
•  The Group has funding risks relating to defined benefit pension 
schemes and any deterioration in the value of assets in which  
the pension scheme has invested as against the financial 
obligations to make payments to members of the schemes  
could have an adverse affect on the Group.
Not all these risks can be managed or substantially mitigated.  
The Group has a number of key processes to effect reduction  
and some mitigation of operational risks where reasonably  
practical, including:
•  Active management processes to manage margins and  
recover input cost increases from customers;
•  Sourcing strategies to access multiple sources for key  
raw materials;
•  Actively managed innovation processes;
•  Product quality control and testing processes;
•  A centralised internal audit function dedicated to SHE issues,  
and programmes for continuous improvement across all major 
SHE areas; and 
•  Internal audit and business performance review processes,  
the format of which has been enhanced for 2012.
Financial risks are partly mitigated through currency and interest  
rate hedging and the Group has a policy on leverage limits  
and seeks to ensure it has adequate borrowing headroom  
on a 12 month forecast basis.
Going concern
The directors have acknowledged the latest guidance on going 
concern and in reaching their conclusions have taken into account 
factors including:
•  the Group’s Euro denominated £150 million term loan facility  
and £60 million multicurrency revolving credit facility the 
termination dates of which were extended from 13 December 
2013 to 31 March 2015 on 22 December 2011; and
•  the first repayment under the 2004 series private placement  
notes of US$43 million due in September 2012.
Further discussion on liquidity and financing is provided in the 
Financial review.
After making enquiries and taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, the directors have concluded  
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Key performance indicators
Management monitors a number of financial and non-financial 
key performance indicators, which are disclosed within the Chief 
Executive’s report, the Financial review and Corporate Social 
Responsibility report. These key performance indicators include 
divisional sales and underlying operating profit, net borrowings, 
reportable safety incidents, energy usage and water consumption.
Cautionary statement
The purpose of this report is to provide information to the members 
of the Company. It contains certain forward-looking statements 
with respect to the operations, performance and financial condition 
of the Group. By their nature, these statements involve uncertainty 
since future events and circumstances can cause results and 
developments to differ materially from those anticipated. The 
forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information 
available at the date of preparation of this report and the Company 
undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking 
statements. Nothing in this report should be construed as  
a profit forecast.
Auditor
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as the Company’s auditor  
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 11.00 am on 
Thursday 17 May 2012 at Manor of Groves Hotel, High Wych,

Report from the Chairman
This section of the annual report sets out how the Board and its 
Committees apply the principles of good governance in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) which was published  
in June 2010 by the Financial Reporting Council.
I am pleased that we were able to strengthen the effectiveness of 
the Board by the appointment of Mr N A Johnson, who will succeed 
me as Chairman in May. With regard to gender diversity we have 
taken note of the recommendations contained in the Davies Report 
on 'Women on Boards’. The Board will be seeking to address these 
points over time as it makes new appointments. A process is already 
well advanced to recruit three new independent non-executive 
directors to maintain Board balance following the retirement of 
myself and Dr Dobbie at the end of the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting and the resignation of Mr D D Fournier.
Our full statements on compliance and the application of the  
main principles of the Code are set out in the following sections  
of this report.

The Company considers that it has complied throughout the 
financial year ended 31 December 2011 with the provisions set out 
in the Code except in relation to the composition of the Board and 
its Committees and the annual re-election of all directors. Further 
details on these matters and how they have been addressed  
are set out in this report.
Application of the Code
The main principles of the Code were applied as follows:
Leadership and effectiveness
Operation of the Board
The activities of the Company are controlled by the Board which, 
during 2011, comprised two executive directors and five non-
executive directors until 1 September 2011 when Mr N A Johnson 
was appointed and the number of non-executive directors increased 
to six. Mr D D Fournier was appointed with effect from 1 January 
2012 and he resigned on 13 March 2012. The roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive are clearly divided between Mr P S Wood 
who heads the Board in his capacity as non-executive Chairman 
and Mr A M Whitfield who has responsibility for the running of 
the Company’s business as Chief Executive. The non-executive 
directors all have wide business and boardroom experience gained 
in a broad range of business sectors.
The Board has reserved to itself a schedule of matters which 
includes setting long-term objectives for the Group and the 
strategies to be employed in achieving them, setting policies 
in the areas of safety, health and the environment, recruitment 
and employment, risk management and treasury and, subject to 
materiality thresholds, decisions on the raising of capital, financial 
commitments, capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals and 
the prosecution, defence and settlement of litigation.
During 2011 the Board held six scheduled meetings to review 
current and projected performance and to determine strategic 
issues. The directors receive in advance full information on all 
matters to be discussed at Board meetings as well as a detailed 
review of performance prepared by the Chief Executive. The Board 
has established Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees 
which are discussed below.
In addition arrangements are made each year for the Board  
to visit up to two of the Group’s operational sites and meet local 
management. Ad hoc site visits are facilitated for individual  
non-executive directors on request. During 2011 the Board held a 
meeting at the offices and research & development facilities in Marl, 
Germany. In conjunction with the Board meeting presentations were 
given by the senior management of the Polymer Division and the 
directors visited the Group’s plants at the Marl chemical park.
The Board has delegated to the Chief Executive responsibility 
for the development and preparation of the business plan for the 
Group and the annual Group budget for recommendation to the 
Board. As the senior executive director, the Chief Executive is 
responsible for all aspects of day-to-day operational control of the 
Group and execution of the Group strategy. The Chief Executive 
has established and chairs an Executive Committee (whose other 
members are the Finance Director, the Chief Executive of the 
Polymer Division, the Deputy Finance Director, the Company 
Secretary and the Director of Group Human Resources) to assist 
him in the performance of his duties and which meets once  
a month. The Chairman has available to him the minutes of the 
Executive Committee and all directors receive a monthly trading 
summary and commentary from the Finance Director and an  
update report from the Chief Executive.
Board membership and balance
The Chairman, Chief Executive and senior independent director  
are identified on page 30. The Chairmen and members of the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees are identified below.  
The Board considers Mr D D Fournier was and that Dr A A Dobbie, 
Mr N A Johnson and Mr J K Maiden are independent in accordance 
with the provisions of the Code.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Governance Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 35
During 2011 the Company was not in compliance with the 
requirement of Code provision B.1.2 for half the Board, excluding 
the Chairman, to comprise independent non-executive directors. 
Following a recruitment exercise in 2011 the Board returned to 
compliance with this requirement with effect from 1 January 2012 
until 13 March 2012 when Mr Fournier resigned from the Board. 
The Board is seeking to return to compliance and has a well 
advanced recruitment process in hand for this purpose.
The Board held a total of six meetings in 2011. In addition the 
Chairman held one separate meeting with the non-executive 
directors without the executive directors being present to  
appraise the performance of the executive management. The  
non-executive directors also met once without the Chairman to 
appraise his performance.
The table below shows the number of meetings of the Board, Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees held during the year 
and the number of meetings attended by each director. Where a 
director is unable to attend a Board or Committee meeting his views 
on agenda items are canvassed in advance of the meeting and 
incorporated into the discussions.

The Committee has not implemented early adoption of the 
amendment to the Code requiring reporting on boardroom diversity 
policy, including gender, associated objectives and progress toward 
achieving them. The Committee will be giving consideration during 
2012 as to how to implement these requirements with effect from 
2013 as required by the Code.
Induction and training
Induction arrangements are in place in order to ensure new  
directors receive a full formal and tailored induction on appointment. 
The Chairman reviews and agrees the training and development 
needs of the directors and the skills and knowledge of the Board as 
a whole are updated by briefings provided by the Company’s internal 
resources and materials and seminars offered by external advisers.
Performance evaluation
Performance evaluations of the Board, its committees and  
its directors were carried out in the last year by the following  
internal processes:
•  an assessment of the performance of individual non-executive 
directors is carried out by the Chairman through a rolling 
programme of one-to-one discussions using performance 
evaluation questions as the centrepiece for those discussions. 
Every non-executive director is assessed in this way once a year;
•  the performance of the executive directors was reviewed in 
August 2011 at a meeting of the non-executive directors chaired 
by the Chairman;
•  a meeting of the non-executive directors (in the absence of the 
Chairman) chaired by the senior independent director was held  
in November 2011 to evaluate the performance of the Chairman, 
taking into account the views of the executive directors; and
•  the Board and its Committees carry out an annual self-
assessment of performance led by the Chairman and the 
Chairman of each committee respectively. The results of 
assessment questionnaires completed by those Chairmen  
were reviewed by the relevant committees and the Board  
and were shared with and discussed by the Board as a whole  
at its meeting in November 2011.
The Board is formulating its policy on the extent and frequency  
of any externally facilitated evaluation.
Non-executive directors are appointed for three-year terms.  
All directors will submit themselves for annual election for the  
first time with effect from the 2012 Annual General Meeting.  
The Board did not comply with this provision of the Code in 2011  
as it wished to fully consider its implications before doing so.
Board committees
The Board has formally established Nomination, Audit, and 
Remuneration Committees, each with their own terms of reference 
which set out their respective roles and the authority delegated  
to them by the Board. Copies of the terms of reference are  
available upon request from the Company Secretary and can  
also be downloaded from the Company’s website. During 2011  
the Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committees did not 
comply with the composition requirements of Code Provisions B.2.1,  
C.3.1 and D.2.1 respectively until 9 November 2011 when  
Mr Johnson joined the Committees. All non-executive directors  
have a standing invitation to attend Committee meetings unless  
they are notified otherwise. Governance Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 36
Audit Committee
During 2011 the Audit Committee comprised Mr J K Maiden 
(Chairman) and Dr A A Dobbie until 9 November 2011 when 
Mr N A Johnson joined the Committee. Mr Maiden is considered 
by the Board to have ‘recent and relevant financial experience’ for 
the purposes of Provision C.3.1 of the Code due to his current 
financial position outside the Group. The Committee has established 
a detailed remit regarding the application of financial reporting and 
internal control principles, which covers:
•  monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group 
and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance and reviewing significant financial reporting 
judgements contained therein; and
•  reviewing the Group’s internal financial controls and the Group’s 
internal control and risk management systems.
The Finance Director and senior members of his department 
attend meetings of the Committee as part of the review of the 
Group’s interim and financial statements prior to their submission 
to the Board. The Committee meets periodically with the 
Company’s auditor to discuss the adequacy of the Group’s 
financial management, internal controls and information systems. 
The Committee’s remit also includes the review of the terms of 
engagement, effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the 
auditor (including the extent of non-audit services and fees payable 
to the auditor) which is carried out and discussed with the auditor on 
a periodic basis. With regard to seeking to ensure the independence 
and objectivity of the auditor, the Audit Committee’s policy is to 
avoid the auditor providing services in areas which may create or 
be perceived to create a conflict of interest. Accordingly, other 
than in circumstances where time constraints render it impractical 
or assignments are of a minor nature, the auditor is not invited to 
tender or propose for services of the following nature: corporate 
finance, legal, information technology and systems, recruitment or 
remuneration, accounting, internal audit or control, acquisition due 
diligence, valuations or appraisals, actuarial or general business 
consulting. In addition the auditor has been requested not to provide 
services to executive directors or senior executives. Non-executive 
directors are required to disclose any relationship they have with  
the auditor.
For 2011 the Group did not have a dedicated internal audit function 
and use was made periodically of outsourced internal audit services. 
During 2011 the Committee reviewed this in view of the significant 
increase in the size of the Group as a result of the acquisition of 
PolymerLatex. The Committee has concluded that whilst there 
are in place appropriate procedures for assuring the integrity and 
effectiveness of the Group’s governance, risk management and 
control processes these should be supplemented by a formalised 
programme of outsourced internal audit services. The Board has 
accepted this recommendation and this new function will operate 
from the first quarter of 2012 with reports being made to the 
Committee twice a year.
The current auditor was first appointed in 2002 and its appointment 
was reviewed by the Committee in 2009. The senior statutory 
auditor is subject to retirement every seven years and in accordance 
with this requirement Mr R Knight replaced Mr S Henderson with 
effect from the 2011 audit. Details of audit and non-audit fees  
paid to them in 2011 are set out in note 6 on page 64. Non-audit 
fees principally relate to tax compliance and advisory services.  
The Board accepts the Committee’s recommendation that the 
current auditor be proposed for reappointment at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
The Committee met formally five times during 2011 and carried  
out the following main activities:
•  Reviewed the financial statements in the 2010 annual report  
and the 2011 interim statement;
• Reviewed the scope and effectiveness of the external audit
•  Monitored the effectiveness of the internal controls  
and risk management;
•  Received reports from the external auditor on the major  
findings of its work;
• Approved the annual audit plan;
• Reviewed its remit.
In addition the Chairman of the Committee had regular dialogue  
with the auditor during the course of the year. As well as complying 
with the terms of its remit during the year the Committee carried  
out a review of its content.
Nomination Committee
During 2011 the Nomination Committee comprised Mr P S Wood 
(Chairman), Dr A A Dobbie, Mr J K Maiden and Mr A M Whitfield. 
On 9 November 2011 Mr N A Johnson joined the Committee. 
The Committee is responsible for: the regular review of the 
structure, size and composition of the Board and the making of 
recommendations with regard to any changes; leading the process 
for Board appointments and nominating candidates for non-
executive positions; and considering succession planning.
The Committee led the process for nominating Mr N A Johnson 
and Mr D D Fournier for appointment as independent non-executive 
directors. This process involved a thorough review of a range 
of candidates put forward by a recruitment consultancy, which 
conducted an extensive search process. The diversity (including 
gender) of the Board was taken into account by the Committee; 
however an appropriate female candidate could not be found for 
nomination at that time.
The Nomination Committee held two formal meetings during 2011 
and a number of informal meetings and telephone calls as well as 
numerous interviews in connection with the nomination process 
referred to above.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
continued Governance Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 37
The election by the Board of Mr Johnson as Chairman to succeed 
Mr Wood with effect from the close of the 2012 Annual General 
Meeting was based on the specification for the role as fulfilled 
by Mr Wood. In addition, in making the appointment the Board 
assessed the expected time commitment required of Mr Johnson  
in the role of Chairman and was satisfied that this was not at  
odds with his other significant commitments which are set out  
on page 30.
As a result of the resignation of Mr Fournier, the retirement  
of Mr Wood and Dr Dobbie and Mr Johnson assuming the role  
of Chairman, there is an immediate need for the appointment  
of one additional independent non-executive director and the  
need for two further independent non-executive directors to be  
appointed by May 2012 in order for continued compliance with  
Code Provision B.1.2. Accordingly the Committee has a well 
advanced recruitment process in hand.
Remuneration Committee
All matters relating to the Remuneration Committee and 
remuneration are covered in the Remuneration report, set out  
on pages 39 to 45.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional investors is conducted on a regular basis 
by the Chief Executive and the Finance Director and meetings take 
place following the announcement of interim and full year results 
and at other times according to circumstances.
The Board has adopted a set of shareholder communication 
principles in order to ensure that Board members develop an 
understanding of the views of the Group’s major shareholders. 
These principles require the Chairman to be present with the 
Chief Executive and the Finance Director at sufficient shareholder 
presentations and meetings that he fully understands the issues  
and concerns of major shareholders.
The Chief Executive reports on shareholder relations at each  
Board meeting. Communications with shareholders relating to 
corporate governance matters are conducted by the Chairman  
with the assistance of the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination  
and Remuneration Committees. Written reports on all meetings 
between non-executive directors and institutional shareholders  
and their representative bodies are presented to the Board at the 
first opportunity following such meetings as is all correspondence 
with them.
The Board seeks to encourage participation of all shareholders,  
and in particular private investors, at the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting and endeavours to ensure all Board members are in 
attendance. In particular, the Chairmen of the Remuneration, Audit 
and Nomination Committees are available to answer questions.
The Company makes use of its website www.yulecatto.com to 
communicate with its shareholders where it publishes interim  
and full year results, Company announcements, share price and 
corporate governance and other investor information.
Accountability
An explanation of the directors’ responsibility for preparing the 
financial statements, their report that the business is a going 
concern, a responsibility statement and their statement as to 
disclosure of information to the auditor are set out on pages 46 
and 32 respectively. Statements by the auditor about its reporting 
responsibilities are set out on pages 47 and 90 respectively.  
A report on the approach to internal control is set out below. 
The directors endeavour to make the annual report and financial 
statements as informative and understandable as possible.
Internal control
The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and sets appropriate policies to ensure 
that the Code requirements on internal control are met.
The system of internal control deployed within the Group is designed 
to reduce the risks of failure to meet business objectives, but these 
risks cannot be eliminated. The internal control system adopted can 
therefore only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance about 
meeting such business objectives or against material mis-statement 
or loss.
The Group’s internal controls over the financial reporting and 
consolidation processes are designed under the supervision of the 
Group Finance Director to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair 
presentation of the Group’s published financial statements for 
external reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant business risks faced by the Group has been in place 
since 2000. This has since been built upon so as to embed further 
the process into the businesses and to enhance the usefulness of 
the relevant processes and information, and has been operated 
throughout 2011 and up to the date of approval of the annual report 
and accounts, and accords with the Turnbull Guidance.
The system is applied at all material subsidiaries, and a ‘bottom 
up’ risk profile is created by evaluating the information at business, 
divisional and Group level. Individual directors within Yule Catto’s 
businesses identify and assess key risks associated within their 
area of responsibility based on formal management information and 
interaction with colleagues, customers, suppliers and other parties.
The individual submissions are consolidated, reviewed and agreed 
at a board meeting of each subsidiary. A business risk report is 
prepared that is closely linked to business strategy and takes 
account of key internal and external factors. Risks are prioritised 
using a common risk matrix, which forms the basis of a single 
corporate risk report that is reviewed and discussed by the Yule 
Catto Audit Committee. Governance Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 38
The individual business risk reports are formally reviewed at a Board 
meeting of the subsidiary every six months, out of which a revised 
report is submitted which identifies changes in the risk environment.
The process was last reviewed by the Yule Catto Board of Directors 
in March 2011. The nature of the risks identified as a result of this 
process during the year primarily relate to matters of an operational 
and financial nature and the most significant of those which faced 
the Group in 2011 are reviewed in the reports of the Chairman, 
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and the Directors’ Report.
Risks associated with safety, health and the environment are,  
by the nature of the Group’s business, always of the utmost concern 
and the Corporate Social Responsibility report on pages 20 to 29 
reviews the Group’s performance in this connection in 2011.
The processes which are used by the Board either directly or, 
where appropriate, through the Audit Committee to review the 
effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems 
(including in relation to the financial reporting process and the 
process for preparing consolidated accounts) include the following:
•  a review of the external audit work plan;
•  consideration of reports from management and external  
parties, including the auditor, on the system of internal  
financial control and any material control weaknesses;
•  a quarterly review of safety, health and  
environmental performance;
•  discussion with management of the actions taken on any  
possible problem areas for the business identified by Board 
members or in the audit report; and
•  consideration of a consolidated risk management report setting 
out the main conclusions from the internal control process.
In addition, the Board:
•  receives copies of the minutes from all Audit Committee meetings;
•  considers the role of the Group insurance programme;
•  receives regular written and oral reports from management  
on all aspects of production, operations, financial and risk 
management matters; and
•  in compliance with Provision C.2.1 of the Combined Code  
the Board regularly reviews and approves the effectiveness  
of the Group’s system of internal controls.
The Board confirms that a review of the effectiveness of the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems was 
carried out in 2011.
Environmental, social and governance matters
In January 2007 the Association of British Insurers (ABI) published 
a revised version of its guidelines on responsible investment 
disclosure. These guidelines require statements on the extent  
to which environmental, social and governance matters are taken 
into account by the Board and identified, assessed, managed  
and monitored, particularly in relation to the risks and opportunities 
they present to the value of the Company.
The Company is a member of the FTSE4Good Index.
Environmental matters
The maintenance of high standards of environmental (together with 
health and safety) protection is central to the Company’s business. 
A separate statement on safety, health and environmental (SHE) 
matters has been a feature of the annual report for a number  
of years. The Corporate Social Responsibility report statement 
on pages 20 to 29 incorporates the ABI guidelines and includes 
a report on the initiatives the Company has adopted regarding 
sustainable development.
Social and ethical matters
The Board takes account of social and ethical matters as part  
of its review of internal control which, by virtue of its approach  
to risk identification, covers areas which encompass social and 
ethical matters.
The Board is conscious of its responsibility to the communities  
in which the Group’s businesses operate and is supportive of local 
initiatives by management.
The Board is also aware of the reputational risk associated with 
social and ethical issues and has a Group-wide code of business 
conduct on corruption and anti-competitive activities, which is 
available on the Company’s website and upon request from the 
Company Secretary. The purpose of this code is to ensure that the 
Group’s employees have a clear understanding of the principles that 
are important in these areas when conducting the Group’s business. 
The application of the code is explained to senior management 
at regular intervals and they are charged with its communication 
throughout their businesses supported by internal and external 
training. A compliance procedure involving annual certification by  
the senior management of each operating company and a procedure 
for maintaining a register of, and where appropriate gaining prior 
approval for, gifts, entertainment and corporate hospitality operates 
throughout the Group. A report is made to the Audit Committee 
annually on the code and the Company’s whistleblowing procedure.
Governance
The Board’s approach to governance, training of directors and 
identification and assessment of risk is set out above.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
continued Governance Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 39
The following report complies with the relevant provisions of the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 and satisfies the requirements of 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the UK 
Corporate Governance Code which was published in June 2010  
by the Financial Reporting Council.
Principal areas of focus for the Committee during 2011
2011 was an exceptional year for the Company with the delivery 
of a very strong set of financial results and the transformation of 
the Group into a focused specialty Polymer business. At the end 
of March 2011 the acquisition of PolymerLatex was completed 
and as a result of this acquisition the Committee conducted 
a comprehensive review of its policies in early 2011 with the 
assistance of New Bridge Street. A key area of focus for that  
review was the ongoing competitiveness of the remuneration  
paid to the Company’s senior executives compared with its peers  
in the following sectors: chemicals and process manufacturing;  
a broader base of similar sized companies in the FTSE 250 
(excluding financial services companies, investment trusts and 
consumer focused companies); and the FTSE 250 as a whole.  
It was considered appropriate to review this range of sectors  
due to the small size of the FTSE 250 chemical sector and the 
fact that the Company re-joined the FTSE 250 Index in September 
2010 and has subsequently moved up that index following the  
rights issue that took place in January 2011 in conjunction with  
the acquisition of PolymerLatex. The outcome of that review 
resulted in the increases in executive directors’ basic salaries  
and the enhancements to the maximum bonus potential under  
the annual incentive arrangements set out below.
The Committee also reviewed the long-term incentive provision  
at the Company during the year. Following advice from New Bridge 
Street and consultation with the Company’s major institutional 
shareholders the Committee concluded that the Company’s existing 
Performance Share Plan should be replaced with a similar scheme 
incorporating latest best practice. This recommendation was 
approved by the Board and shareholders in June 2011.
In conjunction with the review of the executive remuneration  
non-executive director remuneration was also reviewed during 
2011, the last review having been carried out in 2006. As a result 
of this review the Chairman’s fee was found by the Committee to 
be substantially below market rates for similar positions and was 
increased accordingly. Fees for the other non-executive directors 
were also increased as in the Board’s view these had also fallen  
well below competitive market rates and in addition were proving 
to be an impediment to the recruitment of the new non-executive 
directors to fill vacant positions on the Board.
Role of the Remuneration Committee and its advisers
During 2011 the Remuneration Committee comprised 
Dr A A Dobbie (Chairman) and Mr J K Maiden until 9 November 
2011 when Mr N A Johnson was appointed to the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for determining, in agreement  
with the Board, the Company’s policy on executive remuneration 
and the specific remuneration for the Chairman and each of the 
executive directors, including pension rights within the terms of  
the agreed policy. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing 
the remuneration of senior executives throughout the Group.  
The Committee was assisted in its deliberations on the Chairman’s 
and the Finance Director’s remuneration by the Chief Executive and 
also took independent advice from and used the services of New 
Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited). Aon Hewitt 
Limited is part of Aon Group as is Aon Limited which provides 
insurance broking services to the Group. The Committee is satisfied 
that this in no way compromises the provision of independent  
advice by New Bridge Street.
New Bridge Street was paid £65,000 for its services in 2011  
which included assistance with the review of executive and non-
executive director remuneration and the design and implementation 
of the 2011 Performance Share Plan as well as general advice to  
the Committee. No director is involved in any discussions relating  
to their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee met four times during 2011.
Remuneration policy
Executive directors’ remuneration
The Company’s central policy for 2011 was and continues to 
be to structure executive pay in such a way that key executives 
may be recruited, motivated and retained through being offered 
remuneration packages that are competitive. The Committee 
has the discretion to consider the Company’s performance on 
environmental, social and governance matters when setting the 
remuneration of the executive directors.
Remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises:
• a base salary;
•  performance related incentives (being an annual cash bonus  
plan and the 2011 Performance Share Plan); and
• pension and ancillary benefits.
Incentive arrangements were designed in accordance with the 
provisions of Schedule A to the Code. No elements of remuneration 
other than basic salary are pensionable.
The details of these are set out below.
The Committee does not consider that the incentive structure for  
senior executives gives rise to environmental, social or governance 
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT Governance Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 40
Base salaries
The basic element of the remuneration package of senior executives 
is a salary which is reviewed with effect from 1 January each year. 
The Committee also takes into account the pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group when considering annual salary 
increases and total remuneration.
Changes to the basic salaries of the executive directors in 2011 
have been as follows:
Chief Executive – the Chief Executive’s basic annual salary was 
increased by 18.4% to £450,000 with effect from 1 April 2011 
(2010 £380,000) following an interim increase to £430,000 with 
effect from 1 January 2011 pending the outcome of the review 
of executive remuneration referred to above. With effect from 
1 January 2012 the Chief Executive received a 5% increase to 
£472,500 per annum.
Finance Director – the Finance Director’s basic annual salary was 
increased by 10% to £270,000 with effect from 1 January 2011 
(2010 £245,000). With effect from 1 January 2012 the Finance 
Director received a 13% increase to £305,000 per annum in order 
to fully reflect the outcome of the executive remuneration review 
carried out in 2011.
Annual incentive arrangements
For 2011 the Company operated a cash bonus plan for the 
executive directors and senior group employees related to the 
achievement of profit before tax targets.
The maximum profit before tax target for 2011 was £91.1 million 
(being 2010 pro-forma profit before tax for the enlarged Group  
plus 10% plus synergies from the PolymerLatex acquisition planned 
for delivery in 2011). The actual profit before tax result was above 
this, giving rise to maximum payments to be made to the executive 
directors and other participants under the plan. The maximum 
amount payable to the executive directors under the plan was 
increased in 2011 from 60% and 80% of basic annual salary  
for the Finance Director and Chief Executive respectively to 100%  
of basic annual salary for each of them. This increase was reflective 
of the outcome of the Committee’s review of remuneration 
conducted in the year. For senior operational management the  
2011 annual cash bonus payments were based on appropriate 
combinations of profit, cash flow, working capital and safety and 
environmental targets. In 2011 their bonuses were subject to 
limits of between 50% to 80% of basic pay, depending on levels 
of seniority. As a result of the acquisition of PolymerLatex the 
Company inherited bonus arrangements for senior management 
which paid up to 140% of basic pay in 2011 and other than for  
one individual such arrangements have been terminated with  
effect from 2012. For 2012, the annual bonus will operate within  
a similar framework to 2011.

A final grant of awards was made under the 2002 Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) in April 2011 and this Plan has now been 
superseded by the 2011 Performance Share Plan which was 
introduced in June 2011. For the awards granted in 2011, the 
Committee retained the absolute total shareholder return (TSR) 
condition for 50% of the shares comprised in each award as used  
in prior years. However the relative TSR condition for the other  
50% of the shares comprised in each award was replaced with  
a TSR condition linked to performance against a comparator group 
comprising the companies listed in the FTSE 250 Index. Full details 
of the performance conditions attaching to these awards are set out 
on page 44.
2011 Performance Share Plan
The 2011 Performance Share Plan was introduced in 2011 
following shareholder approval at a General Meeting held in June 
2011 and covers the executive directors and senior management. 
It was introduced (i) to replace the PSP which was nine years old 
and had only one more year to run and (ii) to take into account the 
acquisition of PolymerLatex. An award consists of a right to acquire 
shares which can be exercised for a nominal price, subject to the 
Company satisfying performance conditions. The value of shares 
awarded under the 2011 Performance Share Plan in any financial 
year to any individual normally may not exceed 150% of their annual 
basic salary. However, in exceptional circumstances, up to a further 
150% of salary may be granted in line with market practice.
The award policy for 2012 is for annual awards of 100% of salary 
and, should this policy increase, the Remuneration Committee  
would consult with key shareholders in advance.
The current policy is that two performance conditions will apply  
to normal, annual awards under the 2011 Performance Share  
Plan. One half of the awards will vest subject to a relative total 
shareholder return (TSR) performance condition comparing the 
Company’s TSR against the TSR of the constituents of the  
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts and financial services 
companies) over a three year period. An underpin will apply to the 
TSR performance condition which permits the Committee, at its 
discretion, to scale down the vesting of this part of an award in 
exceptional circumstances if it considers that the level of vesting  
is not reflective of the Company’s underlying financial performance. 
The other half of the awards will vest subject to an earnings per 
share (EPS) performance condition relating to the annualised three 
year growth in EPS. The Committee will have the discretion to 
reduce (or defer) the level of vesting of an award under both the 
TSR and EPS performance conditions where an event has occurred 
(such as a material health and safety incident) as a result of which 
the Committee considers that it would be inappropriate for vesting to 
occur in accordance with the TSR and EPS performance conditions. 
The 2011 Performance Share Plan provides for clawback if the 
Group’s accounts have been materially misstated or there has been 
an error in the calculation of any performance conditions which 
results in an overpayment.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
continued Governance Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 41
No normal annual awards were made under the 2011 Performance 
Share Plan in 2011 due to its introduction at the end of the first half 
of the year. The first normal awards under the 2011 Performance 
Share Plan will be made in March 2012. As set out in the Notice of 
EGM when it was approved, exceptional awards were made under 
the 2011 Performance Share Plan immediately after its approval in 
June 2011 as the Committee wanted to put in place an incentive for 
the achievement of truly exceptional business performance delivered 
by key executives following the acquisition of PolymerLatex. 
Accordingly exceptional awards of 100% of salary were made to the 
Chief Executive and the Finance Director and awards of between 
50% and 100% of salary were made to a restricted group of senior 
executives. The performance conditions attaching to those awards 
are set out on page 44.
In order to further align the interests of the executive directors and 
shareholders there are share ownership requirements in connection 
with both the PSP and the 2011 Performance Share Plan requiring 
the retention of 30% of the shares acquired by executive directors 
until such time as ordinary shares in the Company have been  
built up to a level equivalent in value to their annual basic salary. 
Progress toward this target as at 31 December 2011 is as follows:
Director
Actual share ownership
as a % of 2011 salary
 based on closing share
 price on 31/12/11
Actual share ownership
plus 30% of vested
unexercised awards 
as a % of salary based on
share price on 31/12/11
A M Whitfield 6% 43%
D C Blackwood 25% 66%
During 2011 671,290 shares were the subject of awards made in 
April that year under the PSP and 739,845 shares were the subject 
of awards made in June that year as exceptional awards under  
the 2011 Performance Share Plan.
The shares comprised in the awards granted in 2009 under the 
PSP have vested in full as the performance conditions were 
exceeded by a margin of over 200%. The value of shares comprised 
in the awards granted in 2009 did not exceed 100% of the then 
applicable annual salary of any individual and the number of shares 
in each award is reflective of the Company’s share price of 41.25p 
on the day prior to the grant of the awards.
Pension arrangements
Mr A M Whitfield and Mr D C Blackwood are eligible to participate  
in the Group personal pension plan and receive payments of 25% 
and 20% of basic annual salary respectively from the Company 
which they may use either in conjunction with that plan and/or 
to enable them to make their own arrangements. There are no 
unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
Benefits
Ancillary benefits comprise a fully expensed car and private  
health insurance.
Executive directors’ service contracts
No director other than Mr A M Whitfield and Mr D C Blackwood has 
a service contract. Mr Whitfield’s contract is dated 22 November 
2005 and Mr Blackwood’s is dated 12 September 2007. Both 
contracts have no unexpired term, provide for a notice period of  
one year and make no provision for pre-determined compensation 
on termination.
The Remuneration Committee’s policy on contracts and notice 
periods for executive directors is to seek to comply with best 
practices in corporate governance.
Non-executive directorships held by the executive directors
Mr Whitfield is a non-executive director of the Chemical Industries 
Association Limited for which he does not receive any remuneration. 
He is also a non-executive director of AZ Electronic Materials SA  
for which he receives and retains £50,000 pa. Mr Blackwood is a 
member of the Board for Actuarial Standards for which he received 
and retains £10,000 pa.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration and terms of appointment
The Board determines the remuneration of the non-executive 
directors, including members of the Remuneration Committee.
It has been the Board’s policy to review fees paid to non-
executive directors periodically. A review of non-executive director 
remuneration was carried out in 2011 (the previous review having 
been carried out in December 2006) with the assistance of 
advice provided by New Bridge Street. As a result of this review 
the Committee determined that the Chairman’s fee be increased 
from £110,000 pa to £140,000 pa with effect from 1 April 2011. 
Also with effect from 1 April 2011 the Board determined that 
non-executive director fees be increased as follows: £40,000 pa 
(previously £30,000 pa) for those who do not sit on a committee; 
£45,000 pa (previously £33,000 pa) for those who do sit on  
a committee; £50,000 pa (previously £36,000 pa) for those  
who are Committee chairmen and the Senior Independent Director. 
The Committee has decided that in future non-executive directors’ 
remuneration will be reviewed on a biennial basis.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to receive awards under 
any of the Company’s share schemes or other employee benefit 
schemes nor does the Company make any contribution to their 
pension arrangements.
All non-executive directors are appointed in writing.
In addition to Mr N A Johnson’s letter of appointment as a non-
executive director the Company has entered into a consultancy 
agreement with CI (International Consulting) Limited for the 
provision of consultancy services by Mr Johnson. The total of the 
annual fees paid to Mr Johnson and to CI (International Consulting) 
Limited equates to the fees due to an individual fulfilling the role  
of Senior Independent Director of the Company of £50,000 pa.  
The first year of each director’s appointment is shown in the 
directors’ biographies on page 30. The periods of appointment  
and the requirements for re-election of non-executive directors  
are provided within the Performance Evaluation section of the 
Corporate Governance report on page 35. Governance Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 42

Vested awards
(i) The awards made in 2008 under the PSP were subject to the following performance conditions:
(a)  Absolute total shareholder return condition. Vesting in respect of 50% of the shares comprised in the award upon the Company’s 
total shareholder return (TSR) over a three year period ended on 31 December 2010 increasing by the rise in RPI plus 15.76% or 
more compared with the Company’s TSR at the start of the three year performance period; vesting in respect of 25% of the shares 
comprised in the award upon the Company’s TSR increasing by the rise in RPI plus 9.27% over the three year performance period; 
and vesting in respect of between 25% to 50% of the shares for performance between these points on a straight-line basis with 
lesser performance resulting in no part of the 50% of the shares vesting.
(b)  Relative total shareholder return condition. Vesting in respect of 50% of the shares comprised in the award upon the growth in 
the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period exceeding the growth of the FTSE 250 total return index over the 
same three year period by 7.69% or more; vesting in respect of 5% of the shares comprised in the award upon the growth in the 
Company’s TSR over the three year performance period being equal to the growth of the FTSE total return index over the same 
period; and vesting in respect of between 5% to 50% of the shares for performance between these points on a straight-line basis 
with lesser performance resulting in no part of the 50% of the shares vesting. 
 
The 2008 awards vested in March 2011 in full due to the maximum performance criteria being exceeded.
(ii)  For the awards made in 2009 under the PSP the same performance conditions applied as for the awards made in 2008 measured  
over a three year period ending on 31 December 2011.

Unvested awards
(iii)  For the awards made in 2010 under the PSP the same performance conditions apply as for the awards made in 2008 measured  
over a three year period ending on 31 December 2012.
(iv)  For the awards made in April 2011 under the PSP the same absolute total shareholder condition applied to 50% of the shares 
comprised in the award. For the other 50% of the shares comprised in the award the following conditions applied: vesting in respect of 
50% of the shares comprised in the award upon the Company’s TSR at the end of the three year period ending on 31 December 2013 
being in the top quartile of the TSR of the companies in the FTSE 250 Index: vesting in respect of 5% of the share comprised in the  
award upon the Company’s TSR at the end of the three year period ending on 31 December 2013 being at least equal to the FTSE  
250 Total Return Index; and vesting in respect of between 5% and 50% of the shares for performance between these points on  
a straight-line base with lesser performance resulting in no part of the 50% of the shares vesting.
(v)  For the exceptional awards made in June 2011 under the 2011 Performance Share Plan 100% of the shares comprised in the award 
vest if earnings per share (EPS) for 2013 is equal to or greater than 30.3 pence per share. No shares will vest if EPS for 2013 is less 
than 27.3 pence per share and between 27.3 pence and 30.3 pence per share vesting will be on a straight-line basis.
The notional value of unexercised share options is based on the mid-market price of a share on 31 December 2011 of 164.3 pence.  
During the year the market price ranged between 148.0 pence and 253.0 pence.

Financial statements, including adoption  
of going concern basis
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted  
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and  
have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements  
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law the directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair  
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit  
or loss of the company for that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors 
are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
•  make judgments and accounting estimates that are  
reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have  
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed  
and explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern  
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company  
will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
•  properly select and apply accounting policies;
•  present information, including accounting policies,  
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable  
and understandable information; 
•  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the  
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable  
users to understand the impact of particular transactions,  
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position  
and financial performance; and
•  make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time  
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act  
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets  
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Other matters
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation  
taken as a whole; and
•  the management report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as  
a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES Group financial statements Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 47
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO  
THE MEMBERS OF YULE CATTO & CO PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of Yule Catto & Co 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the  
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 36. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation  
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions  
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true  
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion  
on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable  
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies  
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as  
at 31 December 2011 and of its loss for the year then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as  
adopted by the European Union; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or
•   we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•  the directors’ statement, contained within the Directors’ Report,  
in relation to going concern;
•  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to  
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
•  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board  
on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Yule Catto & Co plc for the year ended 31 December 
2011 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
that is described as having been audited.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 201 1
1 General information
Yule Catto & Co plc is a company incorporated in the United 
Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the registered 
office is given on page 30.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling 
because that is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in 
accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
New and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised standards have 
been adopted:
•  IFRS 7 (amended October 2010) – Disclosures – Transfers  
of Assets;
•  IAS 24 (revised November 2009) – Related Party Disclosures;
•  IAS 32 (amended October 2009) – Classification of Rights Issues;
•  IFRIC 14 (amended November 2009) – Prepayments of  
a minimum funding requirement;
•  IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments
•  The improvements to IFRSs (May 2010).
In the current financial year, the Group has adopted IAS 24 
‘Related Party Disclosures’, IFRIC 14 (Amendment) ‘Prepayments 
of a minimum funding requirement’ and Improvements to IFRSs 
2010 – as published in May 2010. IAS 24 simplifies the disclosure 
requirements for entities that are controlled, jointly controlled or 
significantly influenced by government related entities and clarifies 
the definition of a related party. This revision does not impact the 
Group’s related party disclosures. IFRIC 14 (Amendment) allows 
an entity to recognise an early payment of contributions to cover 
minimum funding requirements on its pension plan as a prepayment. 
This amendment does not represent a material impact on the 
Group’s Financial Statements.
The improvements to IFRSs 2010 incorporated necessary, but 
non-urgent amendments to seven International Financial Reporting 
Standards. The amendments most relevant to the Group are:
•  IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments – Disclosures. The required 
enhanced disclosures, where applicable have been incorporated  
in these Financial Statements.
•  IAS 34 – Interim Financial Reporting emphasises the principle that 
the disclosure about significant events and transactions in interim 
periods should update the relevant information presented in the 
most recent annual report. The amended disclosure requirements 
where applicable, were included in the Group’s Interim Financial 
Statements for the half-year ended 30 June 2011.
The remaining five amendments in this collection of improvements 
do not currently impact the Group’s Financial Statements.
The following Standards and Interpretations are also effective from 
the current financial year, but do not currently impact the Group’s 
Financial Statements:
•  IAS 32 (Amendment) – ‘Classification of rights issues’.
IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments’  
is not currently relevant to the Group’s operations.
No amendments to these financial statements have been made 
as a result of adopting these new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
•  IFRS 7 (amended December 2011) – Disclosures –  
Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities;
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments;
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements;
• IFRS 1 1 Joint Arrangements;
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other entities;
• IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement;
•  IAS 1 (amended June 2011) Presentation of Items of  
Other Comprehensive Income;
• IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets;
• IAS 19 (revised June 2011) Employee Benefits;
• IAS 27 (revised May 2011) Separate Financial Statements;
•  IAS 28 (revised May 2011) Investments in Associates  
and Joint Ventures;
•  IAS 32 (amended December 2011) Offsetting Financial  
Assets and Financial Liabilities;
•  IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase  
of a Surface mine.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these Standards 
and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group, except for additional 
disclosures, when the relevant standards come into effect. Group fi nancial statements Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 53
2 Signifi cant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.  
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical  
cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and 
financial instruments. As discussed in the Report of the directors  
on page 33, the financial statements have been prepared on  
a going concern basis. The principal accounting policies adopted  
are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is 
achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the 
year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, 
as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies 
used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using  
equity accounting.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries 
are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Minority 
interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the 
original business combination (see below) and the minority’s share 
of changes in equity since the date of combination. Subsequently, 
any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the 
minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent 
except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and  
is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses  
are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the 
cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly 
controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised 
as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.  
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to  
each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually,  
or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may  
be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating  
unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata 
on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity,  
the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination 
of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to 
IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off  
to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated 
and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss  
on disposal.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for  
using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date  
of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed,  
and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control  
of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit  
or loss as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
•  deferred tax assets or liabilites and liabilities or assets related  
to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured 
in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits respectively;
•  liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by  
the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are 
measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payment; and
•  assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale  
in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale  
and discontinued operations are measured in accordance with  
that standard. Group financial statements Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 54
2 Significant accounting policies continued
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete  
by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, 
the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the 
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or 
liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that,  
if known, would have affected the amounts as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition 
to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts  
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is 
subject to a maximum of one year.
Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired through acquisition are measured  
at their fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over  
their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:
Customer relationships – between 5 and 8 years 
Technology – 10 years
Where necessary the fair value at acquisition an
d estimated useful lives for these intangible assets are based on 
independent valuation reports.
Other intangible assets
Software development and environmental licensing costs resulting  
in development of a long-term intangible asset are measured  
initially at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over  
their estimated useful lives as follows:
Software  – between 3 and 5 years
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s 
product development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions in IAS 38 are met:
•  an asset is created that can be separately identified (such as 
software and new processes);
•  it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic 
benefits; and
•  the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
No research or development costs met the criteria for required 
capitalisation under IAS 38 during the year.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, 
development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period 
in which it is incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation 
and any provision for impairment. Except for freehold land and land 
grants in Malaysia, which are not depreciated, the cost or valuation 
of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line 
basis over its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings –  the lesser of 50 years and the 
period of the lease
Plant and equipment – between 3 and 10 years
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value  
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates  
of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued 
amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated  
as a revaluation decrease.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried  
at its revalued amount, in which case the reversal of impairment  
loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis 
to the income statement over the term of the relevant lease. Any 
benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are 
also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated 
using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents 
the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion  
and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items 
where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value 
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss where there  
is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
All trade receivables that are factored by third parties are done  
so on a non-recourse basis. At the point of factoring, the Group 
forfeits the right to future cash flows from these receivables and 
those amounts are derecognised. The cost of factoring receivables 
is recognised as a finance cost in the period in which the receivable  
is factored.
Amortised costs
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the 
consolidated income statement using the effective interest method 
and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce  
exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.  
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments  
for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies 
approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles 
on the use of financial derivatives, as set out in note 23.
Impairment of financial assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its financial assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.  
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset  
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment  
loss (if any).
Finance costs
Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over 
the term of such instruments at an effective interest rate on the 
carrying amount. Finance costs that are directly attributable to the 
construction of tangible fixed assets are capitalised as part of the 
cost of those assets in accordance with IAS 23.
Foreign currencies
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, 
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of 
the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated 
at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date 
when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that  
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are  
not retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, 
the Group enters into forward contracts and options (see below 
for details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect of such 
derivative financial instruments).
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas 
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated 
at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange 
rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, 
are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation 
reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income  
or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of  
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected 
to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions 
before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterling-denominated 
assets and liabilities. Group financial statements Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 56
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments  
to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate 
risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate 
swaps and foreign currency options.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
to their fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with  
a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas  
a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial 
liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss 
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as  
a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition  
in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.  
The Group designates certain derivatives as either hedges  
of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign 
currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges), or hedges  
of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include 
derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect  
of foreign currency risk, as either cash flow hedges, or hedges  
of net investments in foreign operations.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents 
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy 
for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at 
the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group 
documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a 
hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in  
cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives  
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred  
in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion  
is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in  
the ‘other gains and losses’ line of the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the 
same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item. 
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results  
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, 
the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred 
from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of 
the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes 
the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at 
that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast 
transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain  
or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately  
in profit or loss.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted 
for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is 
recognised in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss, and is included in the ‘other gains  
and losses’ line of the income statement.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable 
and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases  
used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for 
using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able  
to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is  
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
continued Group financial statements Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 57
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Taxation continued
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow  
all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to  
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the consolidated 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in equity.
Retirement benefit costs 
The costs of defined benefit contributions to the Group’s pension 
schemes and of augmenting existing pensions are charged to  
the consolidated income statement on a systematic basis over  
the expected period of benefits from employees’ service.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are 
charged as an expense as they fall due.
Actuarial gains on the defined benefit schemes are recognised in 
full in each period in which they occur. They are recognised outside 
of the consolidated income statement and are presented in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of 
the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate 
trustee-administered funds.
For the German schemes, the assets are included within the  
assets of the respective companies, as permitted under local laws. 
The assets of the other overseas schemes are held separately  
from those of the Group.
Provisions
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale 
of the relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the Group’s liability.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group 
has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been 
communicated to affected parties.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods provided 
in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other 
sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and  
title has passed, where delivery is defined in accordance with 
Incoterms 2000.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based 
Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2  
has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after  
7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured  
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.

2 Significant accounting policies continued
Net borrowings
Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together  
with short and long-term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect  
of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify 
for hedge accounting, non-recourse factoring arrangements,  
and the inclusion of financial assets.
Critical judgements in applying accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving 
estimations (see below), that the Group has made in the process  
of applying the accounting policies and that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Going concern
The assessment that the financial statements should be 
prepared on a going concern basis requires the directors to 
make a judgement that, after taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The Group activities give rise to significant potential deferred 
tax assets, particularly in respect of the UK pension liability, 
tax losses and accelerated capital allowances. Determination 
of whether these assets should be recognised requires a 
high degree of management judgement and is dependent on 
management’s ability to project future earnings from activities 
that may apply loss positions carried forward against future 
income taxes.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires 
that management make estimates and assumptions that affect 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the 
basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis taking the 
current and expected future market conditions into consideration.
Impairment/reversal of impairment
The Group has significant investments in property, plant  
and equipment and goodwill. Changes in the circumstances  
or expectations of future performance of an individual asset  
may be an indicator that the asset is impaired requiring the  
book value to be written down to its recoverable amount. 
Impairments are reversed if the conditions for impairment  
are no longer present. Evaluating whether an asset is impaired  
or if an impairment should be reversed requires a high degree  
of judgement and may depend to a large extent on the  
selection of key assumptions about the future.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an  
estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units  
to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use 
calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash  
flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and  
a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.  
The industry growth rates used within the forecast future  
cash flows are developed with reference to external sources  
but are subject to estimation uncertainty.
Post retirement benefit obligations
Included in the actuaries’ calculation of the post retirement 
benefit obligations are a number of assumptions. These are 
shown in detail in note 25.
Current tax liability and deferred tax
The Group annually incurs significant amounts of income taxes 
payable to various jurisdictions around the world, and it also 
recognises significant changes in deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities, all of which are based on management’s 
interpretations of applicable laws, regulations and relevant  
court decisions. The quality of these estimates is highly 
dependent upon management’s ability to properly apply what 
can be very complex sets of rules and to recognise changes  
in applicable rules.

4 Segmental analysis
The chief operating decision maker of the Group is considered to be the Executive Committee, which reviews internal reports prepared  
on a divisional basis in order to allocate the resources of the Group and to assess business performance. Following the acquisition 
of PolymerLatex the Group revised its reporting to the Executive Committee for these purposes and now reports under three revised 
reportable segments under IFRS 8, being Polymer Chemicals Europe & North America, Polymer Chemicals Asia & Rest of World,  
and Pharma Chemicals. As noted in the Chairman’s Statement the Group disposed of its Pharma Chemicals business in the second half 
of 2011 and now recognises this as a discontinued activity in this Annual Report. The Group no longer allocates the UK defined benefit 
pension scheme deficit to a specific segment.
The segmental analysis below in respect of 2010 has been restated to reflect the change in segmentation discussed above.
Substantially all revenues earned by the Group are from the sale of Polymer products derived from petrochemical monomers.
No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Group’s revenues. No information is provided at the divisional level to the Executive 
Committee concerning interest revenues, interest expense, depreciation or amortisation, income taxes, other material non-cash items  
or material items disclosed in accordance with IAS 1.97.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets 
to the extent that it is probable that these assets will be recovered. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries and joint ventures. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the 
foreseeable future.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment at the balance sheet date, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might 
be impaired.
With completion of the acquisition of PolymerLatex the Board undertook a review of future options for the Pharma business and concluded 
that it was non-core to the Group moving forward. As part of this review the carrying value of the goodwill associated with this business 
was re-assessed, with the conclusion that it had been impaired. The goodwill was accordingly written down to zero in the period to 30 June 
2011. On 30 November 2011 the remaining operating entities of the Pharma business were disposed of (see note 28 for further details).
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit 
from that business combination.
Following the acquisition of PolymerLatex, the Group re-assessed its CGUs for goodwill impairment testing. The revised CGUs better 
reflect the composition and operational structure of the Group, and the expected benefit of synergies from the acquisition. Group financial statements Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 69

The recoverable amounts for CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, based upon discounted cash flows. The key 
assumptions for those discounted cash flow calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate. The discount rate is based  
on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the particular CGU’s 
activities and geography of operation. Profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined with management’s 
expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic growth, internal plans  
and competitor and customer activity.
Discount rates of 11% and 12% have been used in the above calculations.
The profit used in the cash flows for the first year is derived from management forecasts; for years 2 to 10 a growth rate is applied.  
The profit for year 10 is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity. Growth rates of between 2% and 5% have been 
used, representing management’s best estimate of each CGU’s circumstances, and these do not exceed the long-term growth rates  
for the markets concerned.

18 Financial asset
As described in note 28, the Group disposed of its Pharma Chemicals business on 30 November 2011. Part of the consideration agreed 
with the buyer, totalling $10,000,000, was in the form of a deferred payment to the Group which will be made by the buyer on or before  
30 September 2014. In the event that the buyer is unable to fulfil his obligation, this deferred consideration is secured by an irrevocable 
bank guarantee held in favour of Yule Catto & Co plc by HSBC Bank plc.
In view of the security held, the Directors consider this deferred consideration virtually certain to be received and have therefore included  
it in these financial statements as a non-current Financial Asset, and within the Group’s definition of Net Borrowings.
The amount of £5,589,000 included in non-current assets represents the agreed amount of $10,000,000 discounted at the rate of 5% 
per annum from 30 September 2014 to date of completion, plus an appropriate amount unwound on this discounting in the period up to  
31 December 2011.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less.
The special item fair value adjustment represents the revaluation of US dollar loan notes from the rate of the related cross currency swaps 
to the year end rate, together with the transitional adjustment required to reflect movements in fair value caused by variations in interest 
rates, and subsequent amortisation thereof, to the extent that these constituted effective hedges prior to the adoption of IFRS.
23 Financial instruments
The Group’s treasury function operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate financial risk and ensure that funds are available for 
current and future needs. The policies are approved by the Board and the use of financial instruments is strictly controlled.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return 
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes 
the cash and borrowings disclosed in note 22, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves 
and retained earnings.
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors 
and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations. The Group also uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign 
currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in Derivative Financial instruments shall  
be undertaken.

23 Financial instruments continued
Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate. Where market values are not available, fair values  
of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates  
and by applying year end exchange rates. The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.
The fair value of the Group’s financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly  
or indirectly observable.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies  
for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS.
Market risk
The Group’s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The policies adopted to address 
these risks are as follows:
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings. The Group borrows  
at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile in order to manage  
the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Foreign currency risk
The Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly 
denominated in euros. Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.  
The Group’s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities. Consequently, there are no  
material currency exposures to disclose (2010 none).
Impact on income statement
Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to £3,317,000 have been debited to the income statement in the year  
(2010 credit of £2,645,000). These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.
Hedge accounting
The Group has a number of cross currency swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk. These swaps  
are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address. The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary to permit the application of 
hedge accounting under IAS 39. It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these requirements cannot be justified and therefore 
IAS 39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise.
On 31 March 2011, as part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex Group (see note 29), the Group acquired a number of Interest Rate Swap 
agreements that had been used by the former PolymerLatex Group to Hedge external borrowings. In the period since completion several 
of these contracts were terminated, with the Group electing to retain those which in combination represent a floating to fixed interest 
rate swap on a Euro amount of €155 million. On 1 July 2011, the Group designated these remaining contracts as Hedging Instruments 
in order to use them as an effective hedge against the interest rate exposure associated with a substantial portion of the Group’s Euro 
denominated, floating rate, £150 million Term Loan. As such these contracts are now accounted for as Cashflow Hedges as permitted  
by IAS 39.
 In addition the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts to fix the sterling value of its net investments in certain foreign 
operations, which have a euro functional currency. These contracts have been accounted for as net investment hedges as permitted  
by IAS 39. Group financial statements Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 77

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding  
at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their 
translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans  
to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the  
lender or borrower. Group financial statements Yule Catto & Co plc / Annual Report 201 1 78

Liquidity risk
The objective of the Group is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due. The Board closely monitors liquidity through 
monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Yule Catto & Co plc had the following principal facilities:
A committed syndicated bank facility of £210 million comprising a £150 million Term Loan which was drawndown in Euros on completion  
of the PolymerLatex acquisition, and a £60 million revolving credit facility which was undrawn at 31 December 2011.
Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately £75 million raised from the US private placement market in 2004. With maturity between 
2012 and 2016, these loan notes provide the Group’s long-term requirements. Please see note 22 for further details.

from 1 January 1999 a defined contribution section was introduced and is open to all eligible Group employees. During 2009 the Group 
announced that it intended to close the defined benefit scheme to future accrual. This process commenced in 2009 and was completed  
in September 2010.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned. Contributions to the scheme are charged to  
the Income Statement to spread the cost of pensions over employees’ working lives within the Group.

Overseas pension schemes
The Group operates a number of smaller overseas pension and post-retirement schemes. The assets of these schemes are held  
separately from those of the Group, with the exception of the unfunded German schemes (net liability £42.7 million, 2010 £8.3 million), 
where in line with common practice, the assets are held within the respective companies.
Defined benefit schemes
The aggregated pension disclosure below for the overseas defined benefit schemes has been compiled from a number of actuarial 
valuations at 31 December 2011.
The largest of these schemes, which entered the Group as part of the PolymerLatex acquisition on 31 March 2011, accounts for  
£34.5 million of the deficit at 31 December 2011. The major assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of this scheme are:
2011
Rate of increase in salaries 3.00% 
Rate of increase in pensions 2.00% 
Discount rate 4.50% 
Inflation assumption 3.00% 
The major assumption used in the valuation of the other overseas schemes do not differ significantly from the above.

Executive share option schemes
Details of the share option schemes available to senior management are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 39 to 45.  
For grants made after 7 November 2002, the charge to profit is calculated on the assumption that, given that the exercise price  
is effectively nil, the share price at grant provides a reasonable estimate of the option value at grant.
For grants made before 7 November 2002, the charge to profit is based on the anticipated cash cost of acquiring shares to meet  
the options exercised.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO  
THE MEMBERS OF YULE CATTO & CO PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of  
Yule Catto & Co plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which 
comprise the parent company Balance Sheet and the related  
notes 1 to 16. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might  
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required  
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they  
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read  
all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications  
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs  
as at 31 December 2011;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited  
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
•  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial  
year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters  
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
•  the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law  
are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements  
of Yule Catto & Co plc for the year ended 31 December 2011.

1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They  
have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the 
preceding year.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed 
assets, and comply with applicable UK accounting standards.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of 
exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward 
contract rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward 
contract rate.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Except for freehold 
land, which is not depreciated, the cost or valuation of tangible fixed 
assets is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected 
useful lies as follows:
Freehold buildings  – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings  –  the lesser of 50 years  
and the period of the lease
Plant and equipment  – between 3 and 10 years
Revaluation of properties
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions 
of FRS 15 ‘Tangible Fixed Assets’ and retained the book amounts 
of certain freehold properties which were revalued prior to 
implementation of that standard.
Where depreciation charges are increased following a revaluation, 
an amount equal to the increase is transferred annually from the 
revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account as a movement 
on reserves. On the disposal or recognition of a provision for 
impairment of a revalued fixed asset, any related balance remaining 
in the revaluation reserve is also transferred to the profit and loss 
account as a movement on reserves.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision  
for impairment.
Debt
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after 
deduction of issue costs.
Dividends
Dividends are accrued where declared and unpaid at the balance 
sheet date.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is 
provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using  
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that 
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax  
in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at 
the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between 
the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the 
financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses 
in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they  
are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore 
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence,  
it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying 
timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Company balance sheet when the Company becomes a party  
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their 
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct 
issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the profit  
and loss account using the effective interest method and are added 
to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they  
are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their 
nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce 
exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.  
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies 
approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles 
on the use of financial derivatives.

Net borrowings
Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together with short and long-term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect  
of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting.
Pension funding
The costs of contributions to the Group’s pension schemes and of augmenting existing pensions are charged to the profit and loss  
account on a systematic basis over the expected period of benefits from employees’ service.
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate  
trustee-administered funds.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

The Company has given guarantees amounting to £17,465,000 (2010 £18,782,000) in respect of bank and other facilities of subsidiaries 
and joint ventures.
15 Pension commitments
The Group participates in a funded scheme with both a defined benefit and defined contribution section (the Yule Catto Group Retirement 
Benefit Scheme). The scheme’s defined benefit section was closed to new members with effect from 31 December 1998 and with effect 
from 1 January 1999 a defined contribution section was introduced and is open to all eligible Group employees. During 2009 the Group 
announced that it intended to close the defined benefit scheme to future accrual. This process commenced in 2009 and was completed  
in September 2010.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
The pension charge for the year for the Company amounted to £14,132,000 (2010 £14,213,000).
In accordance with FRS 17, the Company will account for its contributions to the defined benefit scheme as if it were a defined contribution 
scheme because it is not possible to identify the Company’s share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and 
reasonable basis. The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme prepared for the purposes of making transitional disclosure in accordance 
with FRS 17 shows a net pension liability of £73,126,000 at 31 December 2011 (2010 £56,158,000).
FRS 17 disclosure
Due to the application of IAS 19 to the Group financial statements, resulting in changes to the required disclosures at Group level,  
the disclosure requirements of FRS 17 for the Group have been included below.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2009 and updated to 31 December 2011 by a qualified actuary.  
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 
2011 2010 2009 2008 2007

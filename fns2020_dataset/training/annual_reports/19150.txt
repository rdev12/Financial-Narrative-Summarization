CHARIMAN’S STATMEMENT  
 
 
Dear Shareholder,  
 
This is the first full year of trading since Bjarke Larsen became Chief 
Executive Officer and I want to congratulate Bjarke on leading a highly 
experienced and capable management team through a rapidly 
changing market place. The initiatives implemented at the end of 2014 
to navigate the UK Point of Consumption duty (“POC”) have been 
effective; strategic TV broadcasting relationships have been 
renegotiated and digital marketing capabilities and revenue 
diversification have been successfully strengthened with the 
acquisition of the trade and assets from Otherside Inc. 
The management team has delivered against our stated strategy by 
reinforcing our USP through the contract extensions with ITV* and 
Channel 5 / Viacom † , focusing on operational efficiencies and 
completing synergistic acquisitions to both strengthen capabilities and 
diversify the Group’s revenues. We are confident that the actions 
taken have created a solid foundation from which the core business 
can continue to operate successfully and drive further growth. 
The UK gambling market has undergone significant regulatory change 
over the last 18 months. These changes have had a widespread 
impact on the industry that is evident from the recent mergers of some 
the UK’s largest gaming and gambling operators. These results 
demonstrate how versatile and adaptive our business has been with 
like-for-like (“LFL”) adjusted EBITDA ‡ growing by £1.8m, which 
shows how successful the strategy has been to improve operational 
and marketing efficiencies.  
Financial review 
In line with the trading update issued in January 2016, I am pleased 
to report that the Group delivered net revenue of £26.3m and adjusted 
EBITDA of £2.7m, which is at the top-end of market expectations. The 
Group has no debt, is cash generative and holds a strong balance 
sheet with cash of £13.0m at year end, following the £2.6m cash paid 
in respect of the acquisition of the assets from Otherside Inc. 
 
Dividend 
The business has remained highly cash generative and maintains a 
robust balance sheet to support the future organic growth of the Group 
and any suitable M&A opportunities that arise.  
 
Considering the strength of the Group's cash position, robust trading 
performance and positive outlook, the Board is proposing both an 
increase in the final dividend to 0.34 pence per share (2014: 0.33 
pence per share) and also an additional distribution of £2.0m via a 
special dividend equivalent to 0.68 pence per share.  
This proposed special dividend together with the final dividend and 
the interim dividend (paid in October 2015) brings the total dividend to 
1.24 pence per share. 
 
Employees 
With their continued commitment and talent, our employees around 
the world remain pivotal to NetPlay TV’s success. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank every one of them for their hard work and 
dedication during this challenging year.  
 
Outlook for 2016 
Trading in the first part of 2016 has been strong across both our B2C 
(core online gaming operations) and B2B (digital marketing 
operations) businesses. The Board remains confident that NetPlay TV 
is well positioned, with continued cash generation and a strong 
balance sheet, to take advantage of the organic growth and M&A 
opportunities which lie ahead. This should be particularly evident by 
the fact that the Group is pursuing not just bolt-on opportunities but 
also considering more transformational deals, such as the potential 
acquisition of The Football Pools, which it considered in December 
2015
§
 although ultimately chose not to pursue.  
I am confident that our business is well equipped for the year ahead, 
allowing us to capitalise on the opportunities available and continuing 
to build on the success of the past year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
 
 
 
Overview 
It was another busy year for the Group which saw us achieve strong 
results despite all the regulatory changes. During the year we 
maintained our focus on controlling marketing and operating costs, 
resulting in a lower than industry average Cost per Acquisition 
(“CPA”)**
 
on our core casino business whilst maintaining strong cash 
generation.  
 
To support our growth plans and diversify our revenue streams we 
acquired the trade and assets of Otherside Inc. (“Otherside”), details 
of which can be found below.  
 
Marketing strategy 
In September 2014, we outlined a revised marketing strategy which 
has delivered improved returns through increased cost efficiencies 
and a more targeted marketing spend. This strategy was largely 
focused on working closely with our TV partners to maximize the 
effectiveness of our TV airtime contracts. The result of which is a CPA 
reduction of 20% to £166 (2014: £208) and an increase in average 
revenue per active depositing player of 4% to £327 (2014: £316), on 
our casino-only brands.  
 
TV continues to be the Group’s USP and remains at the core of our 
strategy. Through the continuous evolution of the production, style 
and format of our shows we ensure that NetPlay TV remains at the 
forefront of interactive gaming. This combination of engagement 
through TV with the development of our mobile platforms is driving 
customer acquisition and retention.   
 
Product development 
2015 was focused on operational efficiencies and product 
development; standardising the Content Management System 
(“CMS”) platform for all our casino brands and creating a fully 
responsive site experience for all our customers. In addition, we 
launched over 50 new titles across web and mobile significantly 
bolstering the Group’s content offering.  
 
To support the sportsbook web offering on the Vernons brand, we 
rolled out mobile sportsbook as well as a number of new features 
(including “cash-out”). In addition we launched virtual sports which we 
believe complements the sportsbook product. With our complete 
sports offering in place we will evaluate the performance and how it 
                                                        
**
 CPA is calculated as aggregate marketing expenditure divided by the total number of new depositing players 
††
 The period for the comparison is 1 January to 15 March, being the last practicable date before the 
publication of these financial statements. 
fits within the Group’s wider product strategy. In addition to these 
sportsbook developments, we recently launched a rebranded and 
new fully responsive Vernons bingo website. 
 
We have a strong pipeline of innovation for 2016, which will see us 
deliver a number of new products. This includes our fully responsive 
roulette betting interface, and an extensive range of new content, 
including new side games and enhanced bet features for our very own 
TV roulette product. Our customers will see an evolution of the 
product, style and show format as we look to take full advantage of 
our renewed commercial partner agreements. 
 
Digital marketing business acquisition 
The acquisition in August 2015 of the trade and assets of Otherside, 
a specialist online digital marketing, product development and 
technology company, has provided a complementary and profitable 
revenue stream whilst adding to our capability in driving traffic to 
NetPlay TV's brands. These assets included a proprietary media 
platform, which is best described as a Demand Side Platform (“DSP”). 
This DSP allows our media buyers to manage multiple ad and data 
exchanges, of which we have over 100, through a single interface. 
The DSP allows the team to build campaigns for our partners and 
efficiently manage bids and pricing for the media we are buying.  
 
The B2B offering generates revenue on a CPA, revenue share or 
hybrid basis for a number of companies across a wide range of 
sectors.  
 
The acquisition has proved a valuable addition to the Group and we 
are confident that this offering will go from strength to strength as we 
start to take advantage of a number of additional opportunities, 
including increasing contributions to our B2C business over time. 
 
Results 
We had fully expected our results to be impacted by the regulatory 
changes, however this impact has been significantly mitigated by our 
strategy set out at the end of 2014. This is reflected in our 2015 
performance where we have once again shown the cash generating 
abilities of the business delivering adjusted EBITDA of £2.7m with a 
strong cash conversion to net underlying cashflow of 79%. 
 
Current trading and Outlook 
In 2016, we remain focused on our strategy to deliver growth, both 
organically and through acquisition, and the Board is pleased with the 
performance of both our B2C and B2B businesses for the start of the 
year. The Group has delivered an 18% increase in total net revenue, 
26% increase in new depositing players and 16% increase in active 
depositing players over the same period in 2015
††
.  
 
We continue to evaluate a number of M&A opportunities with a view 
to delivering ongoing growth for the Group, and I believe we remain 
well positioned for 2016 to deliver increased shareholder value in the 
short and long term. Considering the strength of the Group's cash 
position, robust trading performance and positive outlook we are 
confident that we have the right combination of team, products and 
marketing to exploit the opportunities available for our core business 
and we look forward to continuing to drive growth over the coming 
year.

4  NetPlay TV plc – STRATEGIC REPORT 
 
 
 
The table above reconciles the statutory format of the income 
statement to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted profit before tax which is 
used by management internally to evaluate the underlying 
performance of the business. In the opinion of the Board this format 
better reflects the operational performance of the Group. The 
discussion in this section below will focus on the adjusted information. 
Following the acquisition of the trade and assets of the digital 
marketing business in August 2015 (described below), we have 
introduced a B2B operating segment alongside the core B2C 
operating segment. The results of each segment are shown in note 2 
of these financial statements. We are pleased with the contribution 
made from the B2B operating segment and the start it has made in 
2016. The integration of this operation was undertaken successfully 
and we are pleased with the contribution this operation has made. 
 
Income statement items 
Net revenue for the year was £26.3m (2014: £27.4m) of which £25.2m 
(2014: £27.4m) was generated from the B2C and £1.1m from the B2B 
segment since the acquisition in August 2015. 
 
Betting and gaming duties increased to £3.8m (2014: £0.5m) as a 
result of the introduction of POC which came into effect on 1 
December 2014. The duty is currently set at 15% of gaming net 
revenue and 15% of sports betting gross win from UK customers.   
 
Total marketing expenditure for the year was £9.4m (2014: £12.9m) 
with B2C Marketing expenses decreasing by £4.2m to £8.7m. This 
expenditure reflects the effect of the revised marketing programme 
which was launched in late-2014. These expenses include the cost of 
the revenue share agreements in respect of key broadcast 
agreements with ITV and Channel 5. We are pleased to see that the 
revised marketing strategy we adopted at the end of 2014 is working 
as we successfully reduced marketing expenditure by 32% with only 
an 8% fall in net revenue. Our CPA, on our casino-only brands, 
decreased by 20% from £208 in 2014 to £166 in 2015 as a result of 
increased efficiencies. 
 
Operating expenses in total have decreased by £0.2m to £6.0m in 
2015 (2014: £6.2m). These costs have remained at 23% of net 
revenue. 
 
Administrative expenses have increased by £0.3m to £4.4m. This is 
due to the addition of the B2B operating segment with administrative 
expenses of £0.3m since the date of acquisition.  
 
Acquisition related and other expenses of £0.2m (2014: £0.8m) were 
incurred in 2015 which represent costs associated with the acquisition 
of the assets from Otherside Inc. In 2014 these expenses were non-
recurring costs associated with the consolidation of business locations 
and other one-off costs in respect of contracts. Full details are 
provided in note 5 of these financial statements. 
 
Like-for-like adjusted EBITDA 
POC was introduced on 1 December 2014. In order to show the effect 
of this we have created a like-for-like (“LFL”) adjusted EBITDA which 
reflects the relative impact of betting and gaming duties being in place 
throughout 2014.       ……………………………………………….

Deduct contribution from B2B segment (161) – 
LFL adjusted EBITDA 2,525 690 
 
When considering the 2014 contribution on a LFL basis, it is 
anticipated that the Group would have obtained various offsets in its 
key contracts (e.g. a reduction in software royalty rates) due to 
renegotiated favourable terms which the Group would have benefited 
from.  
 
In addition 2015 has benefited from a contribution from its B2B 
operating segment which did not exist in 2014. This has been 
removed to provide a relative comparative. The table above shows 
that on a LFL basis adjusted EBITDA increase by £1.8m. 
 
The effect of the Group’s mitigation strategy against POC is also 
shown in the common-size table below for the B2C operating 
segment. The table shows expenditure and adjusted EBITDA as a 
percentage of net revenue. 
 
 
The table above shows that the contribution margin for the B2C 
segment has decreased from 17.7% in 2014 to 15.8% in 2015. This 
is largely a function of increasing the efficiency of the Group’s 
marketing expenditure resulting in a lower expenditure offset by an 
increase in the Group’s betting and gaming duties. 
 
Earnings per share 
Reported earnings per share for the year was 0.21 pence per share 
(2014: loss of 0.03 pence per share). However, the Directors have 
additionally chosen to report an adjusted earnings per share as they 
believe it better reflects the underlying performance of the Group. This 
is calculated on the profit before taxation after adding back the 
amortisation of specifically identified intangible assets arising on 
business combination, impairment of intangible assets, share based 
payments and acquisition related and other expenses.

Cash balance 
The Group’s cash balance at the end of 2015 was £13.0m which is 
equivalent to 4.4 pence per ordinary share in issue at 31 December 
2015 (2014: 4.8 pence per ordinary share). £2.2m is in relation to 
balances which players have in their gaming account on deposit with 
NetPlay TV which leaves a corporate cash balance of £10.8m (2014: 
£12.1m) which is equivalent to 3.7 pence per ordinary share.

experience. 
 
Acquisition of digital marketing business 
On 11 August 2015, the Group acquired the trade and assets of 
Otherside Inc. For clarity, the Group did not acquire the Otherside 
branding or website. This business generates revenue from 
companies operating across a range of sectors (e.g. binary options 
trading, online gaming and e-commerce) where it is paid on for 
delivering leads or acquisitions on a CPA, revenue share or hybrid 
basis. 
 
The Board reports this operation as a new Business-to-Business 
(“B2B”) operating segment. This segment generated net revenue of 
£1.1m and a contribution of £0.2m to adjusted EBITDA between 11 
August 2015 and 31 December 2015.  
 
The total consideration in relation to this acquisition is £3.2m of which 
£2.6m was paid within the year and £0.5m payable in 2016. This 
transaction was financed from existing cash resources. The Group 
incurred £0.2m of acquisition related costs which have been 
separately disclosed in note 5 to these financial statements. 
 
 
Dividend 
Given the Group’s continued strong cash generation, the increase in 
LFL adjusted EBITDA, and the Board’s continued confidence the 
Directors are proposing a return to shareholders of £2.0m via a special 
dividend of 0.68 pence per share. If approved at the AGM this dividend 
will be paid on 9 June 2016 to shareholders on the register of 
members at 27 May 2016. 
 
In addition the Directors are proposing an increase in the final 
dividend to 0.34 pence per share (2014: 0.33 pence per share). If 
approved at the AGM this dividend will be paid on 9 June 2016 to 
shareholders on the register of members at 20 May 2016. 
 
These dividend together with the interim dividend paid in October 
2015, make the total dividend of 1.24 pence per share (2014: 0.55 
pence per share).  
 
The closing share price on 15 March 2016, being the last practicable 
date prior to the publication of these financial statements, is 8.75 
pence per share. This would mean that the proposed total dividend 
yield is 14.2%, or if the special dividend is excluded, the total ordinary 
dividend yield is 6.4%. When considering the total ordinary dividend 
for the year the dividend cover ratio (dividend per share as a ratio of 
adjusted earnings per share) is 1.36-times.  
 
Corporation & Deferred Taxation 
The Group has circa £7.4m (2014: £6.9m) of UK corporation tax 
losses carried forward which equates to a total deferred tax asset of 
£1.4m (2014: £1.5m). Of this, the deferred tax asset recognised on 
the balance sheet is £62,000 (2014: £38,000) as this amount of tax 
benefit is deemed to be probable and the remaining £1.4m of the 
potential deferred tax asset is unrecognised. The credit through the 
income statement of £21,000 in the year represents the movement in 
the deferred tax asset between 2014 and 2015 of £24,000 offset by 
tax expected to be payable. The Group works closely with its advisers 
to ensure that its tax position is optimal.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
 
The risks and uncertainties described below are considered to have the most significant effect on NetPlay TV’s business and prospects. This list 
is not intended to be exhaustive. NetPlay TV carries out a detailed risk management process to ensure that risks are identified and mitigated where 
possible. 
 
The Board recognises that the nature and scope of the risks can change and so regularly reviews the risks faced by the Group as well as the systems 
and processes in place to mitigate them.  
 
An explanation of how the Group manages its various financial risks is provided in note 22 to the Financial Statements. 
 
RISK DESCRIPTION AND POTENTIAL IMPACT  CURRENT MITIGATION 
 
STRATEGY RISK 
  
Ineffective or non-delivery of the business strategy 
The online gaming industry is constantly changing and developing, for 
example the increasing shift in interacting with gaming services with a PC 
or laptop to interacting with a mobile or tablet. 
 
The market for online gaming products and services is characterised by 
technological developments, new product and service introductions and 
evolving industry standards. Failure by NetPlay TV to use leading 
technologies effectively, develop its technological expertise, enhance its 
products and services and improve the performance, features and 
reliability of its technology and advanced information systems, could have 
a material adverse effect on its competitive position. 
 
 The Group seeks to identify and anticipate risks regarding our 
assumptions and understanding of the industry and economic 
environment in order to ensure the strategy remains appropriate. 
Corporate planning processes are in place to ensure that the strategy of 
the business contributes to the delivery of shareholder value. These 
processes culminate in the setting of an annual budget for the year, 
together with long-range plans for the two following years. Over the 
course of the year these budgets and plans are reconsidered, in the light 
of any market changes, through business reviews and formal reforecasts 
on a quarterly basis. 
Acquisition risk 
Our strategy includes growth through consolidation in the markets in 
which we operate and through acquisitions in new territories. A poorly 
executed acquisition could lead to lower profitability. 
 The risks associated with this approach are mitigated through clearly 
defined investment criteria, detailed due diligence by the Group and its 
professional advisers and robust financial and operational post-
acquisition and integration plans. 
 
 
REPUTATIONAL RISK   
Under-age and problem gaming 
Under-age and problem gaming are inherent risks associated with the 
online gaming industry and the Group is no exception.  
 The Group devotes considerable resources to putting in place prevention 
measures coupled with strict internal procedures designed to prevent 
under-aged players from accessing its real money sites. In addition, the 
Group promotes a safe and responsible gaming environment to its 
customers supplemented by its corporate culture. 
 
Information security 
NetPlay TV faces external and internal information security risks.  
 
NetPlay TV receives most of its revenue through debit and credit card 
transactions and operates as an e-commerce business. 
 
A security breach could result in an adverse impact for the business and 
reputational damage. 
 NetPlay TV focus on the protection of player information. Appropriate 
controls are in place including:

RISK DESCRIPTION AND POTENTIAL IMPACT  
 
CURRENT MITIGATION 
 
OPERATIONAL RISK 
  
Gaming/Casino risk and volatility 
The Group is exposed to gaming risk in relation to its casino operations 
which could adversely impact its revenue. 
 The Group’s casinos and other games incorporate a “house edge” 
designed to provide a return to the Group over a large number of bets, in 
the short term the Group’s casinos and other games may experience 
losses. 
 
Wagering limits are in place to mitigate the Group’s exposure to individual 
transactions. 
 
   
 
Key personnel 
NetPlay TV has operations in various locations throughout the world 
(including Guernsey, Lancaster, Israel and Battersea).  
 
Our success is driven through the development and retention of a 
focused leadership team and a number of skilled specialist employees 
throughout our business. 
  
The performance of the Group is dependent on its ability to attract, recruit 
and retain quality staff in a highly competitive labour market. We continue 
to invest in our people, ensuring that we recruit and retain the right calibre 
of staff with the skills, experience and talent to grow the business. We 
seek to ensure we have appropriate management development 
programmes to assess, manage and develop our people’s leadership 
skills, talents and experiences throughout the organisation. 
 
Dependence on third parties 
Due to the nature of live broadcasts, the Group’s business is highly 
dependent on broadcasters, networks, software providers and mobile 
operators, as well as other service providers who, for example, provide 
payment processing and customer age and ID verification. If there is any 
interruption to the products or services provided by other third parties or 
if there are problems in supplying the products or services, the Group’s 
business could be adversely affected. 
 
 To mitigate this risk the Group takes care to select third parties that are 
reputable and reliable, and ensures that contractual agreements with key 
third parties offer adequate protection to the Group. 
 
Where commercially viable, NetPlay TV operates with a dual 
service provider.  
Technology risk 
As a leading online business, the Group’s technology systems are critical 
to its operation. The Group is reliant on the performance of these systems 
to generate revenue.  
 Cutting-edge technologies and procedures are implemented throughout 
the Group’s IT operations which are designed to protect its networks from 
malicious attacks and other such risks. These measures include traffic 
filtering, anti-DDoS (“Distributed Denial of Service”) devices, anti-virus 
protection from leading vendors and other such means. 
 
Physical and logical network segmentation is used to isolate and protect 
the Group’s networks and restrict malicious activities. In order to ensure 
systems are protected properly and effectively, external security scans 
and assessments are carried out in a timely manner. 
 
The Group has a high-end storage solution to ensure storage availability 
and performance. All critical data is replicated to another storage device for 
disaster recovery purposes and all data is stored off-site on a daily basis. 
In order to minimise dependencies on telecommunication service 
providers, the Group invests in network infrastructure redundancies whilst 
regularly reviewing its service providers. 
 
The Group takes information technology risks seriously and keeps its 
policies under review in order to mitigate these risks. 
 
   
8  NetPlay TV plc – STRATEGIC REPORT 
 
 
   
RISK DESCRIPTION AND POTENTIAL IMPACT  CURRENT MITIGATION 
 
TAXATION RISK 
  
UK Point of Consumption (“POC”) duty 
From December 2014, the Group has been subject to remote gaming and 
general betting duty on a “point of consumption” basis. Changes in duty 
rates, or a basis of calculation, can incur at short notice which could 
adversely affect the amount of duty payable by the Group. 
 
 The Group endeavours to ensure relevant contractual arrangements 
have offset clauses to mitigate a portion of any change in duty. In 
addition, the Group actively engages in relevant government 
consultations through industry bodies. 
 
VAT & Corporation Tax 
All gaming activities are based in Alderney, where the Group currently 
benefits from a zero corporate tax rate and is outside the scope of UK 
VAT. If there was a change in the rate of corporate tax or VAT in Alderney 
or in UK legislation such that the Alderney subsidiary subject to UK VAT 
this would have an adverse effect on the amount of taxation payable by 
the Group. 
 
 The Group aims to ensure that each legal entity within the Group is a tax 
resident of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and has no taxable 
presence in any other jurisdiction. The Group works closely with its tax 
advisers to make sure that that tax position of the Group is optimal. 
 
 
EXTERNAL RISK 
  
Competition 
NetPlay TV operates in competitive market places against both larger well 
established brands and new entrants to the online gaming market. 
 
One of NetPlay TV’s key competitive advantages is its tightly controlled 
cost base. If NetPlay TV lost sight of this or relaxed its stance over cost 
control this could significantly reduce any competitive advantage and 
impact proﬁtability. 
 
 Regular monitoring of competitor and consolidation activity. 
 
NetPlay TV seeks to have a rapid response to any such activity that may 
impact NetPlay TV’s ability to grow the business. 
 
Strong cost control across the Company. 
 
Laws, regulations and licensing 
During the year, the Group’s gambling activities were operated under a 
licence under the Alderney Gambling Control Commission and a licence 
with the UK Gambling Commission. The regime under which either the UK 
or Alderney permit remote gaming operations to be operated within their 
respective jurisdictions may be altered or restricted through legislation 
in  the UK or Alderney which renders the Group’s operating base unusable 
or uneconomic. In addition, territories where the Group wishes to market its 
Alderney-based gambling services may impose restrictions upon remote 
gambling services which would restrict the Group’s ability to market to 
potential customers in that territory or to service existing customers by, for 
example, restricting financial transactions. 
 
  
Where such restrictions exist, or come into existence in the future and/or 
in each case are actively enforced, the Group would seek to obtain 
gambling and gaming licences local to these territories. 
 
Restrictions on promotion or the operation of remote gambling and 
gaming services in any particular location might also diminish or inhibit 
the Group’s ability to secure distribution in such territories. 
 
The 2015 Strategic Report has been approved by the Board of Directors.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
 
The following section sets out the key governance policies and 
practices adopted by the Group. In common with other companies 
traded on AIM, NetPlay TV plc is not required to follow the guidelines 
set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) and does 
not claim to do so. The Directors have given consideration to the Code 
and have chosen to provide certain information on how the Group has 
adopted various principles of it. 
 
Board 
At the date of this report, the Group Board was made up of two 
Executive and four Non-Executive Directors. Under the Company’s 
Articles of Association a Director shall retire from office at the first 
Annual General Meeting after his or her appointment and one-third, 
but not exceeding one-third, of the Directors are required to retire by 
rotation each year. 
 
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and all Directors have 
full and timely access to the information necessary to enable them to 
discharge their duties. There is a scheduled Board meeting at least 
every month and additional Board meetings are held as required. 
 
During the year, the Board met 22 times and the following attendance 
occurred: 
 
C A N Butler 22 
G P Stevens 20 
A C Lapping  22 
T S Mickley 19 
A Kumar

B J L Larsen            22 
 
The Board is assisted in the discharge of its duties by the following 
Board committees: 
 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee, which comprises two Non-Executive Directors: 
G P Stevens who chairs the Audit Committee; and A C Lapping. The 
Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that the financial 
performance of the Group is properly reported on and monitored, and 
for overseeing the operation of internal financial controls appropriate 
to the size and operations of the Group. The Audit Committee meets 
twice a year to review the results, the findings of the auditors, the 
independence and objectivity of the auditors, and the internal controls. 
It also reviews the application and appropriateness of the Group’s 
accounting policies, including any changes to financial reporting 
requirements brought about by both external and internal 
requirements and it gives consideration to all major financial 
announcements made by the Group including its interim and 
preliminary announcements and annual report and accounts. 
 
The external auditors and other Executive Directors may be invited to 
attend the meetings. During the year the Audit Committee met twice. 
G P Stevens and A C Lapping attended both meetings. 
 
Relations with shareholders 
The Group is committed to ongoing communication with its 
shareholders. At the Annual General Meeting, individual shareholders 
are afforded the opportunity to question the Board. 
 
Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the system of internal control 
established by the Group and places considerable importance on 
maintaining a strong control environment. However, such a system is 
designed to identify, manage and mitigate rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
 
Key elements of the Group’s system of internal control are as follows: 
 
Financial management 
Annual budgets are prepared for each business division and for the 
Group. These budgets are reviewed and agreed by the Board and 
actual performance is measured against these budgets on a regular 
basis. Monthly management accounts are prepared, reviewed, 
analysed and presented to the Board. The Group has in place 
documented authority levels for approving purchase orders, invoices 
and all bank transactions. 
 
Company management 
The Executive Directors meet regularly to monitor and evolve the 
Group’s strategic direction, including product offerings and routes to 
market. In addition, the Chief Executive conducts regular 
management meetings to ensure that the strategy is cascaded 
throughout the Group’s operations and is being acted upon 
accordingly. 
 
Risk analysis 
The Group maintains a comprehensive risk register. The Board 
approves annual updates and appropriate risk mitigating action plans.

REMUNERATION COMMMITTEE REPORT 
 
Companies trading on AIM are not required to provide a formal 
remuneration report. However, in line with current best practice this 
report provides information to enable a greater level of understanding 
as to how Directors’ remuneration is determined. As this report is 
disclosed voluntarily it has not been subject to audit. 
 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”), which comprises 
two Non-Executive Directors: G P Stevens who chairs the Committee 
and A C Lapping.  
 
The Committee has the principal function of agreeing with the Board 
the framework and policy for the remuneration of the Group’s 
executive management and determining, on behalf of the Board, the 
remuneration packages of the Executive Directors. The Committee 
also determines the policy on executive appointments. No member of 
the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as 
a shareholder), conflict of interest arising from cross-directorships or 
day-to-day involvement in running the business. No Director plays a 
part in any discussion about his own remuneration. 
 
The Chief Executive Officer or Group Finance Director may be invited 
to attend certain discussions of the Committee. 
 
During the year the Remuneration Committee met twice. G P Stevens 
and A C Lapping attended both meetings. 
 
Remuneration policy and arrangements 
The objective of the remuneration policy is to ensure that the Executive 
Directors and Senior managers of the Group are provided with 
appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in 
a fair and reasonable manner, rewarded for their individual contributions 
to the success of the Group. Each Director is assessed individually so 
that their remuneration is directly related to their performance over time 
and so that a proportion of their remuneration is performance related. 
 
There main elements of the remuneration package for Executive 
Directors: 
 
(i) Basic salary: 
An Executive Director’s basic salary is determined by the Committee 
before the start of each year and when an individual changes position 
or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee seeks 
to be competitive, but fair, using information obtained from both 
internal and external sources. 
 
(ii) Performance related bonus: 
Performance related bonuses are designed to reward contribution 
and to encourage the achievement of targeted levels of performance 
over the short term. The maximum cash bonuses are set by the 
Committee and are subject to stretching targets linked to both 
individual performance and the Group’s operating performance. The 
performance related bonus evaluation period runs annually from April 
to March, in line with the Company’s annual evaluation period for the 
senior management and wider Group staff. Additionally the 
Remuneration Committee will consider discretionary performance 
related bonuses for Executive Directors and Senior Management for 
any work associated with dealing with leavers, adjustments to awards 
and performance criteria following acquisitions, disposals, changes in 
share capital and to take account of the impact of M&A activity. 
 
(iii) Long-term incentive arrangements: 
The Company’s long-term incentive arrangements are intended to 
encourage Directors and other key employees to focus on long-term, 
strategic corporate objectives and to further align the interests of 
management and shareholders. These arrangements consist of an 
Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (“EMI”), an Inland Revenue 
approved share option scheme and an Inland Revenue unapproved 
share option scheme. Details of these schemes are outlined in notes 6 
and 25 to the financial statements. 
 
(iv) Pension arrangements: 
The Group does not operate a pension scheme for Directors; however 
it does make contributions to personal pension plans. 
 
(v) Other benefits: 
Other benefits for Executive Directors include a private health care 
scheme, critical illness insurance and relevant life insurance. 
 
Service contracts 
A Kumar has a service agreement, dated 25 November 2013, which 
is terminable on six months’ notice by either party. 
 
B J L Larsen has a service agreement, dated 17 August 2014, which 
is terminable on six months’ notice by either party. 
 
In the event of early termination, the Directors’ contracts provide for 
compensation up to a maximum of basic salary plus the fair value 
of benefits to which the Directors are contractually entitled for the 
unexpired portion of the notice period. The Company seeks to apply the 
principle of mitigation in the payment of compensation on the 
termination of the service contract of any Executive Director. 
 
Non-Executive Directors 
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement, the 
dates of which are set out below. There are no provisions for 
compensation payable in the event of early termination. The Non-

set by the Articles of Association. The fees paid to the Non-Executive 
Directors in the year are inclusive of the additional work performed for 
the Group in respect of membership of the Board committees. At the

possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should 
be able to function entirely from its cash generated from operations. 
The Group is currently funded entirely through shareholders’ funds. 
 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual report and financial statements. 
 
Appointment and replacement of Directors 
Directors are appointed to, or removed from, the Board according to 
the provisions contained in the Company’s Articles of Association 
(“Articles”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. A copy 
of the Articles is available to view on the Company’s website 
www.netplaytv.com. 
 
Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
Each of the Directors has been provided with a qualifying third-party 
indemnity from the Company. The Company maintains Directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance.

Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the Company’s auditor 
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ 
Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
each Director has taken steps that ought to have been taken as a 
Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that 
information. 
 
The auditors, BDO LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue 
in office, and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed for the 
Annual General Meeting in accordance with section 489 of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
 
By order of the Board

DIRECTOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare 
the group and company financial statements and have elected to prepare 
them  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The 
Directors are also required to prepare financial statements in accordance 
with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading 
securities on the Alternative Investment Market. 
 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; 
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business. 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. 
 
Website publication 
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the 
financial statements are made available on a website. Financial 
statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with 
legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility 
also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained 
therein.

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
 
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial

 the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;

the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
 
In our opinion the information given in the strategic report and 
directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where 
the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 
 the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or 
 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
General information 
NetPlay TV plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) operate a number of interactive gaming services under an Alderney gaming 
licence, including Supercasino.com, Jackpot247.com and Vernons.com. The Group is focused on the delivery of a converged interactive gaming 
experience allowing its customers to interact with its games on a variety of platforms: TV, internet, mobile and tablet from a common integrated wallet. On 
11 August 2015, the Group acquired the trade and assets of Otherside Inc a digital marketing business speciallising in online marketing, display media 
and affiliation, underpinned by its proprietary online marketing platform across a range of sectors. 
 
The Company is admitted to trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. It is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its 
registered office is Battersea Studios, 80 Silverthorne Road, London, SW8 3HE. 
 
Basis of preparation 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of both the Company and the consolidated financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards 
and Interpretations (collectively “IFRSs”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) as adopted by the European Union 
(“adopted IFRSs”). 
 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 
each year. Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls and investee if all three of the 
following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power 
to affect those variable returns.  
 
The profits or losses of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The results of those subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective 
date of disposal, as appropriate. 
 
All intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
 
Revenue recognition 
Net revenue is defined as either Business-to-Customer (B2C) net revenue or Business-to-Business (B2B) net revenue.  
 
B2C net revenue comprises gross income less customer incentives expensed in the period. Gross income comprises gross gaming win and ancillary 
income. Customer incentives expensed in the period represent the actual cost of customer incentives redeemed as well as an adjustment for the 
movement in the fair value of unredeemed customer incentives.  
 
Gross gaming win represents gross bets and wagers, being amounts staked, less player winnings in the financial year. Gross gaming win is recognised 
when the bet or wager is settled. Ancillary income is predominantly in relation to broadcast airtime and is not directly related to the operation of the 
interactive gaming services under its gaming licenses. This income is recognised when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and when it 
is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity. This occurs when a third-party income estimation matches the Group’s expectation. 
 
B2B net revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and received and represents amounts received for marketing 
services supplied, stated net of discounts. The Group recongnises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and when it is 
probable that economic benefit will flow to the Group. 
 
Betting and gaming duties 
Betting and gaming duties comprise the UK Point of Consumption (POC) duty on gaming revenues and associated regulatory license and compliance 
fees and other expenses incurred as a result of the licenses the Company is required to hold. Betting and gaming duty liabilities are recognised when 
the bet or wager is settled. 
 
This expenditure was included within operating expenses in the prior years. However the Directors have chosen to provide greater clarity and 
transparency to the face of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income by separately disclosing this item.  
 
Taxation 
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the date of the statement of financial position. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial position 
differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: 
 
 the initial recognition of goodwill; 
 the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting or taxable profit; and 
 investment in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it 
is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference 
can be utilised. 
 
 
 
24  NetPlay TV plc – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are 
expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/ (assets) are settled/ (recovered). 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred 
tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: 
 
 the same taxable Group company; or 
 different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or 
recovered. 
 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the 
Directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM. 
 
Pension costs 
The Group makes contributions to defined contribution plans. The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance 
plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The 
contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.  
 
Intangible assets 
 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over, in the case of business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, 
the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and, in the case of business combinations 
completed on or after 1 January 2010, the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. 
 
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, cost comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity instruments 
issued, plus any direct costs of acquisition. Changes in the estimated value of contingent consideration arising on business combinations completed 
by this date are treated as an adjustment to cost and, in consequence, result in a change in the carrying value of goodwill. 
 
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, cost comprised the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity instruments 
issued. Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and, in the case of contingent consideration classified as a financial 
liability, re-measured subsequently through profit or loss. For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, direct costs of acquisition are 
recognised immediately as an expense. 
 
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset. 
 
Customer relationships 
Externally acquired customer relationships are capitalised at cost and are subject to 50% straight-line amortisation. 
 
Customer relationships acquired as part of business combinations are valued by estimating discounted cash flows that will be generated by the assets 
over their lifetime and are subject to amortisation over the expected useful life of the customer which is estimated to be between 2 and 5 years. 
 
Internally generated player databases are not capitalised. 
 
Brands 
Brands acquired as part of business combinations are valued by applying a royalty rate to the estimated discounted future revenues that will be generated 
and are subject to 10% straight-line amortisation. 
 
Websites and other software development costs 
Website and other software development expenditure relating to the application and infrastructure development of websites is capitalised where the 
expenditure leads to substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the 
Group has sufficient resources to complete the development. All other development expenditure relating to planning, content development and other 
operational activities is charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the period it is incurred. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only 
where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates. 
 
Website expenses are capitalised at cost and are subject to 50% straight-line amortisation.  
 
Software development acquired as part of a business combination is valued using estimating the discounted future cash flows produced by applying 
a royalty rate to the revenues that the software is expected to drive. These are subject to a 20% straight-line amortisation. 
 
Domain names 
Externally acquired domain names are capitalised at cost and are subject to 10% straight-line amortisation. 
 
Domain names acquired as part of business combinations are valued by estimating discounted cash flows that will be generated by the assets over 
their lifetime and are subject to 10% straight-line amortisation. 
 
Partner relationships 
Partner relationships entered into as part of a business combination are valued by estimating discounted cash flows that will be generated by the 
assets over their lifetime and are subject to straight-line amortisation over the life of the relationship which is typically between 2 and 5 years. 
  
Internally generated partner relationships are not capitalised.

Impairment 
Impairment tests on goodwill are undertaken annually at the financial year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly. 
 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the smallest group of assets 
to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows; its cash generating units (‘CGUs’). Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition 
to each of the Group’s CGUs that are expected to benefit form a business combination that gives rise to the goodwill. 
 
Impairment charges are included in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognized in other 
comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed. 
 
Investments (Company accounts) 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the fair value of the consideration paid plus share based payments subsequently granted by 
the Company to employees of the subsidiary incurred to date. Investments that were acquired prior to the Company’s conversion to IFRS are held at 
cost which is the aggregate of the nominal value of the Company’s shares plus  the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the share 
capital of the subsidiary undertakings. Provision is made where there is an impairment in the value of the investment. 
 
Property, plant and equipment 
All property, plant and equipment is stated in the statement of financial position at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses. 
 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method of depreciation, as follows: 
 
Computer equipment  33.3% straight line 
Fixtures & fittings  33.3% straight line 
Leasehold improvements Shorter of the unexpired period of the lease and the estimated useful economic life of the assets 
 
The gain or loss arising on disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
is expensed to profit or loss for the period. 
 
Financial instruments 
Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial assets, financial 
liabilities or equity instruments. 
 
Financial assets 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial 
position. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less.  
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise 
principally through the provision of services to customers, but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary assets. They are initially recognised 
at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at cost less impairment 
provisions. 
 
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default 
or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision 
being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. 
Trade receivables are reported net of impairment provisions, with impairment losses being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off 
against the associated provision. 
 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities held by the Group consist of customer funds held, trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities. 
 
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument and subsequently 
at amortised cost. 
 
Equity instruments 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. 
 
The Company’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments. 
 
Provisions for other liabilities and charges 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. 
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the expected benefits to be derived from contracts are less than the unavoidable cost of 
meeting the obligations under the contracts. Provisions are measured at the present value of the amounts that are expected to be paid to settle the 
obligations. 
 
Share based payments 
Where equity settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income over the vesting period.  Share-based payments in respect of subsidiaries are added to the cost of investment of the 
respective subsidiary in the Company statement of financial position. 
 
Where equity settled share options are awarded to parties other than employees in exchange for services performed, the fair value of the options at 
the date of grant is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the expected lifetime of the services received by the Group. 
 
 
26  NetPlay TV plc – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
 
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, 
ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions 
are considered when calculating the fair value of the options granted. The cumulative charge is not adjusted for the failure to meet market vesting 
conditions. 
 
 
The fair value of share options issued without market-based vesting conditions is measured by the application of the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model by reference to the grant date of the options. The fair value of share options issued with market-based vesting conditions is measured by use 
of the Monte Carlo method. 
 
Capital management 
The Group is funded entirely though equity share capital and retained earnings. If financing is required the Board will consider whether debt or equity 
financing is more appropriate and proceed accordingly.  
 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
Estimates and judgements are based on historical experience, expectations of future events, and other factors deemed to be relevant in the 
circumstances. 
 
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies and 
reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
Included below are the areas that the Directors consider require estimates, judgements and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
 
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment and their values are written-down on the basis of the Group’s expectations of future 
economic benefits expected to be received by the Group. 
 
Any process which attempts to estimate future outcomes is subject to uncertainty. Where it is believed that the estimation uncertainty can give rise to 
material differences in asset carrying values, this will be stated in the relevant notes to the financial statements. 
 
Valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired with business combinations 
Identified intangible assets and goodwill are capitalised at fair value when entering into a business combination. Establishing the fair value of the 
assets generally requires use of a technique such as discounting expected future cash flows. 
 
Any process which attempts to estimate future outcomes is subject to uncertainty. Where it is believed that the estimation uncertainty can give rise to 
material differences in asset carrying values, this is stated in the relevant notes to the financial statements (notes 14 and 15).  
 
Standards and interpretations 
None of the new standards, interpretations and amendments, which are effective for periods beginning after 1 January 2016 are expected to have a 
material effect on the Group’s future financial statements.

2. SEGMENTAL INFORMATION 
The Board is the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the operating segments based on the information reviewed 
by the Board for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. The Group has two reportable segments, being the Business-to- 
Customer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B).  
 
B2C consists of all online products and ancillary income. This segment was known as the Online Gaming segment in prior period. The brands operated 
in this division are Supercasino.com, Jackpot247.com and Vernons.com. These brands operate online gaming and betting products which 
management deem to have similar economic characteristics and customers, and therefore are aggregated into one reportable segment. 
 
B2B relates to the online marketing, product development and technology business which was acquired during the year ended 31 December 2015. 
 
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Board 
evaluates performance on the basis of segment contribution. This measurement basis excludes head office costs not derived from operations of any 
segment and are only disclosed in total.

generating unit, arose on the business combination due to the acquisition of certain assets from Two Way Gaming Limited and the simultaneously 
entering into production and gaming contract with Virgin Media Television to operate the Jackpot247 Service in May 2009. £556,000 of goodwill arose 
on the business combination due to the acquisition Vernons.com business acquired from Sportech (Alderney) Limited in October 2013. £1,061,000 
of goodwill relates to the B2B cash generating unit which arose on the asset acquisition from Otherside Inc. in August 2015 as described in note 28. 
The recoverable amount of the SuperCasino, Jackpot247, Vernons.com and B2B cash generating units, to which this goodwill has been allocated, 
has been determined using value in use calculations. 
 
The calculation of value in use is based on several assumptions which feed into a forecast model based on past player behaviour. The key 
assumptions of the forecast were as follows: 
 number of new player depositing registrations; 
 rate of retention of existing players; 
 spending patterns of players; 
 cost per acquisition (“CPA”) from different acquisition sources; 
 the growth rate applied to cash flows arising after the end of approved budgets; and  
 the discount rate applied to cash flows. 
 
 
 
The above assumptions are based on past experience, as considered appropriate for any external influences. For example a planned increase of 
marketing activity or TV airtime would be expected to increase player registrations.  
 
The value in use calculation for the B2B cash generating unit has been based on the forecast model based on historic information available prior and 
subsequent to the acquisition. 
 
Management forecasts cover a 12-month period and beyond that a growth rate of 2% is applied to cash flows. A discount rate of 8.3% has been used 
over five years. 
 
The Directors do not believe that any reasonably possible change in key assumptions would lead to an impairment of the carrying amount of the 
SuperCasino, Jackpot247, Vernons.com or B2B cash generating units.

In 2014, following a strategic review management considered any indications of impairment on the domain names which were acquired as part of the 
Bingos transaction in 2008. As a result of the strategic review the domain names have been valued at fair value less costs of disposal. These fair 
value measurements have been classified as Level 2 in accordance with IFRS 13 as management have obtained an external valuation, considering 
similar market transactions in a relatively illiquid market.  As a result these assets were impaired by £869,000.

22. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT - GROUP 
Treasury management 
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, along with various items, such as trade receivables and payables. 
 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for 
managing these risks and the policies adopted have been applied throughout the year and since the year end. 
 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. Customer funds are kept 
in dedicated client accounts, separately from the Group’s operational bank accounts in order to ensure that their liability can be met. 
 
The Board receive information of cash balances daily in order to keep the Group’s liquidity under review. 
 
The following table sets out the contractual maturities of financial liabilities:

Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The 
Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from cash in transit, though this exposure is relatively small given that the Group’s payment processors generally 
hold only a few days’ transactions at any given time. 
 
Credit risk also arises where cash and cash equivalents are deposited with banks or financial institutions. It is the Group’s policy to deposit funds only 
with reputable institutions, and to keep the position under review. 
 
The carrying value and the maximum exposure in relation to cash and cash equivalent and trade and other receivables are considered equal 
amounting to £14.6m (2014: £15.8m).                                                                                                                                                                          .                                            
 
Market risk 
Foreign currency risk 
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has assets and liabilities denominated in sterling, euros, US dollars and Israeli shekels. The Group’s 
policy, where possible, is to settle liabilities with cash generated from operations denominated in the same currency. 
 
The Directors receive a daily summary of cash balances held in each currency and regularly monitor the foreign currency risk exposure. 
 
Current assets and liabilities denominated in Euros (EUR), US Dollars (USD) and Israeli Shekels (ILS), translated into sterling are included within the 
statement of financial position as follows:

Cash flow interest rate risk 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from cash balances it holds. At 31 December 2015, if interest rates on cash deposits had been 10 basis points 
lower/higher with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and net assets would have been £14,000 lower/higher (2014: £14,000).

25. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS 
The Group has four employee share schemes – the 2000 All Employee Share Ownership Plan (“AESOP”), the 2000 Enterprise Management Incentive 
Scheme (“EMI”), the 2000 Approved Executive Share Ownership Scheme (“ASOS”) and the 2000 Unapproved Share Ownership Scheme (“USOS”). 
To date, the Group has granted options under the AESOP and EMI schemes. 
 
AESOP 
The AESOP holds shares in trust on behalf of employees. Subject to the satisfaction of any performance condition and the continuous employment 
of the beneficiary, access to shares occurs three years from the date of grant, unless there is a change in control of the Company when access may 
occur earlier. 
 
 
A summary of activity in shares issued through AESOP is shown below:

At the beginning of the year 99,933 99,933 
Movement in the year – – 
At the end of the year 99,933 99,933 
 
The market value of the shares held by the AESOP at 31 December 2015 was £7,375 (2014: £7,115). 
 
EMI 
Options to acquire ordinary shares under the EMI may be granted up to a maximum of £3,000,000 (based on the market value of the shares placed 
under option at the date of the grant). 
 
The determination of the number of options granted to employees is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
 
No consideration is payable for the grant of an option and options are not transferable or assignable. Cash consideration is paid to the Company by 
the employee at the point that the share options are exercised. The price paid for share options by employees is determined at the time of grant, 
and is normally equal to the mid-market share price on the date that the option is granted. 
 
An option is normally exercisable in stages between the 1st and 10th anniversaries of the date of grant. All options normally lapse if the option 
holder ceases to be employed by the Group, though at the discretion of the Company and depending upon the circumstances in which the 
employment has ended, some individuals may be permitted to retain options after they leave employment for six months, or an alternative timescale 
if agreed by the Remuneration Committee.

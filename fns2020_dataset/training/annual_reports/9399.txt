Annual Report and Accounts 2007/8

Over the last year we have
pursued our strategy of growing
sales of our hemodynamic
monitoring products in a range
of geographical regions across
the globe whilst maintaining
careful control of costs.
Overall sales for the year grew
by 18% to £4.05m, split 48%
and 52% between capital and
recurring revenue respectively.
As a result of the issue of
shares during the year, the
Company’s cash balance at the
year-end was £2.2m.
More than half of LiDCO’s sales during the
year came from outside the UK. Of note was
the strong growth in sales in continental
Europe, assisted by the redeployment of
some of our UK sales resources. UK sensor
sales showed good growth, as did sensor
sales in Europe.
Turning to product development, the
Company’s main focus last year was the
development of the new LiDCOrapid monitor
and disposables. This is designed especially
to meet the needs of the substantial and
growing market in major surgery and other
hospital applications where quick and easy
set-up is required and continuous trend
information is important. This new monitor
uses the same algorithm as that used in the
existing LiDCOplus monitor, so data from
studies involving the LiDCOplus also
validates the LiDCOrapid monitor, thus
helping with market acceptance. The
LiDCOrapid was launched in April 2008.
In addition, we were pleased to see the
publication during the year of a number of
independent outcome studies by leading
centres, such as the University of Iowa,
further endorsing the use of our LiDCOplus
technology. Such outcome studies are
important because they show the compelling
advantages of using our products, such as
shortened hospital stays, reduced mortality
and reduced infections. These not only
benefit the patient but also bring important
cost-savings for the hospital.
Our products continue to be developed and
assembled, with certain proprietary elements
manufactured, in our facility in East London,
under strict quality standards. The
Company’s critical care products are
registered in 14 markets in Europe, the USA,
Brazil, South Korea and Japan. Sales during
the year were made through our direct sales
forces in the UK and USA, and through our
international network of speciality critical care
and anesthesia distributors in 15 other
countries. In June the Company signed a
new marketing collaboration agreement with
Becton, Dickinson U.K. Limited. This type of
collaboration with a leading global medical
technology company is a tribute to our
technology and to our specialist sales force.
This type of collaborative agreement not only
broadens our offering among our target
customers but also potentially helps to
increase penetration of our markets.
In December 2007 the Company raised
£2m through the issue of new shares, to be
used for completing the development and
market introduction of the LiDCOrapid
monitor, supporting continued sales growth
of the Company’s existing products in the
critical care market and continuing its active
research and development programme.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank
our shareholders for their continued support
of the Company.
We were delighted to welcome Paul Clifford
to the Board in April 2008 as Finance
Director. Paul has extensive experience
of technology and software companies,
both listed on the main market and venture
capital-backed. His past positions include
being finance director of Comino Group plc,
a company that was listed on the London
Stock Exchange’s main market, and
Civica UK Limited.
To date the market for our products has
been mainly the intensive care /critical care
units of hospitals. The launch of the
LiDCOrapid monitor, now available for sales
to customers in the EC and USA, will open
more fully the substantial market opportunity
in major surgery. LiDCOrapid’s ease of use is
a key feature that is expected to broaden the
range of distributors willing and able to work
with us in existing and new territories.
We therefore expect to increase further our
distributor network this year in the EC, the
USA and the Rest of the World, whilst
maintaining our direct sales forces in the UK
and USA. The Company’s product
development activities, conducted in close
consultation with leading clinicians, mean
that we now have a broader portfolio of
linked products to offer our customers
enabling the measurement, analysis, audit
and communication of real-time and historic
hemodynamic data in both critical care units
and the operating theatre. Meanwhile, there
is an expanding body of scientific data linking
the optimization of patients’ hemodynamic
status with better outcomes and reduced
hospital stays.
With strong growth in sales of
our existing products, reinforced
by the recent launch of the
LiDCOrapid monitor targeted
at the major surgery market,
the emergence of an additional
new market opportunity
for improving the viability of
transplant organs, together
with our growing network
of distributors, the Company
is well positioned for further
growth in the coming year.
As we look with enthusiasm to the year
ahead, I would like to thank all the Group’s
staff and directors for their dedication and
hard work over the past year and our Clinical
Advisory Board for their valuable contribution.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Our objectives for the year were
fourfold: achieve revenue growth of our
core intensive care product, expand the
product range, increase our sales
distribution network and contain costs.
I am pleased to say that all four of these
objectives were achieved.

Overview
The worldwide market for hemodynamic
monitoring products continues to evolve,
mainly driven by the move away from the
use of the older invasive catheter products
towards the newer less invasive devices.
The potential market for these minimally
invasive devices, which include LiDCO’s
product range, is estimated at US$800
million per annum (surgery patient market
segment). We estimate that sales revenues
for minimally invasive hemodynamic
monitoring products grew in value last year
by 33%. Our objectives for the year were
fourfold: achieve revenue growth of our core
intensive care product, expand the product
range, increase our sales distribution
network and contain costs.
I am pleased to say that all four of these
objectives were achieved. Sales were up
18% on the prior year while we managed to
reduce normal operating overheads by 6%.
The favourable combination of increased
sales and reduced costs means that
significant progress towards profitability was
made. Following the expansion of the
distributor network and the recent
introduction of the LiDCOrapid product, our
business has both a wider product and
geographic base and is now capable of
significantly increasing its share of the global
hemodynamic monitoring market.
In summary, I feel that this has
been one of our most productive
periods and the Company is in a
strong position to continue to
move forward in 2008.
Sales and trading
Our strategy has been to supply the fast
growing hemodynamic monitoring market
with our proprietary products. I am pleased to
report that there is an increasing momentum
for the market’s transition to our minimally
invasive products and simultaneously in our
ability to access this market.
Since last year’s preliminary
results we have significantly
expanded our distribution
network with new distributors
added in a number of territories,
including Canada, the USA,
Israel, Turkey, and the Middle
East. Negotiations are ongoing
with specialty distributors in
additional regions of the USA
where we do not have direct
representation to further improve
our sales reach. We expect to be
able announce the conclusion of
these arrangements during the
next few months.
Revenues outside of the UK were up by a
very encouraging 63%. The performance of
established European distributors in the
period was particularly encouraging with
revenue increasing by no less than 71%.
The resurgence of sales growth in the USA,
while anticipated, was also good to see.
Overall sales growth at 18% was therefore
limited by lower demand for monitors in the
UK although disposable sales remained
buoyant. In a year where all capital
purchases by NHS hospitals in the UK were
at a low level for most of the period we
decided to redeploy existing sales resources
to the export market, which contributed to
our 63% increase in export sales. Exports
now represent the majority of our sales.
This has the positive effect of reducing our
reliance on an often ‘stop/start’ UK market.
We are expecting trading in the UK to
improve moderately this year with NHS
capital purchase budgets likely to be a little
more freely available. Furthermore our new
LiDCOrapid surgery product is targeted at a
more accessible revenue budget.
Accordingly we have now brought our UK
sales force up to strength with a number
of new appointments.
Despite an increasing proportion of lower-
margin distributor sales, product gross
margins were maintained at 78% on
monitors, and modestly improved to 87% on
disposables. In addition to maintaining
product margin the increased sales were
achieved without an increase in costs. I am
very pleased to be able to report that over
the last four years our sales have increased
by 79% while we have simultaneously
reduced our costs by 16%. Over the last few
years we have made strategic investments in
our patents, our products and their
automated manufacture, coupled with
development of clinical/business cases. We
are now starting to see clear evidence that
these investments have been justified and
can now be leveraged to support a
significantly larger turnover from both our
direct and distributor sales teams.
Looking forward, our new surgery product,
the LiDCOrapid monitor, launched in April,
should have a dual advantage for us.
Not only does it address the needs of a
US$800million per annum surgery market,
but also makes our product range more
attractive to sell by both the existing and new
distribution partners. The attractive features
of this new product – proprietary technology
and design, high margin, ease of set-up and
use – have already helped propel the recent
expansion of our distribution network.
While this expansion of the sales distribution
channel occurred too late to contribute
materially to the 2007/08 results, these
additions are expected to provide a
significant new source of revenue in the
second half of the current year.
In addition to signing up more distributors, in
June 2007 LiDCO announced the signing of
an exclusive UK marketing collaboration with
Becton, Dickinson U.K. Limited (‘BD’). BD is
a leading global medical technology
company and this collaboration involves the
joint promotion, in selected UK hospitals
where LiDCO already has existing sales and
customer relationships, of a number of
critical care products currently being sold by
the BD Medical Surgical Systems business
unit. LiDCO’s strong customer relationship
with critical care departments in UK hospitals
was a key factor in BD’s decision to form this
exclusive collaboration. This marketing
partnership will result in enhanced sales
coverage for BD’s critical care product lines
in the UK and LiDCO will receive a share of
any profits made.
LiDCO_FRONT_0708_aw:LiDCO REP_FRONT_0708_aw  21/5/08  15:53  Page 7 Market trends –
LiDCO’s sales and marketing strategy
Intensive care market
In a 2007 article in the Journal of the
American Medical Association doctors from
Harborview Hospital in Seattle noted that
their use of the invasive pulmonary artery
catheter (PAC) for measuring cardiac output
had declined by 77% over the last four years.
The authors, whose hospital is now a LiDCO
product user, also commented that ‘Recently
nurses and residents gathered around the
bedside of the sole patient in the intensive
care unit (ICU) with a PAC so they could
actually observe one still in use’. The use of
the invasive PAC approach to monitor
hemodynamics continues to decline and this
is particularly so in the ICU. In contrast the
sales of the LiDCOplus monitor are
increasing in the ICU – clearly in these LiDCO
accounts we are replacing the PAC with our
technology, which has been convincingly
demonstrated to improve clinical outcome
and reduce costs in patients after surgery.
The transition to minimally
invasive monitoring in this
market is expected to continue.
We intend to further distinguish
ourselves from older
catheter-based technologies
by presenting to hospitals a
number of strong clinical and
business cases associated with
use of our products.
Accordingly we were pleased to announce
during the year the results of a study
conducted in 2006 at the University of Iowa,
showing that use of our products in severely
ill patients with shock and sepsis
substantially reduced mortality.
The University, which has been using our
technology since 2003, conducted a
retrospective analysis of outcomes in a group
of critically ill patients treated for septic shock
and systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS). This epidemiological study
was undertaken to evaluate the various
hemodynamic monitoring technologies used
in the ICU and their effect on outcomes in
this gravely ill patient population.
Patients treated with the LiDCOplus monitor
had a substantially lower mortality rate than
those treated clinically with the PAC: ICU
mortality in the LiDCO treated group of
patients was only 12% compared with 32%
in the PAC treated group or 31% in those
patients managed without any hemodynamic
monitoring. The compelling data from this
study supports the case that using the
LiDCOplus monitor decreases death rates in
patients with septic shock or SIRS. This is
very exciting news for us and our hospital
customers and for patients, as these
conditions have historically been very difficult
to treat successfully. Similar trials are in
progress in other countries to repeat and
confirm this observation. If successful the
data should have meaningful effects on the
uptake of our LiDCOplus monitor product
within our existing ICU customer base.
Major surgery market – a new opportunity
Now that we have established our
technology’s credentials and the LiDCO
brand name within the technically demanding
intensive care market, we have used our
expertise to produce a product for sale into
the emerging high-risk surgery market.
This project resulted in the recent launch of
the LiDCOrapid monitor. Our goal was to
introduce a simple and easy-to-use product
that would be used to optimize a patient’s
hemodynamic profile during surgery.
Individualized fluid administration to maintain
and optimize hemodynamics and tissue
oxygenation plays a major role in the
management of the moderate to high-risk
surgical patient. This cannot be achieved
reliably through the use of conventionally
measured parameters such as arterial
pressure, heart rate, urine output and central
venous pressure but requires use of a
specially designed monitor that provides a
continuous measure of cardiac output.
The LiDCOrapid is the first
monitor specifically designed to
help surgical teams maintain a
patient’s optimal hemodynamic
profile. It is easy to use and set
up and is designed with a user
interface that is both visually
intuitive and informative.
It provides early warning of hemodynamic
change, together with an indication of fluid
responsiveness and actual response to a
fluid or drug intervention. We are confident
that widespread adoption of the LiDCOrapid
will have a major impact on improving
outcomes after major surgery by reducing
complications and shortening hospital stays:
this will not only benefit patients but also cut
treatment costs. The initial response to this
new product has been excellent and we are
very excited about the potential of this
product to take a significant share of this
US$800 million surgery market.
Organ transplantation –
a developing market opportunity
There has been a large amount of publicity in
the press about the growing shortage of
transplantable organs. This is in part related
to declining numbers of patients suitable to
act as organ donors. However the situation
is compounded by an assumption that post-
collection loss of transplantable organs is
inevitable if an initial assessment of the donor
suggests that the patients’ hemodynamics,
and hence organs, have deteriorated
irreversibly. Brain death is known to induce
dramatic changes in hemodynamics but
donors are often not adequately
hemodynamically monitored. This results in
inadequate resuscitation, thereby reducing
organ yield due to oxygen debt. In an effort
to improve donor outcomes, LiDCO is
working with an Organ Procurement
Organisation (OPO) in the USA which is using
our minimally invasive continuous
hemodynamic monitoring to guide donor
management decisions in hemodynamically
unstable donors. The OPO believes that the
ability to monitor and assess continuously
fluid parameters, pressure and blood flow
would enable the OPO coordinator to
recognize and apply situation-specific
interventions that target improving
hemodynamics and hence improve end-
organ perfusion. LiDCOplus monitoring is
minimally invasive and brings the advantage
that such care could be initiated immediately
by the OPO coordinator (frequently a nurse)
without the need for inserting specialized
catheters (eg. the invasive pulmonary artery
catheter) or requiring specialist physician
support. I am delighted to report that

minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring
has indeed helped to improve donor
outcomes in these cases, with a significant
increase in the number of organs available
for transplantation.
This issue has been further
studied by the University of
Pittsburgh in a recently
published prospective study.
This confirmed our expectation
that donors who were
adequately resuscitated with
the LiDCOplus monitor provided
a significantly higher number
(3.7 compared with 2) of organs
per donor that were suitable for
transplant, whereas donors
who had inadequate volume
resuscitation were associated
with a higher inflammatory
response. These results have
generated considerable interest
within the transplantation
community, which is beginning
to translate into sales of
our technology into this
developing market.
Product development
The last year has been a very active one for
product development. Our development
strategy is to respond quickly to market
opportunities by providing proprietary
hemodynamic monitoring products. The
LiDCOrapid development follows on from the
launch of the LiDCOplus version 4.1 software,
the new LiDCO PC products LiDCOview
SE
and LiDCOview
PRO
(launched) and LiDCOlive
(in development and discussed below).
LiDCOrapid was launched on target in April of
this year with the first shipments of product to
our distributor customers. Customer
response to this exciting product has been
exceptional and we are expecting this
product to represent a new standard of care
for major surgery patients.
We believe that the combination of the
LiDCOplus and LiDCOrapid monitors and our
data analysis PC software products
collectively represent the most evolved
platforms available today for the care and
hemodynamic optimization of both intensive
care and surgery patients.
LiDCOlive –
data display independent of location
The LiDCOlive development is aimed at the
creation of a virtual intensive care unit, taking
real-time hemodynamic patient data and
easy-to-interpret screens to the clinician –
irrespective of their physical location.
Location-independent monitoring is required
to offset the growing shortage of the highly
skilled staff needed to care for these patients.
LiDCO is therefore developing a PC-based
software product called LiDCOlive that can
display the LiDCOplus monitor trend screen
and real-time patient data on any PC or
laptop regardless of location. The clinician,
together with the nurse at the patient’s bed-
side, can then discuss potential treatment
approaches and immediately see the effects
of their agreed change in fluid or drug
therapy. This ‘virtual ICU’ approach using
LiDCO’s technology has the potential to make
a considerable improvement in the care of
high-risk patients and to make best use of
the skills of the hospital clinical staff. The
prototype LiDCOlive product has been
successfully demonstrated in Japan, the
Czech Republic and the USA at various
international meetings this year. One of the
trialists of LiDCOlive, Dr. Loua Shaikh
(Department of Critical Care Medicine, Frimley
Park Hospital, UK), said: ‘In terms of patient
care, the impact of time and distance on the
delivery of experience and expert knowledge
to the bedside are considerably diminished.’
The LiDCOlive software is still a
product in development but we
expect the first generation of
this product to be available
during the second half of 2008.
Regulatory affairs and product quality
During the period both our EC notified
body and the US FDA conducted
surveillance visits. LiDCO is pleased to report
that no non-conformity issues were raised
by either group of inspectors. Our product
quality and customer satisfaction record
continues to be excellent.

IFRS
The attached financial statements for the
year to 31 January 2008 have been prepared
for the first time in accordance with IFRS and
the impact of IFRS has had no effect, other
than presentation, on the reported figures
and there were no material changes to the
opening balances. Where necessary,
comparative figures previously reported
under UK GAAP have been restated for the
transition to IFRS.
Operating results
Turnover increased by 18%
to £4.05m (2006/07: £3.44m).
The installed base of monitors
increased in the year by
149 units to 1,184 (2006/7:
1,035 units), representing an
increase of 14%. This has led
to an accompanying increase
in sensor usage of 7% from
24,316 to 26,081 units.
Product margins against external
procurement costs have been maintained at
78% on monitors and modestly improved to
87% on disposables. The overall reported
gross margin on sales is 64%, down from
67% in 2006/7 with the decrease being
almost entirely accounted for by the
increased monthly payments to Med One.
Excluding the Med One monthly payments,
the gross margin on sales was 75%
(2006/07: 76%).
Administrative and distribution expenses
were reduced by £320,000 (6%) from
£4.94m to £4.62m. This is principally due to
savings in staff costs, professional fees and
premises costs which were offset by
increases in depreciation and amortization.
As a result of the increase in revenues and
reduced costs, operating losses decreased
by £613,000 to £2.01m (2006/07: £2.62m)
and the loss per share was reduced to 1.50
pence (2006/07: 2.10 pence).
Taxation
As the Group is still at the pre-profit stage
there was no tax charge for the year. In
addition the Group has a deferred tax asset
of £6.1m to offset against future profits,
although this has not been recognized in the
accounts. In the UK, the Group qualifies for
research and development (R&D) tax credits
which amounted to £120,000 in 2007/08
which are shown in the income statement.
Cash, financing and working capital
The net cash outflow from operating activities
remained level at £1.10m (2006/07: £1.12m)
despite the reduction in operating losses.
This was largely as a result of exceptional
cash receipts in 2006/07 from two years of
R&D tax credits and the collection of a large
number of old outstanding debtors.
Excluding the receipt of R&D tax credits, the
net cash outflow from operating activities has
reduced by 30% over the last two years.
The net cash outflow before financing
increased from £1.60m to £1.69m as the
result of increased spending on both fixed
and intangible fixed assets.
Debtor days at the year end showed a slight
improvement to 111 days compared with
115 days last year. Creditor days have
reduced from 45 days to 29 days. Stock at
the year end as a percentage of turnover has
reduced from 31% to 21%.
In November 2007, the Company placed
23,647,074 shares at a price of 8.5p per
share raising £2m before expenses with
financial institutions and a number of private
investors. The expenses relating to the
placing were £67,000.
As anticipated in last year’s financial
statements, the Group made use of its £1m
(US$2m) Laurus loan facility and drew down
£500,000 in August 2007. The amount
drawn down at the year end stood at
£553,000. The Laurus loan facility is due for
repayment in August 2008 and it is
anticipated that this will need to be replaced
by a new facility of similar size. The Company
is in discussions with a number of lenders
and the Board is reasonably confident that
this facility can be replaced.
As a result of the placing and the draw down
of the loan facility, the Group’s cash balances
at the year end were £2.23m compared with
£1.47m the previous year.

Companies that have shares traded on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange are not required to comply
with the disclosures of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance which is appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority (the 2006 FRC Code). However, the Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance, where
appropriate for a Company of its size.
The Board of Directors
The Board consists of four executive directors and two non-executive directors. The non-executive directors are free from any relationship
with the executive management of the Company and the Board considers that both non-executive directors, other than through their
shareholdings, are independent directors. The non-executive directors bring a wide range of skills and experience to the Board and fulfil a
vital role in corporate accountability.
The Chairman of the Board is Ms Wallis and Mr Brown is the senior independent non-executive director.
Directors’ biographies are provided on page 13.
There were 12 scheduled meetings during the year. The attendance of the individual directors at the Board Meetings and
Committee Meetings was as follows:

Numbers in brackets denote the total number of meetings during the year.
All the directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, whose appointment and removal is a matter for the
Board as a whole. All directors are able to take independent advice in the furtherance of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
The Company Secretary supports both the Board and the Committees.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, all new directors are required to resign and seek re-election at the first Annual General Meeting
following their appointment. All directors are required to seek re-election at intervals of no more than three years.
Board evaluation and performance
In February 2008, the Board carried out an evaluation of its performance, functioning and composition and that of each Committee.
This involved each director completing an evaluation, the results of which were then collated and discussed by the Board. Actions were
agreed, including the need to appoint an experienced finance director. This position has now been filled. It is the Board’s intention to
continue to review annually its performance and that of its Committees.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw:LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw  21/5/08  16:00  Page 14 Committees of the Board
Audit Committee
The members of the Committee are Ms Wallis (Chairman) and Mr Brown. The external auditors also attend meetings. The Committee
considers financial reporting and internal controls. It also reviews the scope and results of the external audit and the independence and
objectivity of the auditors. It meets at least twice a year and reviews the interim and annual financial statements before they are submitted for
approval by the Board. The Committee met three times during the year. The Committee considers annually whether the auditors remain
independent for the purposes of the audit. This year the fee for non-audit work is £10,000 against an audit fee of £39,000. The Committee
is satisfied that the auditors remain independent for the purposes of the annual audit. The Committee consider that given the size of the
Company and its current stage of development a separate internal audit function cannot be justified, but the matter is re-considered
annually by the Committee.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee are Ms Wallis (Chairman) and Mr Brown. The Committee reviews and sets the remuneration of the executive
directors. It also reviews the policy for the salaries and bonuses of all other staff. It advises on share schemes and approves the granting of
share options. The Committee met four times during the year.
Nominations Committee
The members of the Committee are Ms Wallis (Chairman), Mr Brown and Dr O’Brien. The Committee considers, at the request of the Board,
candidates for new appointments to the Board and advises on all matters relating to Board appointments.
Relations with shareholders
The Company seeks to maintain and enhance good relations with its shareholders. The Company’s interim and annual reports are
supplemented by published updates to investors on technical and commercial progress. All investors have access to up-to-date information on
the Company via its website, www.lidco.com, which also provides contact details for investor relations enquiries. All shareholders are invited to
make use of the Company’s Annual General Meeting to raise any questions regarding the management or performance of the Company.
The Chief Executive and Chairman meet regularly with shareholders and the investing community and report to the Board feedback from those
meetings. Both non-executive directors have the opportunity to attend shareholder meetings. The Board is kept informed on market views
about the Company.
Accountability and audit – Going concern
As noted in the accounting policies and on the basis of current financial projections, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Internal control, regulation and risk management
The composition of the Board and the senior management team provides a suitable range of knowledge and experience to enable
adequate risk monitoring. Further details may be found in the Directors’ Report.

The report will be subject to shareholder vote at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in June 2008.
Committee membership
The membership of the Remuneration Committee is made up of the following non-executive directors:
T A Wallis (Chairman)
I G Brown
Neither of the Committee members has any day-to-day involvement in the running of the Company, nor do they have any business
or other relationship that could affect, or appear to affect, the exercise of their independent judgement, other than as shareholders.
No director plays a part in any decision about his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Committee determines on behalf of the Board, the remuneration for the executive directors and reviews remuneration policies for all
employees. Remuneration levels are set in order to attract high calibre recruits and to retain and motivate those directors and employees once
they have joined the Company to ensure the future success of the business and to deliver long-term shareholder value. This is achieved by
a combination of base salary, bonuses and share options, which are offered to executive directors and employees at all levels. The Committee
met four times in the year.
Base salary
All three executive directors receive a base salary and an allowance in lieu of benefits. The salary reflects the experience and level of
competence of the individual to whom it applies, as judged by the Committee, taking into account salary levels in the market.
Annual bonus
The executive directors who served during the year are members of the Company’s Senior Management Bonus Scheme. Under the terms
of the Scheme, the Remuneration Committee assesses the directors’ individual performances soon after the end of the financial year,
judged against pre-determined targets.
The criteria for awarding bonuses during the year included corporate and individual objectives. Corporate objectives included sales
performance and loss before tax. Bonuses are capped at 50% of base salary.
Remuneration policy of the non-executive directors
The Board determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors. The non-executive directors do not participate in the Company’s
share option schemes and are not eligible for annual incentive payments or benefits in kind.

31 January 2008.
Principal activities, business review and business risks
The principal activity of the Group is the development, manufacture and sale of cardiac monitoring equipment.
The review of the business is included in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review which should be read as part of this directors’ report.
The key commercial risks associated with the business are:
• the development of competing products which can restrict the Group’s ability to make further progress in increasing its share of the
minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring market. The Group addresses this by seeking independent validation of its products and
introducing product developments and enhancements to both existing and new markets;
• healthcare spending – the Group’s performance is affected by hospitals’ expenditure and budgetary constraints which the Group mitigates
by targeting its efforts and resources according to specific opportunities and market expansion in different territories;
• competition activity from market leaders in the USA and Japan. The Group is competing against more established suppliers and the
Group’s progress in these markets is more fully covered in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review.
The key financial risk being the management and maintenance of sufficient cash balances to support the ongoing development and marketing
of the LiDCO technology.
Results and dividends
The Group’s revenue for the year was £4,051,000 (2006/7: £3,443,000). The Group made a consolidated loss after taxation of £1,866,000
(2006/7: £2,385,000). The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2006/7: £nil).
The Company’s share price at 31 January 2008 was 7.5p (2007: 10p).
Research and Development
The Group continued to develop the LiDCO systems during the year. Details of the costs expended on research and development are set out
in Notes 3 and 8 to the financial statements.
Share capital and share premium account
Full details of the authorised and issued share capital of the Company, together with details of the movements in the Company’s issued share

LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw:LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw  21/5/08  16:00  Page 20 Directors’ indemnities and Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
The Company has exercised the power given by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting to extend the indemnities to directors and
officers against liability to third parties. The directors also have Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover in place in respect of personal liabilities
which may be incurred by directors and officers in the course of their service with the Company.
Employment policy
Equal opportunity is given to all employees regardless of their gender, race or ethnic origin, religion, age, disability, or sexual orientation.
The policy of the directors is to encourage the involvement of all employees in the development and performance of the Group.
Employees are regularly briefed on the Group’s activities through regular information releases and meetings. All employees are encouraged
to give their views on matters of common concern through the line management. All employees participate in the share option schemes.
Supplier payment policy
It is and will continue to be the policy of the Group to negotiate with suppliers so as to obtain the best available terms taking account of
quality, delivery, price and period of settlement and, having agreed those terms, to abide by them. The total amount of the Group’s trade
creditors falling due within the year ended 31 January 2008 represents 29 days’ worth (2006/7: 45 days) as a proportion of the total amount
invoiced by suppliers during the period.

*The percentages shown are based on the issued share capital at that date.
Charitable and political donations
The Group made no charitable or political donations in the year (2006/7: £nil).
Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The parent company financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group or Company for that period. In preparing those financial statements,
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
In so far as the directors are aware:
• there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation
in other jurisdictions.

LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw:LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw  21/5/08  16:00  Page 21 Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, as set out in Note 1, Basis of Preparation, which assumes that the
Company will have sufficient funds to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Company has continued to invest in the
development of its operations and in particular its sales and marketing presence by continuing to invest in both its direct and indirect sales
channels during the year and in a new product offering. As a result it has continued to trade at a loss during the year ended 31 January 2008.
The directors have approved forecasts for the foreseeable future, which indicate that the Company will have sufficient funding to continue to
trade during that period. The forecasts assume a level of new sales about which there is uncertainty. If such new sales are not achieved, the
directors believe that there are sufficient opportunities available to them to obtain additional funding from sources that are currently being
explored which would enable the Company to continue to develop its operations and to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The convertible loan
from Laurus (see note 11) is due for repayment in August 2008 and it is anticipated that this will need to be replaced by a new loan facility of
similar size. The Company is in discussion with a number of lenders and the Board is reasonably confident that the facility can be replaced.
Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that would be required in the event that the Company had insufficient funding available.
Financial risk management
The Financial Risk Management objectives and policies of the Group, including the exposure to interest rate risk, liquidity risk and currency
risk are set out in note 13 to the financial statements.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The Board monitors progress of the Group’s strategy and by reference to the KPIs, specifically revenue growth, gross margin, price
maintenance, working capital levels and market position. These KPIs have been addressed in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review and
the Financial Review.
Internal controls, regulation and risk management
The Company has implemented an organisational structure with clearly-defined responsibilities and lines of accountability.
Detailed budgets and forecasts are prepared annually and progress against expectations is reviewed monthly by the Board. Underpinning the
monthly financial reporting is a system of internal control, based on authorisation procedures.
As a medical device Company, LiDCO also has a system of regulatory controls, to ensure compliance with all requirements of the Medicines
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and other medical bodies. During the year the
Company was compliant with ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems) and ISO13485 (Medical Devices – Quality Management Systems).
The Company performs periodic risk assessments involving all departments. The results are reviewed by the Board and actions to mitigate
risk are indentified and agreed.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditors and to authorise the directors to set their remuneration will be proposed at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice to convene the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on Wednesday 25 June 2008 is included in the circular which
accompanies this Annual Report. The circular details the resolutions to be proposed at the meeting together with a brief explanation for each.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

For the year ended 31 January 2008
LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw:LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw  21/5/08  16:00  Page 22 We have audited the group financial statements of LiDCO Group Plc for the year ended 31 January 2008 which comprise the principal
accounting policies, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement and the
consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity and notes 1 to 18. These Group financial statements have been prepared under
the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of LiDCO Group Plc for the year ended 31 January 2008.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, and whether the Group financial statements
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in
the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information
presented in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review that is cross referred from the business review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we also report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial statements.
The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, Corporate Governance Statement, Remuneration Report, Chief Executive Officer’s
Review and the Chairman’s Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state
of the Group’s affairs as at 31 January 2008 and of its loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements for the year ended 31 January 2008.

LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw:LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw  21/5/08  16:01  Page 27 1 Principal accounting policies
The Group’s principal activity is the development, manufacture and sale of cardiac monitoring equipment. LiDCO Group Plc is the Group’s
ultimate parent company. It is incorporated and domiciled in England & Wales and situated at the address shown on page 47.
The Group’s shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and
under the historical cost convention. They are presented in sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent company and the Group.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of
current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The policies have changed from the previous year when the financial statements were prepared under applicable United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). The comparative information has been restated in accordance with IFRS. The changes to
accounting policies are explained below. There were no material changes to the opening balances. The date of transition to IFRS was
1 February 2006 (transition date).
The Group has taken advantage of certain exemptions available under IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards. The exemptions used are explained under the respective accounting policy.
The accounting policies that have been applied in the opening balance sheet have also been applied consistently throughout all periods
presented in these financial statements. These accounting policies comply with each IFRS that is mandatory for accounting periods ending on
31 January 2008.
IFRS standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following new standards and interpretations, which are yet to become mandatory have not been applied to the Group’s
2008 financial statements.

Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment-Vesting Conditions and Cancellations 1 January 2009
IFRS3 Business Combinations (Revised 2008) 1 July 2009

IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements (revised 2007) 1 January 2009
IAS23 Borrowing costs (revised 2007) 1 January 2008
IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (Revised 2008) 1 July 2009
Amendment to IAS32 Financial Instruments:

IFRIC14 IAS19 – The limit on a Defined Benefit asset. Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 1 January 2008
IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 1 January 2008
IFRIC12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008
IFRIC11 IFRS2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material financial impact
on the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group has continued to invest in the development of its operations and in particular its
sales and marketing presence by continuing to invest in both its direct and indirect sales channels during the year and in a new product
offering. As a result the Group has continued to trade at a loss during the year ended 31 January 2008.
The directors have approved forecasts for the foreseeable future, which indicate that the Group will have sufficient funds to trade during that
period. The forecasts assume a level of new sales about which there is uncertainty. If such new sales are not achieved, the directors believe
that there are sufficient opportunities available to them to obtain additional funding from sources which are currently being explored, to enable
the Group to continue to develop its operations and to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The convertible loan from Laurus (see note 11) is due
for repayment in August 2008 and it is anticipated that this will need to be replaced by a new loan facility of similar size. The Company is in
discussion with a number of lenders and the Board are reasonably confident that the facility can be replaced. Accordingly the financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would be required in
the event that the Company had insufficient funding available.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 January 2008
The accompanying accounting policies and notes form an integral part of these financial statements.
LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw:LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw  21/5/08  16:01  Page 28 Basis of consolidation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 January
2008. Subsidiary undertakings are all entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to
obtain economic benefits from its activities. The Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
Business combinations are dealt with by the purchase method. The purchase method involves the recognition at fair value of all identifiable
assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at the acquisition date whether or not they were recognised in the
statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the
consolidated balance sheet at their fair values which are also used as the bases for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group
accounting policies. The results of any subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period, where applicable are included from the date of
acquisition. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
IFRS transition changes
There are no material changes to the reported figures following the adoption of IFRS and no material changes to the opening balances.
The main policies that are amended are:
Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement
IAS39 is applicable to the convertible loan. At 31 January 2008, the liability amounted to £553,000 and the adjustment
arising from this is immaterial.
Deferred tax
The Group has a significant unprovided deferred tax asset. Although there is a change in the basis of assessment for deferred tax under
IAS12: Income Taxes, there is no recognition of this unprovided element.
Exemptions
IFRS1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ sets out the transition rules, which must be applied, when IFRS is
adopted for the first time. The standard sets out certain mandatory exemptions to retrospective application and certain optional exemptions.
The most significant optional exemptions available and taken by the Group are in business combinations. The Group has adopted the
exemption under IFRS1 relating to business combinations which occurred before the date of transition, 1 February 2006.
Revenue recognition
Revenues are recognised at fair value of the consideration receivable net of the amount of value added taxes.
Sale of goods
Sales revenue comprises revenue earned (net of returns, discounts and allowances) from the provision of products to entities outside the
consolidated entity. Sales revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods passes to the customer, which is
normally upon delivery, and when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
The Group has an arrangement for the placing of monitors in hospitals with Med One Capital Funding, LLC, a US company that has trading
relationships with the majority of US hospitals and provides a number of deferred payment arrangements together with product support and
advice. The Group sells monitors to Med One and recognises the revenue as a sale. Title to the monitors passes to Med One, as do the
significant risks and rewards of ownership and there is no obligation for the Group to re-purchase the monitors. The full revenue arising from
the sale of consumables relating to these monitors is recognised as revenue by the Group. Med One is entitled to a portion of the monthly
revenue from the sale of consumables for a period of three years and payments made to Med One in this way are included within cost of sales.
Delivery of services
Revenue from rendering services is recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
Interest income
Interest income is brought to account as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Other income
Other income is brought to account when the consolidated entity’s right to receive income is established and the amount can be reliably measured.

LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw:LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw  21/5/08  16:01  Page 29 Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale
• the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it
• the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset
• the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset, and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably
Capitalised development costs which comprise cost of materials, labour and attributable overheads are amortised over a period
of three to five years.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
Intangible assets – development costs
Intangible assets represent costs relating to product registration in new countries, software development costs and clinical trials on the LiDCO
system. Where the directors are satisfied as to the technical, commercial and financial viability of these projects, the expenditure has been
capitalised and is amortised in equal amounts over the useful life.
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. The amortisation periods generally applicable are:
Clinical trials Three years
Product registration costs Five years
Software development Three years
Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation. Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated
residual value of these assets by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives which are re-assessed annually.
The periods/rates generally applicable are:
Leasehold improvements Over the life of the lease
Plant and machinery 10% per annum
Fixtures and fittings 12.5% per annum
Office equipment 20% per annum
Computer equipment 33% per annum
Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of fair value or present value of the minimum lease payments in the
balance sheet and depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant
proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statements account on
a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less the estimated costs of selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and
bringing them to their existing locations and condition.

For the year ended 31 January 2008
LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw:LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw  21/5/08  16:01  Page 30 Income tax
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on the taxable result for the year.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the difference
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as
other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the
underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets and
liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate
to items that are charged or credited directly to equity (such as the revaluation of land) in which case the related deferred tax is also charged
or credited directly to equity.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in
foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange
rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are recognised and initially recognised at fair value amount and subsequently at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provisions for impairment. Provision against trade receivables is made when there is
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables.
The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated
future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and demand deposits with an original maturity of three months or less,
and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial
assets and are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are initially recorded at fair value
net of issue costs. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its
liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Embedded derivatives: Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the contracts are not measured at fair value with
changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of the liability portion of a convertible loan is determined using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible loan.
The amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the loan. The remainder
of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option, which is recognised and included in shareholder’s equity.
Share-based payments
The Group has one equity-settled share-based remuneration scheme for employees. Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair
value of the options at the date of grant is calculated using a pricing model and is charged to the income statement over the vesting period.
Market, and non-market vesting conditions such as sales growth are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other
vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied.

LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw:LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw  21/5/08  16:01  Page 31 Key judgments in applying the entity’s accounting policies
The Group’s management makes estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated based
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on the
management’s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness.
Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the carrying value and amounts charged to the income statement in specific
periods (notes 7 and 8).
Inventory
The Group reviews the net realisable value of, and demand for, its inventory on a regular basis to provide assurance that recorded inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Factors that could impact estimated demand and selling prices include the timing and
success of future technological innovations, competitor actions, supplier prices and economic trends (note 9).
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are primarily due from two groups, hospitals in the UK and USA where sales are made by the Group’s own sales force and
distributors, predominantly in Europe and the Rest of the World. In making provision for overdue trade receivables, management consider
those due directly from hospitals to be generally of lower risk than those due from distributors and apply a lower level of provision. The size of
the distributor together with its financial credit rating and the length of relationship with the Group are also taken into account (note 10).
2 Revenue and segmental information
The Group has one primary segment – the supply of monitors, sensors and support services associated with the use of LiDCO’s cardiac
monitoring equipment. Geographical and product type analysis is used by management to monitor sales activity and is presented below:

Sales of monitors to Med One as detailed in note 1 under revenue recognition during the year amounted to £467,000 (2006/07: £399,000).
The monthly payments to Med One relating to consumables and included within cost of sales amounted to £444,000 (2006/07: £316,000)
during the year.
The Group can identify trade receivables and trade payables relating to the geographical segments. As noted above, the Group has one
primary segment and other assets and liabilities together with non-sales related overheads are not accounted for on a segment by segment
basis. Accordingly, segment assets, liabilities and segment cash flows are not provided.

6 Loss per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number
of shares in issue during the year. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the calculation described above adjusted to allow
for the issue of shares on the assumed conversion of all dilutive options. Share options are regarded as dilutive when, and only when, their
conversion to ordinary shares would increase the loss per share.

A US$2 million three year convertible loan agreement was entered into with Laurus Master Fund Ltd (Laurus) on 10 August 2005.
The notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the Group at any time during the three year period at a price of 24p, or at 85% of the
average closing price over the preceding 10 trading days, if lower and if the conversion has been requested by the Group. Interest is payable
at 1.5% above New York Journal Prime, which has resulted in an effective average interest rate of circa 9.5%. The balance of the Laurus loan
at 31 January 2008 was US$1,100,000 (£553,000). The split between the debt element and an equity component, representing the fair value
of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is as follows:

The directors believe the amount shown above represents a fair value of the liability component.
The calculation has been carried out in accordance with IAS32 in order to determine the equity component of the Laurus convertible loan. The
interest rate payable to Laurus represents a full commercial rate, this calculation gives an equity component of zero.

13 Financial instruments
Financial risks
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources, borrowings and items such as trade receivables and trade payables
that arise from its operations.
The main risks that arise from the Group’s financial instruments are credit, interest rate, liquidity and currency risk. The Board reviews and
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for
doubtful receivables, estimates by management based on prior experience of customers and their assessment of the current economic
environment. The maximum exposure is £1,185,000 (2007: £1,088,000)
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are respectable international banks.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage this financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest surplus cash
assets safely and profitably.
Market risks
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of shareholder funds and a US dollar based convertible loan with an interest rate of 1.5%
above New York Journal Prime. The Group accepts the risk attached to interest rate fluctuations as interest rates have been relatively stable
over the last three years and the interest expense is a small proportion of total administrative expenses.
Currency risk
The Group manages currency risk by assessing the net exposure in each non-sterling currency in which exposure arises. The only significant
exposure relates to US dollars. The Group accepts the risk attached to fluctuations in the US$ exchange rate as the US$ based loan liability
and US$ payables are partly mitigated by US$ receivables from sales.

Interest on the Laurus convertible loan is payable at 1.5% above New York Journal Prime, which has resulted in an effective interest rate
of circa 9.5%. The loan is repayable within one year.
The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk. The currency where the Group is most exposed to foreign
currency volatility is US dollars.
Transactions and balances of the subsidiaries are denominated in the local currency and had the following balances denominated in US dollars:

Currently, no hedging instruments are used. The Group keeps under review the extent of its exposure to currency fluctuations.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the net result for the year and equity in regards to the Group’s financial assets and financial
liabilities and the sterling to US$ exchange rates. It assumes a percentage change in the exchange rate based on the foreign currency financial
instruments held at each balance sheet date. Both of these percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in
exchange rates in the previous 12 months.

is considered to be representative of the group’s exposure to currency risk.

Weighted average share price (p) 19.0 19.0
Weighted average exercise price (p) 19.0 19.0
Expected volatility 40% 40%
Expected life 3.5 3.5
Risk free rate 5% 5%
Expected dividend yield ––
The expected volatility is based on the Group’s historical share price averaged over a period equal to the expected life. The expected life is the
average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is based on the UK Government gilts. The share options outstanding at the
end of the year have exercise prices of between 5.0p and 28.25p per share.
16 Capital commitments
The Group had no capital commitments at 31 January 2008 or 31 January 2007.
17 Contingent liabilities

LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw:LiDCO_BACK_0708_aw  21/5/08  16:01  Page 41 We have audited the parent company financial statements of LiDCO Group Plc for the year ended 31 January 2008 which comprise the
principal accounting policies, the balance sheet and notes 1 to 9. These parent company financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of LiDCO Group Plc for the year ended 31 January 2008.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, and the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom law
and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent
company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our
opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.
In addition we also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Corporate Governance Statement, Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report,
Chief Executive Officer’s Review and the Chairman’s Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the parent
company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the parent company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 January 2008;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985. As permitted by that Act,
the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The principal accounting policies of the Company are set out below.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group has continued to invest in the development of its operations and in particular its
sales and marketing presence by continuing to invest in both its direct and indirect sales channels during the year and in a new product
offering. As a result the Group has continued to trade at a loss during the year ended 31 January 2008.
The directors have approved forecasts for the foreseeable future, which indicate that the Group will have sufficient funds to trade during that
period. The forecasts assume a level of new sales about which there is uncertainty. If such new sales are not achieved, the directors believe
that there are sufficient opportunities available to them to obtain additional funding from sources which are currently being explored, to enable
the Group to continue to develop its operations and to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The convertible loan from Laurus (see note 4) is due
for repayment in August 2008 and it is anticipated that this will need to be replaced by a new loan facility of similar size. The Company is in
discussion with a number of lenders and the Board are reasonably confident that the facility can be replaced. Accordingly the financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would be required in
the event that the Company had insufficient funding available.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in
foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange
rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and
equity instruments are set out below.
Embedded derivatives: Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the contracts are not measured at fair value with
changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of the liability portion of a convertible bond is determined using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
The amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bond. The remainder of the
proceeds is allocated to the conversion option, which is recognised and included in shareholders’ equity.

The amount due from subsidiary relates to the ongoing funding provided to the principal trading subsidiary, LiDCO Limited, whilst it
continues to be loss-making. Further to a review of this debt, the directors have made a provision for impairment in the year of £12m.
The timing of the repayment of this debt is uncertain and unlikely to be within one year.

Convertible loan 553 –
A US$2 million three year convertible loan agreement was entered into with Laurus Master Fund Ltd (Laurus) on 10 August 2005.
The notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the Group at any time during the three year period at a price of 24p, or at 85% of the average
closing price over the preceding 10 trading days, if lower and if the conversion has been requested by the Group. Interest is payable at 1.5%
above New York Journal Prime, which has resulted in an effective average interest rate of circa 9.5%. The balance of the Laurus loan at
31 January 2008 was US$1,100,000 (£553,000). The split between the debt element and an equity component, representing the fair value
of the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is as follows:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Nominal value of convertible loan 553 51

Liability component at final drawdown date 553 51

Liability component at 31 January 2008 557 51
The directors believe the amount shown above represents a fair value of the liability component.

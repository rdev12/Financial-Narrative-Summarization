The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 19 
Share capital structure
The Company has one class of shares, ordinary shares of 
28
1
⁄8p. The authorised share capital is 284,444,444 ordinary 
shares of 28
1
⁄8p. As at 2 January 2011, the issued, called  
up and fully paid number of shares in issue was 199,470,892 
shares. There are no preference shares or special rights 
pertaining to any of the shares in issue. 
Following the 2010 Annual General Meeting the Directors 
have had the authority to allot shares up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £18,690,289 which represented 
approximately one third of the ordinary share capital of the 
Company at the time the authority was given by shareholders. 
This authority expires at the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 11 May 2011 and it will be proposed to extend this 
authority (updated for the current number of shares in issue) 
at the forthcoming Meeting. The Directors have no present 
intention of exercising this authority. In addition, following  
the 2010 Annual General Meeting, the Directors have the 
authority to make market purchases of shares in The 
Restaurant Group plc on behalf of the Company up to 
19,936,308 ordinary shares (which represented 10% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital at the time of the 
Notice of the 2010 Annual General Meeting). The minimum 
price that may be paid for such shares is 28
1
⁄8p per share. 
The maximum price is the higher of 5% above the average 
middle market quotation for the ordinary shares for the five 
business days preceding the date of purchase and the higher 
of the price of the last independent trade and the highest 
current independent bid on the London Stock Exchange 
Daily Official List at the time the purchase is carried out.  
This authority expires at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting and it will be proposed to extend this authority 
(updated for the current number of shares in issue) at  
the forthcoming Meeting. The Directors have no present 
intention of exercising this authority.
The Group has entered into various contracts, including 
leases, during the course of ordinary business which may  
be terminated in the event of a change of control of  
The Restaurant Group plc.
Substantial shareholdings

Corporate governance
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and to observing the principles of corporate 
governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance that was issued in 2006 by the Financial 
Reporting Council (“the Code”) for which the Board is 
accountable to shareholders.
Statement of compliance with the Combined Code
Throughout the year ended 2 January 2011, the Company 
has been in compliance with the provisions set out in  
the Code except for provisions concerning the number  
of Directors considered to be independent, and the 
independence of the Chairman (who was previously  
executive Chairman before assuming the role of non-
executive Chairman in January 2006). The Company 
currently has two non-executive Directors who are 
considered to be independent, which is less than the 50%  
of the Board best practice guidance under the Combined 
Code. During 2010 John Jackson retired from the Board  
and Simon Cloke was appointed as an independent non-
executive Director. The composition of the Board is regularly 
reviewed to ensure that the effectiveness of the Board  
(and performance of the Group) are at a high standard. 
Statement about applying the principles of the Code 
The Company has applied the principles set out in  
section 1 of the Code, including both the Main Principles  
and the supporting principles, by complying with the Code  
as reported above. Further explanation of how the Main 
Principles have been applied is set out below and in  
the Directors’ remuneration report and the Audit  
Committee report. 20 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010
Report of the Directors
 continued
The Board
The Board’s role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership  
of the Company and Group within a framework of prudent 
and effective controls which enable risk to be assessed and 
managed. The Board reviews the Group’s strategic objectives 
and looks to ensure that the necessary financial and human 
resources are in place to achieve these objectives, and to 
review management performance against these objectives. 
The Board also sets the Company’s values and standards 
and manages the business in a manner to meet its 
obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders.  
The Board currently comprises the non-executive Chairman, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Group Finance Director,  
the Executive Director of the Concessions division and two 
non-executive Directors. Their biographies appear on pages 
16 and 17 and these demonstrate a range of experience  
and sufficient calibre to bring independent judgement on 
issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards  
of conduct which is vital for the success of the Group.  
Tony Hughes acts as senior independent non-executive 
Director and is available to shareholders if they have reasons 
for concern on which contact through the normal channels  
is inappropriate or has failed to resolve an issue. 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are clearly 
defined. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the 
Board and the Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the 
strategic direction and operational management of the Group.
The Board meets on a regular basis and there is a formal 
schedule of matters specifically reserved for its consideration. 
This includes approval of the annual budget and the three 
year business plan, approval of the interim and year end 
Report and Accounts, review and approval of significant 
capital expenditure (including development of new sites), 
significant disposals of assets and acquisitions or disposals 
of businesses.
Operational management are responsible for the day-to-day 
running of the Group and report on a regular basis on that 
performance to the Board. The Board is responsible for 
reviewing, challenging and approving the strategic direction  
of the Group and monitoring operational performance.  
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper 
management of the Group and has access to the necessary 
information to enable it to discharge its duties. All Directors 
are subject to annual election by shareholders at the first 
opportunity after their appointment, except where they  
are appointed by shareholders, and to re-election thereafter 
at intervals of not more than three years. Following changes 
to the UK Corporate Governance Code, Directors will be 
subject to re-appointment on an annual basis.
There is significant involvement from the non-executive 
Directors. This involves an ongoing dialogue with the 
executive Directors including constructive challenge of 
performance and the Group’s strategy. The non-executive 
Directors are provided with sufficient information to allow 
them to monitor, assess and challenge the executive 
management of the Group. Comprehensive Board papers 
including financial information are circulated to all Directors 
prior to Board meetings and, on a weekly basis, they receive 
up-to-date trading information. The non-executive Directors 
have the opportunity to meet without the executive Directors 
present, and this includes discussions of targets set and 
achieved by management.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of  
the Company Secretary and a procedure has been agreed 
for the Directors in the furtherance of their duties to take 
independent professional advice, if necessary, at the expense 
of the Company. On joining the Board there is a process  
for Directors to receive training as to their role and its 
requirements and for non-executive Directors to gain  
an understanding of the whole business. Non-executive 
Directors are actively encouraged to meet with operational 
management and to visit the Group’s operations in order  
to enhance their understanding of the Group’s business,  
its brands, employees and processes. 
During 2010 there were eight Board meetings with full 
attendance by Board members.
Executive Directors are included in the annual performance 
evaluation of all senior employees within the Group. This 
involves a comprehensive review of performance against 
objectives and covers areas for future development through 
appraisal documentation and meetings. The non-executive 
Directors also meet in the absence of the Chairman to 
appraise the Chairman’s performance in the light of his  
fee review.
The Company acknowledges the importance of developing 
the skills of the Directors to run an effective Board. To assist 
in this, Directors are given the opportunity to attend relevant 
courses and seminars and to acquire skills and experience 
which may enhance their contribution to the ongoing 
progress of the Group. The Board and committees of the 
Board have been subject to a formal performance appraisal, 
through an internal questionnaire, and the performance  
of all members of the Board is considered as part of the 
annual remuneration review process. Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 21 
Communications with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high  
priority. The Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive Officer’s 
review of operations and Group Finance Director’s report  
on pages 4 to 15 include a detailed review of the business 
and the Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations  
on pages 6 to 11 includes a review of planned  
future developments. 
There is a regular dialogue with institutional investors 
including presentations after the Company’s announcement 
of the year-end results, and at the half year. Feedback from 
major institutional shareholders is provided to the Board on  
a regular basis and, where appropriate, the Board will take 
steps to address their concerns and recommendations. 
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate 
with private and institutional investors and welcomes their 
participation. The Chairman aims to ensure that the chairmen 
of the Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and 
Nominations Committee are available at the Annual General 
Meeting to answer questions, and for all Directors to attend.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of two non-executive 
Directors. There was 100% attendance of the four 
Remuneration Committee meetings during 2010. The role  
of this Committee and details of how the Company complies 
with the principles of the Code are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 29 to 35.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee consists of the non-executive 
Directors, the non-executive Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer. It met once during 2010 with full attendance 
at the meeting. There are written terms of reference for the 
Nominations Committee. It makes recommendations to  
the Board for the appointment or replacement of additional 
Directors. It is also responsible for succession planning  
for the Group. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of two non-executive 
Directors. During the year the Committee was chaired by 
John Jackson until 6 May 2010 and since that date by  
Simon Cloke. The Audit Committee met twice during 2010 
with full attendance at each meeting. A more detailed 
description of the work undertaken by the Audit Committee  
is included in the Audit Committee report on pages 36 and 
37. Shareholders of the Company have the opportunity to 
re-appoint Deloitte LLP as external auditors of the Company 
at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 11 May 2011.
The Restaurant Group plc – strategy
The Restaurant Group’s key objective is to grow shareholder 
value and the strategy deployed to achieve this is to build a 
business capable of generating long-term, sustainable and 
growing cash flows. In pursuit of this we have built a business 
which is focused on the growing casual eating out market. 
We have targeted segments of this market which offer distinct 
barriers to entry and where we can be confident of delivering 
good growth in profits and cash flows and where there is 
good potential for high returns on investment. This has led  
the Group to focus our activities in two areas – Leisure and 
Concessions. The Group operates in the expanding casual 
dining market, and our offerings continue to provide good 
value for money in comfortable surroundings and excellent 
service from our dedicated teams.
The Group’s strategy is to deliver further organic growth 
through the roll-out of our brands – Frankie & Benny’s, 
Chiquito, Garfunkel’s and our Pub restaurant business.  
We have a solid pipeline of sites for development, coupled 
with a strong focus on continuing to deliver like-for-like sales 
growth from our existing restaurants. Our Concessions 
business operates in a dynamic and complicated market 
where our management teams have market-leading  
expertise and a track record of innovation and improving 
sales performance and the Group continues to look for 
opportunities to expand this division.
The Restaurant Group plc – risk factors
The Board of Directors regularly identify, monitor and manage 
potential risks and uncertainties to the Group. The list on the 
following page sets out what the Directors consider to be the 
current principal risks and uncertainties, with an overview of 
the mitigation process for these. This list is not presumed to 
be exhaustive and is, by its very nature, subject to change.
The Restaurant Group plc – key performance 
indicators
The Board of Directors and executive management receive  
a wide range of management information delivered in a timely 
manner. Listed below are the principal measures of progress 
that are reviewed on a regular basis to monitor the 
development of the Group. 
Like-for-like sales
This measure provides an indicator of the underlying 
performance of our existing restaurants, and highlights 
successful development of our offerings to best match 
changing consumer demands over time. There is no 
accounting standard or consistent definition of “like-for-like 
sales” across the industry, although the Group has applied  
a consistent basis of calculation across years for reporting 
like-for-like performance. During 2010, the Group like-for-like 
sales declined by 1% which followed a 2% decline in 2009 
and a 1.5% increase in 2008. 22 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010

New sites opened
The expansion of our brands is a key driver of the Group’s 
profitability. As noted in the Group Finance Director’s report, 
potential new sites are subject to a rigorous appraisal process 
before they are presented to the Board for approval. This 
process ensures we maintain the quality of openings as  
well as the quantity of sites opened. During 2010 the Group 
opened 24 new sites (2009: 19) and plans to open 22 to 27 
new restaurants during 2011. 
EBITDA
The ability of the Group to finance its roll-out programme  
is aided by strong cash flows from the existing business.  
The Group defines EBITDA as operating profit before 
depreciation, amortisation and non-trading items. EBITDA 
serves as a useful proxy for cash flows generated by 
operations and is closely monitored. During 2010 the Group 
generated £85.8m EBITDA, an increase of 8% on the 2009 
level of £79.6m. 
Operating profit margin
The Board and management closely monitor profit margins 
as an indicator of operating efficiency within restaurants and 
across the Group. During 2010 the Group adjusted operating 
margin was 12.6% (2009: 12.2%). In addition, the Group 
closely scrutinises the returns on invested capital from  
new site openings and the average EBITDA generated  
by restaurants.
Further information on these key metrics is provided in the 
Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations and the Group 
Finance Director’s report.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. In accordance  
with guidance for directors “Internal Control: Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code” (the “Turnbull Guidance”), 
the Board has ensured that there is an ongoing process for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control 
including identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group. This process, which is regularly 
reviewed by the Board, is carried out in conjunction with 
business planning and is documented in a risk register that 
has been progressively enhanced during the financial year 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts. Whilst acknowledging its overall responsibility for 
the system of internal control, the Board is aware that the 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk  
of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Group has well-established procedures which have been 
developed over many years which meet the requirements  
of the Turnbull Guidance. A key control procedure is the 
day-to-day involvement of executive members of the Board  
in all aspects of the business and their attendance at regular 
management meetings at which performance against plan 
and business prospects are reviewed. The Group has 
established a monthly executive management meeting  
where the three executive Directors, senior operational 
managers and head of functional departments review Group 
performance and issues affecting the Group. Additionally,  
the Board seeks to continually strengthen the internal  
control system where this is consistent with improving the 
relationship between risk and reward. The Group’s associate 
company, Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, does 
not fall under the same internal controls as the Group. The 
internal controls within the associate are discussed with 
management of that company during shareholder meetings 
and are considered to be appropriate for an entity of its size.
Other key features and the processes for reviewing 
effectiveness of the internal control system are  
described below:
 Terms of reference for the Board and its sub-committees, •	
including a schedule of matters reserved for the Board  
and an agreed annual programme of fixed agenda items 
for Board approval.
 An established organisational structure with clear lines  •	
of responsibility and rigorous reporting requirements.
 Operational performance and operational matters are •	
considered at monthly meetings of the executive Directors 
with senior management. Financial performance is 
monitored and action taken through weekly reporting  
to the executive Directors and monthly reporting to the 
Board against annual budgets approved by the Board.
 Capital investment is regulated by a budgetary process •	
and authorisation levels, with appraisals and post-
investment reviews. 
 Comprehensive policy manuals setting out agreed •	
standards and control procedures. These include human 
resources related policies, information technology and 
health and safety. The Group employs a firm of external 
auditors to monitor restaurants on a regular basis for 
compliance with statutory and internal health and  
safety requirements.
 An internal audit function headed by an experienced •	
internal auditor has access to all areas of the Company 
and Group’s business and reports into the Board. 24 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation  
to the accounts
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, Directors’ remuneration report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. The Directors  
are required by the International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 
Regulation to prepare the Group financial statements under 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”)  
as adopted by the European Union. The Group financial 
statements are also required by law to be properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4  
of the IAS Regulation.
IAS 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly  
for each financial year the Company’s financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows. This requires the 
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 
events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 
recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s 
“Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial 
statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation 
will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs.
However, Directors are also required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies; •	
 present information, including accounting policies, in  •	
a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable  
and understandable information; and
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the •	
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent 
company financial statements are required by law to give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply  •	
them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  •	
and prudent;
 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards  •	
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern •	
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company and enable them to 
ensure that the parent company financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included  
on the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Information provided to auditors
Each of the current Directors have taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any 
relevant information needed by the Company’s auditors for 
the purpose of their audit and to establish that the auditors 
are aware of that information. The Directors are not aware  
of any relevant information of which the auditors are  
unaware. This information is given and should be interpreted 
in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Going concern
As referred to in the Chief Executive Officer’s review of 
operations there are significant economic concerns facing the 
United Kingdom and consumer-facing industries in particular. 
The Group Finance Director’s report also contains a summary
of the cash flows and borrowing position of the Group. 
Further information on the Group’s policies for capital risk 
management and financial risk management are set out 
below. Potential risk factors and uncertainties that could 
affect the business are listed above. 
The Group is highly cash generative, as explained in the 
Group Finance Director’s report, and enjoys negative working 
capital as it generally does not give credit to its customers. 
The Group has a debt facility of £120m which matures in 
December 2012 and net debt at 2 January 2011 of £46.9m 
(27 December 2009: £66.7m). 
Based on the Group’s plans for 2011 and after making 
enquiries (including preparation of reasonable trading 
forecasts, consideration of current financing arrangements 
and current headroom for liquidity and covenant compliance), 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue operations for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Report of the Directors

The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 25 
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able  
to continue as a going concern while looking to maximise 
returns to shareholders. The capital structure of the Group 
consists of equity (comprising issued share capital, reserves 
and retained earnings), debt, finance leases and cash and 
cash equivalents. The Group monitors its capital structure  
on a regular basis through cash flow projections and 
consideration of the cost of financing its capital.
In December 2007 the Group completed a refinancing 
exercise. As part of this the Group has externally imposed 
borrowing requirements. The Group has a £120m revolving 
facility in place until December 2012 and a £10m overdraft 
facility. Under the terms of the £120m revolving facility the 
Group is required to comply with its financing covenants 
whereby net interest charges must be covered at least four 
times by EBITDA and net debt must not exceed three times 
EBITDA. These covenants are tested twice annually and  
are monitored on a regular basis. The Group remained  
within its external limits throughout 2010.
Financial risk management
The Board of The Restaurant Group plc regularly reviews  
the financial requirements of the Group and the risks 
associated therewith. The Group does not use complex 
financial instruments, and where financial instruments are 
used it is for reducing interest rate risk. The Group does  
not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Group operations are primarily financed from retained 
earnings and bank borrowings (including an overdraft facility). 
In addition to the primary financial instruments, the Group 
also has other financial instruments such as debtors, 
prepayments, trade creditors and accruals that arise  
directly from the Group’s operations. Further information  
is provided in note 24 to the accounts.
Effective from 18 January 2008, the Group entered into  
a three year interest rate swap for a notional amount  
of £25m, from 18 January 2008 to 18 January 2011  
at a fixed rate of 4.92% (plus margin). On 8 February 2010 
this swap was terminated on payment of £1.0m.
Effective from 16 January 2009, the Group entered into  
a further two interest rate swaps: a two year interest rate 
swap for a notional amount of £20m at a rate of 2.70%  
(plus margin) and a three year interest rate swap for  
a notional amount of £20m at a rate of 2.975% (plus margin).  
On 9 February 2011 the three year swap was terminated  
on a payment of £0.4m.
After the impact of the interest rate swaps, the average rate  
of interest charged during the year on the Group’s debt was 
2.81% (2009: 3.56%), and the average year-end rate was 
2.98% (2009: 4.06%). On 2010 results, net interest was 
covered 21.9 times (2009: 16.0 times) by profit before tax, 
interest and non-trading items. Based on year end debt  
and profits for 2010, a 1% rise in interest rates would  
reduce profits before tax and non-trading items by  
0.2% (2009: 0.5%) and interest cover would reduce  
to 21.1 times (2009: 14.9 times).
At 2 January 2011 the Group had gross borrowings 
attracting interest (including overdraft) of £50.0m 
(2009: £70.0m) and cash balances of £2.7m (2009: £2.8m).
Creditor payment policy
The Company’s policy is to agree the terms of payments  
with its suppliers as and when a trading relationship is 
established. The Company ensures that the terms of 
payment are clear and its policy is to abide by the agreed 
terms, provided the supplier meets its obligations.  
At 2 January 2011 the Company had no trade creditors.  
The Group had an average of 42 days (2009: 41 days) 
purchases outstanding in trade creditors.
Donations
No donations for political purposes have been directly made 
by the Company during the year. Charitable events, fund 
raising and sponsorship are organised by restaurants for 
organisations in their locality as described in the Corporate 
Responsibility section on pages 26 to 28.
Annual General Meeting
A separate Circular is included with the mailing of the Annual 
Report to shareholders setting out the resolutions to be 
voted on at the Annual General Meeting, which is to take 
place at 11am on 11 May 2011 at the offices of Maclay 
Murray & Spens LLP, One London Wall, London EC2Y 5AB. 
The Board believes that the proposed resolutions to be put 
to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting are in the 
best interests of shareholders and, accordingly, recommends 
that shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions, as the 
Directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial 
shareholdings in the Company.
Auditors
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue  
as auditors, and a resolution will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting for their reappointment.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
1.  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Company and Group; and
2.   the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive Officer’s review 
of operations, Group Finance Director’s report and report 
of the Directors include a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties faced.

Corporate responsibility
The Restaurant Group plc (“TRG”) acknowledges that it has  
a significant role to play with regard to the community and 
wider environment in which it operates. This statement sets 
out the principal areas of focus and activity that the Group 
has undertaken to date, and what the Group is looking at for 
future development, in managing its impact on customers, 
employees, communities and the wider environment.
This is split into five sections:
 Our market – the area of business that our strategy  •	
is focused on.
 Our people – the Group’s policies and actions towards  •	
our 10,000 employees.
 Our communities – how TRG interacts with those •	
communities from which our customers and employees 
are drawn.
 Our environment – the impact of TRG on the wider •	
environment, and how we are seeking to reduce this. 
 Our shareholders – those that have invested capital in  •	
the development of The Restaurant Group plc, and to 
whom the Directors and management of the Group are 
accountable.
Our market
The Restaurant Group plc has focused its attention on 
markets in the United Kingdom which have significant  
growth potential. For a number of years, dining out has been  
a growing market, and, partially as a result of this, there has 
been an increased focus from customers and regulatory 
authorities on health issues relating to our sector. We have 
seen initiatives on alcohol, food (in particular on calorie 
consumption and fat and salt content) and smoking over 
recent years and these are set to continue to be a focus.  
It is important that the Group continues to monitor closely 
these developments and ensure that we offer our customers 
a broad range of choice in our restaurants, including  
healthy options.
Healthy eating
Healthy eating is a personal responsibility but TRG 
acknowledges that as a provider of food and drink we have  
a role to play in providing appropriate options from which 
individuals may choose when they eat out. TRG strongly 
believes that we should offer our guests choices on the 
menu. Whilst we do not wish to be prescriptive we aim to 
provide a healthy choice at each menu point, alongside more 
indulgent options. For many people dining out is a treat, and 
therefore the normal restrictions which may be applied to 
healthy eating on a day-to-day basis are waived in favour of 
enjoyment and experience. For example, whilst completing 
the weekly shop a consumer may choose chocolate fudge 
cake for their weekend dessert as opposed to a piece  
of fruit during the week.
The Group is undertaking a process of monitoring nutritional 
content across its menus and, as part of our ongoing menu 
review, will look to develop the healthier options available  
to customers and to work with our suppliers to reduce salt 
content and calorific content. The Group has engaged with 
the Food Standards Agency and Department of Health 
Healthy Catering initiatives and is committed to ensure  
that all menus feature lighter options and all children’s meals 
come with a choice of carbohydrate alternatives and a 
complementary portion of salad or vegetables, and to work 
with our suppliers to source lower salt, saturated fat and 
calorie versions of ingredients where possible.
Hydrogenated fats 
In light of UK government and consumer focus with  
regard to consumption of products containing high levels  
of fat, particularly saturated fats and artificial hydrogenated 
trans-fats*, which have been linked to potential risks to 
cardiovascular health, we conducted a detailed review  
of our suppliers and our menu ingredients in conjunction  
with our external food safety consultants.
 We have worked closely with all of our suppliers  •	
to identify the types and levels of fats and oils in  
our ingredients to facilitate a programme of removal, 
replacement or reduction, whilst maintaining our  
required quality standards.
 The vast majority of our ingredients (>99%) are now  •	
free from hydrogenated fats and oils.
 Since August 2007 we have prohibited the supply of new •	
ingredients containing added hydrogenated fats and oils.
 We continue to work closely with all of our suppliers to •	
identify and progress opportunities for reducing overall 
levels of saturated fat wherever possible and to provide 
healthier choices.
*  Whilst some trans-fats occur naturally and are found in small 
amounts in meat and dairy products, concerns have been raised 
about artificial trans-fats, formed during a food manufacturing 
process called hydrogenation that turns oils into solid/semi-solid 
fats. These hydrogenated fats/oils can be found in products such 
as biscuits, cakes, margarine, processed foods and cooking oils.
Other initiatives
All our red meat is supplied from producers in the UK and 
Ireland and we have taken significant steps to reduce our 
“food miles”. This process will continue into 2011, with  
a focus on improving our supply chain efficiency and 
reducing the number of deliveries, and therefore food miles, 
to our restaurants. Our Concessions division sources eggs 
from The Happy Eggs Company, who operate higher welfare 
standards for their chickens. 
TRG is a member of the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange 
(“SEDEX”), which facilitates measurement and improvement 
in ethical business practices across the supply chain;  
120 of our food suppliers and 18 other (non-food) suppliers 
provide information describing their procedures and practices 
to the Group via SEDEX.
As in previous years, there continue to be no known 
genetically modified foods in any product the Group uses  
and new suppliers are required to confirm that they will not 
provide the Group with such products. We are also working 
with our suppliers to target and remove the “Southampton 
Institute” colourings that can cause hyperactivity in children 
and this will remain an ongoing focus during 2011. Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 27 
Drink aware
All our restaurants operate an “Are You 21” policy, whereby 
we will ask for proof of identification to anyone who appears 
to be under 21. We also do not permit the sale of alcohol  
to under 18’s, even if the alcohol is for consumption with  
a meal. All of our restaurants offer a wide range of non-
alcoholic drinks including fruit juices, carbonates, minerals 
and non-alcoholic cocktails and tap water is available for 
customers free of charge.
Smoking
From 1 July 2007 we have complied fully with the legislation 
throughout the United Kingdom which has banned smoking 
in public areas.
Our people
The most important asset any company can have is its 
people. At The Restaurant Group plc we strive to nurture  
our individuals to build great teams. Anyone has the potential 
to develop within our company and we endeavour to give 
them the tools and knowledge to encourage this. This is the 
key to any successful business and our team is one of which 
we are especially proud.
We employ approximately 10,000 people and continue  
to increase this number as we expand our business.  
The Group opened a further 24 restaurants during 2010  
and created approximately 700 jobs for the local communities 
in the process.
Our policies ensure that we offer equal rights regardless of 
age, colour, gender, sexual orientation, disability or religion. 
This gives us a diverse group of employees able to meet the 
challenges our market presents. We have a fair and open 
recruitment process with clear terms of employment and we 
have developed a new website (www.therestaurantgroup.
jobs) to allow easier access to available jobs for potential 
employees across our Group. All staff are provided with a 
contract of employment and copies of our staff handbook 
along with other policies to ensure everyone is aware of our 
rules, expectations and procedures, including grievance and 
disciplinary issues. The Group has an ethical dealings policy 
in place which incorporates a strict prohibition on bribery and 
corruption. The Group also has a defined termination policy, 
should this be required. 
Recently there has been a stronger focus on ensuring the 
recruitment of our teams complies with current legislation. 
With the UK Border Agency instigating regular visits to 
employers to check the validity of our employees’ rights  
to work in the UK we have instigated robust measures  
to prevent the possibility of TRG contravening the rules. 
The Restaurant Group plc pays all of its employees at least 
the national minimum wage and does not utilise tips in  
any form to make up this rate. All gratuities are paid to the 
employees, with credit card tips attracting only the usual  
tax deductions, but unlike some of our competitors, no 
administration fee is taken by the company.
The Group allocates considerable resources to provide high 
quality training to our teams. Training begins on the first day 
and is an ongoing process of development and support.  
Our training team is fully qualified and delivers high quality 
courses, as well as guiding new and established team 
members throughout their development. 
With our portfolio of sites it is vital that our communication  
is of a very high standard. Each day branch staff are given 
team briefings; weekly meetings for staff and management 
are held; and weekly communications packs are issued from 
head office to each brand. Our senior managers are out  
in the business extensively and interact daily with their branch 
management and team members to ensure full two-way 
communication is present throughout the business.
The health and safety of our customers and employees is of 
paramount importance. The Group has extensive procedures 
to ensure we mitigate risks to our guests and teams as far  
as possible. We have very clear procedures and standards  
in place, and to enforce these we employ external auditors 
and carry out benchmarking of our restaurants. We have also 
significantly increased the level of training in health and safety 
matters across the Group in recent years to further enhance 
the clean, safe environment for our customers and staff. 
Our communities
Active involvement in the local communities around our 
restaurants and pub restaurants is important to The 
Restaurant Group plc. Whilst we operate successful national 
brands our focus is on local community marketing whether 
this is for Frankie & Benny’s, with almost 200 restaurants,  
or the individual pub at the heart of a village community.  
The Restaurant Group supports staff fundraising activities  
at a brand and local level. 
During 2010 we engaged in a number of local and national 
charitable events:
 The Frankie & Benny’s teams across the country worked •	
with three regional charities. In Scotland we raised over 
£50,000 with CHAS (children’s hospices in Scotland).  
We sponsored The Christie, a leading cancer centre based 
in Manchester, and raised over £40,000, and also raised 
over £23,000 for the Macmillan cancer charity. These 
monies were raised from customers and staff through 
local events, raffles and theme and fancy dress nights.
 Frankie & Benny’s continues its initiative to support local •	
junior sports teams across the country, providing new 
sports kit for more than 110 local teams in 2010; 
 Chiquito teams raised over £7,000 in 2010 during their •	
Cinco de Mayo fiesta, for Casa Alianza, a homeless 
children’s charity in Mexico. The brand went on to support 
this charity later in the year, on hearing that one of their 
children’s homes had been burned down, Chiquito 
donated 50p for every “Like” that they gained  
on Facebook and raised a total of £1,800; and
 Our pubs undertake a number of small fund-raising •	
initiatives for local charities in their communities. 28 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010
Corporate responsibility

We are proud of our Frankie & Benny’s Schools Programme 
which supports the Primary Key Stages Curriculum.  
This encourages primary school classes to visit their local 
Frankie & Benny’s restaurant to learn about the restaurant 
business, food hygiene and health and safety, and to have the 
opportunity to make and bake their own pizzas. During 2010 
we held approximately 450 such visits across the country – 
over 12,000 pupils visited Frankie & Benny’s as part of  
this initiative.
Our environment
During 2010 we have undertaken a number of developments 
regarding the Group’s commitment to mitigating its impact on 
the environment. Not only are the attitudes and expectations 
of our customers changing over time but we recognise that 
the Group’s activities impact the natural environment, most 
significantly with regard to energy consumption (and carbon 
emissions), water consumption and the creation and removal 
of waste. Innovative regulatory mechanisms are being 
introduced that may in future create a direct link between 
environmental outcomes and financial benefits or penalties. 
We have established a close relationship with the Carbon 
Trust, who advise the Group on best practice and ensure 
energy consciousness is at the heart of our strategic 
objectives covering premises design and construction, 
heating, lighting, ventilation and food production. TRG is 
working towards achieving the Carbon Trust Standard.
We have a multi-disciplinary team working on reducing  
our energy consumption through operational practices and 
staff awareness, premises design and the improved use of 
technology to monitor and control our use of energy, water 
and waste. 
We recognise that lasting change in energy consumption by 
the Group will require changes in behaviour for our whole 
team. The provision of accurate and timely management 
information covering energy consumption is an essential tool 
supporting the change. A web-based energy-information 
portal to provide real time consumption data to restaurants 
and our operators has been developed in association  
with our energy consultants and allows us to target more 
inefficient sites and challenge our teams through league 
tables to improve their energy efficiency. 
We have also launched an energy saving campaign to all 
sites, providing information to help our staff drive energy 
efficiency. By February 2011 we had installed Automated 
Meter Readers (“AMRs”) to supplement half-hourly monitoring 
of electricity supplies at 98% of our available Leisure Division 
businesses, and 96% of available sites for gas supplies.
We have installed an equipment monitoring system in one 
Frankie and Benny’s restaurant to allow us to monitor all 
electrical and gas equipment on a half hourly basis and test 
out new energy saving replacement equipment. This has 
already led to three changes in the equipment that is installed 
in a standard Frankie and Benny’s and during 2011 we  
will monitor the savings in energy consumption from this 
restaurant and we are working with the Carbon Trust and 
other external advisers to develop further environmental 
efficiencies in our building design and equipment used  
in our operations.
We opened a new Frankie & Benny’s restaurant in 2010

Our shareholders
The Group has had a clear strategy since 2001 – to deliver 
value for shareholders by focusing on sectors within the 
eating out market that offer high barriers to entry, where  
we can generate sustainable and growing cash flows and 
which offer high returns on investment. This has led the 
Group to focus investment into the Leisure division and our 
Concessions division, which operates principally on airports. 
The Group has had a progressive dividend policy and has 
had a strong track record of growing profits and dividends  
for shareholders.

Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 
8 of the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 
2006. The report also meets the relevant requirements  
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority  
and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of 
Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration in the 
Combined Code. As required by the Regulations, a resolution 
to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company (to be held on 11 May 2011) at 
which the financial statements are subject to approval.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s 
members on the part of the Directors’ remuneration report 
subject to audit and to state whether, in their opinion, that 
part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance 
with Schedule 8 of the Accounting Regulations under the 
Companies Act 2006. The report has therefore been divided 
into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee 
(“the Committee”) which is constituted in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Combined Code. The members of 
the Committee during the year were Tony Hughes, Simon 
Cloke (from 26 March 2010) and John Jackson (to 6 May 
2010), who were independent non-executive Directors.  
The Committee is chaired by Tony Hughes.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest  
in the Company (other than as shareholders). The Committee 
makes recommendations to the Board. No Director plays  
a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.  
In determining the executive Directors’ remuneration for the 
year the Committee consulted Alan Jackson (non-executive 
Chairman) about its proposals.
Hewitt New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt 
Limited, part of Aon Corporation) is the independent adviser 
to the Remuneration Committee. Neither Hewitt New Bridge 
Street nor any other part of Aon Corporation provided other 
services to the Company during the year.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, 
motivate and retain executive Directors of the high calibre 
needed to progress and develop the Group and to reward 
them for top quartile sector performance and enhancing 
value to shareholders. The performance measurement  
of the executive Directors and the determination of their 
annual remuneration package are undertaken by the 
Committee. In addition, the Committee determines the 
remuneration for the Chairman. The remuneration of the  
other non-executive Directors is determined by the Board. 
The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of  
the remuneration of the executive Directors should be 
performance related. 
Directors’ remuneration report
There are four main elements of the remuneration package 
for executive Directors:
Basic annual salary and benefits; •	
Annual bonus payments; •	
Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) awards; and •	
Pension arrangements. •	
Policy review
During 2010, a comprehensive review of the remuneration 
policy for executive Directors was undertaken. This was  
the first such review in over five years. The Committee  
has considered how best to structure the Company’s 
remuneration policy to continue to incentivise and retain  
the management team as it continues to drive the business 
forward and deliver superior returns to shareholders.  
The Committee considered each of the four main aspects  
of the remuneration package for executive Directors. As part 
of the process, ten of the Company’s largest shareholders 
and major shareholder representative bodies were consulted. 
Following the review, the Committee determined that it would 
be appropriate to increase the maximum level of bonus 
available, for outstanding performance, to the Chief Executive 
Officer and Group Finance Director, and to increase the 
maximum award that may be granted under the LTIP. In 
addition, the basic salary and pension provision of the  
Group Finance Director (both of which were becoming 
increasingly below market) were reviewed and aligned with 
market levels. These changes are set out in more detail 
below. The Committee believes that these changes align  
the level of potential variable remuneration available to the 
executive management team with their peer group. 
Basic salary
An executive Director’s basic salary is determined by the 
Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when  
an individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding 
appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group  
as a whole and by reference to remuneration levels at other 
companies in the leisure and hospitality sectors. 
Following a recommendation from the executive Directors  
to hold salaries, the Remuneration Committee determined  
at the December 2008 salary review that no increase to the 
basic salary of executive Directors would be applied for the 
2009 financial year. At the December 2009 review, it was 
determined that basic salaries for executive Directors should 
increase modestly for the 2010 financial year, with such 
increases capped at 1.5%. This was below the average salary 
increase of 2% provided to other employees in the Group. 
Following a review of salary levels for 2011, the Remuneration 
Committee concluded that the salary for Stephen Critoph 
should be increased to £270,000, to bring Mr Critoph  
closer in line with mid-market levels and recognising his 
performance. Increases to the basic salaries for Andrew Page 
and Trish Corzine for 2011 were below the average for other 
employees of 3%.  30 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010

Trish Corzine 230,000 230,000 233,500 240,000
In addition to basic salary, the executive Directors receive 
pension contributions and certain benefits-in-kind, principally 
a car (or car allowance), and health and life insurance.
Annual bonus payments
The annual bonus is based on the achievement of stretching 
profit before tax targets and personal objectives. Performance 
targets are set annually as part of the budgeting process and 
performance is reviewed against those targets at the end  
of the financial year. Following the review by the Remuneration 
Committee described above, the maximum bonus that can  
be paid in respect of performance in 2011 will be increased 
from 100% of basic salary to 150% of basic salary for the Chief 
Executive Officer and to 125% of basic salary for the Group 
Finance Director. The bonus will remain at 100% of basic salary 
for the Executive Director of the Concessions Division. 
In return for the increased bonus potential, the Committee 
has set commensurately tougher performance targets and 
any bonus payment above 100% of basic salary must be 
invested in Company shares which must be held for three 
years. Actual bonus payments for 2010 are presented in the 
emoluments table on page 32.
Long-term incentives
The Company operates the 2005 Long-Term Incentive  
Plan (“LTIP” or “Plan”), and the 2003 Save As You Earn 
(“SAYE”) Scheme under which awards may be granted  
to executive Directors. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The 2005 LTIP is the primary long-term incentive scheme  
of the Company. Under the Plan, individuals may receive  
an award of conditional free shares (“Conditional Awards”) 
with a face value at grant of up to 100% of salary per annum, 
vesting three years after grant subject to performance 
conditions and continued employment. In addition, the Plan 
has the flexibility to grant conditional awards on a matching 
basis, pro rata to the number of shares purchased via the 
annual bonus (“Matching Awards”). Matching Awards may  
be granted over shares worth up to 37.5% of basic salary  
per annum.
During 2010, the Committee has reviewed the composition  
of award limits under this scheme. Following this review and 
in consultation with the Company’s major shareholders  
and representative bodies, the Committee concluded that 
shareholder approval should be sought at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting to increase:
 the Conditional Award limit from 100% to 150% of basic •	
salary; and
 the Matching Award limit from 37.5% to 50% of basic •	
salary, pro rata to the number of shares purchased via  
the annual bonus.
Subject to shareholder approval, total LTIP opportunity will 
therefore be 200% of basic salary, subject to 50% of basic 
salary being invested into the matching plan. 
For awards to be made in 2011, Conditional Award levels will 
be set at 150% of basic salary for the Chief Executive Officer 
and 100% of salary for the Group Finance Director and  
the Executive Director of the Concessions Division, and 
Matching Award levels will be up to 50% of basic salary for  
all three individuals. Awards will continue to be structured  
with a combination of total shareholder return (“TSR”) and 
earnings per share (“EPS”) performance conditions:
 The performance condition attached to 50% of the •	
Conditional Awards will require average annual EPS 
growth from 3 January 2011 to 31 December 2013 of 
between RPI plus 4% to RPI plus 10% per annum for 
between 30% and 100% of this part of the award  
to vest (i.e. between 15% and 50% of the total award).
 The performance condition attached to the other 50% of •	
the Conditional Awards will be based on TSR performance 
measured against the constituents of the FTSE Travel & 
Leisure Index (excluding airlines) over a single three-year 
period from 2011 to 2014
 Awards will vest on a straight line basis between minimum •	
and maximum thresholds.
 For Matching Awards, there will be a 0.3:1 match for •	
average EPS growth of RPI plus 4% per annum rising on  
a straight line basis to the full 1:1 match for average EPS 
growth of RPI plus 10% per annum.
The combination of EPS and TSR performance conditions 
provides a balance between rewarding management for 
growth in sustainable profitability and stock market out-
performance. The EPS target range will require growth  
from the current all time high level of profitability and the  
TSR condition will be based from a strong recent  
share price performance.
Performance against the TSR and EPS targets will be 
independently calculated and reviewed by the Committee.
Shareholding guidelines
The Company operates shareholding guidelines for executive 
Directors, linked to the out-turn of the Plan. At the time 
Conditional and Matching Awards vest under the Plan  
(or any other executive plan established in the future), there  
is a requirement to retain no fewer than 50% of the shares, 
net of taxes, vesting under an LTIP award until a shareholding 
with a market value (calculated by reference to purchase 
price) in line with the policy is achieved. Following the 
Committee’s review, shareholding guidelines have been 
increased to 200% of basic salary in respect of the Chief 
Executive Officer and 150% in respect of the Group Finance 
Director. The guideline for the Executive Director of the 
Concessions Division remains at 100% of basic salary.  Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 31 
SAYE Scheme
The Company also operates an SAYE Share Option Scheme 
for eligible employees under which options may be granted at 
a discount of up to 20% of market value. Eligible employees 
are full time employees and executive Directors who have 
worked for the Group for at least one year. Under the terms  
of the SAYE scheme, the eligible employees are able to 
purchase shares under a three-year savings contract. Awards 
under the SAYE scheme were made in 2004, 2006, 2008  
and 2010 to eligible employees and Directors.
Pension arrangements
Executive Directors have individual pension arrangements  
in the form of personal pension plans. The Company makes  
a contribution of 20% of basic salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and Group Finance Director (with the latter’s 
contribution increased from 10% of basic salary from  
January 2011) and 10% of salary for the Executive Director  
of the Concessions Division towards funding each executive 
Director’s pension plan. To the extent that this funding 
exceeds the relevant current HMRC limit, the surplus may  
be paid as a salary supplement. There are no unfunded 
pension promises or similar arrangement for Directors.
Performance graph
As required by the Regulations, the graph below compares 
the Company’s TSR performance with the FTSE 350 Travel 
and Leisure Share Index for each of the past five years.
The FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index has been 
selected for this comparison because it is the index most 
relevant to gauging the Company’s relative performance.  
This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2010, of  
£100 invested in The Restaurant Group plc on 31 December 
2005 compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE 
All-Share Index and the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure  
Share Index.
 
Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that executive Directors should 
have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a 
maximum of one year’s notice. However, it may occasionally 
be necessary to offer longer initial notice periods to new 
Directors. All executive Directors have contracts which are 
subject to one year’s notice by either party. In the event of 
early termination (including following a change of control  
in the Company), the Directors’ contracts provide for 
compensation in line with their contractual notice period. 
The details of the executive Directors’ contracts are 
summarised in the table below:
Date of contract Notice period
Andrew Page 28 August 2002 1 year
Stephen Critoph 7 July 2004 1 year
Trish Corzine 31 March 2003 1 year
Appointments outside the Group
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments 
outside the Company or Group and there is no requirement 
for Directors to remit any fees to The Restaurant Group plc. 
Andrew Page is a non-executive director of Arena Leisure plc 
and received fees as a non-executive director of Arena 
Leisure plc of £50,000 in 2010 (2009: £45,000).
Non-executive Directors
The service contracts of the non-executive Directors were 
each set for an initial three-year period (thereafter renewable 
for periods of three years). They are required to submit 
themselves for re-election every three years and in 
accordance with the Group’s compliance with best practice 
under the UK Corporate Governance Code, will make 
themselves available for re-election on an annual basis  
going forward from 2011. The non-executive Directors’ 
appointments were made as follows:

*  Alan Jackson was previously Executive Chairman of the Company, 
and was appointed in March 2001. From 1 January 2006 he has 
held the position of non-executive Chairman.
All non-executive Directors have specific terms of 
engagement and their remuneration (with the exception of 
Alan Jackson) is determined by the Board based on a review 
of fees paid to non-executive Directors of similar companies 
and reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of  
each role. The basic fee paid to the non-executive Directors 
(excluding Alan Jackson) in the year was £50,000 (2009: 
£50,000) (pro rated by tenure of service). Alan Jackson’s fee, 
which is set by the Remuneration Committee, was £300,000 
(2009: £300,000). No increases to the fees of non-executive 
Directors have been made in respect of 2011.

LTIP (1) – Conditional Awards. Vesting of 50% of these awards was based on EPS growth of the 2009 results compared with the 2006 
results and 50% based on relative TSR performance over the three financial years to 31 December 2009. The EPS performance condition 
range of RPI+4%-10% p.a. was achieved in full and consequently those shares pertaining to the EPS criteria vested in full. For the TSR 
performance condition, the performance of the Group was between the median and upper quartile for the relevant period and consequently 
62.5% of the TSR element of the award vested. 
LTIP (2) – Matching Awards. Vesting was based on EPS growth of the 2009 results compared with the 2006 results and the RPI+4%-10% 
p.a. performance condition was met in full. Consequently the Matching Shares vested in full.
LTIP (3) – Conditional Awards. Vesting of 50% of these awards was based on EPS growth of the 2010 results compared with the 2007 
results and 50% based on TSR performance over the three financial years to 31 December 2010. The RPI+4%-10% p.a. EPS growth range 
was achieved partially and 82.5% of the EPS part of the award will vest. For the TSR performance condition the performance of the Group 
was above upper quartile, so the condition was achieved in full. 
LTIP (4) – Matching Awards. Vesting was based on EPS growth of the 2010 results compared with the 2007 results. The RPI+4%-10% p.a. 
EPS growth range was achieved partially and 82.5% of the award will vest. 
LTIP (5) – Conditional Awards and LTIP (6) – Matching Awards. Vesting is based on TSR performance of the Group against a comparator

Approval
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 9 March 2011 and signed on its behalf by:
Tony Hughes
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 36 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010
This report sets out the work carried out by the Audit Committee of the Board with reference to the Guidance on Audit 
Committees (“the Smith Report”) attached to the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Audit Committee composition
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board from the non-executive Directors of the Company. 
The Committee was chaired by John Jackson until his retirement from the Board on 6 May 2010 and has been chaired by 
Simon Cloke since. Tony Hughes is also a member of the Committee. During 2010, the Audit Committee has not been in 
compliance with the best practice guidelines of the Smith Report due to the number of non-executive Directors on the Board 
of The Restaurant Group plc.
The Committee regularly invites the external auditors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and the Group 
Finance Director to its meetings. The Company Secretary attends the meetings and is secretary to the Committee. 
Discussions are held in private when appropriate.
Responsibilities of the Audit Committee
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in its terms of reference and the principal matters are to:
 provide additional assurance regarding the integrity, quality and reliability of financial information used by the Board and  •	
in financial statements issued to shareholders and the public;
 review the Company’s internal procedures for control and compliance with regard to financial reporting to satisfy itself that •	
these are adequate and effective;
 review the principles, policies and practices adopted in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements to ensure they •	
comply with statutory requirements and generally accepted accounting principles;
 receive reports from the Group’s external auditors concerning external announcements, in particular the Annual Report •	
and Accounts and the Interim Report;
 develop and oversee the Company’s policy regarding the engagement of external auditors, review the independence  •	
of the external auditors, review the provision of non-audit services provided by the external auditors and review 
remuneration paid to the external auditors; and
consider any other matter that is brought to its attention by the Board or the external auditors. •	
The Board as a whole reviews the risks facing the Group, and the processes on mitigating those risks, on a regular  
and formal basis. The Board also reviews the work carried out by the Internal Audit function.
Audit Committee frequency
The Committee meets at least twice a year. Two meetings of the Committee were held during 2010 with full attendance.
Audit Committee process
The Committee discharges its responsibilities, as defined in its terms of reference, through Audit Committee meetings during 
the year at which detailed reports are presented for review. From time to time the Committee commissions reports from 
external advisers or Company management, either after consideration of the Company’s major risks or in response to 
developing issues. The Committee has the opportunity to meet privately with the external auditors at least twice a year  
and liaises with Company management in considering areas for review.
During the year, the Committee considered the following matters:
interim and full year financial results; •	
the scope and cost of the external audit; •	
the external auditor’s interim and full year reports; •	
 non-audit work carried out by the external auditors in accordance with the Committee’s policy to ensure the safeguard  •	
of audit independence;
the effectiveness of the external auditors and consideration of their reappointment; and •	
the suitability of the Group’s accounting policies and practices. •	
The Company’s public financial statements are reviewed by the Committee in advance of their consideration by the Board.
Audit Committee report Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 37 
External auditor’s independence 
The Committee has adopted a policy on the use of the external auditors for non-audit work which is in compliance  
with the Combined Code. The pre-approved services may be summarised as follows:
 audit related services, including work related to the annual Group financial statements audit, subsidiary audits  •	
and local statutory accounts; and
certain specified tax services, including tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice. •	
Other work to be carried out by the external auditors is subject to review by the Audit Committee.
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the external auditors, the Audit Committee takes into account  
the following:
 the external auditors’ plan for the current year, noting the role of the senior statutory audit partner who signs the audit •	
report and who, in accordance with professional rules, has not held office for more than five years; 
the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit relationship; •	
 a report from the external auditors describing their arrangements to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest; •	
 the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditors, in addition to its case-by-case approval of the •	
provision of non-audit services by the external auditors; and
the past service of the auditors who were first appointed in 2007. •	
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the Audit Committee takes into account:
the arrangements for ensuring the external auditors’ independence and objectivity; •	
the external auditors’ fulfilment of the agreed audit plan; and •	
the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in their handling of the key accounting and audit judgements. •	
Overview
As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms  
of reference. The Committee has reviewed the independence and objectivity of Deloitte LLP as external auditor and 
recommends their re-appointment by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 11 May 2011.
On behalf of the Audit Committee,
Simon Cloke

statement and the related notes 1 to 28. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the  
European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken

by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as  
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities 
statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit  
and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates  
made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs •	
as at 2 January 2011 and of its profit for the 53 week 
period then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs  •	
as adopted by the European Union; and
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements •	
of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation.

Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Report of the 
Directors for the financial year for which the Group financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Group 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion:
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified  •	
by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations •	
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 the Directors’ statement contained within the Report  •	
of the Directors in relation to going concern; and
 the part of the corporate governance statement relating  •	
to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of 
the June 2008 Combined Code specified for our review;
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the •	
Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of The Restaurant Group plc for the 53 week 
period ended 2 January 2011 and on the information in the 
Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having

9 March 2011 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 39 
Significant accounting policies
The Restaurant Group plc (the “Company”) is a company 
incorporated and registered in Scotland. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Company for the year ended  
2 January 2011 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interest 
in its associate. 
(a) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) and its interpretations adopted by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and as adopted by the 
European Union. 
(b) Going concern basis
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
a going concern basis as, after making appropriate enquires, 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future at the time of approving the financial 
statements. The principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group and further comments on going concern are set out  
in the report of the Directors on pages 21 to 25.
(c) Basis of preparation
The accounting year runs to a Sunday within seven  
days of 31 December each year which will be a 52  
or 53 week period. 
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded 
to the nearest thousand. They have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except derivative financial instruments 
which are held at their fair value. Non-current assets and 
assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying  
amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the 
results of which form the basis of making the judgments 
about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may  
differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed  
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates  
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised  
if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current 
and future periods.
Accounting policies for the consolidated accounts
Change in accounting policies
In the current financial year, the Group has adopted 
International Financial Reporting Standard 3 “Business 
Combinations” (revised 2008) and International Accounting 
Standard 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements“ (revised 2008). There has been no impact  
on the consolidated financial statements on adoption  
of these standards.
Future accounting policies
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements,  
the following Standards and Interpretations which have not 
been applied in these financial statements were in issue  
but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments •	
IAS 24 (amended) Related Party Disclosures •	
IAS 32 (amended) Classification of Rights Issues •	
IFRIC 19  Extinguishing Financial Liabilities •	
with Equity Instruments
IFRIC 14 (amended)  Prepayments of a Minimum  •	
Funding Requirement
Improvements to IFRSs (May 2010) •	
 
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the 
standards listed above will have a material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group in future periods. 
(d) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control 
exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity  
so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing 
control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable  
or convertible are taken into account, regardless of 
management’s intention to exercise that option or warrant. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases.
(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has 
significant influence, but not control, over the financial and 
operating policies. The consolidated financial statements 
include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and 
losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the 
date that significant influence commences until the date that 
significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of 
losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group’s 
carrying amount would be reduced to £nil and recognition  
of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that  
the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations  
or made payments on behalf of an associate. 40 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010
Accounting policies for the consolidated accounts
 continued
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any gains and losses or income and 
expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised 
gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated 
to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised 
losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, 
but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
(e) Foreign currency
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated  
into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of  
the balance sheet. Transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the date  
of the transaction. The profit and loss accounts for overseas 
operations are translated at the average rate of exchange for 
the periods covered by the accounts. Exchange differences 
that relate to the net equity investment in overseas activities 
are taken directly to reserves. 
(f) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, where 
appropriate, to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising 
from operational, financing and investment activities. In 
accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold 
or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at  
cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial 
instruments are stated at fair value. The gain or loss on 
remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in  
the income statement. However, where derivatives qualify for 
hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss 
depends on the nature of the item being hedged. None of  
the Group’s derivatives currently qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount 
that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap  
at the balance sheet date, taking into account current  
interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap 
counterparties.
(g) Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses 
(see accounting policy l). 
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have 
different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items 
of property, plant and equipment.
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially  
all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. The owner-occupied property (excluding land 
element) acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an 
amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the 
lease, less accumulated depreciation (see below) and 
impairment losses (see accounting policy l). Lease payments 
are accounted for as described in accounting policy s.
Subsequent costs
The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item  
of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part  
of such an item when that cost is incurred if it is probable  
that the future economic benefits embodied with the item will 
flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other costs are recognised in the income 
statement as an expense as incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part 
of an item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated 
useful lives are as follows:
Freehold land Indefinite
Freehold buildings  50 years
Long and short leasehold property   Term of lease or 50 years, 
whichever is lower
Fixtures and equipment  3-10 years
Motor vehicles  4 years
Computer equipment  3-5 years
(h) Intangible assets – Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the 
acquisition method. Goodwill represents amounts arising  
on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.  
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since  
1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between 
the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net 
identifiable assets acquired.
The classification and accounting treatment of business 
combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 has not 
been reconsidered in preparing the Group’s opening IFRS 
balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and  
is formally tested bi-annually for impairment (see accounting 
policy l). In respect of associates, the carrying amount of 
goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment 
in the associate.
Any excess of fair value of net assets over consideration on 
acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement. Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010 41 
(i) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less 
impairment losses (see accounting policy l).
(j) Stock
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of 
completion and selling expenses.
(k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and  
call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand 
and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management 
are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
(l) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed  
at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is  
any indication of impairment. 
For property, plant and equipment, the carrying value  
of each cash generating unit (“CGU”) is compared to its 
estimated value in use. Value in use calculations are based  
on discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of  
the CGU (between 2 and 50 years). The discount rate used  
is the rate believed by the Board to reflect the risks associated 
with each CGU. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement.
For goodwill and assets that have an indefinite useful life,  
the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet 
date. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying 
amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in  
the income statement and are not subsequently reversed.
(m) Share-based payment transactions
The share option programme allows Group employees to 
acquire shares of the Company and all options are equity-
settled. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an 
employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the 
period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted  
is measured using a Stochastic model, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the options were 
granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted 
to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except 
where forfeiture is only due to market based conditions not 
achieving the threshold for vesting.
(n) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as  
a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow  
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.  
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value  
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to  
the liability.
(o) Deferred and current tax
Corporation tax payable is provided on the taxable profit  
at the current rate. Deferred tax is recognised in respect  
of all temporary differences that have originated but not 
reversed at the balance sheet date, except to the extent  
that the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill. Temporary differences are differences between  
the carrying amount of the Group’s assets and liabilities  
and their tax base.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected  
to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences  
are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that are 
enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
(p) Pensions
The Group makes contributions for selected employees into 
defined contribution pension plans and these contributions 
are charged to the income statement as they become 
payable. The Group does not operate any defined  
benefit plans.
(q) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the 
expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract 
are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations 
under the contract.
(r) Revenue
Revenue represents amounts received and receivable for 
services and goods provided (excluding value added tax  
and voluntary gratuities left by customers for the benefit  
of employees) and is recognised at the point of sale. 42 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010
Accounting policies for the consolidated accounts
 continued
(s) Expenses
(i) Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in  
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term  
of the lease. Incentives to enter into an operating lease are 
also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term as  
a reduction in rental expense.
(ii) Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the 
finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. 
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the 
lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
(iii) Pre-opening expenses
Property rentals and related costs incurred up to the  
date of opening of a new restaurant are written off to the 
income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
Promotional and training costs are written off to the income 
statement in the period in which they are incurred.
(iv) Borrowing costs
Debt is stated net of borrowing costs which are spread  
over the term of the loan. All other borrowings costs are 
recognised in the income statement in the period in which 
they are incurred.
(t) Dividend policy
In accordance with IAS 10, “Events after the Balance Sheet 
Date”, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are  
not recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date, and 
are recognised in the financial statements when they have 
received approval by shareholders.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources  
of estimation and uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies  
as described above, management has made a number  
of judgements and estimations of which the following are  
the most significant.
a) Impairment of carrying value of associate
The investment in Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited 
and the loan note of £10.4m receivable from a subsidiary of 
that company were fully provided against in the years ended 
30 December 2007 and 31 December 2006. Following  
a review of the trading performance of the company, the 
Directors have concluded that this treatment is appropriate 
and no adjustment has been made in either the current  
or the previous year. Further details are provided in note 13.
b) Impairment of goodwill and property, plant  
and equipment
The Group formally determines whether property, plant and 
equipment and goodwill are impaired on a bi-annual basis. 
This requires the Group to determine the lowest level of 
assets which generate largely independent cash flows  
(cash generating units or “CGU”) and to estimate the value  
in use of these assets or CGUs; and compare these to their 
carrying value. Cash generating units are deemed to be 
individual units, a collection of units or a brand depending on 
the nature of the trading environment in which they operate. 
Calculating the value in use requires the Group to make an 
estimate of the future cash flows of each CGU and to choose 
a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present  
value of those cash flows. The discount rate used in the  
year ended 2 January 2011 for all CGUs was based on the  
Group’s weighted average cost of capital of 9.5% (year ended  
27 December 2009: 10.96%) as the Directors believe there 
are broadly equal risks associated with each CGU. No 
impairment is required in the year ended 2 January 2011. Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements

2 Additional non-statutory information   
Results are stated excluding non-trading items 
Additional non-statutory income statement information is provided as a useful guide to underlying trading performance.  
The 2010 and 2009 results include a number of items which are of a one-off nature or are unrelated to the year’s result  
and hence are not representative of the underlying trading performance of the business. The following segmental analysis 
excludes these non-trading items, as described in note 5, and is provided to aid understanding of the income statement  
and should be read in conjunction with, rather than as a substitute for, the reported information.

Adjustments in respect of previous years (288) (756)

Total tax charge for the year 16,353 11,062
    
b) Factors affecting the tax charge for the year    
The tax charge for the year varies from the standard UK corporation tax rate of 28% (2009: 28%) due to the following factors: 
2010
£’000
2009
£’000
Profit on ordinary activities before tax 56,478 48,334
Profit on ordinary activities before tax multiplied by the  
 standard UK corporation tax rate of 28% (2009: 28%) 15,814 13,534
Effects of:
Depreciation on non-qualifying assets 1,642 1,546
Expenses/(gain) not deductible for tax purposes 110 (293)
Loss on disposal of non-qualifying assets – 29
Credit in respect of rate change on deferred tax liability (781) –
Adjustment in respect of previous years (146) (3,813)
Utilisation of capital losses brought forward – (110)
Other adjustments (286) 169
Total tax charge for the year 16,353 11,062
    
The Finance Act 2010 reduced the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011, and this rate is required to be 
used in calculating deferred tax provisions at the balance sheet date. This has resulted in a tax credit in the income statement 
of £0.8m.    
    
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main corporation tax rate of 1% each year 
reducing the main tax rate down to 24% by April 2014. The future 1% main tax rate reductions are expected to have a similar 
impact on the financial statements as the current year, however the actual impact will be dependent on the deferred tax 
position at that time.

  The additional consideration represents amounts paid to the previous shareholders of Brunning and Price Limited, as agreed under the 
terms of the purchase agreement, being monies received on outstanding negotiations relating to the pre-acquisition period.
    
Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is subject to a bi-annual impairment review, or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Therefore, goodwill arising on acquisition  
is monitored and an impairment test is carried out which compares the value in use of each cash generating unit (“CGU”)  
to the carrying value. The goodwill represents amounts arising on the acquisition of Blubeckers Limited and Brunning  
and Price Limited, which now trade as Pub Restaurants. Previously, the goodwill arising on each acquisition was assessed 
individually but, following the program of modifying the former Blubeckers sites to bring them more in line with the  
Brunning & Price style of operation, it is now considered appropriate to evaluate them in aggregate.    
Value in use calculations are based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and three year 
business plans approved by the Board. Cash flows are then extrapolated in perpetuity with an annual growth rate of 2%. 
Perpetuity is believed to be reasonable due to the significant proportion of freeholds in the estate and the nature of the 
leasehold properties. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 9.5% (2009: 10.96%) which is the rate 
believed by the Directors to reflect the risks associated with the CGU.    
    
Since 1 January 1989 the cumulative amount of goodwill written off against realised reserves is £50.4m (2009: £50.4m). 
Records for periods prior to this date are not readily available. 56 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010

13 Investment in associate       
The Restaurant Group plc holds a 38% investment in Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited and this investment  
is accounted for using the equity method. Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited has an accounting year end date  
of 31 March and as there is no material benefit in making the accounting year end co-terminus with the Group, no change  
has been made.      
      
As a result of a detailed review of the trading performance of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, the investment  
has been recorded at £nil and a loan note of £10.4m plus interest receivable due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary  
of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, was fully provided against as at 2 January 2011 and 27 December 2009.  
    
The Group’s share of the post-tax result of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited for the year ended 2 January 2011  
was a loss of £0.18m (2009: loss of £0.04m). This loss has not been recognised in the income statement, in accordance  
with IAS 28 “Associates and Joint Ventures” as the investment has a carrying value of £nil.     
 
Interest is receivable from LV Finance Limited on the loan note of £10.4m at a rate of LIBOR. In the 53 weeks ended  
2 January 2011 £0.1m of interest has accrued of which the Group has recognised £nil (2009: £0.2m of which the Group 
recognised £nil). Consequently in addition to the loan note of £10.4m outstanding at that date, £1.2m of interest receivable 
had accrued, of which, under the terms of the agreement, all was overdue.      
      
Summarised financial information on Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited is as follows:

Stock comprises raw materials and consumables and have been valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable 
value. The replacement cost at 2 January 2011 is not considered by the Directors to be materially different from the balance 
sheet value. The Group recognised £106.7m of purchases as an expense in 2010 (2009: £101.7m).

20 Employee benefit trust      
An employee benefit trust (“EBT”) was established in 2007 in order to satisfy the exercise or vesting of existing and future 
share awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The EBT purchases shares in the market, using funds provided by the 
Company, based on expectations of future requirements. Dividends are waived by the EBT. At 2 January 2011, the Trustees, 
Appleby Trust (Jersey) Limited, held 5.9m shares in the Company (27 December 2009: 5.8m shares).    
Net cash outflow in the year ended 2 January 2011 was £1.4m, inclusive of costs (year ended 27 December 2009: £3.9m,

Details of options granted under the Group’s share schemes are given in note 21.      
21 Share-based payment schemes      
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes, details of which are provided in the Directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 29 to 35. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IFRS 2 “Share-based payments” not to 
account for share options granted before 7 November 2002.        
The charge recorded in the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 2 January 2011 in respect of share-based 
payments is £2.2m (2009: £2.1m).
        
The other reserve account in the balance sheet reflects the credit to equity made in respect of the charge for share-based 
payments made through the income statement and the purchase of shares in the market in order to satisfy the vesting of 
existing and future share awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (see note 20).      
  
Executive Share Option Plans (“ESOPs”)        
The Group has in place three ESOPs, the 1998 scheme, the 2003 scheme and a one-off scheme. Under these schemes, the 
Remuneration Committee may grant options over shares in The Restaurant Group plc to employees of the Group. Awards 
under the ESOPs are generally reserved for senior management level and above. The contractual life of an option is ten years. 
Options granted under ESOPs become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to growth in earnings 
per share exceeding RPI growth by more than 4% (under the 1998 scheme) or 2.5% (under the 2003 scheme). Exercise of 
options is subject to continued employment within the Group. Options were valued using a Stochastic option pricing model. 
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. 60 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010

Long-Term Incentive Plan        
On 9 November 2005 an Extraordinary General Meeting of The Restaurant Group plc approved the adoption of a new 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for the Group, details of which are provided in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 
29 to 36. Awards under the LTIP are generally reserved for senior management level and above. 
Conditional Award share options and Matching Award share options are granted to Directors and selected employees. In 
respect of the Matching Award share options, the respective Director or employee is required to acquire a number of shares 
by a specified date, known as “Deposited shares”, and retain these shares until the Matching Award share options vest, for 
these Matching Award share options to be valid. The table below summarises the dates of awards under the LTIP and the 
dates by which Directors and employees were required to acquire their deposited shares.

6 March 2008 30 June 2008
5 March 2009 30 June 2009
4 March 2010 30 June 2010
Vesting of share options under the LTIP is dependent on continuing employment. In exceptional circumstances, employees 
may be permitted to exercise options before the normal period in which they are exercisable.
On publication of the 2010 results, the Conditional and Matching Awards granted on 6 March 2008 become exercisable.  
The vesting criteria for the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) element of the Conditional Award were met in full and 
consequently, 100% of this part of the award will vest. Earnings per share (“EPS”) growth of the 2010 results compared  
with the 2007 results was between RPI +4% and RPI +10% and consequently, 82.5% of the EPS element of the Conditional 
Award and the Matching Award will vest.
The options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through share purchases via a trust. Further details are provided in note 20.

Save As You Earn Scheme        
Under the Save As You Earn (“SAYE”) scheme, the Board may grant options over shares in The Restaurant Group plc to 
UK-based employees of the Group. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price 
of the shares for the five days prior to invitation. Employees pay a fixed amount from their salary into a savings account each 
month for the three-year savings period. At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise 
their options using the funds saved. If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds  
saved and the options expire. Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group. In exceptional 
circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise these options before the end of the three-year savings period. 
Options were valued using the Stochastic share pricing model.

  Expected volatility is the measure of the amount by which the share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. In order to calculate 
volatility, the movement in the return index (share price plus dividends re-invested) over a period prior to the grant date equal in length  
to the remaining period over which the performance condition applies has been calculated. For the SAYE awards and for the discount  
for the TSR performance condition for the relevant Conditional Awards, the calculated volatility based on the movement in the return index 
over a period of 3.25 years and 3 years respectively prior to the grant has been used.

24 Financial instruments and derivatives      
The Group finances its operations through equity and borrowings. The Group borrows at floating rates and during 2010  
and 2009, used interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile. The use of any financial instruments is carefully 
controlled and monitored by the Board in line with the Group’s treasury strategy and the terms and conditions of its facilities. 
     
Management’s approach to treasury is to:      
ensure sufficient committed loan facilities are in place to support anticipated business requirements; •	
ensure the Group’s debt service will be supported by anticipated cash flows and that covenants will be complied with; and •	
manage interest rate exposure with a combination of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps, when appropriate.  •	
    
Further details on the business risk factors that are considered to affect the Group and more specific financial risk 
management (including sensitivity to increases in interest rates) are included in the report of the Directors on pages 18 to 25. 
Further details on market and economic risk is included in the Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations on pages 6 to 11. 
Further detail on headroom against covenants is included in the Group Finance Director’s report on pages 12 to 15.

dependent on LIBOR and base rate. The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 1.30% (2009: 1.22%). After 
taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps, the average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 2.98% 
(2009: 4.06%).

On 19 December 2007 the Group entered a 5 year facility agreement for £120m which was utilised from 17 January 2008. 
Interest is payable on the amount drawn down at LIBOR plus mandatory cost and the bank’s margin, which is dependent  
on the debt to EBITDA ratio. The Group has a £10m overdraft facility, which is repayable on demand, on which interest  
is payable at the bank’s overdraft rate. 
   
At 2 January 2011 the Group has £70.0m of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings  
(27 December 2009: £50.0m) and £10.0m of undrawn overdraft (27 December 2009: £10.0m of undrawn overdraft).

       66 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2010
24 Financial instruments and derivatives continued     
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
At 2 January 2011, the Group had derivative financial instruments relating to interest rate swaps and these have been valued  
in accordance with IAS 39. The fair value measurement of these financial instruments is categorised as Level 1, being derived 
from quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities.      
      
The fair value of these instruments was £0.6m and this is accounted for as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet  
(2009: £2.2m liability). The movement in fair value, after taking into consideration the £1.0m cash paid on termination  
of one of the swaps, has been recorded as a non-trading item in the consolidated income statement.
All financial assets and liabilities, excluding the interest rate swaps, are accounted for at cost and the Directors consider the 
carrying value to approximate their fair value. 
(b) Credit risk      
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the 
Group. Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with large established financial institutions. The Group is exposed 
to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet 
their obligations.      
      
As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from 
customer transactions. The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of retrospective discounts receivable from suppliers but 
the Directors believe adequate provision has been made in respect of doubtful debts  and there are no material amounts past 
due that have not been provided against.      
      
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of £10.4m plus interest due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of the 
Group’s associate company Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited. This debt is secured on the assets of Living Ventures 
Restaurants Limited, but is subject to a prior ranking behind LV Finance Limited’s bank. In 2007, following a detailed review of 
the carrying value of the business including the loan note receivable, the Board made full provision against the loan note due 
(further details are provided in note 13).       
      
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.      
(c) Liquidity risk      
The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and 
liquidity management requirements. Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank 
facilities by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.  
The Group’s loan facilities, which mature in 2012 (as set out in note (a) above) ensure continuity of funding, provided the 
Group continues to meet its covenant requirements (as detailed in the report of the Directors on pages 18 to 25).   
   
(d) Foreign currency risk      
As the Group operates primarily within the United Kingdom any transactional or translational exposure to changes in foreign 
exchange rate is limited. The Group operates three restaurants in Spain that are serviced by local Euro denominated  
debt. The Group is not materially exposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange  
forward contracts.      
      
(e) Interest rate risk      
Exposure to interest rate movements has been controlled historically through the use of floating rate debt and interest  
rate swaps to achieve a balanced interest rate profile. The Group no longer has an interest rate swap, following the early 
repayment of the swap scheduled to terminate in 2012, as the reduction in the level of debt throughout 2010 combined  
with current market conditions results in a low level of exposure. The Group’s exposure will continue to be monitored and  
the use of interest rate swaps may be considered in the future.

Lease commitments are in respect of property leases where the initial term of the lease is in excess of 25 years and the 
conditions of the lease are in keeping with a finance lease. There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor. 
The interest rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group  
in relation to each lease. The fair value of the lease payments is estimated as £3.1m (2009: £3.0m).
The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are:

The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor.  
There are no restrictions imposed by the Group’s operating lease arrangements, either in the current or prior year. 
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable on properties where the rental payment is based on turnover.  
For these properties, primarily in the Group’s Concession division, the amount included above is the minimum guaranteed 
rent as detailed in the concession agreement. Where there is no minimum guaranteed rent, the amount included is based  
on the estimated amount payable.

27 Contingent liabilities      
The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and 
therefore unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this date 
that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement. Consequently, should  the current tenant default, the landlord 
has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc, or its subsidiaries, for future rental payments. As and when any liability 
arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.      
      
28 Related party transactions      
Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited is a related party to The Restaurant Group plc through the Group’s 38% holding. 
A loan note of £10.4m is due from LV Finance, a subsidiary of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, which attracts 
interest at the rate of LIBOR. During the year ended 2 January 2011, £0.1m of interest was accrued of which the Group 
recognised £nil (2009: £0.2m of which the Group recognised £nil). Consequently, in addition to the £10.4m loan note 
outstanding at 2 January 2011, £1.2m interest had accrued, of which all was overdue under the terms of the agreement. 
Further details are provided in note 13.   
   
Alan Jackson is a non-executive director of Charles Wells Limited, an independent brewing, pub and distribution company. 
During 2005, The Restaurant Group plc entered into a lease for a site owned by Charles Wells Limited and subsequently  
this site was converted into a Frankie & Benny’s restaurant. No premium was paid by the Group to Charles Wells Limited.  
The Group has entered into the lease with Charles Wells Limited, on an arm’s length basis, with an annual rent of £73,850  
per annum. In addition, the Group purchased products with a value totalling £0.7m (2009: £0.9m) from Charles Wells Limited 
during the year, on an arm’s length basis. No balance was directly outstanding at the year end. Alan Jackson received no 
remuneration or compensation in respect of these transactions.   
   
Remuneration in respect of key management personnel, defined as the Directors for this purpose, is disclosed in note 6. 
Further information concerning the Directors’ remuneration is provided in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 29 to 35,

Accounting policies and basis of preparation     
     
Basis of accounting     
The accounts for the Company have been prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, whilst the Group 
accounts have been prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards. The Company accounts have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and on a going 
concern basis.     
     
Investments     
Investments are valued at cost less any provision for impairment.     
     
Dividends     
In accordance with FRS 21, “Events after the Balance Sheet Date”, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not 
recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date, and are recognised in the financial statements when they have received 
approval by shareholders.     
     
Share-based payment transactions     
The share options have been accounted for as an expense in the company in which the employees are employed, using  
a valuation based on the Stochastic simulation model.     
      
In accordance with an available election in FRS 20, share-based payment awards granted before 7 November 2002 have  
not been subject to a charge. An increase in the investment held by the Company in the subsidiary in which the employees 
are employed, with a corresponding increase in equity, is recognised in the accounts of the Company. Information in respect 
of the Company’s share-based payment schemes is provided in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.  
    
The value is accounted for as a capital contribution in the relevant Group subsidiary that employs the staff members to whom 
awards of share options have been made.

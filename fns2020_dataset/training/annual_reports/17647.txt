Group at a Glance
By centralising editorial and approval processes via secure 
web-based platforms, ZOO’s proprietary patented software 
helps customers to increase their speed of production, 
reduce costs and protect their brand integrity. ZOO’s services 
enable quicker and more cost effective processes across a 
wide range of applications and formats, including packaging, 
printed materials, DVD, Blu-ray Disc, video on demand, 
electronic sell-through (EST), broadcast, music and electronic 
books. 
The Group’s largest customers include major Hollywood 
studios, for which the production, marketing and distribution 
of titles in numerous formats across many geographies and 
languages has previously been a lengthy, costly and largely 
manual process. Increasingly the Group’s software is benefiting 
a variety of companies across sectors where the development 
of media products, printing, packaging and marketing involves 
complex processes in multiple countries and languages, 
particularly where brand integrity is of core importance.
The Industries We Serve
Following an initial period of exclusively targeting the entertainment industry with solutions for video content, our product 
set has since been expanded to address a much wider scope of creative media types and requirements. We are now building 
our customer base in a number of diverse industries as described on the following page. In each case, depending on the 
needs of the customer, we either license our technology or provide an outsourced service to customers with our operators 
utilising our software. Either way the customer will reap the benefits of our wealth of experience and dramatically reduce 
their production costs, meaning that those previously uneconomic products become viable and can now be introduced into 
product streams.
One Stop to Global
ZOO offers comprehensive solutions for global 
companies like film and television studios, music 
producers, book and games publishers and 
corporate clients who produce creative media 
for global distribution.
ZOO Digital Group plc provides software and related services that 
support the authoring, re-purposing and distribution of creative media. 
ZOO’s products form an integrated suite of web-based and desktop 
applications for audio/visual content and printed materials, adapting 
these media for different languages, formats and delivery mechanisms.

Home Entertainment
The home entertainment industry is going through a period of significant change. Consumers have come to expect to have choice in the way in which 
they watch movies and other video materials — in the living room, on the personal computer and on the move. The DVD format is in decline as consumers 
scale back the building of their personal collections, while the latest packaged media format — Blu-ray Disc — and a range of Electronic Sell Through (EST) 
platforms such as iTunes are taking off. This industry transition causes all studios to examine costs very carefully and find ways of doing more for less.
We help our customers cut outsourcing costs. We offer something different from the traditional service provided by other vendors; our tools 
automate the costly repetitive tasks involved in production. These tools remove the need for expensive and error-prone manual production resulting in 
fully compliant output that requires significantly less quality control.
We help our customers to decrease their time to market. We have been at the sharp end of the entertainment industry’s demand for ‘day-and-
date’ releases for the past few years and have developed tools and services to help our customers co-ordinate their workflows, speed up localization and 
drastically cut the time taken to create products — whether they are EST, DVD or Blu-ray – as well as the associated promotional material.
Our products manage complexity for our customers. Creation of home entertainment products is complex work — there are many parties whose 
work must be co-ordinated; everyone is under time pressure; there is a high reliance on human labour; it is easy to make mistakes; every aspect of these 
products must be checked and verified; the cost of ensuring that products meet the stringent quality expectations of modern consumers is high. Our 
technology manages complex workflows to bring structure and enforce adherence to standards – we can achieve high quality results very cost effectively.
Video games
When video games are distributed around the world, having a fast, efficient method for producing and managing localized versions of manuals, packaging 
and marketing material is a must. In this industry product packaging often requires text in multiple languages to be integrated into a single layout. This is a 
challenging design requirement with a correspondingly onerous approvals process.
Our software manages complex approvals workflows. For any single territory, multiple approvers are typically required to ensure that all aspects of the 
artwork fulfil the needs of the business. These include legal, corporate branding, product marketing, regulatory and other requirements. The integration 
of multiple languages brings an added level of complexity to the process. Our collaboration software enables these complex workflows to be managed 
efficiently, reducing time-to-market.
Our software creates print-ready artwork. The output from our systems is data files that can be delivered directly to a printer and streamlining the pre-
media process. 
Publishing
There is a seismic shift taking place in the publishing industry as businesses seek to exploit the rapidly expanding eBook market. While the conversion of a 
novel for electronic sale is a relatively straightforward process, the production of rich media genres, such as picture books, comics, graphic novels, recipe 
books, travel guides and encyclopaedias is a different matter altogether.
We automate the preparation of media-rich eBooks. Working with us, traditional publishers are able to adapt existing titles for sale electronically at a 
lower cost and more quickly than by partnering with traditional service vendors. 
We can streamline the translation of books into other languages. Although the eBook market is currently established in the US and UK, it is expected 
that other countries will follow suit and when they do we are well placed to assist in the management of workflows for localisation.
We support all popular eReader platforms. We take a platform agnostic position – by working with us book publishers are assured that their titles can be 
produced through our automated process for all required eReader devices, including the iPad, Kindle, Nook and Sony Reader.
Music
iTunes LP offers a unique and interactive experience with Apple’s iTunes platform. A consumer who purchases an album with iTunes LP 
receives the songs from the album, plus special features such as lyrics, photos, videos, credits, and more.
The added value provided by these bonus materials should make titles more attractive for purchase, and provide an incentive for 
publishers to package their products using the iTunes LP format. But this is a complex and costly process.
Our software can create iTunes LP packages quickly and easily. We are able to repurpose designs and files created previously for 
other platforms to enable efficient production of titles.
We enable music publishers to create products in-house. We have developed software so that these complex titles can be created without requiring 
technical specialists. The result is an easy to use product that can be used to create engaging, content-rich LPs using the publisher’s internal staff and 
reducing costs. 
Our software manages localisation. Adapting digital music products so that they may be published in other languages is a painless process using our 
software, enabling international product versions to be created quickly and easily.

Smarter Workflows
for Global Media
Creative media plays an ever increasing role in the operations 
of all global organisations. For some, creative media is the 
lifeblood of the business — the product itself, particularly 
for producers and publishers of film and video, video games, 
music and books. For others it is a means to an end to entice 
customers to buy consumer and professional products — 
used in the design of packaging and marketing materials.
As businesses strive to reach global audiences, creative media must be produced in the local languages of 
customers all around the world, often as part of simultaneous product releases in many territories. Across  
many industries there is a drive to create more products, more quickly, in more languages and at lower  
cost. This often requires a Herculean effort by many collaborating groups — suppliers, distributors, licensees, 
territory offices, legal departments, translators — involving complex workflows with plenty of opportunity  
for human error. 
ZOO provides a Media Collaboration Platform to support creative media preparation and publication  
enabling diverse groups of individuals to work together efficiently via the internet. 
Each ZOO tool brings customer value in its own right yet all work together to offer a smart end-to-end 
workflow for global media. The tools on the following page are components of ZOO’s Media Collaboration 
Platform.

Interactive Content Editor
ZOO’s Interactive Content Editor (ICE) 
allows movie and music studios to produce 
cost-effective value-added content for 
consumers interested in enhanced features 
and additional content with their digital 
media downloads. iTunes
®
 Extras and iTunes 
LPs deliver a richer product to film and 
music fans and quantifiable benefits to the 
publishers.
ICE is designed to allow movie and music 
producers to create enhanced iTunes movies 
and albums in the form of iTunes Extras and 
iTunes LP that often use assets designed 
for other media. This could include DVD/
BD packaging, album cover art or CD-audio 
packaging. Content such as still images, 
music videos, director’s commentary, 
deleted scenes, album credits and lyrics are 
repurposed and used to create an engaging, 
content-rich product.
ICE eliminates time-consuming hand 
programming while also automating the 
production of all the images by generating 
constituent elements for buttons, 
backgrounds, etc. ICE can efficiently produce 
the same features and effects found in 
almost all of today’s iTunes Extras and iTunes 
LP titles in a matter of minutes. Automated 
creation of language versions are also a 
feature.
Templated Authoring System
For movie/TV content providers, TAS is the 
only professional DVD authoring solution 
that offers a flexible templated workflow. 
This de-skills the creation of a DVD title, 
so creating titles is quicker and cheaper. 
Because TAS is systematic about the way 
in which titles are prepared, it ensures 
all technical requirements are rigorously 
adhered to. This means titles are produced 
right-first-time, reducing the labour needed 
for QC.
TAS enables cost effective in-sourcing of 
functions that previously required specialists. 
Because TAS simplifies the process of 
authoring a DVD and removes much of the 
repetition. In depth knowledge of the DVD 
specification is not required to create a disc 
and fewer errors occur during authoring. 
This reduces the cost of authoring and 
testing of a DVD title and operators within 
studios can undertake DVD authoring  
in-house without needing to outsource  
to a specialist.
Media Adaptation Tool
For anyone with an international market, MAT 
is the only automated tool which creates single 
and multi-lingual variants of printed and digital 
materials in multiple languages and sizes. MAT’ s 
flexible automation brings significant timesaving 
benefits, reduces the number of errors and 
encourages consistency in output designed for 
multiple territories.
MAT also links to other ZOO tools in the 
production workflow. This means that 
translations are requested, received and applied 
automatically (in conjunction with the TMS). It 
also means all digital media menus (such as for 
DVD/Blu-ray/iTunes LPs) are already formatted for 
ZOO authoring systems (TAS/BDX/ICE).
MAT automates the tedious and error-prone parts 
of the production process for printed materials 
so that designs can be created more quickly and 
with fewer errors. It scans domestic documents, 
copies text to the ZOO Translation Management 
System ready for translation. Then MAT finds and 
uses supplied translations to create regionalized 
variants of the same document so operators no 
longer have to repeatedly copy and paste. T ext 
expansion after translation is already accounted 
for and the MAT operator has direct control over 
automatic text resizing and adjustments to put in 
finishing touches on the localized versions to get 
them just right.
Not only does MAT regionalize and resize 
printed materials, but digital products too. 
Entertainment products such as Blu-ray menus 
can be easily created and regionalized using 
the same process, and because everything 
is automated, the vast numbers of files 
produced are all consistently and logically 
named, filed and ready for authoring.
Translation Management System
The TMS helps our clients manage global 
projects with complex media workflows 
and thousands of translations. This system 
incorporates a number of modules designed 
to support international media production 
workflows, including a graphical display of 
a project’s progress, a dictionary of standard 
translations, as well as the capability to 
‘learn phrases’ as they are used in specific 
contexts. This eradicates the need for 
duplication, providing ZOO’s clients with 
significant cost savings, alongside improved 
brand consistency and control.
Blu-ray Authoring System
BDX is the only Blu-ray authoring system 
that combines flexible template-driven 
authoring with a visual menu editor. This 
means that Blu-ray discs can be made more 
quickly, with reduced need for QC, and 
without the need for programming skills. 
This can dramatically reduce costs.
Everyone in the home entertainment 
industry knows that Blu-ray production is 
complex, expensive to author and test, and 
the work involved is error-prone, repetitive 
and requires highly skilled staff. It is also 
difficult to scale up when work increases.
ZOO eBook Builder
ZEB is an eBook editing tool which combines 
full support for fixed-layout epub files 
with the ability to quickly regionalise a title 
for many different territories. This means 
that graphically rich books can be easily 
converted into eBooks and made ready for 
multiple territories with reduced need for 
QC and without the need to manually create 
the epub files.

Our Performance
The Board is pleased to report another year 
of progress in which ZOO has performed in 
line with market expectations. The group 
increased its operating profit
1
 to $1.3m 
(compared with $821k in 2010), and EBITDA 
rose to $2.3m (from $1.6m in 2010), despite 
a decline in revenue to $14m (from $15m 
in 2010). The decline in revenue arose from 
two primary causes: a short-term slowdown 
in projects from our largest customer during 
a major organisation change there, and 
a reduction in the amount of low margin 
subtitling work which has traditionally 
been subcontracted to a third party vendor. 
Cash generation was also affected by this 
temporary slowdown in orders, and our year 
end cash balance was $0.6m.
During the year ZOO has made significant 
progress in reducing its dependence on the 
filmed entertainment industry. Although 
extending and deepening our customer 
relationships in this large industry remains 
vital to our business, the alliance with MPS, 
announced last year, has now yielded its 
first significant customer contracts outside 
the sector. In addition, our software and 
service platforms have shown themselves 
to be ideally suited to the management 
and electronic delivery of a wide range of 
creative media content, such as music, video 
game materials and, most significantly, 
eBooks. The Chief Executive’s operational 
review provides more details of these 
exciting developments for the group. 
Shareholders will be aware that in 
September 2006 the Company issued a 
five-year convertible loan note of $5.6m 
(£3.54m) to be either redeemed or 
converted into shares prior to October 2011.  
I am pleased to report that we have reached 
agreement with the loan note holders for 
50 per cent of this loan to be converted into 
shares and for the balance of 50 per cent 
to remain in the loan note instrument with 
the maturity date extending to 31 October 
2013 and the coupon changing to 7.5 per 
cent. I am also pleased to report a successful 
placing which will raise $2.8m to be used 
as working capital for the group to support 
expansion of the business in new markets, 
particularly eBooks.

Ian Stewart, Non-Executive director of the

ZOO’s products and services are highly

ZOO’s customers are therefore typically

Our Performance
Operational review
I am pleased with the performance of 
the group in what has been a difficult 
environment for the filmed entertainment 
industry. 
Filmed entertainment
The home entertainment market in 
particular has been through a turbulent 
period over the last 12 months, with 
upheaval and cost cutting measures taking 
place at many of the major Hollywood 
studios which, in turn, led to some order 
distortion for ZOO, specifically from our 
major customer. However, we were very 
pleased to note that the shortfall in orders 
has substantially recovered. Furthermore, we 
believe that the pressure that the studios are 
under to maximise sales and eliminate costs 
provides an ever greater advantage for the 
group. One of the most important ways for 
a studio to maximise sales of a new release, 
especially blockbuster titles, is to distribute 
the product into as many territories as 
possible simultaneously. By doing so, the loss 
of revenue through counterfeit products and 
illegal copying are dramatically reduced and 
the integrity and quality of the production 
is maintained. This very need to accelerate 
distribution globally in the shortest time 
frame possible makes our toolsets even 
more compelling. 
We are continually looking to broaden our 
client base whilst also striving to deepen 
the relationships with existing customers 
and increase the scope of work that we are 
doing for them. We were, therefore, pleased 
to be able to announce that Global Digital 
Media Xchange, a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Warner Bros. Entertainment, has licensed 
our automation production solutions for  
Blu-Ray and Electronic Sell Through 
platforms. 
Electronic Sell Through (“EST”) 
Market
The electronic delivery of digital products 
represents possibly the most significant shift 
in consumers’ media purchasing in recent 
times and we believe that this creates an 
excellent opportunity for ZOO. In September 
we announced that we had launched a new 
toolset that allowed existing content for the 
filmed entertainment industry to be made 
available through Apple’s iTunes
®
 Extras 
platform. Our tools enable content owners 
to adapt additional features such as movie 
and chapter selection along with special 
features such as movie stills, deleted scenes, 
exclusive interviews, and behind-the-scenes 
footage. These additional features have long 
been associated with DVD and more recently 
with Blu-ray Disc productions but the costs 
associated with traditional production 
methods have proved prohibitive for sales on 
iTunes and other Electronic Sell Through 
platforms. ZOO’s toolset enables this 
production at significantly lower costs and 
the initial response from clients has been 
extremely positive.
A similar opportunity exists within the music 
industry. Traditional album formats often 
include extra features such as the ability to 
view lyrics, liner notes, band photos and 
performance videos. ZOO has created an 
Interactive Content Editor to enable the 
efficient preparation of iTunes LPs, enabling 
publishers to sell such content through 
Apple’s iTunes LP platform and incorporate 
many of the extra features associated with 
traditional formats. Initial customers include 
a number of music publishers in the US, UK 
and France. According to Strategy Analytics, 
digital music revenues in 2012 will reach 
US$2.8bn and surpass physical sales for the 
first time.
Chief Executive’s Statement
“We are continually looking to broaden our client base whilst also 
striving to deepen the relationships with existing customers and 
increase the scope of work that we are doing for them.”

Our Performance
Our Financials Our Governance Our Performance Our Business
An even greater opportunity in the field 
of EST, and one of the most exciting 
developments in the past year, has 
presented itself with the electronic book, or 
eBook, market. The success of the overall 
eBook market has been spectacular and well 
publicised. According to a recent report from 
Futuresource Consulting, in 2010 the eBook 
market grew by more than 200% to a value 
of more than US$900m. 
As a result of ZOO’s success with the iTunes 
platform we have augmented our Media 
Collaboration solutions to include an 
eBook Builder which provides an efficient 
and cost-effective way for publishers to 
repurpose traditional books for sale online. 
This new tool works in conjunction with 
ZOO’s software for managing collaborative 
workflows, adapting materials into multiple 
languages, and providing storage and 
distribution of content for multiple eBook 
vendors. Another great advantage in using 
ZOO’s toolset for eBook production is that 
it maintains the formatting qualities and 
standards of a physical production thereby 
enhancing the enjoyment of reading it 
electronically. For example, where pictures 
or illustrations are used to accompany text 
to illustrate a point in a physical book, 
current practices for converting this into an 
electronic version have proved complicated 
and many of the resulting eBooks created by 
third parties have been produced with layout 
errors. Whilst this may not be of particular 
relevance to pure text books, it makes a 
huge difference where such features are 
integral to the genre of the book, which 
makes our tools particularly applicable to 
picture books, comics, travel guides, cookery 
books and reference publications.
MPS
At this stage last year we announced that 
we had agreed a strategic relationship with 
John Henry Holdings Inc., a subsidiary of 
Multi Packaging Solutions, Inc. (“MPS”), a 
US headquartered value-added print-based 
packaging solutions company. I am pleased 
to report that we have made significant 
progress through this in the past 12 months 
and the potential new business opportunities 
available to us are extremely exciting.
Indeed, in June this year we were able to 
announce the first significant contract win 
through this relationship with a leading 
international videogame publisher. We have 
already begun work with the publisher in 
the regionalisation of the interactive game 
group’s packaging materials for multiple 
territories and languages. 
We believe that this will be just the first in 
many relationships to come through MPS 
and are currently in discussions with a 
number of impressive organisations to help 
them with the production of packaging, 
marketing and other printed materials in 
a wide range of geographies, and I look 
forward to providing further updates in the 
coming year.
Placing of shares
We have raised approximately $2.8m of 
capital through a placing of shares to 
provide working capital that we intend 
to use to support the acceleration of the 
business in new markets. I have personally 
subscribed $160,000 to the placing, 
demonstrating my confidence in the future.  
We plan to use these funds for the following 
purposes: 
n Put in place the infrastructure needed to 
establish ZOO as an eBook aggregator
n Support the recruitment of additional 
R&D staff to accelerate eBook and EST 
software development
n Enlargement of the production team to 
provide a range of eBook services
n Recruit new sales and marketing staff to 
support eBook business development
Convertible loan note
We have reached agreement with the holders 
of the $5.6m convertible loan note, which 
was issued in 2006 and was due to mature 
in October 2011. The loan note holders 
have agreed to convert 50 per cent of the 
outstanding amount into equity at 40p with 
the balance remaining in the convertible loan 
note instrument which has been extended for 
a further period of two years with a coupon 
of 7.5 per cent and a conversion price of 48p.
Staff
It continues to be an honour to work with 
such a talented team of professionals in 
both our UK-based R&D centre and our 
US-based production services facility. In all 
areas of the business our success hinges on 
the talents, creativity and dedication of our 
staff who continue to excel in delivering 
innovative technology and first class 
customer services. We strive to provide a 
great place to work to attract and retain our 
key talent. On behalf of the board I would 
like to extend my thanks to all staff for their 
contributions over the past year and I look 
forward to working together in the year 
ahead.
Outlook
Our team has built an excellent product 
platform, reputation and customer 
relationships that I believe place us in 
a strong position to grow the business 
significantly. We have many exciting 
opportunities ahead of us and I look forward 
to the future with confidence.

Our Performance
The year ended 31 March 2011 was an 
exciting one with the business expanding 
into new areas. 
Results for the year
We are pleased to report a significant 
increase in operating profit in the year 
despite a reduction in turnover. The 
operating profit reported for the year is 
$1.3m compared to the previous year’s 
$0.8m, which was prior to an exceptional 
impairment charge.
The revenue for the period reduced to 
$13.8m (2010: $15.1m) due to the short 
term impact of reorganisations that took 
place within our largest customer and also 
the change in the invoicing of certain low 
margin subtitling work. There was one 
line of outsourced work which we have 
previously managed on behalf of a major 
client from which we have earned a small 
margin to cover administration. This work 
declined during the year and we took the 
decision to extricate ourselves from the 
invoicing process, which in the future will 
occur directly between the supplier and 
customer. The Board felt that, although 
this would have an impact on the reported 
turnover, it would enable us to report 
clearer financial results as they would not be 
distorted by non-core, low margin work.  
In the year ended 31 March 2011 the 
reported revenue included $2.0m of this 
outsourced revenue; the amount in the prior 
year was $3.6m. Now that we have stepped 
out of the invoicing it is expected that the 
amount in the year ended 31 March 2012 
will be minimal. It can be seen that once the 
impact of the outsourced work is removed 
the core business would report a turnover of 
$11.8m which shows a small increase from 
$11.5m in the prior year.
The overheads of the business have 
reduced slightly since the previous year. On 
the face of the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income (CSoCI) the 
operating expenses show a decrease from 
$11.5m to $10.2m but the comparative 
number includes an exceptional impairment 
charge. Once this is removed the other 
operating costs show a decrease from 
$10.5m to $10.2m. The overheads are 
primarily staff related costs. 
We have continued to take advantage of 
grant funding and throughout the year 
the total amount of cash received from 
grants was $0.3m (2010: $0.6m). The 
amount recognised in the CSoCI was $0.1m 
(2010: $0.2m). The amounts differ because 
some of the grant funding covers capital 
expenditure and therefore is not recognised 
in the CSoCI. We still have grant-supported 
projects on-going with almost $0.9m of 
funding still available at the end of the 
financial year (2010: $0.7m).
We have a total of around $28m of 
accumulated tax losses and consequently 
do not expect to pay taxes in the UK or the 
US in the immediate future. Now that the 
group is profitable and we anticipate profits 
in the foreseeable future it is appropriate 
that some of these losses are recognised as 
a deferred tax asset. Consequently, in the 
year we have recognised a $0.5m deferred 
tax asset.
Financial Review
“With a significant increase in operating profit, ZOO has made a great 
deal of progress over the past year and I share the board’s optimism 
for the future.”

Convertible loan note maturity
Our Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position as at 31 March 2011 includes 
the reporting of a liability of $5.6m which 
relates to the £3.54m convertible loan note 
instrument which was issued in 2006 and 
is due to mature in October 2011. I am 
pleased to confirm that we have reached 
agreement with the loan note holders to 
convert 50 per cent of this loan into equity 
and for the remaining 50 per cent to remain 
as a loan note instrument for a further two 
years. The new loan note instrument will 
carry a coupon of 7.5 per cent, a conversion 
price of 48p and is now due to mature on 
31 October 2013.
At the same time as resolving the loan note 
maturity we have successfully agreed a share 
placing which has raised $2.8m (£1.7m) 
working capital to support the acceleration 
of the business in new markets, particularly 
eBooks.
Following this placing the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position is 
significantly strengthened with net assets 
of around $9m.
Cash flow
The year has seen a reduction in cash 
generated from operating activities 
compared to the previous year through the 
impact of the reorganisation within a key 
customer and the investment in new areas 
of business. Operating cash generation was 
$0.9m compared to $2.1m in 2010. Overall, 
cash reduced by $0.6m in the year, leaving 
a cash balance at 31 March 2011 of $0.6m 
(2010: $1.2m).
The Board is focused on maximising the 
efficiency of cash management and we 
closely monitor our cash predictions. The 
placing mentioned above will provide 
additional working capital to give us the 
ability to accelerate the expansion into new 
markets such as eBooks, where we can see 
many opportunities. The working capital is 
supplemented by a $0.8m bank overdraft 
facility which gives a buffer for the peaks 
and troughs of cash flow throughout the 
trading year.
Summary
With a significant increase in operating 
profit, ZOO has made a great deal of 
progress over the past year and I share the 
board’s optimism for the future. With an 
exciting period ahead as we penetrate new 
markets, we will manage the growth to 
ensure that we maximise profitability and 
efficiently manage working capital. I look 
forward to reporting on progress in the 
future.

“The Electronic Sell Through market is clearly 
one of the most exciting developments in 
recent history for all forms of media sales, and 
we’re delighted to be playing an increasing 
role. The incredible growth in the electronic 
books market has been well documented 
of late and we believe that there are also 
substantial opportunities within the music

Directors’ Report
The directors present their report on the affairs of the group, 
together with the financial statements and auditor’s report, for the 
year ended 31 March 2011.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the group for the year under review was to 
provide productivity software tools and services for digital content 
authoring, video post-production and localisation for entertainment 
and packaging markets and to continue with on-going research and 
development in those areas.
Review of the Business and Future Developments
A review of the development of the business together with an 
indication of future developments is included in the Chairman’s and 
Chief Executive’s statements set out on pages 6 to 9.
The audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2011 
are set out on pages 23 to 60. The directors do not recommend the 
payment of a dividend for the year.
Research and development
The group undertakes research and development into software 
solutions for media transformation. The aim of the software 
developed is to improve efficiencies, therefore reducing time and 
costs of producing physical and digital video products.
Charitable and political contributions
During the year the group made no charitable or political donations.
Employees
Employee consultation
The group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
employees and has continued to keep them informed on matters 
affecting them as employees and on the various factors affecting 
the performance of the group. This is achieved through formal and 
informal meetings, questionnaires and regular feedback.
Disabled employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always 
fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant 
concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled 
every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the group 
continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of 
the group that the training, career development and promotion of 
disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical with that of 
other employees.
Events after the reporting period
On 10 June 2011 36,155 shares were issued following the exercise 
of employee share options.
On 14 June 2011 the group entered into an agreement to  
extend the lease on its US offices. The lease has been extended  
to December 2016. The total commitment of the five year period  
is $2.6m.
On 10 August 2011 the company announced that agreement  
had been reached with the holders of the $5.6m convertible loan 
note to convert 50% of their holding into shares at a price of 
40p and for the balance of 50% to remain within the loan note 
instrument for a further two years at a coupon of 7.5% and a 
conversion price of 48p. The loan note conversion into equity results 
in the issue of 4,426,250 shares and the placing results in a further 
4,252,500 shares. 
Dr Stuart A Green held a $549,000 (2010: $519,000) interest in 6% 
unsecured convertible loan stock at 31 March 2011. The underlying 
value of the interest in the convertible loan stock is £342,000. As 
a result of the above agreement, 50% of this loan stock has been 
converted into shares. 
On 10 August 2011 it was further announced that there has been a 
successful placing of shares raising $2.8m at a price of 40p in order 
to fund working capital in areas of growth. Stuart A Green, CEO, 
agreed to subscribe $160,000 to the placing.
On 16 August 2011 99,500 shares were issued following the 
exercise of employee share options.

Details of the interests in the shares of the company at the 
beginning or subsequent date of appointment and end of the 
financial year of those directors who held office at 31 March 2011 
are disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration report. In accordance 
with the company’s Articles of Association Helen Gilder and James 
Livingston retire by rotation at the next Annual General Meeting 
and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
Directors’ indemnities
The group has granted an indemnity to one or more of its directors 
against liability in respect of proceedings brought by third parties, 
subject to the conditions set out in the Companies Act 2006. The 
company has purchased and maintains directors’ and officers’ 
insurance cover against certain legal liabilities and costs for claims in 
connection with any act or omission by such director and officers in 
the execution of their duties.
Policy and practice on payment of creditors
The group’ s policy is to settle terms of payment with suppliers when 
agreeing the terms of each transaction, ensure that suppliers are made 
aware of the terms of payment and abide by the terms of payment. 
Trade creditors of the group at 31 March 2011 were equivalent to 76 
days (2010: 101 days) purchases, based on the average daily amount 
invoiced by suppliers during the year. The group has agreed with one 
significant creditor extended payment terms.
Key performance indicators
In addition to the monthly management accounts and information 
that are produced and monitored against the company’s plan and 
the previous year’s performance, the Board uses Key Performance 
Indicators (KPI’s) in the management of the key risks of the business 
and as a measure of the business efficiencies of the company. The 
KPI’s cover the following:
n Sales performance is measured against budget and the latest 
expectations which are updated monthly.
n Debtors are monitored by reviewing trends in debtor days and 
tracking the level of debt becoming overdue by 30 days or more
n Costs and overheads are monitored against budget and against 
current needs.
n Employee satisfaction is monitored through monthly surveys, 
enabling management to act on emerging trends.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Company law requires the group to report on princpal risks and 
uncertainties facing the business, which the directors believe to be 
as follows:
International business
The group is domiciled in the UK, but has the LA operations and 99% 
of its revenues coming from overseas customers. As with most small 
yet international businesses the group’s risks are around managing 
the cash flow and exchange rate fluctuations. The group continues to 
focus closely on conservative cash management and monitor currency 
transactions taking proactive actions when appropriate.
Technology conservation
The group continues with an aggressive patent protection policy, 
with 28 patents granted and 15 pending. These are integral to the 
business in the protection of our unique technologies.
Operational risks
The main operational risks are delays in the production of technology 
products and adoption of technology tools by customers. The production 
risk is managed by ensuring very tightly controlled schedules, thoroughly 
planning staff time and allowing time for contingencies.
Loss of the group’s key customer
Client relationships are crucial to the group and the strength of 
them are key to its continued success. The group mitigates this risk 
by a diverse number of contacts working closely with the customer 
across different business units and obtaining long term contractual 
agreements for supply of technology and services.
Financial risks
The main financial risks faced by the group are foreign currency risk 
and liquidity risk. The directors regularly review and agree policies for 
managing these risks.
Foreign currency risk is managed by matching payments and receipts 
in foreign currency to minimise exposure. From 1 April 2009 the 
functional currency and presentation currency of the group has 
changed to US dollars. The majority of the group’s transactions are 
undertaken in US dollars, however, the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position can be affected by movements between pound 
sterling and US dollars as the parent company and UK subsidiaries 
have some pound sterling debtors and creditors. In the current 
financial year the group has used forward foreign exchange 
contracts to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in the pound sterling 
and US dollars exchange rate.
Further information on the financial risks is given in note 28 to  
the accounts.

Directors’ Report
Financial instruments
During the financial year the group entered into some forward 
exchange contracts to sell US dollars for pound sterling. There were 
no forward exchange contracts outstanding at 31 March 2011 
(2010: nil). Further description of the forward foreign exchange 
contracts is given in note 28 to the accounts. The group is also 
exposed to the usual credit risk and cash flow risk associated with 
selling on credit and manages this through credit control procedures.

Corporate Governance Report
Directors' responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the directors' report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have, as required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange, elected to prepare 
the group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
and also elected to prepare the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with those standards. Under company law the 
directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the company and the group and of the profit or loss of the group for 
that period. 
In preparing these financial statements the directors are required to:
n select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
n make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
n state whether the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
n prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and the 
group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and the group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
company and the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of the financial statements and other 
information included in annual reports may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
The names and functions of all the directors are stated on page 12. 
Compliance with the Combined Code
Under the rules of AIM (The Alternative Investment Market of the 
London Stock Exchange) the company is not required to comply with 
the Combined Code as annexed to the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority. Nethertheless, the company has taken steps to 
comply with provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code so far as is 
practical given the size of the group and the nature of its operations. 
The directors consider the group insufficiently large to warrant the 
need for an internal audit function.
Board of Directors
Throughout the year the board consisted of the non-executive 
chairman and three executive directors. From the start of the 
financial year to 31 December 2010 the board also included two 
non-executive directors. Following the retirement of Ian Stewart on 
31 December 2010 this reduced to one non-executive director.
The Board meets formally at least eleven times a year to consider 
those matters which are required to be brought to it for decision, 
which ensures that it maintains full and effective control over 
appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. 
Directors receive an information pack before each board meeting 
which contains background information on such matters. Additional 
meetings are held to review and approve special matters if necessary.
Board Committees
There are two committees to deal with remuneration and audit. 
They are comprised solely of the non-executive directors with certain 
executive directors attending by invitation when required.
The Audit Committee is chaired by James Livingston. The committee 
meets at least twice a year. The group’s external auditor is invited to 
attend these meetings. Consideration is given to the auditor’s pre- 
and post-audit reports and these provide opportunities to review the 
accounting policies, internal control and the financial information 
contained in the Annual and Interim Reports.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Roger Jeynes and meets 
at least once per year.

Corporate Governance Report
Internal Control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
A comprehensive budgetary process is completed once a year and 
is reviewed and approved by the Board. The group’s results are 
compared to the budget and prior year and are reported to the 
board on a monthly basis.
Going Concern
After making enquires and taking into account the group’s cash 
resources, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at 
least the next twelve months and, for this reason, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

value of the interest in the convertible loan stock is £342,000. On 10 August 2011 the company announced that agreement had been 
reached with the holders of the $5.6m convertible loan note to convert 50% of their holding into shares at a price of 40p and for the 
balance of 50% to remain within the loan note instrument for a further two years at a coupon of 7.5% and a conversion price of 48p. The 
loan note conversion into equity results in the issue of 4,426,250 shares and the placing results in a further 4,252,500 shares. As a result, 
50% of Dr Stuart A Green’s loan stock has been converted into shares. 
On 10 August 2011 it was further announced that there has been a successful placing of shares raising $2.8m at a price of 40p in order to 
fund working capital in areas of growth. Stuart A Green, CEO, agreed to subscribe $160,000 to the placing.

VCTs, several of which have a direct beneficial interest in ZOO Digital Group plc.
No other transactions have taken place with directors.
No other changes took place in the interests of directors between 31 March 2011 and 18 August 2011.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members  
of Zoo Digital Group plc
We have audited the financial statements of ZOO Digital Group plc 
for the year ended 31 March 2011 which comprise the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated and 
Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
and Parent Company Statement of Cash Flows, and the related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards 
the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
n the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 
2011 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
n the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
n the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
n the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters  
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in  
our opinion:
n adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
n the parent company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
n certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
n we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2011
1. General Information
ZOO Digital Group plc (‘the company’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the group’) provide productivity tools and services for digital 
content authoring, video post-production and localisation for entertainment and packaging markets and continue with on-going 
research and development in those areas. The group has operations in both the UK and US.
The company is a public limited company which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market and is incorporated and domiciled in  
the UK. The address of the registered office is The Tower, 2 Furnival Square, Sheffield.
The registered number of the company is 3858881.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
company operates (note 2.4).
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that effect the application of policies and reported amounts in the financial statements. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgements or complexity, or areas where assumptions or estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 3.
A separate Statement of Comprehensive Income for the parent company has not been presented as permitted by section 408 (2) of the 
Companies Act 2006.
In September 2006 the company issued a five year convertible loan note of $5.6m to be either redeemed or converted into shares prior 
to October 2011. Since the balance sheet date the Board have reached agreement with the loan note holders for 50 per cent of this loan 
to be converted into shares and for the remaining 50 per cent to stay in the loan note instrument which has been extended for a further 
a two years with a coupon of 7.5 per cent. A placing of equity shares has raised an additional $2.8m which will be received in September 
2011 and will be used as working capital for the group to support expansion of the business in new markets, particularly eBooks.
The results for the year demonstrate growth in profitability and the directors have prepared trading and cash flow forecasts for the 
group for the period to 31 March 2014 which show further cautious growth in profitability.  In line with industry practice in this sector 
the directors have had informal indications from major and other customers to substantiate a significant proportion of the forecast sales.  
The directors have considered the consequences if the sales volume is less than the level forecast and they are confident that in this 
eventuality alternative steps could be taken to ensure that the group can continue to operate without the need for additional funding.
The bank funding facilities are due for renewal in October 2011 and the directors have no reason to believe that this will not be 
renewed.
The directors believe these assumptions to be realistic, and consequently that the group will continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.1.1 IFRS effective in 2010 but not relevant
The following standards and interpretations were mandatory for the current accounting period, but are not relevant to the operations of 
the group.
n IFRS1 (Amendment) First time adoption of IFRS
n IFRS2 (Amendment) Share based payments
n IFRS3 Business combinations (Revised)
n IFRS5 (Amendment) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
n IFRS7 (Amendment) Financial instruments: Disclosures
n IAS1 and IAS32 (Amendment) Presentation of financial statement and Financial instruments: Presentation
n IAS23 (Amendment) Borrowing costs
n IAS27 (Amendment) Consolidated and separate financial statements
n IAS39 and IFRS7 (Amendment) Reclassification of financial instruments
n IAS39 and IFRIC9 (Amendment) Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, and Reassessment of embedded derivatives
n IFRIC13 Customer loyalty programmes
n IFRIC16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
n IFRIC17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners
n IFRIC18 Transfers of assets from customers
2.1.2 Standards and interpretations issued but not yet applied
Any standards and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective, and that are available for early application, have 
not been applied by the group in these financial statements. Application of the majority of these Standards and Interpretations is not 
expected to have a material effect on the financial statements in the future.
The standards that are expected to have a material effect on the financial statements in the future are:
n IFRIC19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments
In accordance with the transitional provisions these standards will be prospectively applied and changes in accounting policy resulting 
from their application will have no impact on the opening balances in future financial statements.
2.2 Consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefit 
from their activities. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred until the date that control ceases.
The consolidated financial statements of ZOO Digital Group plc include the results of the company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiary 
accounting policies are amended where necessary to ensure consistency within the group and intra group transactions are eliminated  
on consolidation.
2.3 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting regularly reviewed by the group’s chief operating 
decision maker to make decisions about resource allocation to the segments and to assess their performance.
2.4 Foreign currency translation
2.4.1 Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars 
which is the company’s functional and presentation currency.
The pound sterling/US dollar exchange rate at 31 March 2011 was 0.6228 (2010: 0.6589).

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2011
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.4.2 Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange in the month of the transaction. Foreign exchange 
gains or losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the year end exchange rates are recognised in the profit/(loss) for the year in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign currency exchange risks, the group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts  
to hedge significant exposure on foreign exchange transactions. This is explained in the financial instruments accounting policy and  
note 28 to these financial statements. The group does not hedge account for forward foreign currency contracts.
2.4.3 Group companies
The results and financial position of all group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
n assets and liabilities for each entity are translated at the closing rate at the year end date;
n income and expenses for each Statement of Comprehensive Income are translated at the prevailing monthly exchange rate for the 
month in which the income or expense arose and all resulting exchange rate differences are recognised with the foreign exchange 
translation reserve.
2.5 Intangible assets
2.5.1 Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the 
consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and reviewed annually for 
impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating 
units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
2.5.2 Patent and Trademark costs
Patent and trademark costs are stated at cost, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Patents and trademarks have a 
finite useful life and amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic life which is assessed to be  
ten years.
2.5.3 Research and Development costs
Research expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred. 
Development costs are recognised as an intangible asset if they fulfil the following criteria:
— it is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use;
— management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
— there is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
— it can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
— there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset;
— the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured.
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously 
recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development costs recognised as an intangible asset are amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of three years or 
the length of any current sales contracts, from the point at which the asset is ready for sale or use.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.5.4 Computer Software
Acquired computer software is shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three years from the date 
the asset is available for use.
Costs that are directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group, and are 
expected to generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as development costs within intangible assets. 
See note 2.5.3 Research and Development costs.
Amortisation is included within ‘Other operating expenses’ in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
2.6 Investments in subsidiary undertakings
In the company, investments in subsidiary undertakings are carried at cost less any impairment. The investments are reviewed on an 
annual basis to test for any indication of impairment. The investments are eliminated on consolidation.
2.7 Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is provided 
on all such assets at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset less estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis, over its 
estimated useful life, as follows:
— Leasehold improvements   5 years or over the term of the lease, if shorter
— Computer hardware   between 2 and 3 years
— Office equipment, fixtures and fittings  between 2 and 5 years
— Production equipment   between 2 and 3 years
2.8 Impairment of assets
The group assesses at each year end date whether there is any indication that any of its assets have been impaired. If such indication 
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to its carrying value.
For goodwill, intangible assets that have an indefinite life and intangible assets not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is 
estimated at each year end date and whenever there is an indication of impairment an impairment loss is recognised for the amount 
by which the asset’s carrying value amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income within ‘Other operating expenses’.
2.9 Financial Instruments
The group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an 
equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual agreement.
The group has used forward foreign exchange contracts in the current financial year to hedge its exposure to currency risk. The group 
monitors its exposure and adopts forward foreign exchange contracts where it deems appropriate.
Financial instruments are recognised on the Statements of Financial Position at fair value when the group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument, with movements reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
The group does not use hedge accounting for its forward foreign currency contracts and does not use forward foreign currency 
contracts for speculative purposes.
2.9.1 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; 
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
The convertible loan notes are accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: presentation’ and split between debt and 
equity based upon the market rate of similar loans not carrying conversion options.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2011
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.9.2 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. They are 
recognised on the trade date of the related transactions. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
2.9.3 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held with banks.
2.9.4 Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their amortised cost. They are recognised on the trade date of the related transactions.
2.10 Share-based payments
Options and warrants are measured at fair value at grant date using the binomial model. The fair value is expensed on a straight line 
basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options or warrants that will eventually vest.
Under the group’s share option scheme, share options are granted to directors and selected employees and under the share warrant 
schemes, warrants are granted to selected customers. The options and warrants are expensed in the period over which the share based 
payment vests. A corresponding increase to the share option reserve or share warrant reserve under shareholder’s funds is recognised.
When share options or warrants are exercised, the company issues new shares. The nominal share value from the proceeds received 
are credited to share capital and proceeds received above nominal value, net of attributable transaction costs are credited to the 
share premium when the options or warrants are exercised. When share options or warrants are forfeited, cancelled or expire, the 
corresponding fair value is transferred to the accumulated losses reserve.
The group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
2.11 Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The Group operates only defined contribution schemes and pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance 
plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
The amount charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement 
benefits is the contributions payable in the period. Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually 
paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Statements of Financial Position.
2.12 Revenue
Revenue comprises the consideration receivable for services provided, software usage fees and royalty income. Revenue is shown net of 
value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group.
2.12.1 Sales of services
The group sells design, development and other services relating to the media production and packaging industries. These services are 
provided either on a time and material basis or as a fixed price contract.
Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised as labour hours and direct expenses are incurred, at the contracted rates.
Revenue from fixed price contracts is recognised in accordance with the substance of the contract as services are performed by the 
group and accepted by the customer.
If circumstances arise that may change the original estimates of revenue and costs or extent of progress toward completion, estimates are 
revised. These revisions resulting in increases or decreases in the estimated revenues and costs are reflected in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known to management.
2.12.2 Software license fees

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.12.3 Royalty income
Under IAS18 royalties are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement. Based on the 
substance of the contract agreements, revenue is recognised to match with estimated sales. Estimates of expected sales are reviewed at 
each year end date.
2.13 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all direct costs incurred and attributable production 
overheads. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price allowing for all further costs of completion and disposal.
2.14 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis 
over the term of the lease.
Leases of equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance 
leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance 
outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings. The interest element of the 
finance cost is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the lease period so as to produce a constant 
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The equipment acquired under finance leases is 
depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
2.15 Deferred taxation
Deferred tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided in full using the Statement of Financial Position liability method. 
Deferred tax is the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities shown on the consolidated and parent company Statement of Financial Position. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if they arise in the following situations; the initial recognition of goodwill; or the initial recognition of assets and liabilities 
that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of recovery or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the year end date.
The group does not recognise deferred tax liabilities, or deferred tax assets, on temporary differences associated with investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as it is not considered probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each year end date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
2.16 Government grants
Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and 
the group will comply with all attached conditions.
Government grants relating to operating costs are deferred and recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 
over the period necessary to match them with the costs they are intended to compensate.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are credited to the cost of the asset and released to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the expected lives of the related assets.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2011
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.17 Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the group’s financial performance. The transactions giving rise to exceptional items are the gains and losses on 
disposal of operations and the discontinuation of activities, including the decisions not to continue certain development projects.
3. Accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
3.1 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal 
the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the year end date. The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been 
estimated based on value in use calculations. Value in use calculations have been based on a subjective pre-tax discount rate of 8%. No 
impairment loss incurred at this discount rate. Had the discount rate used been 1% greater or lower than estimated, there still would be 
no material impact on impairment.
Financial Instruments
Discounted cash flow analysis is used to determine the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded on the open market. The 
non-traded financial instrument is the convertible loan note. Calculations have been based on a subjective pre-tax discount rate of 
8%. Had the discount rate used been 1% greater or lower than estimated, the fair value would have been decreased by $155,000, or 
increased by $165,000 respectively.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be 
available in the future against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted. Where the temporary differences related to 
unused tax losses, evidence considered to support the recognition of deferred tax assets include the existence of relevant taxable profits 
in the current and preceding periods and in the period after the reporting date and expectations of profits in the future. Recognition 
therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred 
tax asset has been recognised.
Accounting estimates for the useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are included within the relevant 
accounting policies above.
3.2 Critical judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies
Operating lease commitments
The group has entered into property leases for its Sheffield and Los Angeles offices. As management have determined that the group 
has not obtained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the property, the lease has been classified as an operating lease 
and accounted for accordingly.
4. Segmental reporting
Business segments
At 31 March 2011, the group is organised on a worldwide basis into two main business segments:
— Software solutions, including development, consultancy and software sales
— Media production and design
These divisions are the basis on which the group reports its segment information. Other group operations comprise of head office 
operations.

During the year ended 31 March 2010 changes in market expectations led to a management decision not to continue certain 
development projects acquired through the purchase of Scope Seven LLC. The amount of this impairment was $797,000 and this is 
included within ‘Exceptional impairment losses on other intangible assets’, the balance being in respect of cancelled patents (note 16).
This item is considered exceptional by virtue of its size and omission of its disclosure would not give a fair presentation of the group’s 
financial position and performance.

Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill 
is allocated to the group’s cash generating units (CGUs) identified according to the business segment. The aggregation of assets for 
identifying the cash generating units has not changed since the prior year.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is its value in use. In calculating the value in use the group used a discount rate of 8% (2010: 8%). 
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated as follows:
 Software Solutions Media Production Group
      2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010
      $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 $000
      2,281 2,281 1,709 1,709 3,990 3,990
Following the impairment tests, goodwill was considered not to be impaired.
Management has based its pre-tax cash flow projections on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period. 
Cash flows after the three year period have been extrapolated based on estimated growth rates disclosed below. Management 
determined the budgets on past performance and its expectations of market development.

19. Trade and other receivables continued
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of trade receivables, other debtors and cash and cash 
equivalents. The group does not hold any collateral as security.

unprovided amounts are considered to be recoverable.
The amounts owed by the subsidiary undertakings to the parent company, have no payment terms and bear no interest, but they are 
considered to be recoverable in the future.

In arriving at the fair value, each option grant has been valued separately using the binomial model and the resulting fair value is 
expensed over the vesting period. The following table lists the range of assumptions used in the model:
         2008 Jun 2010 Dec 2010
Expected Volatility (%)      100 73 76
Risk-free Interest rate (%)       4.49   2.65   2.13 
Expected life of option (years)      5 5 5
Expected dividends       none none none
Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the company’s share price over a three year period up to the date of 
grant of the options. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Share warrants
Share warrants have been granted under the following schemes to subscribe for ordinary shares of the company. 
Scheme 1
Under this scheme the percentage of shares that can be exercised is staggered over the exercise period based on cumulative cash 
received from the Warrant holder.

exercise price of $0.77 (50p)
In arriving at the fair value, the share warrants have been valued using the binomial model and the resulting fair value is expensed over

Market Risk
Foreign currency risk
The main risks arising from the group’s financial instruments are from foreign currency risk.
The group includes subsidiaries operating in both the UK and USA. The majority of the group’ transactions are denominated in US 
dollars, however the costs arising from the UK subsidiaries are denominated in pound sterling therefore exposing it to a currency risk of 
fluctuations in the pound sterling/US Dollar exchange rate. During the year ended 31 March 2011 there was less volatility in the pound 
sterling/US Dollar rate than in the previous years with the rate peaking at 0.7023 and falling to a low of 0.6097, with an average rate 
of 0.6424. If the US Dollar had remained at its highest level throughout the full year the group would have shown a post-tax profit of 
$514,000 (2010: Loss $230,000), if US Dollar had been at its lowest level throughout the full year the group would have shown a post-
tax loss of $863,000 (2010: Loss $1.3m) and if the US Dollar had remained at the average rate throughout the year the post-tax loss 
would have been $334,000 (2010: Loss $894,000).
Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries are in US Dollars, however the company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 
due to the majority of its costs being denominated in pound sterling and through the revaluation of the company’s pound sterling 
creditors.
The main exposure for the group and the company to fluctuation in the pound sterling/US dollar rate is through the Convertible loan 
note creditor which is denominated in pound sterling. The value of the loan is translated at the year end exchange rate.
To mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in pound sterling/US dollar exchange rate the group entered into four forward foreign currency 
exchange contracts during the year to the value of $750,000 (2010: nil). No forward exchange contracts were outstanding at 31 March 
2011 (2010: nil). The group does not apply hedge accounting to its financial statements, and therefore accounts for contracts at their 
fair value at the balance sheet date.

for the year ended 31 March 2011
28. Financial instruments continued
At 31 March 2011 the aggregate amount of profit during the year from the forward currency exchange contracts was $18,000  
(2010: nil).
The pound sterling/US dollar exchange rate at the 31 March 2011 was 0.6228 (2010: 06589)
Interest rate risk
In September 2006 the company issued $5,062,000 (£3,541,000) Unsecured convertible redeemable loan stock, which matures on  
31 October 2011. The loan carries a fixed interest rate of 6%. The group and company consider the interest rate risk on the loan to  
be minimal as the rate is fixed. The company also has access to an overdraft facility of $800,000 through its bank, which carries an 
interest rate of 2.75% over the bank’s base rate.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group and company will not be able to meet their financial obligations as they fall due. Management monitors 
rolling forecasts of the group’ s cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows, reducing its liquidity risk through management 
of bank accounts, trade debtors and trade creditors, by utilising the availability of finance leases and through controls on expenditure. The 
majority of convertible loan stock is owned by major shareholders of the company.
The tables below analyse the financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the 
remaining period at the year end to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted 
cash flows.

Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and credit exposures on outstanding receivables. The group’s and company’s main 
credit risks are on the outstanding trade receivables. This risk is reduced through credit control procedures. An analysis of outstanding 
receivables is included in note 19.
29. Capital management
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and 
services commensurately with the level of risk.
The group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the 
light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital 
structure, the group may return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt 
divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including ‘current and non-current borrowings’ as shown in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position plus net debt.

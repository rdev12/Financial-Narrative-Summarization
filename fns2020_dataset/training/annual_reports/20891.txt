3 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
POSITIONING 
FOR THE FUTURE
Company and our management 
have been well prepared to meet 
the challenges ahead. I look forward 
to his continued support, not 
only of the Group, but also in the 
development of the mining industry 
in Chile in his new role as President 
of Sonami.
A RESPONSIBLE 
PARTNER IN THE 
COMMUNITY
As we work to reduce our cost 
base we must do so in a way 
that reflects our responsibilities 
to the communities – and the 
environment – in which we operate. 
I am delighted therefore with 
the demonstrable progress that 
Antofagasta has made to strengthen 
its community relations during 
2016. Chief among these is the 
agreement we reached in April with 
the Caimanes community which led 
to the resolution of two court cases 
relating to the Mauro tailings dam. 
Los Pelambres and the Antofagasta 
Group now move into a new era of 
community engagement.
Dear shareholders,
Over the course of 2016 we saw 
copper prices begin to stage a 
recovery from the lows at the 
beginning of the year and this has 
continued into 2017. While this 
is undoubtedly good news, we 
must be careful as an industry 
to guard against falling back 
into complacency.
Despite considerable efforts – the 
industry still has further to go 
in order to put costs back on a 
sustainable footing.
At Antofagasta, our response to 
these challenges has been to renew 
our focus on producing profitable 
tonnes. This is an essential strand in 
our strategy to ensure our business 
will generate positive free cash flow 
through the cycle and generate 
decent returns on the capital we 
invest. Our employees have worked 
hard over the last 12 months to 
improve the Company’s operating 
performance and reliability, 
achieving some notable milestones. 
The Antucoya mine successfully 
reached full production capacity 
during 2016 and the Zaldívar 
mine, in which we acquired a 50% 
interest in December 2015, was 
fully integrated into our operations 
during the year.
As a result of these efforts, over the 
course of 2016 costs have come 
down, productivity improved and 
copper production has grown to 
almost 710,000 tonnes. While we 
anticipate prices will be stronger 
in 2017 than in 2016, we must 
continue to implement our strategy 
of reducing costs sustainably 
and producing only profitable 
tonnes in a way that benefits all of 
our stakeholders.
AN IMPORTANT 
PILLAR IN CHILE’S 
DEVELOPMENT
Despite the fall in prices over the 
last few years, the copper industry 
in Chile still has a vital role to play 
both in the country’s development 
and in the global markets. While 
I believe that Chile needs to continue 
to diversify its economy as the 
country raises living standards for 
all, we must not lose sight of the 
very important role that the copper 
industry has to play.
I believe that copper remains a 
central pillar in Chile’s development. 
The industry contributed some 8% 
of Chile’s gross domestic product 
last year. Approximately 50% of 
this is reinvested back in to Chile’s 
economy, securing jobs, supporting 
local businesses and helping to 
create the prosperity which drives 
the country’s development. The 
industry contributed $3 billion in 
taxes during 2015, allowing the 
government to invest in education, 
social housing, roads, rail and other 
vital infrastructure.
If managed properly, copper will 
have a long-term role to play in 
Chile’s development. The country 
still has 30% of global copper 
reserves. With the right incentives 
in place and working with all the 
stakeholders involved – employees, 
communities, companies, 
shareholders and local and regional 
government – we can develop these 
reserves safely and to the benefit of 
future generations of Chileans.
WELCOMING OUR 
NEW CEO
In April 2016 we welcomed 
Iván Arriagada as CEO of the 
Antofagasta Group. He has over 
25 years of operating and financial 
experience in the mining and oil and 
gas industries, including leading the 
Group’s mining division since early 
in 2015. Iván is the right person 
to succeed Diego Hernández, 
having worked closely with him 
in the preceding year. His focus 
on cost discipline and operating 
performance has proven very 
effective in navigating the current 
challenge of low copper prices. His 
strong commitment and leadership 
of our expansion initiatives has 
enhanced our ability to grow 
profitable production in the future.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to take this opportunity to thank 
Diego for his commitment and 
dedication over these past four 
years. Under his leadership the

4 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 NEW LEASE OF LIFE 
FOR MICHILLA
Last year we announced the closure 
of Antofagasta’s first mine, Michilla. 
As I said at the time, this was an 
important moment both for the 
Company and for me personally 
– Michilla was the mine where 
I completed my first internship 
when I was just 18 years old. 
I am delighted that during 2016 we 
found a new owner for the mine, 
another Chilean mining company, 
which will be able to continue its 
operations and help secure jobs in 
the region.
SAFETY
The safety of our employees and 
the communities in which we work 
is our number one priority. Our 
target is to achieve zero fatalities 
at our operations. Therefore 
I regret to report that during 2016 
Antofagasta had two fatalities. On 
behalf of the Board – and myself – 
I would like to express our sincere 
condolences to the families of our 
departed colleagues. 
BOARD CHANGES
During the year Hugo Dryland 
retired from his position as Non-
Executive Director of the Company, 
a position he has held since 2011. 
I would like to thank Hugo for his 
valuable insights and guidance on 
a wide range of matters and for the 
significant contribution he made 
to the Company during his time 
on the Board. Hugo was replaced 
by Francisca Castro, who brings 
with her extensive experience in 
mining, energy and finance, in 
Chile – where she has worked 
for the government and Codelco 
– and internationally. I know her 
knowledge and expertise will be of 
great benefit to Antofagasta.
In August we announced that Ollie 
Oliveira, a Non-Executive Director of 
Antofagasta, was appointed Senior 
Independent Director. Ollie took over 
from Bill Hayes who remains on the 
Board. We also made several other 
changes to the Board committees 
with Ollie taking over as Chairman 
of the Audit and Risk Committee, 
and Vivianne Blanlot as Chairman of 
the Sustainability and Stakeholder 
Management Committee.
OUTLOOK
We made good progress in 2016, 
reducing costs and increasing 
production as the full impact from 
the new assets in our portfolio 
flowed through. This led to a 
strong end to the year, which was 
boosted by a marked strengthening 
in copper prices on higher than 
expected Chinese demand.
As we look ahead into 2017 we see 
a market which is more driven by 
supply considerations than demand 
factors, some of them short term. 
This may result in more supply 
disruptions than originally expected 
and the year ending in balance, 
or possibly in deficit. In any event 
the market should be in balance in 
2018 and in 2019 we expect to see 
supply constraints come through in 
the market as the impact of project 
deferrals is felt in the global market.
So, although prices and sentiment 
are improving, some of the 
challenges we have seen in the 
market over the last two or three 
years are expected to continue over 
the next 12 months. We are now 
seeing the return of inflationary 
pressures on input prices and this is 
one reason we remain committed to 
our strategy of reducing costs and 
putting them on a sustainably lower 
footing, producing profitable tonnes 
and delivering positive free cash 
flow through the cycle. With this 
approach we will maintain healthy 
margins during periods of lower 
prices and safeguard our financial 
strength to the benefit of all of our 
stakeholders – our employees, 
communities, shareholders and the 
government. This in turn sets us up 
well to take full advantage of any 
upturn in the market.
As a final note I would like to thank 
all of our employees and managers 
for their continued hard work. 
I look forward to 2017 and beyond 
with a greater degree of optimism 
than I have had for some years.

IVÁN ARRIAGADA, CEO
 You took over as CEO in 2016 – how would you describe 
your first year?
It has been an exciting year, both for me personally and for the Company. 
Taking over as CEO of Antofagasta was a very proud moment for me. 
Since taking up the role I have been working hard with the team at 
Antofagasta, putting people and safety first, focusing on improving our 
operating efficiency and rebasing our cost structure. I am convinced that 
improvements in productivity are key for the long term success of the 
Company and that we should regard them as an on-going process and part 
of the culture of Antofagasta.
We will always look for ways to improve what we do, irrespective of the 
copper price environment. In addition, we progressed down a path of 
constructive and transparent engagement with the communities around 
Los Pelambres, resolving the court cases relating to the Mauro tailings 
dam, overcoming what has been a very important challenge to us. This 
confirmed our belief that we can drive value creation for us and our 
stakeholders by the way in which we address and find solutions to social 
and environmental challenges. One of the things that first attracted me to 
Antofagasta was its long history of entrepreneurialism. The Company has 
grown from a single mine site at Michilla into one of the world’s largest 
copper producers and a major contributor to Chile’s economy. We still seek 
opportunities for innovation and 2016 saw us work hard to improve our 
operations, sustainably reducing costs and maximising the extraction of 
profitable tonnes.
While there is more to do, I’m pleased with what we’ve achieved in 2016. 
Costs have come down, productivity and efficiency has improved and our 
copper production rose. Against a challenging backdrop we’ve maintained 
our focus on sustaining the foundations of our business that underpin our 
ability to provide stable, long-term returns to our shareholders.

STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
9 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK  What were the operating 
highlights during the year? 
Can you talk us through some 
of the numbers for 2016?
I think it was in 2016 that we 
really started to see the underlying 
performance of our operations 
begin to come through in our 
production numbers as we achieved 
copper production of 709,400 
tonnes, an increase of 12.5% 
compared to 2015. While this was 
in part driven by higher production 
at Centinela, it also reflected 
development milestones being 
achieved at Antucoya and the full 
integration of Zaldívar. Importantly 
Antucoya reached full production 
capacity during 2016 with 
significant progress with the dust 
issues having been achieved and 
Zaldívar contributed its first full year 
of production, adding to the Group 
51,700 tonnes of copper cathode 
production during the year.
At Los Pelambres production fell 
slightly versus 2015, primarily due 
to lower throughput as a greater 
proportion of harder ore was 
processed in the plant. For me, this 
reduction in ore quality underlines 
the real need to focus on operating 
improvements and productivity, 
which are the key drivers behind 
Antofagasta’s efforts to reduce 
costs sustainably and consistently 
into the future.
Q
Occasionally, this means we have 
to make tough choices. As you 
know, during the year a significant 
forecast construction cost overrun 
was announced at the Alto Maipo 
hydroelectric project, in which 
Los Pelambres held a 40% 
interest, at a time when long-term 
electricity prices in Chile had been 
falling dramatically. We reviewed 
our options and concluded that it 
would be best for Antofagasta if we 
disposed of our interest to benefit 
from lower future sustainable 
energy costs for Los Pelambres. 
Actions like these are part of our 
efforts to bring down the cost base. 
And the success of our decision to 
concentrate the Group’s efforts in 
2016 on operating and capital cost 
control has been another highlight 
of the year. Improved productivity 
and efficiencies have also begun to 
bear fruit. As a result of our efforts 
on costs, combined with increased 
production and lower input prices, 
we’ve been able to reduce our net 
cash costs by 20% year-on-year, to 
average $1.20/lb in 2016. 
Away from our core copper 
production, gold production was 
270,900 ounces, 26.6% higher than 
in 2015, reflecting better grades and 
throughput at Centinela. Additionally, 
as expected, molybdenum 
production saw a 3,000 tonne 
decrease for the full year as grades 
and recoveries fell. Our transport 
division saw increased customer 
demand and improved performance 
of the rolling stock and better fleet 
utilisation, all contributing to a 6.3% 
increase in transported volume to 
6.5 million tonnes.
The Board has recommended a 
final dividend for the year of 15.3 
cents per share, bringing the total 
dividend for the year to 18.4 cents 
per share or $182 million. This 
represents a total pay out ratio of 
53% of net earnings, significantly 
in excess of the Company’s policy 
of paying out a minimum of 35% of 
underlying net earnings.

During 2016 the Group 
created a new operating model 
throughout its operations, with 
the objective of strengthening 
key processes and achieving full 
production commitments.
The model improves operating 
reliability and releases latent 
capacity, resulting in a competitive 
advantage for the Group’s 
mining operations. It has been 
supported by:
1. Operations – streamlining 
operations to focus on safety, 
production and costs. During 
the year the Group conducted 
a simplification exercise to 
prioritise core functions carried 
out by the operations and 
established a solid support 
structure at Group level to assist 
operations in other activities.
2. Maintenance – ensuring in-
house capability and expertise 
on maintenance issues within 
the Group. Maintenance 
managers were appointed at all 
operations, with responsibility 
for overseeing all maintenance 
activity conducted by the Group 
and its contractors. They will 
share the lessons learned in 
other operations to establish 
more efficient, standardised 
maintenance practices across 
the Group.
3. Planning – focusing on near-term 
and medium-term mine planning 
in a single area, with the full 
life of the operation in mind. A 
new control and reconciliation 
function encourages adherence 
to plan, reducing the variability 
of and deviation from production 
plans to achieve maximum 
potential performance.
4. Operating Excellence – 
supporting continuous 
improvement by implementing 
standardised practices and 
sharing experiences to ensure 
that all operations work within an 
established framework regarding 
support services, asset integrity 
and engineering standards.
 We hear a lot from mining 
companies on the subject 
of innovation – how has 
Antofagasta added value 
through innovation?
We have been making some 
important progress over 2016 which 
are associated to real innovation. 
As I said earlier the entrepreneurial 
spirit is a core element of 
Antofagasta’s character. Let me 
provide you with a couple of recent 
examples where our innovations 
Q
have improved plant efficiency and 
saved money.
At Centinela we have finally 
commissioned three new paste 
thickeners, which represent a new 
water saving technology on the 
biggest scale yet seen in copper 
mining. They play a big role, not 
only in improving our efficient use 
of water, but also enabling us to 
run the plant at our new increased 
throughput capacity of 105,000 
tonnes per day.
Elsewhere we have been working 
on developing partnerships 
with technology and specialist 
engineering companies to improve 
our training and safety systems. 
At Antucoya we have been 
trialling a state-of-the-art 360˚ 
training simulator for operators 
of our trucks, shovels and other 
mining equipment with the aim 
of eliminating accidents through 
loss of vehicle control. We’ve also 
installed Collision Alert Systems in 
all of our mining trucks at Centinela 
and Antucoya and will roll this out 
across the rest of the operations 
in 2017.
These are just a few of the 
ways that we are deploying new 
technologies and procedures to 
reduce our running costs, boost 
plant uptime and improve safety 
across our operations.

We produce copper responsibly and 
profitably, putting people and safety 
first and working closely with our 
local communities to ensure that our 
mines are developed sustainably. 
Our aim is to work in partnership 
with all of our stakeholders to 
provide jobs, prosperity and 
opportunities to not just the local 
population, but Chile as a whole. 
Our belief is that this is the best 
approach to ensure our continued 
ability to deliver stable, long-term 
returns to our shareholders.
Q
During 2016 we made an important 
step towards putting our relations 
with the Caimanes community at 
Los Pelambres on a sustainable 
future. We reached a settlement 
of the outstanding court cases 
concerning the Mauro tailings 
dam. As a result the Company is 
now proceeding with the plans 
agreed with the community and 
courts as regards the future water 
supply solutions, additional safety 
measures, community development 
projects, and to provide access 
to benefits for families in 
the community.
STATEMENT FROM THE CEO CONTINUED
SAFETY REMAINS OUR 
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY
IVÁN ARRIAGADA, CEO
 What will your focus for 
safety be in 2017?
Safety remains our number one 
priority. During the course of 2016 
Antofagasta tragically suffered 
a fatal accident at Antucoya in 
April and a further fatality at our 
transport division in July. I, with 
everyone at Antofagasta, offer 
my sincerest condolences to the 
affected families and friends.
It is not acceptable that we still have 
fatalities and we are determined to 
achieve our target of zero fatalities. 
While overall our safety standards 
have improved I am redoubling 
Q
Antofagasta takes steps right at the 
beginning of an employee’s training to 
improve their knowledge of accident risk 
and avoidance. Key to this approach is the 
use of virtual reality Safety and Health 
Inductions, using a system of lenses and 
mobile devices to create realistic 360° 
images of operating sites. This allows 
employees to learn in the most tangible 
way how to assess the risk of accidents or 
fatalities in particular situations and the 
use of critical controls.
VIRTUAL REALITY USED FOR 
SAFETY AND HEALTH 
INDUCTIONS
our efforts to ensure that all of our 
employees and contractors live in 
a culture of safety every day. We 
are building on our programme 
of 2016, including enhancing our 
Critical Safety Controls verifications 
and “near-miss” incidence 
reporting. Our executive team 
continues to visit the Group’s mining 
operations regularly as part of 
our safety leadership programme, 
demonstrating to employees and 
contractors the importance of safety 
and empowering employees to 
ensure safety comes first.
12 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Nordea Asset Management (NAM) 
is the largest asset manager in the 
Nordics, with over €200 billion 
under management. As part of 
its mission statement – Returns 
with Responsibility – it believes 
that companies incorporating 
environmental and social 
considerations into their business 
strategies represent better long-
term investment opportunities. After 
several conference calls discussing 
financial and non-financial results 
over several months, the NAM 
Responsible Investments team 
decided to conduct a site visit to 
the Group’s mining operations. 
Nordea performs site visits to 
develop an in-depth on the ground 
knowledge of how companies are 
addressing Environmental, Social 
and Governance (“ESG”) issues 
and to further understand how 
companies are achieving their goals. 
Nordea also develops short videos 
for their clients to explain how 
companies approach sustainability 
issues. In October 2016, two Nordea 
analysts and their cameraman 
toured the Los Pelambres and 
Centinela operations, meeting 
several employees and members of 
senior management during 
their three-day visit.
They also met community members, 
including representatives from the 
Caimanes community, and visited 
the tailings storage facility at El 
Mauro. This included an overnight 
stay at the campsite, a tour of 
the mine and the opportunity to 
appreciate the absolute importance 
of safety. 
At Centinela, they visited the 
thermosolar plant and the innovative 
thickened tailings deposit system 
pioneered by the Group. In addition 
to the mining operations, they 
toured the equally progressive sea 
water pumping facilities, where 
the Group is the first company in 
the world to use sea water without 
desalination in a large-scale copper 
mining process.
Sustainable development is an 
essential component of the Group’s 
business model. The Group 
is committed to the continual 
assessment and improvement of 
safety, health, environmental and 
social performance across all of 
its operations. 
The Nordea visit was an excellent 
opportunity to showcase the Group’s 
progress and achievements and to 
demonstrate how it is addressing 
challenges in ESG matters. It was 
also the result of regular dialogue 
with the Company’s shareholders 
on the importance of issues such 
as safety, community relations and 
the environment.
The ultimate purpose of this visit was to 
establish whether Antofagasta would be 
investable for the Nordea Star Funds. Before 
the equity investment team can invest in these 
companies, they need to be approved by the RI 
team from an ESG point of view. After we got 
home, we assessed all the information that we 
had gathered during our visit, and concluded 
that Antofagasta plc is investable for the 
Nordea Star Funds and we have subsequently 
become a shareholder.
Our approval was based on the business 
model, where copper plays an important part 
in the transition to a low-carbon economy, and 
on the management of ESG issues, which we 
ﬁ nd acceptable, given that mining is a high 
risk sector.

GLOBAL COPPER SUPPLY AND DEMAND
 You speak to end users in key 
markets like China. What is 
your sense of prices for the 
year ahead and the outlook 
for 2017 and beyond?
I do meet our customers on various 
occasions during the year when I 
am in China or at the LME Week in 
London. What has surprised many 
over the last year, and particularly 
in the final quarter of 2016, was the 
uptick we saw in copper demand 
and the expectation that this would 
continue. This year has started 
strongly, bolstered by the continued 
improvement in sentiment towards 
copper and the production problems 
at some of the biggest copper 
mines. It seems that we are now in 
a reflationary environment and this 
is positive for commodities. As many 
Q
continue to adjust their forecasts 
for China, we are confident that 
consumption there will continue to 
grow as they support their power 
and infrastructure requirements. 
The higher level of mine disruptions 
we are experiencing since the 
beginning of the year should 
keep pressure on refined copper 
availability and support the 
fundamentals for copper in the 
months to come. As a result we do 
not see copper returning to the lows 
of 2016.
Beyond that we expect to see 
a steady shift from a market in 
balance to a slight deficit, leading 
to a further improvement in prices. 
There are wild cards of course, but 
these are more likely to be positive 
for the copper price than negative. 
Potential higher demand in the US 
under the new administration is 
one, increased disruptions to supply 
is another.
But the key lesson our industry 
has learnt over the last few years, 
and one that Antofagasta has now 
embedded in the way that we do 
business, is that we must maintain 
our cost discipline through the 
cycle, not just at our operations 
but also in how and when we 
invest capital. Only by doing this 
will we ensure that our operations 
continue to generate cash, defend 
our margins and deliver sustainable 
returns for all of our stakeholders.
This is why, as I look into 2017, 
my focus will continue to be on 
improving our operating efficiencies 
and reducing our costs sustainably 
while continuing to work on our 
options for growth. As I said at 
the beginning of our conversation, 
Antofagasta was established 
and grew quickly because of its 
entrepreneurial spirit, and I want 
to embed that dynamism and 
innovation further in the Company. 
What gives me optimism about 
the future is how far we’ve 
come over the past few years. 
Antofagasta is focused on the 
responsible production of profitable 
tonnes in a way that benefits all 
of our employees, communities, 
government, fellow citizens, and 
of course, our shareholders.
IVÁN ARRIAGADA
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
14 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 REFINED COPPER
2016 MARKET 
PERFORMANCE
The average LME copper price 
during 2016 was $2.21/lb, an 11.6% 
decrease compared with the 2015 
average. Prices were expected 
to remain low during 2016 as the 
market priced in lower growth for 
key markets such as China, and 
this reduced investment in the 
sector depressed the copper price 
even though the market was in 
balance or showing only a small 
surplus during the year. However, 
by the fourth quarter of 2016 
China was consuming at a much 
higher rate than expected and in 
October announced that it would 
continue its programme of fiscal 
stimulus into 2017. This, combined 
with a reflationary and stimulatory 
acceptance speech by President-
elect Trump, led to a rally in the 
price of copper, which finished the 
year strongly at over $2.50/lb.
Global mine production accounts 
for some 82% of total refined 
supply and grew during the year 
as new production came on 
stream, particularly from Peru. In 
addition, fewer supply disruptions 
occurred during the year, which 
led to more copper in the market. 
The balance of supply comes from 
secondary sources, particularly in 
the form of scrap, the availability 
of which declined as falling prices 
led to lower rates of recycling and 
some scrap dealers limited their 
trading activities.
On the demand side, the most 
important market is China, which 
accounted for approximately 47% of 
global copper consumption in 2016. 
Europe and North America also 
remain the key consumers at 17% 
and 8% respectively. An estimated 
15-25% of Chinese consumption 
is re-exported in products 
manufactured in China.
The Group’s average realised price 
in 2016 was above the average 
LME price, reflecting a net positive 
provisional pricing adjustment of 
$153.6 million for the year.
MARKET OUTLOOK
The general consensus is that the 
market will show a small surplus in 
2017. An unexpectedly high level of 
supply disruptions early in the year 
may move this small surplus to a 
small deficit. However, from 2018 
the market will tighten as supply is 
constrained by lack of investment 
as greenfield and brownfield 
projects across the world have been 
postponed while demand continues 
to grow. Demand growth will 
continue to be linked to expected 
Chinese consumption.
In early 2017, the consensus price 
forecast for the year was $2.45/lb, 
11% higher than in 2016 based on 
expected higher consumption from 
China and possible supply-side 
disruptions arising from contested 
labour negotiations in Chile, which 
produces about one-third of the 
world’s copper.
COPPER CONCENTRATE
2016 MARKET 
PERFORMANCE
There was good demand for 
copper concentrates during the 
year, and spot treatment and 
refining charges (“TC/RCs”) 
traded below the benchmark 
price for annual contracts. 
As new mines ramped up 
production, particularly in Peru, 
new smelters came on stream in 
China absorbing this production. 
Further increases in Chinese 
smelting capacity are expected in 
2017 and 2018.
MARKET OUTLOOK
Benchmark TC/RCs for 2016 
have been agreed at $92.50 per 
dry metric tonne of concentrate 
and 9.25c/lb of refined copper. 
This rate is some 5% lower than 
the benchmark set for 2016 and 
reflects a tighter market and 
increased smelter capacity.
GOLD
The average annual gold price 
increased by more than 7% in 
2016, peaking in July at $1,366/
oz. Macroeconomic events such 
as Brexit, rising interest rates in 
the US and uncertainty related to 
Chinese growth all impacted the 
price of gold, which is considered 
a safe haven investment. Prices 
in the second half of the year 
were further impacted by 
demonetisation in India which 
caused a fall in demand in 
traditionally strong months.
Gold averaged $1,248/oz in 2016 
compared with $1,160/oz in 2015 
and closed the year at $1,148/oz. 
The consensus price forecast for 
2017 is $1,302/oz.
MOLYBDENUM
Molybdenum prices rebounded 
in 2016 after reaching their 
lowest levels for 12 years in 
2015 due to lower demand from 
the steel industry and increased 
mine supply. The price averaged 
$6.5/lb for the year compared 
with $6.7/lb in 2015, and the 
consensus is it will remain 
around this level in 2017.

RISK 
MANAGEMENT
COMPLIANCE
The Group’s risk and compliance management 
framework can be divided into three tiers:
Communicating the Group’s vision, strategy 
and objectives throughout the organisation, 
and putting in place appropriate governance 
structures, policies and procedures to embed 
key aims and objectives.
Ensuring that there are structures and processes 
in place to identify and evaluate risks, and 
developing appropriate controls and mitigation 
techniques to address those risks.
Ensuring that key risks, and performance in 
managing those risks, are reported on a timely 
basis to the relevant parties.
Ensuring that the Group adheres to internal 
policies, procedures and controls, as well as all 
relevant laws and regulations.
The Risk and Compliance Management 
Department is responsible for risk and 
compliance management systems across the 
Group. It maintains the Group’s risk register, 
which specifies the strategic risks that 
represent the most significant threats to the 
Group’s performance and achievement of its 
strategy, along with any necessary mitigation 
activities. The risk register is regularly updated 
and annual strategic risk workshops are held 
at which senior management from across the 
business review the Group’s key strategic risks 
and related mitigation activities. The Risk and 
Compliance Management Department reports 
quarterly to the Audit and Risk Committee on 
the overall risk management process, giving a 
detailed update of key risks, mitigation activities 
and actions being taken.
The General Managers of each of the 
operations have overall responsibility for 
leading and supporting risk management. 
“Risk Champions” within each operation have 
direct responsibility for the risk management 
processes in their operations and for the 
continuous update of individual business 
risk registers, including relevant mitigation 
activities. The owners of the risks and controls 
at each business unit are identified, providing 
effective and direct management of risk. Each 
operation holds its own annual risk workshop 
in which the business unit’s risks and mitigation 
activities are reviewed in detail and updated 
if necessary. Workshops are also used to 
assess key risks that may affect relationships 
with stakeholders, limit resources, interrupt 
operations and/or negatively affect potential 
future growth. Mitigation techniques for 
significant strategic and business unit risks are 
annually reviewed by the Risk and Compliance 
Management Department.
The Board regularly reviews Group compliance 
with all relevant laws and regulations, internal 
policies, procedures and control activities. A 
formal risk assessment is conducted at least 
once a year at all the Group’s operations, and 
all risks are reported and reviewed quarterly by 
the Audit and Risk Committee.
RISK MANAGEMENT
 See page 88 for more information on our risk management practises
The Board is responsible for determining the 
nature and extent of the significant risks that 
the Group will accept in order to achieve its 
strategic objectives, and for maintaining sound 
risk management and internal control systems. 
The Board receives detailed analysis of key 
matters for consideration in advance of Board 
meetings. This includes reports on the Group’s 
operating performance, including safety and 
health, financial, environmental, legal and social 
matters, key developments in the Group’s 
exploration, project and business development 
activities, information on the commodity 
markets, updates on talent management and 
analysis of financial investments. The provision 
of this information allows the early identification 
of potential issues and assessment of any 
necessary mitigating actions.
The Audit and Risk Committee assists 
the Board by reviewing the effectiveness of the 
risk management process and monitoring key 
risks and mitigation procedures. The Chairman 
of the Audit and Risk Committee reports to 
the Board following each Committee meeting 
and, if necessary, the Board can discuss the 
matters raised in more detail.
These processes allow the Board to monitor 
effectively the Group’s major risks and 
mitigation procedures, and to assess the 
acceptable level of risk arising from the 
Group’s operations and development activities. 
Risk management reports are sent to 
the Board quarterly.
The Code of Ethics sets out the Group’s 
commitment to undertaking business in a 
responsible and transparent manner. The Code 
requires honesty, integrity and accountability 
from all employees and contractors and 
includes guidelines for identifying and managing 
potential conflicts of interest. An Ethics 
Committee comprising members of senior 
management implements, develops and updates 
the Code and monitors compliance. The Code 
and other compliance matters form part of the 
induction programme for all new employees.

COMPLIANCE
The Group’s Compliance Model applies to 
both employees and contractors. It is clearly 
defined and is communicated regularly 
through internal communication channels, 
as well as being available on the Group’s 
website. All contracts with contractors include 
clauses relating to ethics, modern slavery and 
crime prevention to ensure adherence to the 
Group’s Compliance Model.
The Compliance Model comprises five pillars:
1
 THE CODE OF ETHICS 
This code sets out the Group’s values and 
provides guidelines on behaviour for all 
employees and contractors.
 − Code of Ethics
 − Conflict of Interest Guidelines
 − Gifts and Hospitality Guidelines
 − Modern Slavery Act
 − Monitoring effectiveness of programme
 − Annual Statement
 Please see our Modern Slavery 
Statement on page 59.

  THE CRIME PREVENTION 
MODEL 
This model ensures compliance with the 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in the 
United Kingdom and Chile. The Vice President 
of Finance and Administration is responsible 
for overseeing, defining and implementing 
the model. As part of the model, the Group 
regularly undertakes the following activities: 
 − Training on key risk areas (ethics, 
anti-corruption, modern slavery and 
antitrust matters)
 − Investigating all reports made 
by whistleblowers
 − Assessing conflict of interest and due diligence 
on all business partners 
 − Updating and reviewing all employees’ conflict 
of interest statements

 WHISTLEBLOWING 
Employees and external stakeholders can 
report concerns of irregular conduct or ethical 
issues through the Company’s intranet, by 
email, or letter, or by using a dedicated hotline. 
All complaints are investigated, findings are 
reported to the Ethics Committee and action 
taken if required. The security and confidentiality 
of employees is ensured for the duration of the 
process, safeguarding individuals and therefore 
achieving greater transparency.
 − Reporting channels (web, telephone 
hotline, email)
 − Methodology of complaints investigation 
and reports
 − Monitoring – analysis of complaints and 
improving internal controls

  COMMUNICATION AND 
TRAINING PROGRAMME
The Group has a comprehensive training 
programme to ensure that the policies 
and procedures of the Compliance Model 
are clearly understood and embedded 
in the culture of the organisation. The 
programme emphasises the right to know 
and there are measures in place to enhance 
the skills required to ensure its effective 
implementation. 
The Group updated its compliance training 
programme in 2016, adding the concept of 
modern slavery and examples of its use 
to the new employee induction and 
e-learning courses.
 − Communications (news, intranet, posters)
 − Training programme – induction of new 
employees and e-learning

  COMPLIANCE RISKS AND 
CONTROL ASSESSMENT 
The objective of the Compliance Risks and 
Control Assessment is to identify, develop and 
improve internal controls to prevent potential 
risks. This assessment is performed at 
least annually.
 − Identification of risks and controls
 − Assessment of risks and controls, and 
improvement of the process
The model is reviewed regularly, both 
internally and by third parties, and on matters 
relating to corruption it has been certified 
under Chilean anti-corruption legislation.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
To address the requirements of provision C.2.2 
of the 2014 Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the prospects of the 
Group over a period of five years.
Mining is a long-term business and timescales 
can run into decades. The Group maintains 
life-of-mine plans covering the full remaining 
mine life for each of the mining operations. 
More detailed medium-term planning is 
performed for a five-year time horizon (as well 
as very detailed annual budgets). Accordingly, 
a period of five years has been selected as the 
appropriate period over which to assess the 
prospects of the Group.
When taking account of the impact of the Group’s 
current position on this viability assessment, 
the Directors have considered in particular its 
financial position, including its significant balance 
of cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments 
and the borrowing facilities in place, including 
their terms and remaining durations.
When assessing the prospects of the Group, the 
Directors have considered the Group’s copper 
price forecasts, the Group’s expected production 
levels, operating cost profile, capital expenditure 
and financing plans. The Directors have taken 
into consideration the Group’s principal risks 
which could impact the prospects of the Group 
over this period, with the most relevant to this 
viability assessment considered to be risks to 
the copper price outlook. Robust down-side 
sensitivity analyses have been performed, 
assessing the impact of a significant deterioration 
in the copper price outlook over the five-year 
period, along with the impact of the potential 
occurrence of a number of the Group’s other 
specific principal risks. This analysis has focused 
on the existing asset-base of the Group, without 
factoring in potential development projects, which 
is considered appropriate for an assessment 
of the Group’s ability to manage the impact of 
a depressed economic environment. These 
stress-tests all indicated results which could be 
managed in the normal course of business. 
Based on their assessment of the Group’s 
prospects and viability, the Directors confirm 
that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next 
five years.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors also considered it appropriate 
to prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis, as explained in the Basis 
of preparation paragraph in Note 1 to the 
financial statements.
 See page 88 for more information
22 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 PRINCIPAL RISKS
RISK MITIGATION APPLICATION TO STRATEGY
Growth opportunities
The Group may fail to 
identify attractive acquisition 
opportunities or may select 
inappropriate targets.
The long-term commodity price 
forecast and other assumptions 
used when assessing potential 
projects and other investment 
opportunities have a significant 
influence on the forecast return 
on investment and, if 
incorrectly estimated, could 
result in the wrong decisions.
The Group assesses a wide range of potential growth opportunities, both internal 
projects and external opportunities. A rigorous assessment process is followed to 
evaluate all potential business acquisitions, which are subjected to different stress 
test scenarios for sensitivity analysis, and to determine the risks associated with the 
project or opportunity.
The Group’s Business Development Committee reviews potential growth 
opportunities and transactions, and approves or recommends them within authority 
levels set by the Board.
Commodity prices
The Group’s results are heavily 
dependent on commodity prices 
– principally copper and, to a 
lesser extent, gold and 
molybdenum. The prices of 
these commodities are strongly 
influenced by a variety of 
external factors, including 
world economic growth, 
inventory balances, industry 
demand and supply, possible 
substitution, etc. 
The Group considers exposure to commodity price fluctuations to be an integral part 
of the business and its usual policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices. 
The Group monitors the commodity markets closely to determine the effect of price 
fluctuations on earnings, capital expenditure and cash flows. Very occasionally, 
when it feels it to be appropriate, the Group uses derivative instruments to manage 
its exposure to commodity price fluctuations. The Group runs its business plans 
through various different commodity price scenarios and develops contingency plans 
as required.
Foreign currency
The Group’s sales are mainly 
denominated in US dollars and 
some of the Group’s operating 
costs are in Chilean pesos.
The strengthening of the 
Chilean peso may negatively 
affect the Group’s financial 
results.
As copper exports account for over 50% of Chile’s exports, there is a correlation 
between the copper price and the US dollar/Chilean peso exchange rate. This natural 
hedge partly mitigates the Group’s foreign exchange exposure. However, the Group 
monitors the foreign exchange markets and the macroeconomic variables that affect 
them and on occasion implements a focused currency hedging programme to reduce 
short-term exposure to fluctuations in the US dollar against the Chilean peso.
Set out below are the Group’s principal risks 
and related mitigation techniques. The Board 
has carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks.

Strategic resources
Disruption to the supply of any 
of the Group’s key strategic 
inputs such as electricity, water, 
fuel, sulphuric acid and mining 
equipment could have a 
negative impact on production. 
Longer term, any restrictions 
on the availability of key 
strategic resources such as 
water and electricity could 
affect the Group’s opportunities 
for growth.
A significant portion of 
the Group’s input costs are 
influenced by external 
market factors.
Contingency plans are in place to address any short-term disruptions to strategic 
resources. The Group negotiates early with suppliers of key inputs to ensure supply 
continuity. Certain key supplies are purchased from several sources to mitigate 
potential disruption arising from exposure to a single supplier.
Technological and innovative solutions, such as using sea water in the Group’s 
mining operations, can help mitigate exposure to potentially scarce resources.
The Group also utilises several sources of non-traditional energy such as wind and 
solar power.
Operating
Mining operations are subject 
to a number of circumstances 
not wholly within the Group’s 
control. These include damage 
to or breakdown of equipment 
or infrastructure, unexpected 
geological variations or 
technical issues, extreme 
weather conditions and natural 
disasters, any of which could 
adversely affect production 
and/or costs.
Key risks relating to each operation are identified as part of the regular risk 
review process undertaken by the individual operations. This process also 
identifies appropriate mitigation techniques for such risks. Monthly reports to 
the Board provide variance analysis of operating and financial performance, allowing 
potential key issues to be identified in good time and any necessary actions, such as 
monitoring or control activities, to be implemented to prevent unplanned downtime.
The Group has Business Continuity Plans and Disaster Recovery Plans for all key 
processes within its operations in order to mitigate the consequences of a crisis 
or natural disaster. The Group also has property damage and business interruption 
insurance to provide protection from some, but not all, of the costs that may arise 
from such events.
Project management
Failure to effectively manage 
the Group’s development 
projects could result in delays 
in the start of production and 
cost overruns.
The Group has a project management system consisting of standards, manuals and 
procedures containing the best practices applicable and enforceable in all phases 
of project development. The project management system supports the decision-
making process by balancing risk versus benefit, increasing the likelihood of success 
and providing a common language and standards. All geometallurgical models are 
reviewed by independent experts.
During the project lifecycle, quality checks for each of the standards applied are 
carried out by a panel of experts from within the Group. This panel reviews each 
feasibility study to assess the technical and commercial viability of the project and 
how it can be safely developed. Detailed progress reports on ongoing projects 
are regularly reviewed, and include assessments of progress against key project 
milestones and performance against budget.

Political, legal and regulatory
The Group may be affected 
by political instability and 
regulatory developments in 
the countries in which it is 
operating, pursuing projects 
or conducting exploration 
activities. Issues regarding 
the granting of permits or 
amendments to permits 
already granted, and changes 
to the legal environment or 
regulations, could adversely 
affect the Group’s operations 
and development projects.
Political, legal and regulatory developments affecting the Group’s operations and 
projects are monitored continually. The Group operates in full compliance with the 
existing laws, regulations, licences, permits and rights in each country in which 
it operates.
The Group assesses political risk as part of its evaluation of potential projects, 
including the nature of any foreign investment agreements.
The Group monitors proposed changes in government policies and regulations and 
belongs to several associations that consult with the government on these changes. 
This helps to improve the Group’s internal processes and better prepare it to meet 
any new regulatory requirements. 
Identification of new 
mineral resources
The Group needs to identify 
new mineral resources to 
ensure continued future growth 
and does so through 
exploration and acquisition. 
There is a risk that exploration 
activities may not identify 
sufficient viable mineral 
resources.
The Group conducts exploration programmes both in Chile and in other countries. 
The Group has entered into early-stage exploration agreements and strategic 
alliances with third parties in a number of countries and has also acquired equity 
interests in companies with known geological potential. The Group focuses its 
exploration activities on stable and secure countries to reduce risk exposure.
Ore reserves and mineral 
resources estimates
The Group’s ore reserves and 
mineral resources estimates 
are subject to a number of 
assumptions, including 
geological, metallurgical and 
technical factors, future 
commodity prices and 
production costs. Fluctuations 
in these variables may result in 
some reserves or resources 
being deemed uneconomic, 
which could lead to a reduction 
in reserves and/or resources.
The Group’s reserves and resources estimates are updated annually to reflect 
material extracted during the year, the results of drilling programmes and any revised 
assumptions. The Group follows the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration 
Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (“the JORC Code”) in reporting 
its ore reserves and mineral resources. This requires reserves and resources 
estimates to be based on work undertaken by a Competent Person, as defined by 
the Code. In addition, the Group’s reserves and resources estimates are subject to a 
comprehensive programme of internal and external audits.

Community relations
Failure to identify and manage 
local concerns and expectations 
can have a negative impact on 
the Group. Relations with local 
communities and stakeholders 
affect the Group’s reputation 
and social licence to operate 
and grow.
The Group has a dedicated team that establishes and maintains relations with local 
communities. These are based on trust and mutual benefit throughout the mining 
lifecycle, from exploration to final remediation. The Group seeks to identify early 
any potentially negative operating impacts and minimise these through responsible 
behaviour. This means acting transparently and ethically, prioritising the safety and 
health of its employees and contractors, avoiding environmental incidents, promoting 
dialogue, complying with commitments to stakeholders and establishing mechanisms 
to prevent or address a crisis. These steps are undertaken in the early stages of 
each project and continue throughout the life of each operation.
The Group contributes to the development of communities in the areas in which it 
operates, particularly through human capital development – the education, training 
and employment of the local population. The Group endeavours to communicate 
clearly and transparently with local communities, in line with the established 
Community Relations Plan, including the use of a grievance management process, 
local perception surveys, and local media and community engagement.
Safety and health
Safety and health incidents 
could result in harm to the 
Group’s employees, contractors 
or to local communities. 
Ensuring their safety and 
wellbeing is first and foremost 
an ethical obligation for the 
Group, as stated in the Group 
Core Values.
Poor safety records or serious 
accidents could have a 
long-term impact on the 
Group’s morale, reputation 
and production.
The Group is seeking continuous improvement of its safety and health risk 
management procedures, with particular focus on the early identification of risk and 
preventing fatalities.
The corporate Safety and Health department provides a common strategy to the 
Group’s operations and co-ordinates all safety and health matters. The Group has a 
Significant Incident Report system which is an important part of the overall approach 
to safety.
The Group’s goal of zero fatalities and minimising the number of accidents requires 
all contractors to comply with the Group’s Occupational Health and Safety Plan. 
This is monitored through monthly audits and supported by regular training and 
awareness campaigns for employees, contractors, employees’ families and local 
communities, particularly with regard to road safety.
Critical controls and veriﬁcation tools are regularly strengthened through the 
veriﬁcation programme and regular audits of critical controls for high potential 
safety risks.
Environmental management
An operating incident that 
damages the environment 
could affect both the Group’s 
relationship with local 
stakeholders and its reputation, 
undermining its social licence 
to operate and to grow. 
The Group operates in 
challenging environments, 
including the Atacama Desert, 
where water scarcity is a key 
issue.
The Group has a comprehensive approach to incident prevention. Relevant risks are 
assessed, monitored and controlled in order to achieve the goal of zero incidents 
with significant environmental impact. The Group works to raise awareness among 
employees and contractors and provides training to promote operating excellence. 
Potential environmental impacts are key considerations when assessing project 
viability, and the integration of innovative technology in the project design to mitigate 
these effects is encouraged. The Group strives to ensure maximum efficiency 
in water use, pioneering the use of sea water for mining operations in the arid 
Antofagasta Region of Chile and installing capacity to produce thickened tailings at 
Centinela, thus achieving high rates of reuse and recovery.

Talent management and 
labour relations
The Group’s highly skilled 
workforce and experienced 
management team are critical 
to maintaining current 
operations, implementing 
development projects, 
achieving long-term growth 
and preserving current 
operations without major 
disruption. Managing talent and 
maintaining a high-quality 
labour force is a key priority for 
the Group and any failures in 
this respect could have a 
negative impact on the 
performance of the existing 
operations and future growth.
The Group maintains good relations with its employees and unions, founded on trust, 
continuous dialogue and good working conditions. The Group is committed to safety, 
non-discrimination and compliance with Chile’s strict regulations on labour matters.
There are long-term labour agreements in place with employee unions at each of the 
Group’s mining operations, which help to ensure labour stability.
The Group seeks to identify and address labour issues that may arise throughout the 
period covered by existing labour agreements and to anticipate any potential issues 
in good time. Contractors are an important part of the Group’s workforce and under 
Chilean law are subject to the same duties and responsibilities as the Group’s own 
employees. The Group’s approach is to treat contractors as strategic associates and 
its goal is to build long-term mutually beneficial contractor relationships. The Group 
maintains constructive relationships with its employees and the unions that represent 
them through regular communication and consultation. Union representatives are 
regularly involved in discussions about the future of the workforce.
The Group develops the talents of its employees through training and development, 
invests in initiatives to widen the talent pool and focuses on maintaining good 
relationships with employees, unions and contractors.
The Group’s Employee Performance Management System is designed to attract and 
retain key employees by creating reward and remuneration structures and personal 
development opportunities. The Group has a talent management system to identify 
and develop internal candidates for key management positions, as well as identifying 
suitable external candidates where appropriate.
Corruption activities
The Group’s projects or 
operations around the world 
may be affected by risks related 
to corruption or bribery, 
including operating disruptions 
or delays resulting from a 
refusal to make “ facilitation 
payments”. Such risk depends 
on the economic or political 
stability of the country in which 
the Group is operating.
The Group employs procedures and controls against any kind of corruption, including 
open channels of communication that any employee or external party can use in 
order to raise any concerns or complaints.
In addition, the Group has Ethics Committees (composed of senior executives) 
at each of its operations, responsible for investigating complaints and taking any 
necessary measures. They in turn report such investigations to the Corporate Ethics 
Committee, which decides whether any further action is required.
All employees in the Group receive training on the Group Compliance Model which is 
subject to external certification.
There are also control procedures in place that help to prevent corruption, covering 
such issues as conflicts of interest, suitability of suppliers, receiving and giving of 
gifts and hospitality, and facilitation payments.

The Group’s mining 
operations depend on 
a range of key inputs 
such as energy, water, 
labour and fuel. The 
management of these 
inputs has a significant 
impact on operating costs, 
so ensuring the long-
term availability of key 
resources is a vital part 
of supply management.
To secure the future of 
the business in the long 
term, the Group must 
increase the size of its 
mineral resource base. 
It undertakes exploration 
activities in Chile and 
abroad. Exploration 
programmes outside 
Chile are generally 
carried out in partnership 
with other companies 
in order to benefit from 
their local knowledge 
and experience.

Effective project 
evaluation and design 
maximise value at this 
stage of the mining cycle. 
The Group’s wealth of 
experience in both areas 
helps to make the best use 
of mineral deposits.
The Group integrates 
sustainability criteria 
into design processes 
and project evaluation, 
developing innovative 
solutions for challenges 
such as water and 
energy supplies and 
community relations.
Once a project has been 
approved by the Board, 
construction begins. 
This stage requires 
significant input of capital 
and resources. Effective 
project management and 
cost control maximise 
a project’s return 
on investment.
The Group has a 
co-operative approach 
to developing projects. 
Typically, after the 
feasibility stage, and into 
the construction phase, 
the Group seeks a partner 
for its projects, generating 
an immediate cash return 
while diversifying risk and 
providing broader access 
to funding.
The Group’s four 
operations in Chile are: 
Los Pelambres, Centinela, 
Antucoya and Zaldívar. 
The world-class Los 
Pelambres and Centinela 
districts have long-life 
operations with large 
mineral resources and 
produce significant 
volumes of gold, silver 
and molybdenum as 
by-products. In 2015,

Mining is a long-term business and timescales can run into decades. The period from initial 
exploration to the start of production often exceeds ten years, and, depending on the nature of the 
project and market conditions, it may take more than ﬁ ve years of operation to recoup the initial 
investment. If possible, mines exploit higher-grade areas towards the start of the mine life in 
order to maximise returns. As a result, average ore grades may decline over time, with production 
volumes decreasing along with revenues.

The Group mines both 
copper sulphide and 
copper oxide ores, 
which require different 
processing routes:
Los Pelambres and 
Centinela Concentrates 
Mined sulphide ore is 
milled to reduce its 
size before passing to 
flotation cells where it is 
upgraded to a concentrate 
containing some 25-35% 
copper. This concentrate 
is then shipped to a 
smelter operated by a 
third party and converted 
to copper metal.
The marketing team builds 
long-term relationships 
with the smelters and 
fabricators who purchase 
the Group’s products, 
with approximately 
75% of output going to 
Asian markets.
As well as copper, a 
number of the Group’s 
mines produce significant 
volumes of gold, 
molybdenum and silver as 
by-products. Gold is sold 
for use in industrial and 
electronic applications 
and in jewellery making. 
Most copper and 
molybdenum sales 
are made under annual 
contracts or longer-term 
framework agreements. 
Sales volumes are 
agreed each year, which 
guarantees offtake. 
During the operation of 
a mine, its impact on 
the environment and the 
neighbouring communities 
is carefully managed. 
At the end of its life, a 
mine must be closed 
and the surrounding 
habitats restored to their 
original state.
A closure plan for each 
mine is maintained and 
updated throughout its life 
to ensure compliance with 
the latest regulations and 
a sustainable closure.
The Group’s mining 
operations create 
significant economic and 
social value for a wide 
range of stakeholders. 
Local communities 
benefit from job 
creation and improved 
infrastructure, while 
the Chilean government 
and local municipalities 
receive tax payments and 
royalties. There are also 
benefits to society in 
general, with the copper 
the Group produces being 
used across many sectors, 
from industrial to medical. 
The copper and 
by-products from the 
Group’s mines go on to 
be further processed 
for use in end markets, 
including property, power, 
electronics, transport and 
consumer products.
Centinela Cathodes, 
Antucoya and Zaldívar 
Mined oxide ore is 
combined with leachable 
sulphide, crushed, 
piled into heaps and 
then leached with 
sulphuric acid, producing 
a copper sulphate 
solution. This solution 
is then put through a 
solvent extraction and 
electrowinning (“SX-EW”) 
plant to produce copper 
cathodes, which are sold 
to fabricators around 
the world.

The Group introduced the Cost and Competitiveness Programme (CCP) in 
2014, with the aim of reducing the cost base and improving the Group’s 
competitiveness within the industry. Since then, the Group has achieved 
savings in mine site costs of $359 million, approximately $176 million 
of which were made during 2016. These savings in mine site costs are 
equivalent to 11 cents per pound. The Group target for 2017 is set at 
an incremental $140 million. Together with exploration, evaluation and 
corporate cost savings, total savings since 2014 were over $500 million.
The programme focuses on four areas:
Services productivity: Improving the productivity and quality of 
contracts while reducing costs
Operating and maintenance management: Improving the 
performance of critical processes and the implementation of standard 
maintenance management practices
Corporate and organisational effectiveness: Reducing costs and 
restructuring the Group’s organisational framework
Energy efficiency: Optimising energy efficiency and lowering energy 
contract prices
KEY INPUTS 
AND COST BASE
The Group’s mining operations depend on key inputs, including 
energy, water, labour and fuel. For cathode producers such as 
Centinela, Antucoya and Zaldívar, which use the SX-EW process, 
sulphuric acid is also a key input.

$10-15 MILLION
Concentrate producers such as Los Pelambres and Centinela require other 
substantial inputs, for example reagents and grinding media. The availability 
and cost of these inputs are central to the Group’s cost management 
strategy, which focuses on cost control and security of supply.
The Group’s two largest operations, Los Pelambres and Centinela, are 
already competitively positioned on the copper industry cost curve and the 
acquisition of Zaldívar and its successful integration into the Group has 
unlocked valuable synergies in several areas, including that of cost.
The initiatives below have been implemented by the Group’s procurement 
department, reducing the unit cost of each operation and allowing them to 
remain profitable even as mine grades decline.

ENERGY
Water is a precious commodity 
in the regions where the Group’s 
mines operate, so the recycling of 
water is extremely important.
Water for each operation is sourced 
either from the sea or from surface 
and underground sources. Each 
operation has the necessary permits 
for the long-term supply of water at 
current production levels.
The Group optimises water 
efficiency by reducing demand, 
using untreated sea water and 
encouraging recycling across its 
operations. Water reuse rates 
depend on a range of factors 
and the Group seeks to achieve 
a rate of 70–85% depending on 
circumstances at each operation.
The Group has pioneered the use of 
untreated sea water at its Chilean 
operations, and the technique is 
used at Centinela and Antucoya. 
In 2016, sea water accounted for 
47.2% of total Group water use.
The Group sources its energy from 
the two electricity grids in Chile: 
the northern grid (SING), which 
supplies the Centinela, Antucoya 
and Zaldívar mines, and the 
central grid (SIC) which supplies 
Los Pelambres. The SING has 
an installed capacity of 5.0 GW, 
supplied to the grid from coal-fired 
power stations and renewable 
sources such as wind and solar. 
The SIC’s installed capacity is 17.4 
GW, primarily from hydroelectric 
plants. Due to this reliance on 
hydroelectric power, the cost 
of energy on the SIC fluctuates 
depending on precipitation levels, 
whereas on the SING costs tend to 
be more stable.
In 2014, the Government began a 
process to connect the SING and 
SIC power grids to increase the 
reliability of the national power 
system. This should be completed 
in 2018. The new integrated grid 
will supply 99% of national demand, 
increasing customer access to a 
range of power generation sources.
Approximately 13% of the Group’s 
operating costs are energy related. 
To manage price fluctuations, the 
Group aims to procure medium 
and long-term electricity contracts 
called Power Purchase Agreements 
(PPAs) at each operation. Pricing, 
in most cases, is linked to the 
cost of electricity on the Chilean 
grids or the generation costs of a 
supplier, the latter being subject to 
adjustments for inflation and fuel 
input prices.
In 2012, Los Pelambres was facing 
an energy market with limited 
availability of long-term PPAs 
indexed to more stable fuel input 
prices, leaving it exposed to volatile 
spot energy prices. To mitigate this, 
the Group improved Los Pelambres’ 
security of supply by investing 
in several power generation 
projects. These include an equity 
interest in a wind-power plant, 
El Arrayán, which now provides 
some 20% of Los Pelambres’ 
energy requirements.
Los Pelambres has signed 
long-term PPAs with two solar 
power providers for a total of 
50MW of power. The first solar 
PPA commenced in 2015 and 
the second came online in 2016. 
During 2015, Los Pelambres also 
started to receive power under a 
long-term PPA from a coal-fired 
power plant and in 2016 replaced 
the remaining exposure to the 
spot market by a short-term fixed 
price PPA. These PPAs, together 
with those signed with Alto Maipo, 
will fulfil Los Pelambres’ energy 
requirements at competitive and 
stable prices.
All the Group operations located on 
the SING benefit from long-term 
contracts, mostly indexed to the 
price of coal. The first of these to 
expire will be the PPA supplying 
100% of Zaldívar’s power until 
2020. The other PPAs continue until 
2026-2028.
WATER
Secure labour supply is key to 
the Group’s success. Labour 
agreements with unions are in 
place at all of the Group mining 
operations, generally lasting for 
three years. In 2016, the Group 
successfully renewed labour 
agreements with the unions at 
Zaldívar, Antucoya, and with 
a new supervisors’ union at 
Los Pelambres. The Group 
continues to foster good working 
relationships with its employees and 
labour unions and to date there has 
been no industrial action.
Contractors account for 
approximately 71% of the workforce 
across Group operations, and 
they are responsible for labour 
negotiations with their own 
employees. The Group maintains 
strong relations with all contractors 
to ensure operating continuity and 
expects all contractors to adhere to 
the same standards expected of its 
own workforce, particularly in the 
areas of safety and health.

SULPHURIC ACID
OIL PRICE
EXCHANGE RATE
SERVICE 
CONTRACTS AND 
KEY SUPPLIES
Fuel represents less than 5% of 
total operating costs and is used in 
trucks transporting ore and waste 
at the mine sites. Nevertheless, 
improving fuel efficiency is a 
priority, with the amount of fuel 
consumed per tonne of material 
extracted being a key measure. Fuel 
is supplied by Chile’s two largest 
suppliers to avoid sole supplier risk.
Generally, the oil price also affects 
the spot price of energy, shipping 
rates for supplies and products, and 
the cost of items such as tyres and 
conveyor belts, which contain oil-
based products. The oil price rose 
by approximately 45% during 2016, 
following the reduction of output 
agreed by oil producing nations at 
the end of the year.
The sulphuric acid market 
weakened during 2016, mainly 
due to lower consumption in the 
fertiliser industry. This lowered the 
regional deficit and caused prices 
to drop by the end of the year.
The Group secures most of its 
sulphuric acid requirements under 
contracts for a year or longer at 
prices normally agreed in the latter 
part of the previous year. Therefore, 
the decline in demand is likely 
to benefit the acid procurement 
programme in 2017.
Costs are affected by the Chilean 
peso to US dollar exchange rate, as 
approximately 35-40% of the mining 
division’s operating costs are in 
Chilean pesos. However, this often 
acts as a natural hedge as over 
half of Chile’s foreign exchange is 
generated from copper sales, so an 
increase in the copper price tends 
to weaken the Chilean peso and 
vice versa. During 2016, the Chilean 
peso weakened by 3.5% from 
Ch$654/$1 in 2015 to Ch$677/$1. 
During the first two months of 2017 
it averaged Ch$652/$1.
In 2014, the Group created a 
central procurement department 
to consolidate supply activities 
for key purchases such as mining 
equipment, tyres and reagents, 
achieving synergies and economies 
of scale across its operations. The 
programme has expanded since 
and has worked to standardise 
procurement policies and 
procedures across the Group. A 
core of experts defines product and 
service categories and negotiates 
corporate-level agreements 
to obtain price reductions and 
discounts in high-spend areas.
In 2016, the procurement 
team successfully:
 − Implemented SAP to manage 
inventory levels
 − Centralised the procurement 
of all goods, strategic 
and operating
 − Incorporated Zaldívar into 
existing Group-wide contracts, 
achieving significant savings
 − Integrated Antucoya into the 
Group procurement system and 
negotiated new procurement 
contracts for goods and services 
not already covered under 
Group contracts
 − Automated and outsourced all 
transactions under $5,000, which 
account for approximately 60% of 
all procurement transactions
The Group continually reviews 
its procurement processes and 
existing agreements, identifying 
additional cost-saving opportunities 
to be taken during the coming 
years as part of the Cost and 
Competitiveness Programme.
Opportunities to improve major 
service contracts in areas such as 
productivity and costs are under 
review by external consultants. 
Once identified and analysed, these 
can lead to contract renegotiations.
In total, the Group has over 
1,500 contracts for goods and 
services. Key contracts, such as 
tyres, grinding media, mining and 
mobile equipment, chemicals, 
explosives, camp administration 
and maintenance, are under 
long-term agreements. Price 
adjustment formulas reflect market 
variations of key cost elements, 
such as steel, petrol and Consumer 
Price Index (CPI). Contracts are 
normally negotiated between the 
operation and the supplier, but 
tenders and negotiations are mostly 
co-ordinated, and sometimes 
led, by the Central Procurement 
Department in order to maximise 
leverage and benefits.
The Group’s corporate procurement 
team uses a variety of strategies, 
including from full-price 
competition, price auctions, 
sourcing in China and working with 
strategic suppliers, to reduce the 
costs to each party and achieve a 
sustainable, longer-term, lower-cost 
base for future growth. To foster 
this co-operative approach, the 
Group has engaged productivity 
experts to map operations, 
understand value streams and 
identify opportunities for the Group 
to increase efficiency and 
reduce costs.
34 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 KEY 
RELATIONSHIPS
Most copper and molybdenum 
sales are made under annual 
contracts or using longer-term 
framework agreements with sales 
volumes agreed for the coming 
year. Gold is contained in the copper 
concentrates and so is part of 
copper concentrates sales.
The majority of sales are to 
industrial customers who refine 
or further process the copper – 
smelters, in the case of copper 
concentrate production, and copper 
fabricators in the case of cathode 
production. The Group’s marketing 
team builds long-term relationships 
with these core customers, while 
also maintaining relationships with 
trading companies that participate in 
shorter-term sales.
Over 80% of the Group’s mining 
sales are under contracts of a year 
or longer and metals sales pricing 
is generally based on prevailing 
market prices.
CUSTOMERS
Typically, the Group’s sales 
contracts set out the annual 
volumes to be supplied and the 
main terms for the sale of each 
payable metal, with the pricing of 
the contained copper in line with 
LME prices.
In the case of concentrate, a 
deduction is made from LME prices 
to reflect TC/RCs – the smelting 
and refining costs necessary to 
process the concentrate into copper 
cathodes. These TC/RCs are typically 
determined annually and in line 
with terms negotiated across the 
concentrate market.
A significant proportion of the 
Group’s copper cathode sales are 
made under annual contracts, 
priced in line with LME prices. 
In copper cathode transactions 
a premium, or in some cases 
a discount, on the LME price is 
negotiated to reflect differences 
in quality, logistics and financing 
compared with the metal 
exchange’s standard copper 
contract specifications.
Similarly, the Group’s molybdenum 
contracts are made under long-
term framework agreements, with 
pricing usually based on Platts’ 
average prices.
STRUCTURE 
OF SALES 
CONTRACTS
Across the industry neither copper 
producers nor consumers tend 
to make annual commitments for 
100% of their respective production 
or needs, and producers normally 
retain a portion to be sold on the 
spot market throughout the year.
The prices realised by the Group 
during a specific period will differ 
from the average market price for 
that period. This is because, in 
line with industry practice, sales 
agreements generally provide for 
provisional pricing at the time of 
shipment, with final pricing based 
on the average market price for 
the month in which settlement 
takes place.
For copper concentrate, sales 
remain open until settlement occurs, 
on average three to five months 
from the shipment date. Settlement 
for the gold and silver content in 
copper concentrate sales occurs 
approximately one month from 
shipment. Copper cathode sales 
remain open for an average of one 
month from shipment. Settlement 
for copper in concentrate sales is 
later than for copper cathode sales 
as further refinement of copper in 
concentrate is needed before sale. 
Molybdenum sales generally remain 
open for two or three months 
from shipment.
The Group cannot run its business in isolation. The 
business model is underpinned by relationships with 
stakeholders at local, regional, national and international 
level, which contribute to its long-term success.
The Group forms long-term partnerships with some suppliers, 
while others are managed with a more short-term focus based 
on market competition.

The number of contractors working 
for Antofagasta varies according 
to business needs and the level of 
construction activity.
As at 31 December 2016, there 
were approximately 13,100 
contractors working at the Group’s 
operations and projects. This was 
some 5% lower than the same 
time last year, principally due to 
the completion of construction 
at Antucoya.
Contractors are vital to mining 
operations and the Group aims to 
build long-term relationships with 
contractor companies based on the 
highest standards. Safety and health 
targets are included in performance 
agreements and compliance with 
safety and human rights laws, 
labour regulations and the Group’s 
own safety and health standards are 
assessed regularly by internal and 
external audits.
The minimum wage paid by 
Antofagasta to contractor 
employees is 55% higher than 
that required by Chilean law and 
contractor staff have access to the 
same mine camp facilities as the 
Group’s own employees.
Suppliers play a critical role in the 
Group’s ability to operate, providing 
a large range of products and 
services from grinding media to 
catering at the mine sites. 
The Group currently works with 
over 3,500 suppliers, focusing on 
the top suppliers in each category 
to ensure the most cost-effective 
and efficient solutions across 
all operations. As previously 
mentioned, the corporate 
procurement team has consolidated 
procurement practices across all 
operations and projects. The team 
has also reduced the number of 
suppliers in order to extract greater 
benefits from selected suppliers 
over a long period of time.
The Group openly encourages 
suppliers to raise any issues or 
concerns they may have about their 
relationship with the Company, their 
contracts or the workforce.
All suppliers are audited routinely 
with regard to the workforce, to 
ensure that they are complying with 
the law and the Group’s stringent 
policies and procedures. The Group 
also monitors suppliers’ financial 
health and ensures bank guarantees 
are in place when necessary.
SUPPLIERS EMPLOYEES
The Group employs approximately 
5,400 people, who work alongside 
approximately 13,100 contractors 
at its corporate offices, operations 
and projects. Mining operations are 
inherently risky and ensuring the 
safety and health of every employee 
is an absolute priority. It is an 
ethical obligation and is central to 
the Group’s strategic objectives.
The Group has created a variety of 
initiatives over the last few years 
to secure and develop talent. In 
particular, the Group seeks to 
attract young professionals into the 
mining industry and complement 
their work experience with 
workshops and seminars across 
different functional areas. 
Relationships with trade unions 
are based on mutual respect and 
transparency. This helps the Group 
to retain employees and avoid 
labour disputes, contributing to 
greater productivity and business 
efficiency. During 2016, the Group 
renewed labour agreements with 
employees at Antucoya and with 
the supervisors at Los Pelambres 
and Zaldívar. In the Chilean mining 
industry labour agreements are 
negotiated with each union every 
three years and the next of the 
Group’s negotiations will take 
place during 2017.
During 2016 the Group successfully 
implemented a functional 
simplification programme to:
1. Focus the operations on core 
business activities (safety, 
production volume and cost) 
and centralise all supporting 
transactional activities. 
2. Standardise processes and 
foster best practice across 
all operations by sharing and 
leveraging the potential of SAP.
3. Increase the efficiency of 
functional processes and 
structures with a core team 
responsible for these activities 
across all operations.
4. Reduce costs as a consequence 
of simplified functional models 
and structures.
The programme covered Finance, 
Supply, IT, Human Resources, 
Legal, Internal and External Affairs 
functions, eliminating approximately 
100 positions across the Group and 
achieving annual savings of around 
$10 million.

36 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 It is crucial to have strong 
relationships with local communities 
in the areas where the Group 
operates, as without mutual trust, 
co-operation and understanding 
it is not possible to run a 
mine successfully.
Having clear social policies and 
regular contact with community 
members helps to manage potential 
conflicts and maintains the Group’s 
social licence to operate. During 
2014, Los Pelambres adopted a new 
community engagement initiative 
called “Somos Choapa” (We Are 
Choapa), after the region in which 
it is located. In 2015, the Group 
signed a framework agreement 
with three municipalities under the 
initiative, and has begun assessing a 
portfolio of projects for sustainable 
development in the region.
During 2016, the Group resolved 
long-standing legal issues with 
the Caimanes community, mainly 
related to the El Mauro tailings dam. 
This was achieved by open dialogue 
with the community, prioritising 
their needs and clarifying the 
Company’s commitments. The 
dialogue was monitored by the 
Chilean chapter of Transparency 
International to ensure the openness 
and fairness of the process.

The Group monitors new and 
proposed legislation in order to 
anticipate, mitigate or reduce 
possible effects and ensure 
it complies with all legal and 
regulatory obligations. It works 
with industry bodies to engage with 
governments on public policy, laws, 
regulations and procedures that 
may affect its business, including 
such issues as climate change and

GROWTH PROJECTS 
AND OPPORTUNITIES
The Group seeks to expand its copper production in 
Chile and abroad by developing new projects and other 
potential opportunities. Brownﬁ eld development within 
the Group’s Los Pelambres and Centinela mining districts 
in Chile remains the primary focus for maximising value 
while managing associated risks.
The Group has a portfolio of longer-term growth options and continues 
to assess opportunities that come to market. Long-term growth options 
already within the portfolio are under evaluation in feasibility studies. Given 
the early stage of some of these projects, their potential and timing is 
uncertain and the following outline provides only a high-level indication of 
potential opportunities.
The Group’s exploration and evaluation expenditure decreased by 56.5% 
to $44.3 million in 2016 compared with $101.9 million in 2015. When 
commodity prices decline and there is greater emphasis on cost control, 
tighter focus on high-potential opportunities results in a decrease in overall 
exploration expenditure.
The Group has an active early-stage 
exploration programme beyond the 
core locations of the Centinela and 
Los Pelambres mining districts. 
This is managed through its in-
house exploration team and utilises 
partnerships with third parties to 
build a portfolio of longer-term 
opportunities across Chile and 
the rest of the world. In response 
to the depressed copper market 
the Group reduced its exploration 
and evaluation expenditure 
from $101.9 million in 2015 to 
$44.3 million in 2016.
CHILE
The Group focuses its exploration 
activities on the main copper 
porphyry belts in northern and 
central Chile. During the year, as 
part of its asset rationalisation 
programme, the Group relinquished 
low priority tenements and acquired 
new tenements more closely 
aligned with its target areas. First 
stage drilling was initiated during 
the year and progressed as planned 
at targets located in the second and 
third regions of Chile.
 Further information regarding 
Reserves and Resources is 
included on pages 190 to 199.
EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES
INTERNATIONAL
The Group’s international 
exploration strategy is to identify, 
secure and evaluate high-quality 
copper exploration projects in 
preferred jurisdictions such as 
the Americas and Australia.
During 2016, the Group 
downgraded Australia as a target 
country, increasing its focus on the 
Americas while refining its portfolio 
of early-stage exploration projects 
in key copper provinces in target 
countries. Working in partnership 
with selected companies, both 
public and private, the Group drilled 
and tested projects in Argentina, 
Australia, Mexico and Zambia and 
exited from projects in Portugal, 
Finland and Canada. Exploration 
efforts in Canada and Australia 
generated new projects that will 
be evaluated during 2017.
The Group’s strategy is to partner 
with experienced junior exploration 
companies, funding their exploration 
programmes to earn an interest in 
the projects while benefiting from 
their local knowledge and expertise.

Group is considering the possibility 
and timing of such an expansion, 
which could bring throughput 
capacity to approximately 150,000 
tonnes per day and increase 
annual production to approximately 
200,000 tonnes of copper, 170,000 
ounces of gold and 5,500 tonnes

CENTINELA SECOND 
CONCENTRATOR
The Centinela Mining District is a 
key area for longer-term growth 
and the Group continues to evaluate 
options for its development. 
The second concentrator will be 
built some 7 km from Centinela’s 
current concentrator and is 
expected to have an ore throughput 
capacity of approximately 90,000 
tonnes per day, with annual 
production of approximately 
140,000 tonnes of copper, 
150,000 ounces of gold and 
2,800 tonnes of molybdenum. 
Ore will be sourced initially from 
the Esperanza Sur deposit and, 
once mining is completed at 
Encuentro Oxides, additionally from 
Encuentro Sulphides.
The pre-feasibility study for this 
$2.7 billion project was completed 
at the end of 2015 and the feasibility 
study is now underway. The EIA

was approved in 2016 and the 
Group has commenced applications 
for the additional permits required 
for the project following certain 
design modifications made during 
the year. The feasibility study, 
which is due for completion in 2017, 
will include the testing of a pilot 
hydraulic roll crushing system that 
is being considered in preference 
to conventional SAG. 
A decision to proceed with the 
project will depend on the market 
outlook and the sequencing 
of the project relative to the 
Los Pelambres project. If approval is 
granted in 2018, production would 
be expected to begin in 2021.
The project team continues to 
review options for reducing 
the capital cost of the project. 
These include the use of existing 
infrastructure (power lines, 
pipelines, concentrate shipping and 
other facilities) as well as enhancing 
the owner’s team capabilities, 
to improve the project execution 
strategy, management and control, 
together with other initiatives.
There is scope to further increase 
the plant capacity once the second 
concentrator is completed. The 
authorities had denied renewal of 
two of its long-held federal mining 
leases. Twin Metals’ leases had 
been held in good standing by 
the federal government for more 
than 50 years, and had been twice 
renewed without controversy. 
Twin Metals has filed a federal 
lawsuit seeking to secure its rights 
to the two federal mineral leases 
and believes denial of the leases 
is inconsistent with federal law, 
the terms of leases themselves 
and the federal government’s 
established precedent in supporting 
and renewing the leases over 
five decades.
While Twin Metals is assessing 
the impact of the agencies’ lease 
renewal decision, it will continue 
progressing the project while also 
pursuing legal avenues to protect 
its contractual mineral rights.

PHASE 1
This phase is designed to optimise 
throughput within the limits of the 
existing operating, environmental 
and water extraction permits so 
that it will thus need only relatively 
simple updates. During this phase, 
Los Pelambres will operate at an 
average throughput of 190,000 
tonnes per day with the addition of a 
new grinding and flotation circuit to 
mitigate the hard ore currently being 
mined, and a 400 litres per second 
desalination plant and pipeline. 
Desalinated water will be pumped 
to the tailings storage facility at El 
Mauro where it will connect with 
the recycling circuit returning water 
to the Los Pelambres plant.
PHASE 2
In this phase the Group will seek 
to increase throughput to 205,000 
tonnes per day and to extend the 
mine’s life beyond the currently 
approved 21 years. As part of this 
development a new EIA must be 
submitted to increase the capacity 
of the mine’s El Mauro tailings 
storage facility and the mine waste 
dumps. The Group is preparing 
to commence the environmental 
baseline study for the EIA in 2017. 
BROWNFIELD 
GROWTH PROJECTS
During the year 2016 the 
Group submitted the EIA for the 
desalination plant to the authorities 
and expects to receive approval 
in late 2017 or early 2018. The 
feasibility study was completed 
in early 2017 and detailed 
engineering will be completed 
once EIA approval is received. The 
project will be subject to internal 
review and should be presented 
to the Board for construction 
approval by the end of 2017. A 
decision to proceed will be made 
only in suitable market conditions 
and with an approved EIA in place. 
Production would commence in late 
2020 at the earliest.
The feasibility study estimate of the 
capital expenditure for this project 
is approximately $1.05 billion, 
with some $580 million allocated 
to the additional crushing and 
flotation circuits and the balance 
to the desalination plant and water 
pipeline. The expansion is estimated 
to increase copper production by an 
average of 55,000 tonnes per year 
over a period of 15 years.
Capital expenditure for this phase 
is estimated at approximately 
$500 million, with the majority of 
the expenditure being on mining 
equipment, additional crushing and 
grinding capacity and flotation cells. 
The conveyors from the primary 
crusher to the concentrator plant 
will also have to be repowered to 
support the additional throughput. 
Critical studies on tailings and waste

42 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 MOLYBDENUM 
PLANT
This project will allow Centinela 
to produce an average of 2,400 
tonnes of molybdenum per year. 
Completion is expected in 2017, and 
the addition of another by-product 
credit will lower Centinela’s unit net 
cash costs.
ENCUENTRO OXIDES
The Encuentro Oxides deposit is 
within the Centinela Mining District. 
It is expected to produce an average 
of approximately 43,000 tonnes 
of copper cathode per year over 
an eight-year period, utilising the 
existing capacity at Centinela’s 
SX-EW plant. Once the project is 
completed, it will enable the plant to 
produce at full capacity of 100,000 
tonnes per annum for a number of 
years, helping to offset a natural 
decline in production due to falling 
mined grades at Centinela’s existing 
oxide pits. 
The project entails the installation 
of new crushing and heap-leach 
facilities at the Encuentro Oxides 
deposit, a pipeline to take the leach 
solution for processing at the 
existing SX-EW plant some 17 km 
away, and the extension of the sea 
water pipeline from Centinela to 
Encuentro. Higher-grade ore will be 
crushed and sent to the new heap-
leach facilities, while lower-grade 
ore will be processed later on a 
Run-of-Mine (ROM) leach pad.
This deposit is important for the 
Group’s long-term development, 
as Encuentro Oxides sits on top 
of the much larger Encuentro 
Sulphide deposit. The Encuentro 
Oxides project will therefore 
act as a funded pre-strip for 
the sulphide deposit, opening 
up the latter for development 
as part of the Centinela Second 
Concentrator project.
CENTINELA
During 2016, work continued on 
optimising Centinela’s concentrator 
plant in order to bring the level of 
throughput to 105,000 tonnes per 
day. Debottlenecking of the flotation 
and concentrate circuit and the 
installation of two paste thickeners 
were completed during the year 
and the plant achieved its design 
capacity in November. The final 
paste thickener was completed 
in early 2017 allowing the plant 
to produce tailings with a solids 
content of approximately 67% on a 
continuous basis, an improvement 
in the solids content of some 
four percentage points. The new 
paste thickeners are the largest 
application of this thickened tailings 
technology in the world.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
EBITDA at Los Pelambres was 
$921.0 million in 2016, compared 
with $748.7 million in 2015, 
reflecting significantly lower 
operating costs. Realised copper 
prices rose to $2.35/lb from 
$2.24/lb, further supporting 
EBITDA growth.
PRODUCTION
Copper production was 355,400 
tonnes in 2016, which was slightly 
below production in 2015 of 
363,200 tonnes. This decrease is 
primarily due to lower throughput 
as a greater proportion of harder 
ore is processed in the plant, and 
was only partly offset by higher 
mined grades.
Molybdenum production for the year 
was 7,100 tonnes, 29.7% lower than 
in 2015, due to lower grades and 
recoveries. Gold production was 
12.5% higher in 2016 at 57,800 
ounces, compared with 51,400 
ounces in 2015.
CASH COSTS
Cash costs before by-product 
credits at $1.36/lb were 9.3% 
lower than in 2015, due to the 
savings achieved through the Cost 
and Competitiveness Programme 
and changes in the estimating 
method for deferred stripping 
costs. Net cash costs for the 
full year 2016 were $1.06/lb 
compared with $1.23/lb in 2015. 
This decrease is mainly due to 
higher realised prices for gold and 
molybdenum, slightly offset by lower

remaining almost unchanged. The 
realised gold price rose from $1,159/
oz in 2015 to $1,257/oz in 2016.
PRODUCTION
Copper production for the full 
year 2016 was 6.8% higher than 
in 2015, primarily due to higher 
sulphide grades and the completion 
of the concentrator expansion 
project. This was partly offset by 
lower throughput in the Centinela 
Cathodes plant and the expected 
continued decline in oxide grades.
Copper in concentrate production 
for the full year was 24.2% higher 
year-on-year, mainly reflecting 
expanded throughput capacity 
following the installation of new 
tailings thickeners and modifications 
to the grinding and flotation circuits. 
Higher grades and slightly higher 
recoveries also helped increase 
production during the year. 
Gold production was 213,000 
ounces, some 31% higher than 
in 2015. This was mainly due to 
higher throughput and grades, as 
recoveries remained flat across the 
two years.
Copper cathode production for the 
year was 55,800 tonnes, 26.5% 
lower than the previous year, as

for deferred stripping costs. 
The balance was due to higher 
production. Net cash costs for 
2016 were $1.19/lb compared with 
$1.85/lb in 2015. This decrease 
is due to lower cash costs before

Capital expenditure was 
$534.7 million, including 
$206.2 million on Encuentro

As part of Antofagasta’s commitment to eliminating fatalities at its operations, it has 
analysed the main causes of accidents and implemented technology-driven solutions 
to minimise such risks.
For example, a significant factor in fatalities is loss of control of a vehicle. The solution 
at Antucoya was to install a state-of-the-art 360° simulator, so that operators training 
on a variety of mining equipment, such as trucks, shovels and front-end loaders, could 
experience the most realistic situations possible to prepare them for the challenges faced 
in the everyday working environment.

was $950 million. 
PRODUCTION
Total attributable production in 
2016 was 51,700 tonnes of copper 
cathodes. During the year there 
was a significant increase in copper 
recovery due to improved sulphide 
leaching, using experience gained at 
other Group operations.

CASH COSTS
Cash costs for 2016 were lower 
than expected at $1.54/lb, partly 
because leach recoveries and 
grades were higher than anticipated 
and partly due to synergic savings 
made during the year following the 
mine’s merger into the Group.
Attributable capital expenditure for 
the 2016 full year was $57.5 million, 
which includes approximately 
$30 million with respect to mine 
development. These amounts are 
not included in the Group capital 
expenditure figures.
OUTLOOK
Attributable copper production in 
2017 is forecast to be approximately 
55–60,000 tonnes at a cash cost of 
$1.50/lb. 
Attributable capital expenditure 
in 2017 is expected to be 
approximately $50 million, of which 
$25 million will be spent on mine 
development.

2016 PERFORMANCE
During the year, FCAB optimised 
and expanded its business by 
integrating and strengthening the 
three key areas of sustainability, 
productivity and cost management. 
There was a positive effect on 
revenue as sales associated with 
spot services increased due to 
higher utilisation of the fleet. The 
railway agreed a tonnage increase 
with one of its largest customers 
and reached an important milestone 
with the purchase of seven brand 
new locomotives, with the object of 
optimising the fleet and increasing 
asset productivity.
OPERATING 
PERFORMANCE
The division’s EBITDA was 
$87.7 million in 2016, compared to 
$78.8 million in 2015, reflecting tight 
cost management which reduced 
costs by 7.6% compared to the 
previous year. 
TRANSPORT TONNAGE
During 2016 the division transported 
6.5 million tonnes, compared to 
6.1 million tonnes in 2015. This 
6.3% increase was due to increased 
customer demand, improved 
performance of rolling stock and 
better fleet utilisation, which allowed 
more acid and copper and other 
concentrates to be transported.
This increase in tonnage 
transported marks the reversal of 
a downward trend since 2013 and 
further growth is expected in the 
medium term. 
COSTS
Cost management was focused on 
optimising the division’s business 
processes to ensure the lasting 
competitiveness of its services. This 
was achieved by better utilisation 
of the fleet resulting in greater 
fuel efficiency, savings in the use 
of third-party services, and other 
organisational changes.

50 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 OUTLOOK
The division will also develop 
new business opportunities and 
optimise the use of rolling stock and 
utilisation of the fleet. One area of 
emphasis will be on maintenance, 
using knowledge gained from 
the mining division. Maintenance 
practice will be strengthened in 
order to deliver more consistent 
fleet availability, thereby improving 
operating continuity and budget 
compliance. This will ensure a 
seamlessly integrated fleet and 
more efficient use of assets 
and resources.
In the medium term, copper 
production in the Antofagasta 
Region will change from metallic 
copper output to concentrate, 
increasing the mass to be 
transported, and declining 
ore grades will increase the 
consumption of bulk supplies. 
These factors present unique 
opportunities for the transport 
division and will drive revenue 
growth in the medium to long term.
SUSTAINABILITY
Sustainability is an integral part of the division’s new management 
model, as the safety and health of employees and engagement 
with local communities are key to long-term success. It has been 
incorporated into the systems of both the division and the Group 
overall, enabling efficient co-ordination with the mining division’s 
operations in the region.
Safety and health: As part of the management model a new Health, 
Safety and Security role was created on the division’s Executive 
Committee. Employees’ responsibility for their own and their 
colleagues’ safety has been emphasised and improved risk and 
accident reporting introduced as a result of lessons learned from 
the first fatality in the division for five years. 
This tragic fatality occurred in July 2016, a year that otherwise showed 
an improvement in the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), which 
fell by 55% compared to 2015. Incident reporting increased by 270% 
over the same period, reflecting take-up of the new reporting metric.
Communities: A Sustainability and Public Affairs Manager was 
appointed and internal and external baseline studies were conducted. 
The division also began to work on strengthening its image in 
the region.
In 2017, the focus will be on embedding the preventive safety and 
health culture, with a clear emphasis on individual responsibility, 
and deepening the interaction with local communities.

THE GROUP’S APPROACH 
TO SUSTAINABILITY 
For Antofagasta, sustainable mining means prioritising employees’ 
safety and health and taking responsibility for environmental 
stewardship while engaging transparently with stakeholders. 
Sustainable operation is an ongoing process in the face of increasingly demanding challenges. The Group is committed to the continuous 
improvement of its social and environmental practices and its Board is responsible for ensuring that sustainability is embedded in all 
decision-making throughout the mining cycle. This approach is closely aligned with its corporate values and the International Council 
on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Principles.
2016 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
The Group’s sustainability priorities are determined both by business risks 
and by the key concerns and expectations of its stakeholders. In 2016, the 
Group focused on:
1
 Striving to achieve zero fatalities while continuing to improve safety and 
health performance. Regrettably, two employees lost their lives in fatal 
accidents. 
2
Addressing long-running claims by the Caimanes community. Following 
an agreement reached with the community in April, the two outstanding 
court cases were substantively resolved in favour of Los Pelambres in 
November 2016. 
3
Delivering on commitments made to communities as part of the Somos 
Choapa engagement process and extending its principles and 
methodology to other districts.
4 Pioneering the involvement of the Caimanes community in creating 
an emergency preparedness plan for the El Mauro dam.
5 Progressing strategies to address climate change and biodiversity.
6 Integrating Zaldívar into the Group’s culture. 
7 Strengthening corporate compliance procedures and increasing 
internal awareness.

52 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 FOCUS ON CONTRACTORS’ EMPLOYEES
Contractor employees are a particularly important part of the Group’s safety 
and health programme, as they represent some 70% of Antofagasta’s 
total workforce. In 2016 the focus was on accelerating the adoption of the 
corporate safety framework by contractors via the Corporate Security and 
Health Regulations for Contractors and Subcontractors (RECSS), training, 
data analysis and on-site audits.
The Group requires contractors to comply with its safety and health 
procedures, providing them with technical support and training and closely 
monitoring their safety performance, which is reported together with that 
of the Group’s own employees.
PERFORMANCE IN 2016
The Group has continued to reduce the severity and frequency of accidents, 
but has yet to eliminate fatalities altogether: in 2016 one worker died at 
Antucoya and another employee was involved in a fatal accident at the 
Group’s transport division. The Group is committed to improving compliance 
with the safety standards and timely management of early warning 
indicators. Compliance with the Safety model is audited twice a year 
at each site.

The Group is fully committed to achieving zero fatalities and to reducing 
the frequency and severity of accidents. Its safety and health strategy is 
risk based, in line with international best practices. Unfortunately, despite 
all efforts, two employees died in fatal accidents during the year, one at 
Antucoya and the other in the transport division. Though new standards, 
processes and tools are in place and the leadership is fully committed to 
safety, there is still more to be done to make each and every employee safe 
at work.
SAFETY IS A JOURNEY
Over the past three years the Group has implemented a corporate 
framework to increase employee and contractor safety at all of its 
operations. The first step was to define new standards and procedures. 
Next came raising awareness through intensive training, senior leadership 
on the ground and communications support. The biggest challenge today is 
embedding this model with employees and contractors; as with all cultural 
change, this will take time.
ADDRESSING KEY RISKS
Analysis of past accidents identified 15 types of risks that caused all of 
the fatalities. In 2016 the tools and processes for on-site verification of 
key safety controls were simplified on the basis of past experience, which 
showed that simpler procedures were more effective than complex ones.
There are six causes of all major health risks. The Group has concentrated 
on these risks by defining specific controls for each one.
In 2016 SAFEmap, a renowned international consultant, was hired to 
review the mining division’s safety strategy and identify gaps. This review 
included a safety culture survey answered by 3,500 employees. The 
resulting recommendations and the plans to address them were reviewed 
by the Board.
AWARENESS AND REPORTING
Safety reviews are conducted by the Executive Committee at every 
operation and the Committee uses its monthly visits to verify that the key 
controls for critical safety risks are being correctly applied at each site. 
It also oversees the investigation of high-potential risk events and publicly 
recognises employees for outstanding safe conduct. In 2016 the Group’s 
Executive Committee conducted seven on-site safety verifications.
Safety performance is reported weekly to the Executive Committee and 
monthly to the Board. The Sustainability and Stakeholder Management 
Committee reviews fatal and serious accidents in detail.
Raising awareness and persuading all employees to fully commit to their 
own and their colleagues’ safety remains a cultural challenge. Intensive 
on-site supervision and training, near-miss reporting, wide dissemination 
of information on the causes of severe accidents, site management meetings 
focused on safety, and public recognition of committed employees are 
among the many ways in which the Group’s safety practices are introduced 
and reinforced.
All new employees must complete a safety and health induction course 
and all existing employees and contractors regularly receive refresher 
training. There are also regular refresher workshops on safety policies 
and procedures, which consider best practices and lessons learnt from 
near-miss incidents.

53 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CONTINUED
SECURING KEY TALENT TO SUPPORT THE 
BUSINESS
Antofagasta believes that committed employees are key to the operation 
of a successful organisation, particularly in a challenging business 
environment. The aim of its Human Resources model is to ensure 
it has the organisational capability to achieve its strategy.
In 2016, the Group’s average total workforce was 18,600 people, of 
which almost 5,500 were employees and 13,100 contractors, compared 
with an average workforce of 19,200 in 2015. During the year a corporate 
reorganisation, implemented as part of the Cost and Competitiveness 
Programme, led to a reduction in the number of employees, mostly in 
supervisory positions at the operations.
LABOUR RELATIONS
The Group recognises employees’ rights to union membership and collective 
bargaining, with 68% of its employees holding union membership at its 
mining operations. There are ten unions across the Group; Centinela has 
four, including a supervisors’ union created in 2016, Los Pelambres has 
three, Zaldívar has two, and Antucoya one.
Labour agreements cover matters such as salaries, shift patterns and 
employment benefits and these are generally renegotiated with the unions 
every three years in accordance with Chilean legislation. In 2016, labour 
agreements were negotiated at Los Pelambres, Antucoya and Zaldívar for 
the period through 2019.
Among other provisions, Chilean law prescribes the maximum number of 
working hours and forbids child and forced labour.
The Group’s excellent labour relations are based on the provision of good 
working conditions, mutual trust and ongoing dialogue, which have resulted 
in fair labour agreements and the avoidance of strikes.
VALUE OFFER FOR EMPLOYEES
The Group’s mining division is the largest privately held mining group in 
Chile. It seeks to attract and retain talented and committed employees by 
offering opportunities to become part of a growing company with strong 
corporate values. The Group is not only committed to the development of 
its employees but to the development of the country, by setting examples 
in innovation, safety and excellence. It offers employees a safe work 
environment, quality accommodation, a fair salary and a good work/life 
balance, along with opportunities to further develop their talents.
MANAGING TALENT AND SUCCESSION
The mining division has a talent management system designed to hire and 
retain talented, committed people who take responsibility for their personal 
safety and development in order to support business growth. The Group, 
in turn, supports each employee within their present position, as well as 
provides opportunities for horizontal and vertical development via training 
and internal mobility. New positions are initially advertised internally 
and there is a succession plan in place for key positions. Employees in 
supervisory and managerial positions are offered periodic training to 
develop leadership skills.
During 2016 the Group invested $1.5 million dollars in training, providing 
an average of 2.5 hours of training per employee a month.
INCREASING GENDER DIVERSITY
In 2016 women represented 9% of the mining division’s workforce, of whom 
60% were supervisors or above and 10% held senior management roles. 
There are two female Board Directors and one Vice President.
CONTRACTORS – KEY PARTNERS
The Group aims to form stable, long-term relationships with key 
contractors who share its values and good practices. Contractors constitute 
over 70% of the mining division’s workforce, so keeping them aligned with 
the Group’s safety, ethical and operating standards is key to the Group’s 
success and reputation. Contractor companies are audited monthly to 
ensure their compliance with Chilean labour legislation and with the Group’s 
standards, which require contractors to offer their employees life insurance 
and a minimum salary well above the country’s minimum wage, among 
other benefits.
EMPLOYEES
ZALDÍVAR’S SUCCESSFUL 
INCORPORATION INTO THE 
ANTOFAGASTA GROUP
Human Resources had an important role in easing Zaldívar‘s 
employees into the Group’s structure and culture. Special efforts were 
made to share corporate values and communicate Antofagasta’s Code 
of Ethics. The Group’s performance management system was also 
implemented and Zaldívar employees have also been incorporated into 
the internal recruitment and mobility programme.
Sustainable management of the Group’s mining operations includes the 
prevention and mitigation of negative impact on neighbouring communities 
from the project stage until closure. The Group takes into account 
community expectations and adopts an approach consistent with its 
corporate values, human rights and the ICMM Principles.
SOMOS CHOAPA: ENGAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT
Antofagasta is a long-term neighbour, keen to understand local challenges, 
and contributes to help solve these in conjunction with the community, 
the government and other relevant stakeholders. The Group has been 
innovative in its approach to resolving community issues at Los Pelambres, 
where it developed a new engagement process called Somos Choapa. 
This addressed both community engagement and investment under the 
same five principles: dialogue, collaboration, traceability, excellence and 
transparency. Somos Choapa is being developed into a platform for ongoing 
communication between the mining company, communities, the government 
and other stakeholders on local development and other issues of common 
interest. It encourages neighbours to take an active role in the decisions 
affecting their communities and is intended to become an integrated 
roadmap for public-private investment. Having successfully developed this 
approach at Los Pelambres, the Group now plans to expand it to the rest 
of its mining operations.
Through Somos Choapa, neighbours voice expectations and concerns 
regarding community development and the projects designed to advance it. 
Los Pelambres funds an independent firm to design these projects, aided by 
technical input from the municipalities. This co-ordinated approach produces 
a better outcome based on a combination of public and private funds.
COMMUNITY RELATIONS
54 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 SUSTAINABILITY
CAIMANES – FROM CONFLICT TO COLLABORATION
Since Los Pelambres began building the El Mauro tailings dam, some 
13 km from Caimanes, it has faced over a decade of local protests involving 
lawsuits, roadblocks and demonstrations. However, in May 2016, after nine 
months of talks, an agreement between the mine and the community was 
formally approved by 83% of the community and the pending court cases 
were finally resolved.
The Group realised that the judicial path was not going to resolve the 
conflict. Instead it needed a solution to the issues underlying the lawsuits 
and this required engagement with all the parties involved. This process 
was guided by the Somos Choapa Principles and involved:
 − Thirteen open community meetings to discuss safety, water issues and 
Los Pelambres’ contribution to local development.
 − Full transparency during the meetings about the issues under discussion 
and what was being agreed. Anyone could attend the meetings, which 
were recorded in full and made available on the internet.
 − Formal consultation with the community under the supervision of external 
observers, including Chile Transparente.
 − A formal vote on the written agreement by all adult members of the 
community, which was approved by a vast majority.
The Caimanes Agreement covers:
 − Additional works to ensure water availability for the Caimanes 
community, even during severe drought, thus complying with the 
Supreme Court’s ruling.
 − Additional works suggested by the community to increase its confidence 
in the safety of the El Mauro tailings dam.
 − A fund to finance the development of the community and its 
member families.
A committee made up of representatives from the community, 
Los Pelambres and Chile Transparente oversees the implementation of 
the Agreement.
In 2016 Los Pelambres, in partnership with a local educational provider, 
endorsed the development of the Choapa’s first technical training centre to 
be located in Los Vilos. This centre will give young people who live in the 
area the opportunity to train in technical careers without the need to migrate 
away from their homes. It will be the first establishment of its kind in the 
province of Choapa.

SOCIAL RISKS AND IMPACTS
The mining division manages the impact of its operations on local 
communities, from project inception to closure, and Somos Choapa 
reflects the Group’s wish for this commitment to go beyond the mere 
legal requirements.
PREVENTING CONFLICT
Water scarcity is a major community concern in Los Pelambres’ area of 
influence. Besides operating the mine in a way to preserve water and being 
an active participant in local water management initiatives, the Company is 
leading the private-public Salamanca Agreement to assess other potential 
long-term solutions, such as the construction of a new public desalination 
facility and irrigation dams.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE
The Group’s dams and other facilities are designed to resist extreme 
weather conditions and severe earthquakes. This was demonstrated in 
September 2015 when Los Pelambres’ tailings dam, El Mauro, remained 
unaffected after an 8.5 earthquake, whose epicenter was located some 
50 km away. The dams have periodical revisions carried out by independent 
experts to verify its structural integrity.
As legally required, all four of the Group’s mining operations follow 
emergency procedures approved by the national mining authority and their 
response plans are co-ordinated with public agencies and other authorities. 
These plans include preventive and corrective operating measures at 
each site.
INNOVATION, COMMUNITY AND 
EMERGENCY PLAN
In 2016, using the approach developed as part of the Somos Choapa 
programme, Los Pelambres and the residents of the neighbouring 
Caimanes community discussed an agreed response procedure in 
case of an emergency at the El Mauro tailings dam. As a result, the 
legally required emergency procedure was supplemented with a 
new Contingency Plan, which involved defining a new safety zone in 
the community as well as measures to issue warnings and improve 
evacuation procedures for any type of emergency. The implementation 
of this plan started in 2016 and will be completed in 2017.
STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
55 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK INNOVATION TO REDUCE THE IMPACT 
OF MINING
The Group continues to seek and find new solutions to mining 
challenges. It pioneered the use of untreated sea water at its Michilla 
operation in the 1990s and later did the same, on a much larger scale, 
at Esperanza (now Centinela) and then Antucoya. In 2016, Centinela 
installed paste thickeners to increase the proportion of water being 
recycled, depositing paste tailings and removing the need for a 
conventional tailings dam.
In 2016 the Group participated in several research programmes 
on tailings management, acidic water treatment, dust control, tyre 
recycling and a plan to cover old tailings dams with endemic species 
of vegetation.
The Group endeavours to avoid environmental incidents and to comply with 
its legal commitments under its operating permits. Environmental incidents 
have the potential to damage the environment as well as community 
relations. They can also result in sanctions and even the cancellation of 
key permits.
The Group’s environmental stewardship priorities are:
 − Ensuring compliance with all of its commitments under its operating 
permits, also known as the Environmental Approval Resolution (RCA).
 − Ensuring that all key environmental risk controls are in place.
 − Enabling the environmentally sound development of mining projects 
through the early identification and assessment of their potential 
environmental impact.
 − Developing adequate responses to the mitigation of climate change, 
protection of biodiversity and ensuring the proper closure of 
mining operations.
In 2016 Antofagasta updated its environmental management system. 
The immediate goal was to get all four of its mining operations applying 
the same standards to the assessment of environmental risk and to ensure 
full compliance with their operating permits. A system to track the sites’ 
compliance with their operating permits and to issue automatic alerts in 
case of breaches is under development.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA)
In Chile, all mining projects undergo a stringent environmental and social 
impact assessment (EIA) that is reviewed by the national Environmental 
Assessment Service and includes formal consultation with local 
communities and indigenous people. If the project is approved, its impact 
prevention, mitigation and compensation commitments become legally 
binding, contained in its RCA. The national Environmental Administration 
department regularly reviews companies’ compliance with these 
commitments and any failures can result in severe fines and eventually 
the revocation of the RCA.
In April 2016, Los Pelambres submitted the EIA application for its 
Incremental Expansion project and in December Centinela received approval 
of its application for the Second Concentrator project, submitted in 2015.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT
The Group’s operations are located in two areas in Chile. Los Pelambres 
is in the central Andean zone, at the head of the agricultural Choapa 
valley. Its main environmental issues are water, air quality, biodiversity 
and archaeology. Centinela, Zaldívar and Antucoya are further north, 
in the Atacama Desert, with no agriculture nearby and only small local 
communities as neighbours, none of which are in close proximity to 
the sites.
WATER MANAGEMENT
Antofagasta minimises its use of continental water resources through 
efficient consumption and by using sea water. Two of the Group’s newest 
mines, Antucoya and Centinela Concentrates, use untreated sea water. 
Centinela Cathodes, Zaldívar and Los Pelambres still use continental water. 
However, a desalination plant will be built as part of the Los Pelambres 
Incremental Expansion project to satisfy any increased water needs 
at Los Pelambres and to supplement the mine’s requirements in case 
of drought.
The Group has achieved high water reuse rates of up to 86%, with zero 
discharge to waterways. The remainder of the water either evaporates or 
remains in the tailings dam. In 2016 it consumed 56 million m
3
 of water, 
53% of which was continental water and 47% was sea water. 
All of the Group’s mining operations have water management plans. 
Water quantity and quality are monitored respectively by the Chilean Water 
Bureau and the Chilean Health Bureau. Local communities also participate 
in this monitoring at Los Pelambres since 2012. The quality of sea water 
is monitored at the port of Los Pelambres and at the dock that serves the 
Centinela and Antucoya operations.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CONTINUED
ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
The acquisition of Zaldívar and the ramping-up of Antucoya have increased 
the Group’s water consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 
mining waste production, although some of these increases were offset by 
the closure of Michilla at the end of 2015. However, efforts are underway to 
maintain efficiency indicators.
LOS PELAMBRES ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLAINT
In October 2016 Los Pelambres received notification of various charges 
against it from the Chilean environmental authority (SMA). The Company 
remains committed to full compliance and is working to address these 
charges, some of which have been under discussion for several years. 
The charges do not relate to the court cases that were resolved in 2016 
nor to the protests regarding water availability in 2015. Los Pelambres 
is analysing various alternatives and is confident that it can resolve the 
situation in a manner acceptable to the SMA.
56 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 CLIMATE CHANGE
Chile is vulnerable to climate change, which has increased average 
temperatures and reduced rainfall in the northern and central regions of the 
country. The Chilean government has committed to a 30% reduction in GHG 
emissions intensity by 2030, despite the country contributing only 0.2% to 
global emissions.
The Group continues to work on limiting GHG emissions through improved 
energy efficiency and renewable sourcing. The Group began reporting 
its GHG emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in 2009 and 
developed its first integrated climate change strategy in 2015, the main 
features of which are:
 − Identifying risks and opportunities for the Group’s operations arising from 
climate change.
 − Encouraging innovation to improve energy efficiency and the use of 
clean energy.
 − Mitigating GHG emissions.
 − Measuring progress and reporting results, including CO
2
 emissions, in 
accordance with the CDP.
The Group’s production growth will increase 
GHG emissions. However, it is committed to 
offsetting this by improving energy efﬁ ciency 
and increasing its use of renewable energy.
Antofagasta has no signiﬁ cant gaseous 
emissions other than GHG.
MINING WASTE
Waste at large-scale mining operations is in the form of rock, spent ore and 
tailings. Tailings are the material remaining after the valuable portion of the 
ore has been separated from the uneconomic portion. Los Pelambres and 
Centinela Concentrates use a flotation process and deposit their mining 
waste in licensed tailings storage facilities. Antucoya, Zaldívar and Centinela 
Cathodes use leaching to produce copper and have fully-permitted spent 
ore dumps.
Centinela was the first large-scale mine in the world to use water-efficient 
thickened tailings technology that also makes tailings more stable and offers 
better dust control. Its expansion project will also use thickened tailings.
Other solid industrial and domestic waste is separated and stored prior to 
final disposal, in compliance with Chilean regulations for each type of waste.
The Group has pioneered the use of raw sea 
water and thickened tailings technology to 
reduce its consumption of continental water.
SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
The Group’s energy demands are rising as a result of higher throughput 
at its operations. As production increases and grades decline, haulage 
distances rise and a greater volume of water must be pumped from the 
sea. As energy represents around 15% of the mining division’s total costs, 
investing in new and clean energy sources has major commercial as well as 
environmental benefits.
Over the past few years, the Group has secured renewable energy for 
Los Pelambres from conveyor belt self-generation as well as several wind 
and solar sources. Renewables accounted for 42% of Los Pelambres’ total 
energy requirement during 2016 and this is expected to increase to 80% 
on completion of the Alto Maipo hydroelectric project. Centinela, Antucoya 
and Zaldívar have long-term fuel indexed supply contracts, secured prior 
to renewable sources becoming available, but as the contracts expire the 
Group expects to be able to benefit from increasing renewable supply. 
The Group remains committed to the efﬁ cient 
use of energy to reduce consumption per unit 
of production and increase the percentage of 
energy generated from renewable sources.

57 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK BIODIVERSITY
The Group has no operations in protected areas. Its biodiversity challenges 
are concentrated around Los Pelambres, which is at the head of the Choapa 
valley, one of the world’s top 25 biodiversity areas due to its varied native 
vegetation. The Group’s conservation efforts began in 2000, when it 
protected and rehabilitated an area previously used as an illegal waste dump 
into what is now an internationally-recognised coastal wetland under the 
Ramsar Convention. It also protects one of the last remaining Chilean palm 
forests and in 2014 bought a 62.7-hectare site to ensure the conservation of 
the rare temperate relict rainforest of Santa Ines.
In 2016 the Group produced its first Biodiversity Standard, developed with 
the support of the Wildlife Conservation Society while incorporating the 
ICMM’s policy guidelines on the subject. The Standard includes a hierarchy 
of good practices to meet its objectives, in order to:
 − Avoid or reduce as much as possible the impact of the Group’s operations 
on biodiversity and associated ecosystems.
 − Restore and/or compensate, as appropriate, when there is 
unavoidable impact.
 − Generate additional benefits to the environment.
 − Increase biodiversity awareness within the organisation.
 − Consider biodiversity in the decision-making process.
The main biodiversity challenges for Centinela, Antucoya and Zaldívar 
are associated with the protection of the fauna occasionally found 
near their sites. Los Pelambres and Centinela also monitor the marine 
ecosystems at their port facilities for rapid detection of any impact on the 
marine environment.
In order to update this information in line with the new Biodiversity 
Standard, all four mining operations have now begun to assess their own 
biodiversity performance. 
DUST CONTROL
Los Pelambres has developed a predictive model to anticipate local 
weather affecting air quality around its operations. This information 
is used to prevent critical dust episodes by rescheduling blasting and 
even, at times, suspending some activities. The company also uses a 
set of measures to prevent and mitigate dust emissions at the mine 
and its facilities, which are also closely monitored by its neighbours.
This preventive approach has proved effective, allowing Los Pelambres 
to operate below the legally permitted dust emission limits.
SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE
The Group’s Sustainability and Stakeholder Management Board Committee 
oversees sustainability strategy and targets.
The Sustainability and Stakeholder Management Committee is one of five 
committees supporting the Board and met four times in 2016. The Vice 
President of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability oversees environmental, 
communications and public affairs issues for the Group and in addition each 
mining company and the transport division has a sustainability manager.
 Further information on the Board and its Sustainability and Stakeholder 
Management Committee can be found on pages 92 to 93.
ETHICS AND CORRUPTION PREVENTION
The Group’s Code of Ethics was updated in 2016 to include modern slavery 
and to emphasise respect for human rights. It sets out the conduct expected 
of directors, executives, employees and contractors, not just within the 
Group but in their dealings with all stakeholders. It reflects the Group’s core 
values of Respect, Safety and Health, Sustainability, Excellence, Innovation 
and Forward Thinking.
The Crime Prevention Manual defines conflicts of interest and outlines 
an anonymous whistleblowing procedure offering multiple methods 
of communication. In 2016 all employees were asked to complete a 
Declaration of Interest questionnaire in order to prevent potential conflicts 
and approximately 1,000 workers participated in compliance workshops. 
Contractor companies are also trained to adhere to the Group’s compliance 
standards and are expected to report any unethical conduct.
 Further information on the Group’s Code of Ethics and Crime 
Prevention Manual can be found on the Group’s website,
 www.antofagasta.co.uk.
PAYMENTS TO GOVERNMENTS
The Group makes payments to governments related to activities involving 
exploration and the discovery, development and extraction of minerals. In 
June 2016, in accordance with specific UK regulations and requirements, 
the Group published a report detailing the mining division’s payments to 
governments for the year ended 31 December 2015. These were primarily 
taxes paid to national, regional and local governments, and mineral licence 
fees. In 2015 these payments totalled $278 million, of which 99.9% were 
paid in Chile. 
 The full report is available on the Group’s website at 
www.antofagasta.co.uk.
Chilean law allows political contributions subject to certain requirements, 
but the Group made none in 2016. However, it often contributes financing 
for projects that benefit neighbouring communities, in alliance with the 
municipalities and the government. These contributions are regulated by 
specific laws and reviewed by the Chilean Internal Revenue Service.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CONTINUED
CLOSURE PLANNING
Chilean legislation requires mining operations to have comprehensive 
closure plans approved by the National Geology and Mining Service 
(Sernageomin). These plans identify key issues and define risk control 
measures that focus on preventing pollution and ensuring the permanent 
stability of the tailings dams. Plans include budgeting for remediation 
work on closure and providing the financial resources to implement them. 
Closure plans must be submitted for all new mining projects as part of their 
original application for environmental approval and must be updated every 
five years.
In 2016 the Group approved a new corporate 
closure standard that goes beyond what is 
legally required and provides further guidance 
on the management of environmental and social 
issues at the time of closure.
 For more information can be found in the Sustainability Report 2016.
58 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 HUMAN RIGHTS
The Group’s respect for human rights is reflected in its commitments 
to its employees, contractors and neighbouring communities:
 − High safety and health standards
 − Fair wages and good labour relations
 − Prevention of discrimination, harassment and bullying
 − Application of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015
 − Provision of quality accommodation, services and facilities at 
the operations
 − Opportunities for training and development
 − Prevention of corruption and malpractice
 − Prevention or mitigation of environmental and social impacts
 − Respecting communities’ rights, culture and heritage
 − Engaging in dialogue from exploration to closure
 − Responding to grievances
 − Supporting community development
SUSTAINABILITY
Zaldívar is located 100 km from the Peine 
indigenous community, with which it has 
established a relationship and will make sure to 
comply with the framework provided by Chilean 
legislation, ILO Convention 169 and the ICMM’s 
recommendations.
MODERN SLAVERY ACT
Section 54 of the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires any company 
operating a business in the UK, which supplies goods or services and 
has a total annual turnover of £36 million or more, to publish an annual 
statement setting out the steps it has taken to ensure that slavery and 
human trafficking are not occurring in its supply chains or in any part of 
its business.
In 2016 the Group prepared and published a statement for the first 
time. This statement has been approved by the Antofagasta plc Board. 
A full copy of the statement is available on the Company’s website at: 
www.antofagasta.co.uk.
Steps were also taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking do not 
occur in the Company’s supply chains or in any part of its business, and 
it intends to build on these actions over the coming years. The following 
actions were taken in 2016. 
 − Policies and Procedures: The Code of Ethics was reviewed and 
updated to prohibit the exercise of any form of exploitation or other 
behaviours constituting slavery or human trafficking. This includes the 
requirement that all employees and suppliers must report any conduct 
that is not in accordance with the Code of Ethics. All reported incidents 
will be thoroughly investigated to determine whether further action 
should be taken. All new contracts with suppliers include specific clauses 
requiring them to comply with the Group’s compliance model.
 − Due Diligence: Due diligence is performed on all new suppliers before 
they are engaged and periodically thereafter. The process requires 
suppliers to complete a questionnaire explaining their relevant internal 
models and procedures and includes third-party background checks.
 − Risk Assessment, Accountability and Results: As part of the Group’s 
risk assessment process, all suppliers are reviewed, based on due 
diligence analysis, the supplier’s location and the slavery index of 
the country in which they operate. During 2016, none of the Group’s 
reviewed suppliers had issues relating to forced labour, child labour or 
human trafficking.
 − Education and Training: During 2016 the new employee induction 
training programme and the e-learning training courses for existing 
employees and contractors were updated to include training to ensure 
that slavery and human trafficking are not occurring in the Group or in its 
supply chains.
In 2017 the Group plans to:
 − Monitor the effectiveness of actions taken to ensure that slavery and 
human trafficking are not occurring in the Group or in its supply chains.
 − Engage external consultants to review its suppliers and the steps that 
they have taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not 
occurring in their supply chains.
The Group’s current procedures, combined with these steps and the 
continual improvement of its compliance model, confirms to the Board that 
the likelihood of modern slavery taking place in its first-tier suppliers 
or in any part of its business is low and that it took appropriate steps 
in 2016 to confirm this and to extend the scope and effectiveness of its 
supplier assessments.
  More information can be found in the Risk Management section on 
page 20.
COMPLIANCE AND SUPPLIERS
The Group’s risk management and compliance function is responsible for 
the corporate compliance programme overseen by the Board’s Audit and 
Risk Committee. Suppliers are required to provide specific information 
on their procedures concerning safety, anti-corruption, antitrust, modern 
slavery and other areas.

In 2016 revenue also includes a loss of $2.2 million (2015 – nil) relating to 
commodity derivatives which matured during the year. 
 Further details of hedging activity in the period are given in Note 25 to 
the ﬁ nancial statements.
(III) TOLLING CHARGES
Tolling charges for copper concentrate increased by $7.0 million to 
$301.0 million in 2016 from $294.0 million in 2015. Tolling charges are 
deducted from concentrate sales when reporting revenue and hence the 
increase in these charges has had a negative impact on revenue.
REVENUE FROM MOLYBDENUM, GOLD AND OTHER 
BY-PRODUCT SALES
Revenue from by-product sales at Los Pelambres and Centinela relate 
mainly to molybdenum and gold and, to a lesser extent, silver. Revenue from 
by-products increased by $92.2 million or 22.6% to $499.9 million in 2016, 
compared with $407.7 million in 2015.
Revenue from gold sales (net of tolling charges) was $339.7 million 
(2015–$252.0 million), an increase of $87.7 million, which mainly reflected 
an increase in volumes and a higher realised price. The realised gold 
price was $1,256.1/oz in 2016 compared with $1,154.5/oz in 2015, with the 
increase reflecting higher market prices. Gold sales volumes increased by 
23.8% from 219,200 ounces in 2015 to 271,400 ounces in 2016, mainly due 
to higher grades at Centinela.

Total EBITDA in 2016 1,626.1
REVENUE
Revenue for the Group in 2016 was $3,621.7 million, 12.3% higher than in 
2015. The increase of $396.0 million mainly reflected an increase in copper 
sales volumes and the realised copper price, as well as higher gold and 
silver revenue.
REVENUE FROM THE MINING DIVISION
REVENUE FROM COPPER SALES
Revenue from copper concentrate and copper cathode sales increased by 
$296.0 million, or 11.1%, to $2,961.6 million, compared with $2,665.6 million 
in 2015. The increase reflected the impact of higher sales volumes and 
slightly higher realised prices.
(I) COPPER VOLUMES
Copper sales volumes reflected within revenue increased from 590,400 
tonnes in 2015 to 634,000 tonnes in 2016 increasing revenue by 
$218.5 million. This increase was mainly due to Antucoya which achieved 
commercial production on 1 April 2016, and which recorded sales volumes 
of 54,900 tonnes reflected within revenue from that point onwards.
(II) REALISED COPPER PRICES
The Group’s average realised copper price increased by 2.2% to $2.33/lb in 
2016 (2015 – $2.28/lb) despite the market price having fallen by 11.6%. This 
was due to a significant year-end positive price adjustment of $153.6 million 
with the copper price ending the year at $2.51/lb, compared with a decrease 
of $291.2 million in 2015. The increase in the average realised price led to 
an $84.5 million increase in revenue from copper sales.
Realised copper prices are determined by comparing revenue (gross of 
tolling charges for concentrate sales) with sales volumes in the period. 
Realised copper prices differ from market prices mainly because, in line 
with industry practice, concentrate and cathode sales agreements generally 
provide for provisional pricing at the time of shipment with final pricing 
STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
61 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK Revenue from molybdenum sales (net of roasting charges) was 
$94.0 million (2015–$105.3 million), a decrease of $11.3 million. The 
decrease was mainly due to lower sales volumes of 7,200 tonnes (2015 
– 9,900 tonnes), partly offset by an increased realised price of $6.8/lb 
(2015–$5.7/lb).
Revenue from silver sales increased by $15.8 million to $66.2 million in 
2016 (2015–$50.4 million). The increase was due to higher sales volumes 
of 3.7 million ounces (2015 – 3.3 million ounces) and an increased realised 
silver price of $17.5/oz (2015–$15.4/oz).
REVENUE FROM THE TRANSPORT DIVISION
Revenue from the transport division (FCAB) increased by $7.8 million or 
5.1% to $160.2 million, mainly due to higher tonnages transported.
OPERATING COSTS (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION, LOSS ON 
DISPOSALS AND IMPAIRMENTS)
Operating costs (excluding depreciation, loss on disposals and impairments) 
amounted to $2,100.0 million (2015 – $2,349.1 million), a decrease of 
$249.1 million despite copper sales volumes having increased by 9.8%. 
This was mainly due to lower mine operating costs and reduced exploration 
& evaluation and corporate expenditure.
OPERATING COSTS (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION, LOSS 
ON DISPOSALS AND IMPAIRMENTS) AT THE MINING 
DIVISION
Operating costs (excluding depreciation, loss on disposals and impairments) 
at the mining division decreased by $242.0 million to $2,013.1 million in 
2016, a decrease of 10.7%. Of this decrease, $220.7 million is attributable to 
lower mine-site operating costs. This reduction in mine-site costs reflected 
significant cost savings achieved during the year as well the impact of a 
revised estimation of deferred stripping costs, partly offset by additional 
costs resulting from the higher production volumes in the year. Reflecting 
these decrease costs, weighted average unit cash costs excluding by-
product credits (which are reported as part of revenue) and tolling charges 
for concentrates (which are deducted from revenue) decreased from 
$1.58/lb in 2015 to $1.33/lb in 2016.
Exploration & evaluation costs decreased by $57.6 million to $44.3 million 
(2015 – $101.9 million). This reflected a general decrease in exploration 
activity, in particular at the Centinela District in Chile and the Twin Metals 
project in the United States. Corporate costs decreased by $11.1 million 
compared with 2015, and costs relating to the mine closure provisions 
decreased by $23.2 million. These decreases were partly offset by a 
$70.6 million increase in other expenses, largely relating to increased 
community spend at Los Pelambres.
OPERATING COSTS (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND 
LOSS ON DISPOSALS) AT THE TRANSPORT DIVISION
Operating costs (excluding depreciation and loss on disposals) at the 
transport division decreased by $7.1 million to $86.9 million, mainly reflecting 
lower diesel prices and a decrease in services provided by third parties.
EBITDA
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation) increased 
by $716.0 million or 78.7% to $1,626.1 million in 2016 (2015–$910.1 million). 
EBITDA includes the Group’s proportional share of EBITDA from associates 
and joint ventures
EBITDA from the Group’s mining subsidiaries increased by 73.6% from 
$876.6 million in 2015 to $1,521.7 million in this year. As explained above, 
this was mainly due to the decrease in revenue, lower unit cash costs, and 
lower exploration & evaluation and corporate costs.
EBITDA at the transport division increased by $8.9 million to $87.7 million 
in 2016, reflecting the increased revenue and lower operating costs 
explained above.
The Group’s proportional share of EBITDA from associates and joint 
ventures included $85.1 million from Zaldívar (2015 – $6.8 million) and 
$19.3 million from other associates and joint ventures (2015 – $26.7 million).
DEPRECIATION, AMORTISATION AND DISPOSALS
The depreciation and amortisation charge was largely in-line with the prior 
year at $578.4 million (2015–$576.1 million). In addition, there were losses 
on disposals of assets of $19.7 million (2015 – loss of $11.5 million).
EXCEPTIONAL IMPAIRMENT PROVISIONS
The Group recognised exceptional impairment provisions with a total 
impact of $591.3 million before tax. After a corresponding tax credit of 
$204.9 million the after tax impact was $386.4 million.
The majority of this relates to the Group’s 40% interest in Alto Maipo 
SpA (“Alto Maipo”), which is developing two hydroelectric power stations 
in Chile. The remaining 60% controlling interest is held by AES Gener 
SA (“Gener”). The Group had been reviewing its options with respect to 
its investment in Alto Maipo following the announcement of a significant 
forecast cost overrun for the project. In January 2017 the Group entered 
into an agreement with Gener to dispose of its stake in Alto Maipo to 
Gener for a nominal consideration. Accordingly, an impairment provision 
of $367.6 million has been recognised in respect of the total carrying value 
relating to the project. This impairment provision resulted in a deferred tax 
credit of $95.0 million and so the post-tax impact is $272.6 million.
An impairment review was also conducted in respect of the Antucoya mine. 
Following the completion of construction, Antucoya achieved commercial 
production in April 2016 and then reached full production capacity in August 
2016. This process was slower than originally forecast so costs capitalised 
during the ramp-up period were greater than originally forecast and net 
depreciation of the assets commenced later than originally anticipated. The 
achievement of commercial production and full capacity during the year has 
allowed a final determination of the total capital cost of the project, including 
costs capitalised during the ramp-up to commercial production, along with 
an understanding of the actual operating performance of the mine. The 
impairment review determined that the recoverable amount of Antucoya’s 
assets was below their carrying value, and accordingly an impairment 
provision of $215.6 million (on a pre-tax basis) has been reflected in respect 
of Antucoya. This impairment provision resulted in a deferred tax credit of 
$99.4 million and so the post-tax impact is $116.2 million.
In addition, the Group’s Energia Andina joint venture holds an investment 
in the Javiera solar plant in Chile. In February 2017 the disposal of the 
interest in Javiera was agreed. The terms of the sale agreement indicate a 
recoverable value for the interest in Javiera which is $8.1 million below the 
carrying value and accordingly an impairment provision for this amount has 
been recognised. The sale agreement is subject to certain closing conditions, 
and the transaction is expected to complete during the first half of 2017.

This effective tax rate (excluding exceptional items) varied from the statutory rate principally due to the effect of increases in future first category tax rates 
on deferred tax balances (impact of $24.6 million / 2.8%), the effect of expenses not deductible for Chilean corporate tax purposes (principally the funding 
of expenses outside of Chile) and items not subject to first category tax (impact of $15.2 million / 1.7%), and the mining tax (impact of $60.1 million / 6.9%).
OUTPUT
OPERATING PROFIT FROM SUBSIDIARIES
As a result of the above factors, operating profit from subsidiaries increased 
in 2016 by 61.6% to $467.0 million. Of the exceptional impairment provisions 
outlined above $456.6 million was recorded within operating expenses, and 
therefore excluding the exceptional impairment provisions, operating profit 
was $923.6 million, a 219.6% increase compared to 2015.
SHARE OF RESULTS FROM ASSOCIATES AND JOINT 
VENTURES
The Group’s share of results from associates and joint ventures was a loss 
of $134.7 million in 2016, compared with a loss of $5.8 million in 2015. 
This was largely a reflection of the exceptional impairment provisions. Of 
the total impairment provision outlined above, $134.7 million was recorded 
within the share of results from associates and joint ventures. Excluding the 
impact of the exceptional impairment, the share of results from associates 
and joint ventures was a profit of $23.5 million (2015 – loss of $5.8 million). 
The improvement compared with the prior year mainly reflected a full year’s 
contribution from Zaldívar.
NET FINANCE EXPENSE
Net finance expense in 2016 was $71.1 million, compared with $40.4 million 
in 2015.

Net finance expense (71.1) (40.4)
Interest income increased from $17.5 million in 2015 to $26.9 million in 
2016 due to an increase in operating cash invested as a result of increased 
revenue in 2016.
Interest expense increased from $33.7 million in 2015 to $86.1 million in 
2016, mainly due to interest charges at Antucoya being expensed since 
the start of commercial production on 1 April 2016. Additionally, there 
was higher corporate interest expense reflecting a new long-term loan 
of $500 million taken out during the period.
Other finance items comprised a loss of $11.9 million (2015 – loss of 
$24.2 million) arising mainly from foreign exchange losses of $2.9 million 
in 2016, compared with a loss of $14.8 million in 2015.
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
As a result of the factors set out above, profit before tax increased by 
17.2% to $284.6 million (2015–$242.8 million). Excluding exceptional items, 
profit before tax was $875.9 million, a 260.7% increase compared with the 
prior year.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE
The tax charge for 2016 was $108.6 million and the effective tax rate was 
38.2%. The exceptional impairment provisions had an impact on the overall 
tax charge and the reconciliation of the effective tax rate. Excluding these 
exceptional impairment provisions, the 2016 tax charge was $313.5 million 
and the effective tax rate was 35.8%.

The Board determines the appropriate dividend each year based on 
consideration of the Group’s cash balance, the level of free cash flow and 
underlying earnings generated during the year and significant known or 
expected funding commitments. It is expected that the total annual dividend 
for each year would represent a payout ratio based on underlying net 
earnings for that year of at least 35%.
The Board has declared a final dividend of 2016 of 15.3 cents per ordinary 
share, which amounts to $150.8 million and will be paid on 26 May 2017 
to shareholders on the share register at the close of business on 
28 April 2017.
The Board declared an interim dividend for the first half of 2016 of 3.1 
cents per ordinary share, which amounted to $30.6 million and was paid 
on 30 September 2016 to shareholders on the share register at the close 
of business on 9 September 2016.
This gives total dividends proposed in relation to 2016 (including the interim 
dividend) of 18.4 cents per share or $181.4 million in total (2015 – 3.1 cents 
per ordinary share or $30.6 million in total).
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Capital expenditure decreased by $253.4 million from $1,048.5 million 
in 2015 to $795.1 million in the year. This was mainly due to decreased 
construction costs at Antucoya, which is now in operation, partly offset 
by increased expenditure at Los Pelambres, relating mainly to capitalised 
stripping costs.
NB: Capital expenditure figures quoted in this report are on a cash flow 
basis, unless stated otherwise.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group periodically uses derivative financial instruments to reduce 
exposure to commodity price movements. At 31 December 2016 
the Group had entered into min/max contracts at Centinela for a notional 
amount of 72,000 tonnes of copper production covering a period up to 
31 December 2017, with an average minimum price of $2.25/lb and an 
average maximum price of $2.84/lb. The Group also periodically uses 
interest rate swaps to swap the floating rate interest for fixed rate interest. 
At 31 December 2016 the Group had entered into contracts at Centinela 
for a maximum notional amount of $70 million at a weighted average fixed 
rate of 3.372 % maturing in August 2018. The Group had also entered into 
contracts in relation to a financing loan at the FCAB for a maximum notional 
amount of $90 million at a weighted average fixed rate of 1.634% maturing 
in August 2019.

account there were other tax payments of $194.6 million, mainly comprising 
tax relating to the disposal of Aguas de Antofagasta S.A. in 2015, as well as 
the recovery of $108.3 million relating to prior years.
In 2016 the disposal of subsidiary amount of $10.0 million related to the 
disposal of Michilla (2015–$947.3 million related to the disposal of Aguas 
de Antofagasta S.A.).
Contributions and loans to associates and joint ventures of $10.1 million

Tailings thickeners.  Q
 What does good corporate 
governance mean for the 
Company?
Expanding on my statement 
above, our aim is to have clearly 
defined roles and responsibilities, 
to promote and maintain a culture 
that encourages innovation and 
constructive challenge, to recruit and 
motivate the best talent available, 
to commit to regular, candid and 
objective review processes and 
to involve shareholders and other 
stakeholders in our deliberations.
In my letter of introduction to 
the 2015 Corporate Governance 
Report, I explained that one of my 
responsibilities as Chairman is to 
promote good corporate governance 
and as a Board, we continue 
to believe that good corporate 
governance is fundamental to the 
Company’s success.
This Corporate Governance Report 
sets out the framework that we have 
worked hard to put in place and 
that we believe is best suited to the 
Group’s businesses and strategy.
Q
 What have been the main 
changes in 2016?
We made a number of changes 
during the year. 
At the executive level, Iván Arriagada 
succeeded Diego Hernández as CEO 
now that Diego has completed his 
task of management restructuring. 
At Board level:
 − Francisca Castro joined the Board 
on 1 November 2016, following the 
retirement of Hugo Dryland. 
 − Ollie Oliveira succeeded William 
Hayes as Senior Independent 
Director and Audit and Risk 
Committee Chairman.
 − A number of changes were 
made to the Board Committees 
with effect from 1 January 2017, 
including the appointment of 
Vivianne Blanlot as Sustainability 
and Stakeholder Management 
Committee Chairman. 
We also conducted our second 
externally-facilitated Board and 
Board Committee effectiveness 
review during the year. This exercise 
has supported our view that 
significant improvements have been 
made in recent years. Further details 
are set out on pages 82 to 83.
Q
 How do the Board and 
management of the Company 
differ from other UK listed 
companies? 
As noted in my introductory letter at 
the beginning of this Annual Report, 
Chile holds 30% of global copper 
reserves, and the Group’s operations, 
corporate headquarters and all of 
our senior management are based 
in Chile. Understanding the country 
and, in particular, mining in Chile, is 
essential for our Board.
The Board comprises a strong 
mix of Chilean and international 
Directors with mining experience in 
Chile, and during 2016 all Directors 
made a concerted effort to visit the 
Group’s operations.
At the management level, the 
Group competes for talent with 
international and local businesses 
in Chile. This means that our 
approach to remuneration needs 
to take into account local market 
conditions and locally available 
remuneration structures.
The Group CEO is not a director. 
This is consistent with practice 
in Chile where local law prohibits 
CEOs of public companies from 
being directors of those companies 
Nevertheless, we voluntarily disclose 
his remuneration as if he were a 
member of the Board. Further details 
are set out in the 2016 Remuneration 
Report on pages 100 to 111.
Members of my family are also on 
the Board and on the Executive 
Committee. I am Non-Executive 
Chairman of the Company, my 
brother Andrónico Luksic C is a Non-
Executive Director and my nephew 
Andrónico Luksic L is Vice President 
of Development.
Members of the Luksic family 
are interested in the E. Abaroa 
Foundation, which is a controlling 
shareholder of the Company under 
the Listing Rules. Further details 
of the Company’s substantial 
shareholders are set out on page 70.
Q
 How does the absence of 
an executive as a director 
affect the interaction between 
Non-Executive Directors and 
management? 
In practice, the interaction 
between the Board and executive 
management is as you would expect 
between Non-Executive Directors 
and management in a typical UK-
listed company. 
Our Group CEO and Group CFO are 
invited to attend all Board meetings, 
our Group CEO is also invited to 
attend all Committee meetings and 
there is regular formal and informal 
dialogue between management and 
the Board.
The Board considers that there are 
considerable benefits associated 
with having a Board comprising 
exclusively Non-Executive Directors. 
Not only does it provide a broad 
range of perspectives, but also 
encourages robust debate with the 
Group’s executive management.
We remain satisfied that the 
current structure ensures rigorous 
and effective oversight of the 
management team and do not 
currently expect it to change.
Q
 How would you describe the 
Group’s culture? 
As a Board, we actively promote the 
values that have been developed and 
set by our employees. These values 
reflect our industry, the nature of our 
Company and Chilean culture. They 
include taking responsibility for safety

and health, respecting one another 
and being innovative in our approach 
and processes.
It is the Board’s responsibility to 
ensure that our values continue to 
be relevant and aligned with the 
expectations of our stakeholders. 
During 2017, our human resources 
team, under the supervision of 
the Remuneration and Talent 
Management Committee, will engage 
further with our employees and 
other relevant stakeholders to ensure 
that our current values continue to 
be embedded across the business 
and that expected behaviours are 
consistent with those values. Further 
details are set out on page 74.
Q
 Are you satisfied with the 
current Board composition? 
Yes. We have a diverse Board 
comprising Directors with a broad 
and complementary spectrum of 
skills, personalities and competencies.
As at the date of this report 
the Board has 11 Directors, 
comprising a Non-Executive 
Chairman and ten Non-Executive 
Directors, five of whom 
are independent.
The Directors’ biographies 
provide details of their Committee 
memberships as well as other 
principal directorships and external 
roles, and demonstrate a detailed 
knowledge of the mining industry, 
significant international business 
experience and a diversity of core 
skills and experience, as well 
as gender. All of the Directors 
have confirmed that their other 
commitments do not prevent them 
from devoting sufficient time to their 
roles. Further details are set out on 
pages 72 to 74. 
Q 
 What drives the Board’s 
approach to succession 
planning?
With support from the Nomination 
and Governance Committee, 
the Board bases succession plans 
on the need to maintain a broad and 
complementary spectrum of skills, 
personalities and competencies on 
the Board. 
To assist in this, the Board adopted 
the skills matrix set out on page 73 
during 2016. This was used to assist 
with the recruitment process that 
led to the appointment of Francisca 
Castro and also to update the 
succession plans for key Board 
and Committee roles. 
Q
 Will there be any further 
changes to the Board and its 
Committees in 2017?
We do not expect there to be any 
major changes in 2017.
As always, I welcome questions or 
comments from shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting.

UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council in September 2014 (available on the Financial Reporting 
Council website at www.frc.org.uk) sets out the governance 
principles and provisions that applied to the Company during the 
2016 financial year.
The Company complied with all of the detailed provisions of the Code 
in 2016.

STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
69 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK Q
 How do you see your role as 
Senior Independent Director?
It is my responsibility to support 
the Chairman on a number of 
levels. A major part is to ensure 
that he has a direct channel of 
communication to understand the 
issues that are especially important 
to the Board’s independent Non-
Executive Directors and to the 
Company’s shareholders.
I am based in the UK which 
allows me to keep in touch with 
shareholders, directors at other 
UK-listed companies and advisers, 
to ensure that the Chairman, 
the Board and the Group as a whole 
receive independent and objective 
feedback and challenge.
Q
 Are there any additional 
responsibilities attaching 
to this role given the 
Company has a controlling 
shareholder?
The Company has had a controlling 
shareholder for 36 years. Although 
the controlling shareholder’s track 
record has been excellent and 
speaks for itself, the Company’s 
obligations towards all its 
shareholders are always given the 
highest level of importance. It is 
part of my role to ensure that this 
continues to be the case and to give 
all shareholders a route by which 
they can make their opinions known.
In addition to the regulatory 
requirement for related party 
transactions outside the ordinary 
course of business to be subject 
to independent assessment and 
approval, the Company has for many 
years presented any such proposed 
related party transaction (regardless 
of its size) between the Company 
and the controlling shareholder 
or its associates to a committee 
of Directors who are independent 
from the controlling shareholder 
for approval.
In addition, as a Board, we are 
satisfied that the balance of the 
Board, in terms of background and 
independence, limits the scope 
for an individual or small group of 
individuals to dominate the Board’s 
decision-making.
Q
 What steps were taken by 
the Board to provide for an 
orderly succession to the 
role of Senior Independent 
Director?
I have been a Director of the 
Company since 2011. Since 
then, I have had a number of 
opportunities to gather perspectives 
on the Group from independent 
Directors and shareholders and 
other stakeholders.
Before my appointment as Senior 
Independent Director, I was 
approached by former Senior 
Independent Director, William 
Hayes, and the Chairman to discuss 
the responsibilities and expectations 
of the role. Together, we decided 
that the transition should commence 
with a number of meetings with 
shareholders and proxy voting

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
The Company provides Directors with the necessary resources to maintain 
and enhance their knowledge and capabilities. Directors are regularly 
updated on the Group’s businesses, the competitive and regulatory 
environment in which they operate and other changes affecting the Group 
as a whole. In 2016, this included a Board strategy session and briefings 
from industry experts on copper market dynamics and key changes to the 
regulatory and legal environment impacting the Group.
Directors based outside Chile visit Chile regularly to attend Board and 
Committee meetings and for other meetings with management. All Directors 
come to the UK at least once a year to attend the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting in London.
The Board and its Committees receive briefing materials in advance of 
each meeting. Directors also receive regular reports including analysis of 
key metrics in respect of safety, operating, financial, environmental and 
social performance, as well as key developments in the Group’s exploration, 
projects and business development activities, information on the commodity 
markets, the Group’s talent management activities and analysis of the 
Group’s financial investments. 
Regular topics to be covered in Board meetings are agreed at the beginning 
of each year as shown on page 79. The CEO provides timely updates to 
the Board on emerging issues. Materials are sent to Board and Committee 
members a week in advance of each meeting. Each presentation has a 
summary sheet setting out the objective, background, proposal, justification 
and risk analysis, and next steps. Materials include the CEO’s report, an 
open and candid summary of his views on evolving challenges, changes 
in risk assessments and emerging issues, as well as a management 
report, with detailed information on the Group’s performance against key 
performance indicators. Directors receive flash reports monthly with key 
monthly and year-to-date production and financial results, ensuring that 
the Board is continuously updated on the Group’s performance. The Board 
and each Committee maintain an action list that is reviewed at the beginning 
of each meeting to ensure that Directors’ enquiries and concerns are clearly 
identified and addressed.
All Directors have access to management and to such further information as 
is needed to discharge their duties and responsibilities fully and effectively. 
Executives present to the Board and its Committees on operating and 
development matters, allowing close interaction between Board members 
and a wide range of executive management.
All Directors are entitled to seek independent professional advice concerning 
the affairs of the Group at the Company’s expense. The Company has 
appropriate insurance in place to cover Directors against any claims that 
may be made against them.
All new Directors receive a thorough induction on joining 
the Board. This typically includes meetings with the 
Chairman, other Directors and senior executives, brieﬁ ngs 
on the Group’s operations and projects, and visits to the 
Group’s operations. All Directors receive detailed brieﬁ ngs 
on legal, regulatory and other developments that are 
relevant to directors of UK-listed companies.
INFORMATION 
AND PROFESSIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT
SITE VISITS
Directors are actively encouraged to visit the Group’s operations. 
This ensures that there is a strong connection between the strategic 
decisions being made by the Board and the realities and challenges 
being faced day-to-day in the Group’s operations. In 2016, individual 
Directors attended the Group’s operations and projects, including the 
new operations Zaldívar and Antucoya. The Projects Committee also 
visited Los Pelambres and Centinela to see first-hand the challenges 
associated with the Los Pelambres Incremental Expansion Project, 
the Centinela Second Concentrator Project, the Centinela Molybdenum 
Plant and the Encuentro Oxides Project.

STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
81 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK Regular and candid effectiveness reviews are part 
of the Board’s continuous improvement process.
AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT IDENTIFIED IN 
JANUARY 2016
Independent Audit reported that significant improvements have been made 
to Board effectiveness following the changes that had been made to address 
the areas for improvement identified in 2013. In particular:
 − the appointment of new independent Non-Executive Directors has 
improved Board balance and diversity;
 − the appointment of a Santiago-based Secretary to the Board has 
significantly improved Board planning, organisation, focus and follow-up;
 − specific requests made by the Board are followed through into agreed 
actions which are tracked and reviewed until they have been reported 
back to the Board;
 − the Committees are functioning well, allowing the Board to receive more 
detail and enhanced visibility across the business;
 − the introduction of a Projects Committee has improved Board oversight of 
project development and execution, informed capital allocation decisions 
and allowed the members of that Committee to add additional value to the 
management team; and
 − the management team has been strengthened, resulting in the Board 
having even greater confidence in management.
EXTERNAL REVIEW
REVIEWING 
THE BOARD’S 
EFFECTIVENESS
WHAT WE DID
WHAT WE ARE 
GOING TO DO
As envisaged in the 2015 Annual Report, 
we asked Independent Audit Limited
*
 
(“Independent Audit”) to conduct an 
externally-facilitated review of the 
effectiveness of the Board and its 
Committees in January 2016 to:
 − assess the Company’s progress in 
closing gaps that were identified in 
the 2013 external review; 
 − evaluate the Company’s response to 
the changes made to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in 2014;
 − analyse the Company’s response to 
the new FRC guidance on Internal 
Control and Risk Management; and 
 − benchmark Board and Committee 
effectiveness against other large 
publicly-listed companies in the UK.
We then worked on addressing the 
opportunities for improvement identified 
by Independent Audit. 
Independent Audit provided a progress 
report in January 2017 based on further 
interviews and observations so that we 
could focus further on specific areas for 
improvement in 2017 and beyond.
Significant improvements have been 
made to Board effectiveness over the last 
three years.
We will use the findings of the January 
2017 progress report to make targeted 
additional improvements to Board and 
Committee effectiveness in 2017. This will 
include maintaining the strengths and 
continuing to address those areas 
identified in January 2016 as in need 
of further improvement. 
EFFECTIVENESS
EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW
INTERNAL REVIEW
During the year, led by the Senior Independent Director, the Non-Executive 
Directors met without the Chairman present and reviewed the Chairman’s 
effectiveness. The Senior Independent Director subsequently met with 
the Chairman to provide feedback. The Chairman used these comments 
to develop further the effective operation of the Board. In turn, the 
Chairman reviewed the individual effectiveness of each of the Non-
Executive Directors.
* Independent Audit Limited is an external independent adviser with no other connection to the Company.
82 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT 
IDENTIFIED IN JANUARY 2016
Independent Audit reported that, although no major issues needed to be 
addressed in order to ensure that the Board and Committees continue to 
operate effectively, further improvements could be made by:
 − reflecting on the Group’s culture and how it affects the Group’s ability to 
cope with change, to work within controls, and to respect the Group’s 
values; and
 − changing the structure of materials circulated ahead of meetings to 
further enhance the quality of discussion, use of time, and ability for 
Directors to focus on key strategic issues and risks; 
JANUARY 2017 PROGRESS REPORT
Improvement is a continuous process and Independent Audit’s January 2017 
progress report noted that:
 − a very thorough approach to follow-through of the agreed actions has 
been adopted;
 − considerable progress has been made across many aspects of the 
Board’s activity, including a strong focus on cost and competitiveness as 
well as considerable attention given to other crucial areas, including 
relations with local communities, and to safety and health; and
 − looking ahead, management will need to focus on the further 
development of the information provided to Directors to help support 
discussion of the main challenges and risks, and the Board will need to 
assess how the Group will respond to industry trends, macroeconomic 
developments and innovation.

FEMALE DIRECTORS TO TWO
Q
 What is the main function 
of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee?
We support the Board in ensuring 
that the Group has effective 
governance structures in place, 
that the Board and its Committees 
are operating effectively and that 
the Board and its Committees 
are comprised of Directors with 
necessary and appropriate skills. 
We make recommendations for 
change where appropriate. 
This involves: 
 − monitoring trends, initiatives 
and proposals in relation to 
corporate governance;
 − overseeing and facilitating 
annual reviews of the 
Chairman, Directors and the 
Board, including externally 
facilitated reviews;
 − evaluating and overseeing the 
balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board and its 
Committees and reviewing the 
independence of Directors; and 
 − overseeing Board and CEO 
succession plans and leading the 
process of identifying suitable 
candidates to fill vacancies, 
nominating such candidates 
for approval by the Board and 
ensuring that the appointments 
are made on merit and against 
objective criteria.
Q
 What has the Committee been 
working on during 2016?
2016 has been a period of 
significant activity and the 
Committee met on six occasions, 
recommending the implementation 
of, and changes to, Board and 
Committee succession plans, 
culminating in the changes set 
out on page 68 and overseeing 
the externally facilitated Board 
effectiveness review as described 
on pages 82 and 83. 
Q
 What are the steps that you 
take to identify and appoint 
new Directors?
When we are looking for a new 
Director, we consider the skills, 
experience and knowledge of the 
existing Directors and identify 
potential candidates who would 
best meet a number of criteria, 
including relevant experience, skills, 
personality type, contribution to 
Board diversity and whether they 
have sufficient time to devote to the 
role. The steps taken to identify and 
appoint independent Non-Executive 
Director Francisca Castro are set 
out on page 87.
Q
 How important is a 
comprehensive induction 
process for new Directors?
It is essential both for the new 
Director and for the Company.
I am responsible for ensuring that 
any new Directors receive a full 
induction on joining the Board, and 
the Secretary to the Board and the 
Company Secretary both assist with 
this process. 
Details of the induction process 
for Francisca Castro are set out on 
page 81.
Q
 Do you think it is important 
to have a Board review 
each year?
Improvement is a continuous 
process and we welcome the 
opportunity to regularly assess 
how effectively we operate as a 
Board and how we can improve 
even further.
The assessment of the Board and 
its Committees through an annual 
review has now become part of 
the normal governance cycle and 
we consider it to be a very useful 
process. We plan our reviews on 
the basis that at least every three 
years we will conduct an external 
effectiveness review. An external 
review was held in 2013 and again 
in 2016 and the details of the most 
recent review are set out on pages 
82 and 83. 
It is useful to assess the 
commitment of individual Directors 
to ensure that they have enough 
time available to devote to their 
roles, and I am satisfied that this 
is true for all our Directors.
THE BOARD’S APPROACH TO 
SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Committee periodically reviews the composition of the Board and 
its Committees. The Committee regularly discusses relevant profiles 
for future appointments and, when required, assists the Board in 
identifying appropriate candidates. 
The Committee reviewed succession plans for all Board and 
Committee roles in 2016. 
The Committee regularly reviews the written succession plans in 
place for the Board and Committees to ensure that vacancies can 
be appropriately filled. Contingency plans are in place for a range of 
situations, including the loss of key personnel.
During 2016, the Committee thoroughly reviewed the skills matrix 
which sets out the core competencies and areas of expertise on the 
Board, highlighting areas to be addressed in the future and amending 
the skills in the matrix to reflect changes in the Group’s strategy and in 
the current market environment.
JEAN-PAUL LUKSIC, CHAIRMAN
86 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Q
 What prompted the changes 
to the composition of 
the Board Committees in 
November 2016?
We review the membership of 
each Board Committee annually 
and, following the 2016 review, 
recommended a number of changes 
for approval by the Board. This was 
with the intention of refreshing and 
strengthening the performance of 
each Committee. 
We expect the composition of 
the Board and its Committees to 
remain unchanged in 2017. 
Q
 How is diversity taken into 
account when making Board 
appointments?
The Board comprises highly capable 
and committed individuals with a 
diverse range of technical skills, 
backgrounds, expertise, cultures, 
nationalities and perspectives.
The Board benefits from the 
diversity of personal attributes 
among Board members. Diversity of 
culture, views, attitudes, background 
and gender is important to ensure 
that the Board is not composed 
solely of like-minded individuals. 
As part of the annual review 
process, the Board assesses 
its effectiveness in meeting its 
diversity goals.
The Board believes in the benefits 
of diversity, including gender, and in 
2016 the appointment of Francisca 
Castro increased the number of 
female Directors to two.
The Board plans to continue to have 
at least one female Director and 
will keep looking for opportunities 
to increase female representation 
further, while continuing to appoint 
Directors based on merit.
Q
 How does corporate 
governance fit in with the 
other responsibilities of the 
Committee?
Sound corporate governance is 
fundamental to Board effectiveness. 
The Company’s shares are admitted 
to a Premium listing on the London 
Stock Exchange and the Company 
reports against, and complies with, 
all of the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
The Committee is responsible for 
monitoring the Board’s corporate 
governance arrangements, 
reviewing the Company’s corporate 
governance framework at least 
annually and recommending any 
changes to the Board. 
In performing these functions, 
the Committee uses the UK 
Corporate Governance Code as a 
benchmark and takes into account 
the nature and location of the

JEAN-PAUL LUKSIC, 
CHAIRMAN OF THE 
NOMINATION AND 
GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE
GENDER DIVERSITY
It is widely reported that companies in the mining sector face 
particular challenges in recruiting and retaining female talent. One of 
the main challenges is the low level of female participation at all levels 
of the mining industry. This industry-wide challenge is particularly 
relevant for Antofagasta as its operations and corporate centre are 
located in Chile where less than half of women currently participate in 
the job market. Furthermore, it is less common for women in Chile to 
pursue higher education in the fields of engineering, mathematics and 
sciences – disciplines that, of necessity, feed into participation in the 
mining industry. 
During 2017 the Group will be initiating a programme to improve 
opportunities for female employees and to ensure that the working 
environment throughout the Group encourages the recruitment and 
retention of female talent. This programme includes measurable 
deliverables which are part of the Group’s Annual Bonus Plan metrics 
for 2017.

88 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Q
 What are the main 
responsibilities of the 
Committee?
The purpose of the Audit and Risk 
Committee is to assist the Board in 
meeting its responsibilities relating 
to financial reporting and 
control. The Committee’s main 
responsibilities cover financial 
reporting, the external audit 
process, internal audit, risk and 
internal control, and compliance.
Q
 You were appointed 
Chairman of the Audit and 
Risk Committee in September 
2016. What has been your 
experience so far, and what 
do you think will be your 
main focus during the next 
year?
Firstly, I’d like to thank William 
Hayes for his excellent work in 
chairing the Committee over the 
past five years. During that time the 
Committee has been increasingly 
focused on risk, and I think that this 
trend will continue. 
I was very pleased that Vivianne 
Blanlot and Francisca Castro 
agreed to join the Committee on 
1 January 2017. This has been a 
valuable addition to the Committee’s 
breadth of experience and 
expertise. It also means that the 
size of the Committee has increased 
from three to four members from 
the start of 2017, which will be 
very helpful in dealing with the 
significant responsibilities of the 
Committee. This also means that 
we now have members of the Audit 
and Risk Committee participating 
on the Projects Committee and 
the Sustainability and Stakeholder 
Management Committee. This 
allows close linkage between the 
overall review of the Group’s risks 
and risk management processes 
by the Audit and Risk Committee, 
with the more specific risks 
relating to project execution, safety, 
environmental and community 
issues considered in detail by 
the other committees.
While risk management is 
considered at every meeting, I have 
decided to have an additional 
meeting each year at which 
the Committee will focus on 
risk management, to reflect the 
increasing importance of this area. 
Having a larger Committee will help 
manage this additional workload.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
Q
 What are the Committee’s 
main activities in respect 
of the Group’s financial 
reporting?
We review the year-end Financial 
Statements and half-yearly financial 
report, and ensure that the key 
accounting policies, estimates 
and judgements applied in those 
financial statements are reasonable.
We also monitor the overall financial 
reporting process to ensure it is 
robust and well controlled. This 
includes ensuring that the Group’s 
accounting and finance function 
is adequately resourced with 
appropriate segregation of duties, 
that there are appropriate internal 
review processes, that the Group’s 
accounting policies are appropriate 
and clearly communicated, and 
that the Group’s accounting and 
consolidation systems are also 
appropriate. This final area has 
been a particular area of focus for 
the Committee, as the Group has 
implemented a new SAP accounting 
system, which went live on 
1 January 2016. We’ve been closely 
monitoring the implementation of 
the system, and its functioning and 
control since the go-live date.
Q
 What are your particular 
responsibilities with respect 
to the Annual Report?
We assist the Board in its 
assessment that the Annual Report 
is, taken as a whole, fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides 
the necessary information to allow 
shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy. As part of this, 
we use our detailed knowledge of 
the financial results and the key 
accounting judgements applied in 
the Financial Statements to ensure 
that the tone and content of the 
narrative reporting fairly reflects 
the financial results for the year.
We also review the going concern 
basis adopted in the Financial 
Statements, as well as the detailed 
long-term viability statement 
contained within the Annual Report.
Q
 What were the significant 
accounting issues in relation 
to the Financial Statements 
considered by the Committee 
during 2016?
The main issues considered in detail 
by the Committee were:
 − The impairment provisions 
recorded in respect of Antucoya 
and Alto Maipo. With Antucoya, 
the Committee reviewed the 
key assumptions used in the 
impairment review, including 
copper price forecasts, future 
cost and production levels. This 
included a number of meetings 
with both management and the 
external auditors to review the 
methodologies and data used in 
determining key parameters such 
as the copper price forecasts. 
The Committee considered 
information provided by the 
external auditors in respect of 
their own consensus estimates 
relating to relevant parameters, 
and the auditors’ own calculation 
of an appropriate discount rate. 
The Committee also requested 
that management perform a 
number of sensitivity analyses 
showing the impact of changes 
in key assumptions on the value 
of the operation. Following 
this process the Committee 
agreed that the management’s 
estimate of the recoverable 
amount of Antucoya’s assets was 
reasonable, and therefore the 
level of the impairment provision 
was appropriate.
 − With respect to Alto Maipo, the 
Committee members had been 
receiving (along with all other 
Directors) regular updates in 
respect of the project since the 
identification of a significant 
forecast cost overrun during 
2016. As part of the Committee’s 
review of the appropriate 
accounting for the Group’s 
investment in the project they 
considered the key terms of the 
Group’s agreement to dispose 
of its investment for a nominal 
amount and the remaining 
steps required to complete the 
disposal. Following this review 
the Committee concurred with 
management’s view that a 
full impairment provision was 
appropriate for the carrying value 
of the Group’s investment.
 − Details of the impairment reviews 
are set out in Note 4 to the 
Financial Statements.
 − The finalisation of the fair 
value adjustments relating to the 
Zaldívar acquisition: following the 
acquisition of our 50% interest 
in Zaldívar in December 2015, 
during 2016 the Group finalised 
its valuation of the individual 
assets and liabilities acquired. 
The Committee reviewed the key 
assumptions and conclusions of 
this process.
 − Consideration of the impact 
of the non-renewal of two 
mining leases at the Twin 
Metals project. Following the 
non-renewal of these licenses 
the Group is undertaking legal 
action to protect its position. 
The Committee has reviewed in 
detail the current status of the 
legal action with the Group’s legal 
team. They also reviewed the 
potential operating and financial 
impact of the non-renewal of 
these leases with the Group’s 
projects team, including an 
analysis of the potential impact 
on the mine plan and value of the 
project of excluding the mineral 
resources relating to these 
two leases. This resulted in the 
conclusion that no adjustment 
to the carrying value of the 
assets relating to the Twin Metals 
project was appropriate.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
Q
 What are the Committee’s 
activities in respect of the 
external audit process?
We are responsible for overseeing 
Antofagasta’s relationship with 
PwC, the Group’s external 
auditor. I personally have a key 
direct relationship with Jason 
Burkitt, the lead PwC audit 
partner. We review and approve 
the scope of the external audit, 
the terms of engagement and 
fees. The Committee monitors 
the effectiveness of the audit 
process and we are responsible 
for ensuring the independence 
of the external auditor. We 
also make recommendations 
to the Board in respect of the 
appointment, reappointment or 
removal of the external auditor. 
The Committee formally meets 
with PwC without management 
present at least once a year.
Q
 How long has PwC been the 
Group’s auditor?
PwC has been our external auditor 
for two years. We carried out a 
tender process during 2014, which 
resulted in PwC being appointed. 
In line with the relevant regulatory 
guidance, we would expect to 
undertake a tender process in 
respect of the external audit at 
least every ten years.
STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
89 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK ACCOUNTABILITY
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE CONTINUED
Q
 How do you assess the 
effectiveness of the external 
audit process?
We considered the following 
factors as part of our review of the 
effectiveness of the external audit 
process during the year:
 − the appropriateness of the 
proposed audit plan, the 
significant risk areas and 
areas of focus, and the effective 
performance of the audit;
 − the technical skills and industry 
experience of the audit 
engagement partner and the 
wider audit team;
 − the quality of the external 
auditor’s reporting to 
the Committee;
 − the effectiveness of the 
co-ordination between the 
UK and Chilean audit teams;
 − the effectiveness of the 
interaction and relationship 
between the Group’s 
management and the 
external auditor;
 − feedback from management 
in respect of the effectiveness 
of the audit processes for the 
individual operations and the 
Group overall; and
 − the review of reports from the 
external auditor detailing its 
own internal quality control 
procedures, as well as its 
annual transparency report.
In light of this assessment, the 
Committee considers it appropriate 
that PwC be re-appointed as 
external auditor.
INTERNAL AUDIT
Q
 What are your main activities 
in relation to Internal Audit?
The Committee monitors and 
reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s Internal Audit function. 
The Head of Internal Audit reports 
directly to the Committee and 
meets with us without management 
present at least once a year. 
The Committee reviews and 
approves Internal Audit’s plan of 
work for the coming year, including 
the department’s budget, head 
count and other resources. We 
make sure there are sufficient 
resources in the plan to allow for 
special reviews which may be 
required during the year.
We also monitor the resources 
available to the Internal Audit team 
to make sure it has the right mix of 
skills and experience. Internal Audit 
utilises a mix of permanent team 
members, temporary secondees 
from elsewhere in the Group and 
third parties, particularly for areas 
such as IT-related reviews. We’re 
particularly keen on ensuring 
the team has the right level of 
mining technical expertise to be 
able to deliver highly effective 
operating reviews.
Internal Audit presents summaries 
of the key findings from the reviews 
conducted during the year to 
the Committee. All Internal Audit 
reports are distributed to the 
Committee members once they 
have been finalised.
The Committee monitors the 
interaction between Internal Audit 
and PwC, to ensure an efficient 
relationship between the internal 
and external audit processes, 
avoiding duplication of work, and 
ensuring the effective and timely 
sharing of findings.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND 
INTERNAL CONTROL
Q
 What are the Committee’s 
responsibilities for risk 
management and internal 
control?
We play an important role in 
assisting the Board with its 
responsibilities in respect of 
risk management and related 
controls. The Board has ultimate 
responsibility for overseeing the 
Group’s principal risks, as well as 
for maintaining control systems. 
Our internal control systems 
are designed to identify and 
manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve our 
business objectives, and can 
only provide reasonable, and 
not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The 
Committee assists the Board with 
its assessment of the Group’s 
principal risks and its review 
of the effectiveness of the risk 
management process.
Q
 What were the Committee’s 
main activities during the 
year relating to risk?
The risk management function 
presents to the Committee several 
times during the year, covering 
developments in the Group’s risk 
management processes and Group-
level strategic risks.
The General Managers of the 
Group’s operations also present to 
the Committee at least once a year, 
covering their assessment of their 
operation’s key potential risks and 
any significant materialised risks. 
The analysis of key risks includes 
an assessment of the significance 
of the risks based on the probability 
of the risk materialising and the 
potential economic impact of the 
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 – statement of compliance
The Company confirms that it complied with the provisions of the 
Competition and Markets Authority’s Order for the financial year 
under review.
INDEPENDENCE AND 
OBJECTIVITY OF THE 
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Committee monitors the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity. The Company 
has a policy in place that aims to safeguard the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor. 
This includes measures in respect of the potential 
employment of former auditors, the types of non-
audit services that the external auditor may and may 
not provide to the Group, and the approval process in 
respect of permitted non-audit services.
The policy in place during 2016 specifies the 
non-audit services that the external auditor is not 
permitted to provide; these include Internal Audit 
outsourcing, valuation services that would be used 
for financial accounting purposes, preparation of the 
Group’s accounting records or financial statements, 
and financial information systems’ design and 
implementation. Under the policy in place during 
2016, certain permitted non-audit services always 
required prior approval by the Committee, whereas 
certain other non-audit services required prior 
approval by the Committee when the related fees 
were above specified levels ($50,000 for a single 
engagement or a cumulative annual amount of 
$400,000). In addition to this approval process 
for specific non-audit services, the Audit and 
Risk Committee monitors the total level of non-
audit services provided by the external auditor to 
ensure that neither the auditor’s objectivity nor its 
independence is put at risk.
An updated policy has been applied from 
1 January 2017, reflecting the implementation of the 
EU Audit Regulation and Directive. The updated policy 
increases the scope of prohibited non-audit services, 
particularly in respect of tax services. The policy 
also requires prior approval by the Committee for all 
non-audit services, other than services which are 
considered to be clearly trivial, which the Committee 
has defined as being services with fees of not more 
than $25,000.
A breakdown of the audit and non-audit fees is 
disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements. 
The Company’s external auditor, PwC, has provided 
non-audit services (excluding audit-related services) 
which amounted to $0.2 million, or 11% of the fees 
for audit and audit-related services. This mainly 
related to assurance services in respect of the 
Group’s sustainability reporting and tax services. 
In general, where the external auditor is selected 
to provide non-audit services it is because they are 
considered to have specific expertise or experience 
in the relevant area which means they are the most 
suitable provider of those services. The Committee 
has reviewed the level of these services in the course 
of the year and is confident that the objectivity and 
independence of the auditor is not impaired by reason 
of such non-audit work.
The external auditor provides a report to the 
Committee at least once a year, setting out its 
firm’s policies and procedures for maintaining 
its independence.
The Committee considers that PwC remained 
independent and objective throughout 2016.
90 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 risk, as well as an evaluation of the 
quality of the controls in place in 
respect of those specific risks. We 
also look at whether those risks 
have been increasing or decreasing 
in significance. The General 
Managers present their forecast 
of any expected change in key 
risks over the coming 12 months. 
If there is a specific issue at one 
of the operations that requires more 
detailed understanding, we will 
ask the General Manager to attend 
the next meeting to discuss that 
issue. I find this direct interaction 
between the Committee and the 
General Managers extremely 
valuable – not only in terms of the 
direct insight into each operation 
it affords the Committee, but 
also in allowing us to convey the 
importance we attach to strong risk 
management processes.
The Committee also reviewed the 
implementation of the Group’s 
standard risk management 
processes at Zaldívar during 
the year.
Q
 How does the Committee 
interact with the Board and 
other Committees?
I report to the Board following each 
Committee meeting, summarising 
the main matters reviewed by the 
Committee. These regular reports 
allow Directors to understand the 
main issues being considered by the 
Committee, and, when relevant, to 
discuss these matters in more detail 
with the Board.
The Risk Management function 
also presents directly to the 
Board, providing updates of 
the analysis of the Group’s key 
risks and relevant developments 
in the risk management and 
compliance processes. However, 
we try to ensure that the review 
of risk by the Board is not 
compartmentalised into isolated 
sessions, but permeates everything 
that the Board considers. So the 
operating update which the 
CEO provides to the Board at each 
meeting covers any significant 
materialised risks, and all 
proposals which are presented to 
the Board incorporate an analysis 
of the principal risks relevant to 
the proposal.
These processes have assisted 
the Board in carrying out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Company, including those 
that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity, and to assess 
the acceptability of the level of 
risks that arise from the Group’s 
operations and development 
activities. Each year the Board, 
with the support of the Committee, 
reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems. The 
review covers all material controls, 
including financial, operating and 
compliance controls. No significant 
failures or weaknesses were 
identified as a result of this review 
during 2016.
As I explained earlier, from 
the start of 2017 we now have 
members of the Audit and Risk 
Committee participating on the 
Projects Committee and the 
Sustainability and Stakeholder 
Management Committee, which 
allows close co-ordination between 
these committees.
COMPLIANCE
Q
 What are the Committee’s 
responsibilities relating to 
compliance?
We ensure that appropriate 
compliance policies and procedures 
are observed throughout the Group. 
The Group’s Risk Management 
function makes regular 
presentations to the Committee 
covering developments in the 
Group’s compliance processes and 
significant compliance issues.
Chilean law requires the Group to 
appoint a Crime Prevention Officer. 
The Committee is responsible 
for making recommendations 
to the Board in respect of 
the appointment of the Crime 
Prevention Officer, and generally 
monitors and oversees the

performance of the role. The Crime 
Prevention Officer is currently 
Alfredo Atucha, the Vice President 
of Finance and Administration. 
The Committee receives reports 
from the Risk Management 
function in respect of the Group’s 
Crime Prevention Model, in 
accordance with Chilean anti-
corruption legislation.
Q
 What were your main 
activities during the year 
in respect of compliance?
We reviewed the Group’s 
whistleblowing arrangements, 
which enable staff and contractors 
to raise concerns in confidence 
about possible improprieties 
or non-compliance with the 
Group’s Code of Ethics. This is 
an important facility to allow any 
potential issues to be raised. We 
received regular reports on any 
reported whistleblowing incidents, 
which detail the number and type 
of incidents, along with details 
of the most significant ones 
and the actions resulting from 
their investigation.
The Committee reviewed updates to 
the conflict of interest declarations 
by the Group’s employees and 
suppliers, including details of the 
types of potential conflicts being 
declared. We also reviewed the 
analysis of suppliers who are 
Politically Exposed Persons, (ie 
individuals who hold prominent 
public positions).
We also reviewed the Group’s 
policies and procedures relevant to 
the requirements of the UK Modern 
Slavery Act.
As with the risk management 
processes noted above, we 
reviewed the implementation of 
the Group’s standard compliance 
processes at Zaldívar during 
the year.

92 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Q
 What is the main function 
of the Sustainability and 
Stakeholder Management 
Committee?
The Committee assists the Board 
in the stewardship of the Group’s 
social responsibility programmes 
and makes recommendations to 
the Board to ensure that ethical, 
safety and health, environmental, 
social and community considerations 
are taken into account in 
the Board’s deliberations.
The Committee provides guidance to 
the Board in relation to sustainability 
matters generally, reviewing and 
updating the Group’s framework of 
strategies and policies, (including 
safety and health, environmental, 
climate change, human rights, 
community and other stakeholder 
issues), and monitoring and 
reviewing the Group’s performance 
in respect of sustainability matters, 
indicators and targets.
During 2016, the Committee 
reviewed and updated its terms of 
reference, adding climate change 
as an area of responsibility and 
clarifying the interconnection 
between sustainability and 
stakeholder management risks 
and the risk oversight function 
performed by the Audit and 
Risk Committee.
Q
 What achievements did the 
Committee oversee during 
2016?
We have overseen and promoted 
significant improvements in the 
Group’s strategies and systems 
to improve the Group’s safety, 
environmental and community 
relations performance. These 
improvements have been 
demonstrated by the milestones 
that were achieved during 2016, 
including the Group’s admission 
as a full member of the ICMM, 
reaching an agreement with the 
local communities at Los Pelambres 
and implementing a new community 
relations programme (Somos 
Choapa) at Los Pelambres.
Q
 What were the biggest 
failures?
Two people died at the Group’s 
operations during the year. The 
Group’s stated objective is to 
ensure that there are no fatalities. 
The Committee oversaw the 
appointment of internationally-
renowned consultants, SAFEmap, 
to review the mining division’s safety 
strategy. This involved a safety 
culture survey answered by over 
2,600 employees and contractors. 
SAFEmap’s recommendations were 
reviewed by the Committee and 
the Board and action plans were 
developed to close the gaps that 
were identified. 
We must be resolute in our efforts 
to ensure that a safety culture is, 
and continues to be, embedded in 
everything that the Group does.
Q
 Significant progress has 
been made in relation to 
community relations at 
Los Pelambres. What about 
elsewhere in the Group?
The future of our operating 
companies depends on committed 
and sustained collaboration between 
local communities, local, regional 
and national government and the 
Group. During 2016, the Committee 
oversaw the implementation of a 
new community engagement model, 
based on the Somos Choapa model 
deployed at Los Pelambres, at the 
other mining operating companies 
and transport division in the north 
of Chile. The model fosters close 
engagement with local communities 
and authorities to jointly identify 
challenges, opportunities 
and solutions.
The Committee also oversaw 
progress in the implementation 
of commitments made as part of 
the Somos Choapa programme at 
Los Pelambres, which included the 
endorsement of the development 
of a technical training centre at Los 
Vilos, in partnership with a local 
technical education provider.
Q
 What trends did the 
Committee observe in 2016?
Several events in 2016 highlighted 
the increased importance of careful 
environmental management. 
In October 2016, the Environmental 
Authority (SMA) brought nine 
charges based on inspections 
conducted at Los Pelambres in 
2014-2015 and other activities 
being undertaken in respect of third 
parties. Los Pelambres remains 
committed to full compliance and is 
working to address these changes.
In November 2016, a compliance 
programme was proposed for 
the Los Pelambres Incremental 
Expansion, which in its final form 
should address all material issues 
that might create a risk of non-
compliance in the future.
Q
 What are the Committee’s 
three main priorities in 2017?
 − Our number one priority is the 
safety of our employees and 
contractors. The steps taken 
to close the gaps identified in 
SAFEmap’s review of the mining 
group’s safety strategy will be 
carefully monitored. 
 − The Committee will continue to 
oversee the implementation of 
commitments made to the new 
community relations model in the 
north of Chile and as part of the 
Somos Choapa programme at 
Los Pelambres.
 − The Committee has asked 
management to strengthen 
the Group’s environmental 
compliance monitoring system 
by appointing a third party to 
perform an external review with 
the aim of taking compliance 
to a level of excellence.

94 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Q
 What is the main function of 
the Projects Committee?
The Committee reviews all aspects 
of projects to be submitted to 
the Board for approval, highlighting 
key matters for the Board’s 
consideration throughout the 
project lifecycle and making 
recommendations to management 
to ensure that all projects 
submitted to the Board are in 
line with the Group’s strategy. 
The Committee adds an important 
level of governance and control 
for the evaluation of the Group’s 
projects, and plays a key role 
in providing the Board with 
additional oversight of the projects 
portfolio, development proposals, 
milestones and performance 
against key indicators.
Q
 What is the balance between 
decisions made by the 
Projects Committee and 
decisions made by the 
Board?
The Committee is not responsible 
for approving projects – that is 
for the Board to decide. Our role 
is to assist the Board by ensuring 
that all the Group’s projects follow 
a standard, structured process 
with consistent analysis, execution 
and evaluation practices. As 
part of its review, the Committee 
invites management to consider 
different perspectives, ideas and 
improvements, with the aim of 
fostering focused discussion within 
the Board and, ultimately, enhancing 
the value of the Group’s projects.
Q
 What tools does the 
Committee use to assist with 
benchmarking?
The Committee provides guidance 
to the project managers leading 
each individual project and to 
the Board from the early stages 
of project planning, to ensure that 
policies, strategies, and the Group’s 
standard implementation framework 
are applied to all projects. The use 
of the Group’s ADS framework is 
an essential component of this.
ADS uses processes and practices 
commonly utilised in the mining 
industry for project management 
from conception to execution. It 
defines standards and common 
criteria, including governance by 
a steering committee, functional 
quality assurance reviews and 
risk management.
During 2016, the Committee 
reviewed and endorsed 
enhancements to the ADS 
framework, including front-end 
loading deliverables: 
 − making comparisons with 
industry systems and assessing 
alignment with best practices; 
 − the project control and 
reporting system;
 − the project accounting start-up 
point policy (which clarifies 
treatment of revenues generated 
during the start-up period); and 
 − Board and Committee 
involvement in the ADS stage 
gate process.
Q
 What were the key activities 
of the Committee in 2016?
The Committee reviewed project 
proposals against flat-price 
sensitivities, execution milestones 
and key performance indicators, and 
provided guidance when there was 
evidence of a deviation in costs or 
schedule from the plans approved 
by the Board.
The Committee considered the drop 
in commodity prices and reviewed 
the Group’s mining projects portfolio 
with the objective of maximising 
cash preservation in 2016. It 
endorsed a spending reduction 
for the Encuentro Oxides and 
Molybdenum Plant projects (which 
are currently in the execution 
phase) by reducing the rate and 
intensity of construction.
When necessary, the Committee will 
also commission reviews of specific 
matters by external advisers.
The Committee reviewed progress 
in relation to the Los Pelambres 
Incremental Expansion Project, 
including an analysis of project 
management organisation, 
an evaluation of comminution 
technology alternatives and a review 
of the tailings dam capacity studies.
The Committee also reviewed 
Centinela’s Second Concentrator 
project, including a detailed 
analysis of grinding technology 
alternatives. It also reviewed 
Centinela’s long-term plan and 
productivity effects.
As explained on page 80, the 
Committee visited the Group’s 
projects during the year and met 
management and employees to 
understand the precise stage of 
development (including projects in 
the study phase and construction 
phase) and the specific issues 
relevant to individuals working 
at the site.
Q
 What does the Committee 
do to ensure continuous 
improvement?
The Committee reviews close-out 
reports to derive lessons learned 
that will be applied to future 
projects. In 2016, the Committee 
reviewed the lessons learned from 
the Antucoya project. In particular, it 
reviewed a cost reconciliation of the 
project, and identified that project 
economics should capture all costs 
involved. The Committee ensured 
that future projects’ submissions 
for approval should include the 
cost of studies, project execution, 
commissioning, accumulated 
interest, working capital and related 
items in order to present a full 
picture of the funding required.
The Committee also reviewed 
lessons learned from the 
construction of Esperanza and 
the Centinela debottlenecking 
project and evaluated the 
investment in Centinela’s tailings 
management system.
Q
 What are the Committee’s 
priorities in 2017?
 − To play a key role in reviewing 
the commissioning and ramp-up 
of the Encuentro Oxides and 
Molybdenum Plant projects. 
 − To carefully assess progress of 
studies of the Los Pelambres 
Incremental Expansion and 
Centinela Second Concentrator 
projects, particularly with respect 
to critical path items, such as 
the necessary Environmental 
Impact Studies.
 − To review Zaldívar’s and the 
transport division’s projects.
 − To continue to review and further 
enhance the ADS framework.

95 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK AS A COMMITTEE, OUR OBJECTIVES FOR 
2017 ARE THE SAME AS FOR THE REST 
OF THE GROUP – TO REDUCE COSTS 
SUSTAINABLY , PRODUCE PROFITABLE 
TONNES AND DELIVER POSITIVE FREE 
CASH FLOW THROUGHOUT THE CYCLE
ENCOURAGING THE 
RIGHT BEHAVIOURS
TIM BAKER, CHAIRMAN
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTORY LETTER
REMUNERATION AND TALENT MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE 
Dear Shareholder,
Q
 What is the function of the 
Remuneration and Talent 
Management Committee?
The Remuneration and Talent 
Management Committee is 
responsible for ensuring that the 
Group’s remuneration arrangements 
promote effective execution of the 
Group’s strategy and enable the 
recruitment, motivation, retention 
and development of talent. 
The Committee is responsible 
for preparing the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and reviewing 
the remuneration of any Executive 
Directors (although there are 
currently none and none are 
expected to be appointed). The 
Board comprises solely of Non-
Executive Directors as explained 
by the Chairman on page 68. 
The Committee also reviews and 
approves the remuneration of the 
Chairman and the Group CEO, 
and determines the performance-
related elements of the Group 
CEO’s compensation.
Remuneration for members of the 
Executive Committee, including 
awards granted under the long-term 
incentive plan (LTIP) and annual 
bonus plan (Annual Bonus Plan), 
is proposed to the Committee by 
the Group CEO for approval.
Awards under both the LTIP and 
the Annual Bonus Plan are subject 
to performance against financial 
and non-financial metrics and 
take into account the interests 
of the Group’s stakeholders. The 
Committee reviews these metrics 
at the beginning of the year 
and, if necessary, recommends 
amendments before approving the 
metrics (in the case of the LTIP) 
or recommending the metrics to 
the Board for approval (in the case 
of the Annual Bonus Plan). 
The Committee also reviews 
succession plans for members of 
the Executive Committee, assessing 
any changes in compensation 
policies across the Group that 
may have a significant long-term 
impact on labour costs, and 
oversees compensation and talent 
management strategies for the 
Group as a whole.
Q
 What were the areas of focus 
for the Committee in 2016?
The Committee reviewed the 
principles and application of the 
2014 Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, resulting in the development 
of the 2017 Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, which is set out on pages 
112 to 114. Shareholders are 
invited to vote on this policy at the 
2017 AGM.
At the management level, the 
Committee reviewed Diego 
Hernández’s performance against 
the performance criteria that 
applied to the Strategic Awards 
that he received in 2015. These 
criteria are set out on page 108 and 
primarily relate to the successful 
implementation of a succession plan 
allowing for the transition of the 
role of Group CEO to Iván Arriagada 
(whose pay arrangements were 
also reviewed during the year). 
The Committee also oversaw the 
functional simplification programme 
implemented during 2016. The 
programme centralised certain 
functions that support our mining 
operations (including finance, 
human resources, legal and external 
affairs and sustainability) in the 
locations most appropriate for 
supporting the Group’s portfolio 
of operations.
Finally, the Committee considered 
the progress made in attaining the 
Group’s strategic performance 
targets for the year and how this 
impacted executive remuneration. 
As reported by the Chairman in his 
introduction to this year’s Annual 
Report, good progress was made 
during 2016 as demonstrated by the 
reduction in costs and increase in 
production as the full impact from 
the new mining operations in our 
portfolio flowed through. As a result, 
the Group’s performance score 
for 2016 under the Annual Bonus 
Plan, which forms the basis for 
calculating 70% of the Group CEO’s 
and Executive Committee’s annual 
bonus, was determined to be 99.7 
within a range of 90 (Threshold) – 
110 (Maximum). 
Q
 How does the 2017 Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy differ 
from the 2014 policy?
There is very little change between 
the two policies. The main 
difference is that the 2017 policy 
does not include a recruitment 
policy for Executive Directors. As 
noted on page 68, the Board does 
not currently have an Executive 
Director and does not anticipate 
a new appointment during the 
2017-2020 policy period. 
Further details of the minor 
differences between the 2014 and 
2017 policies are set out within the 
2017 Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
itself on page 112.
Q
 Did the Committee apply 
discretion to adjust 
remuneration outcomes 
during the year?
No discretion has been applied to 
remuneration outcomes for any 
payments to Directors or the Group 
CEO during the year.
Q
 What information about 
executive pay is being 
provided in this 2016 
Remuneration Report?
We feel it is important to embrace 
the broad governance requirements 
of the UK regime, so voluntarily 
continue to report the Group 
CEO’s remuneration as if he 
were a member of the Board. We 
also provide detailed information 
relating to the structure and 
components of the other Executive 
Committee members’ remuneration. 
As explained on page 68, the 
Committee needs to consider the 
market conditions and remuneration 
structures available in Chile when 
setting executive remuneration and 
some elements of the Group’s LTIP 
may therefore differ slightly from 
arrangements that would typically 
be expected for a UK-based CEO 
and management team.
96 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Q
 Have any changes been made 
to the fees payable to Non-
Executive Directors in 2017?
The sole change is the introduction 
of a separate fee for the Senior 
Independent Director. The 
Committee works with remuneration 
consultants to review Non-
Executive Directors’ remuneration 
against relevant markets and 
makes recommendations to 
the Board based on those results. 
The remuneration of Non-
Executive Directors is determined 
by the Board as a whole and no 
Non-Executive Director participates 
in the determination of his or her 
own remuneration.
Fee levels for the Non-Executive 
Directors have remained unchanged 
since 2012 and will remain 
unchanged in 2017 except for 
the Senior Independent Director 
fee of $20,000 pa. This fee is in 
accordance with the 2014 Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and provides 
recognition of the additional time 
commitment and responsibilities 
attached to the role.
Q
 What arrangement does the 
Committee have in place with 
remuneration consultants?
During the year, the Committee 
reappointed remuneration 
consultants Willis Towers Watson 
to provide advice to the Committee. 
In past years Willis Towers Watson 
has provided the Committee with 
useful advice on such matters 
as compensation benchmarking, 
new legislative requirements and 
market practice.
Willis Towers Watson is a widely-
recognised independent global 
professional services firm that is 
a signatory to, and adheres to, the 
Code of Conduct for Remuneration 
Committee Consultants. 
This can be found at www.
remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. 
The Committee is satisfied that the 
advice provided by Willis Towers 
Watson in 2016 was objective and 
independent, that no conflict of 
interest arose as a result of these 
services and that it had no other 
connection with the Company. 
Willis Towers Watson’s fees for this 
work were charged in accordance 
with normal billing practices and 
amounted to £93,848.
The Committee also re-appointed 
the Company’s legal advisers, 
Clifford Chance LLP, to provide 
advice on the operation of 
the Group’s LTIP and other 
compensation-related legal issues 
during 2016. This re-appointment 
was also based on the Committee’s 
satisfaction with advice received in 
previous years.
The Committee Chairman and the 
Committee as a whole regularly 
speak with these advisers without 
management present, to provide a 
forum for open discussion and the 
sharing of views and opinions on 
compensation issues. Additionally, 
part of each Committee meeting is 
held without management present 
to ensure that individual views 
or areas of concern are debated 
between the Committee members 
as necessary.
The Committee also received 
assistance from the Chairman, the 
Group CEO, the Vice President 
of Human Resources and the 
Company Secretary during 2016, 
none of whom participated in 
discussions relating to their 
own remuneration.
Q
 What role does the 
Committee play in talent 
management and succession 
planning?
Talent management and succession 
planning enable the Group to adapt 
to the challenges and changes 
that arise over the copper price 
cycle. Under the agreed succession 
planning policy, when a key 
management position becomes 
vacant a replacement will first 
be sought from within the Group, 
taking into account the succession 
plan agreed for that position. In 
2016, the appointment of Iván 
Arriagada as Group CEO was an 
internal appointment in accordance 
with this policy.
In the event that candidates are 
being considered for a role that 
reports into the Group CEO, the 
Committee Chairman participates 
in the interview process to ensure 
that the candidate receives input 
on, and is capable of meeting, the 
Board’s expectations. 
We encourage and review 
progress in the development and 
internal promotion of professional 
talent and the movement of 
that talent between the Group’s 
operations and closely monitor and 
encourage the development of high 
potential employees.
Q
 What are the key objectives 
for the Committee in 2017?
The Committee’s objectives for 
2017, as with the rest of the Group, 
are to reduce costs sustainably, 
produce profitable tonnes and 
deliver positive free cash flow 
throughout the cycle. In order 
to ensure that these objectives 
are met, the Committee has 
commissioned a thorough review 
of the Group’s variable remuneration 
models in 2017. 
As set out on page 74, the 
Committee will also oversee the 
activities of the culture committee, 
update the talent management 
programme and oversee labour 
union negotiations at Centinela 
and Zaldívar.
Shareholders are invited to 
vote on the 2017 Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and on 
the 2016 Remuneration Report 
and it is hoped that there will be 
continued support for the Group’s 
pay arrangements.

98 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 The 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 21 May 2014 and took effect from that date. The summary 
policy table below is provided for reference, and covers elements of the policy that apply to all Directors. It does not formally form part of the Remuneration 
Report and has not been separated into elements relating to the role of Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Director following Jean-Paul Luksic’s 
re-designation as Non-Executive Chairman in 2014.
The full Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM can be found in the Remuneration and Talent Management section of the 
Company’s website at www.antofagasta.co.uk/investors/corporate-governance/board-committees.
The Company’s policy is to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded with regard to their responsibilities, and to consider comparable pay levels and 
structures in the UK and Chile, and in the international mining industry. Remuneration levels for Directors are reviewed annually in comparison with 
companies of a similar nature, size and complexity and take into account the specific responsibilities undertaken and the structure of the Board.
 PURPOSE OPERATION MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY
Fees To attract and 
retain high-calibre, 
experienced Non-
Executive Directors 
by offering globally 
competitive fee 
levels. 
Fees are reviewed annually and the competitiveness 
of total fees is assessed against companies of a similar 
nature, size and complexity. 
Non-Executive Directors receive a base fee for 
services to Antofagasta plc’s Board, as well as 
additional fees for chairing or serving as a member 
of any of the Board’s committees.
Separate base fees are paid for services to the 
Antofagasta Minerals Board (all Non-Executive 
Directors are members of both boards), and for being 
directors of subsidiary companies and joint venture 
companies within the Group. 
Ramón Jara also receives a base fee for services 
provided to Antofagasta Minerals (pursuant to 
a separate service contract). 
Fee levels are denominated in US dollars. The 
Committee may determine fee levels and/or pay 
fees in any other currency if deemed necessary, 
or appropriate.
In normal circumstances, the maximum annual fee 
increase will be 7%. However, the Committee has 
discretion to exceed this in exceptional circumstances, 
for example: 
 − if there is a sustained period of high inflation;
 − if fees are out of line with the market; and/or 
 − if fees for chairing or serving as a member of 
any of the Board’s committees are out of line with 
the market.
Any increases will take into account the factors 
described under “operation” and will not be excessive.
Fee levels for additional roles within the Antofagasta 
Group are based on the needs and time commitment 
expected and may be determined and/or paid in a 
combination of currencies, including US dollars and 
Chilean pesos.
Fees will also be increased to take account of Chilean 
inflation and may be reported as an increase or 
decrease as a result of the exchange rate impact 
of Chilean peso-denominated fees, given all amounts 
in this report are reported in US dollars.
Variable 
remuneration
Given the non-executive composition of the Board, there are no arrangements for Directors to acquire benefits through the acquisition 
of shares in the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, to benefit through performance-related pay or to participate in long-
term incentive schemes. 
The Corporate Governance Code states that remuneration for Non-Executive Directors should not include share options or other 
performance-related elements.
Benefits To provide 
appropriate benefits 
required in the 
performance of the 
duties of Non-
Executive Directors. 
Benefits include the provision of life, accident and 
health insurance.
The Committee retains the discretion to provide 
additional insurance benefits in accordance with 
Company policy, should this be deemed necessary.
In normal circumstances, the maximum value of 
benefits will be $22,000. However, the Committee 
has discretion to exceed this should the underlying 
cost of providing the pre-existing benefits increase, 
or if additional benefits are provided and are 
deemed appropriate.
Pension No Director receives pension contributions. The Corporate Governance Code considers that the participation by a Non-Executive 
Director in a company’s pension scheme could potentially affect the independence of that Non-Executive Director.
As Directors do not receive variable remuneration, there are no provisions in place to recover sums paid or withhold payments. 
No Executive Directors were appointed, or served, on the Board in 2016.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2016 
CHAIRMAN
Mr Jean-Paul Luksic was appointed Executive Chairman in 2004 and 
was re-designated as Non-Executive Chairman in 2014. Mr Luksic’s total 
2016 fee was $1,000,000, comprising, for his services as Chairman of the 
Board: $730,000 per annum, Chairman of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee: $10,000 per annum, and Chairman of the Antofagasta Minerals 
board: $260,000 per annum.
Since the last policy review in 2014, this reflects a decrease of 61%, 
reflecting his role change from Executive to Non-Executive and his 
continuing responsibility, experience and time commitment to the role.
SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
Ollie Oliveira was appointed Senior Independent Director with effect from 
1 September 2016. On 24 January 2017, the Board approved an annual fee 
of $20,000 for performing this role in recognition of its importance, and the 
additional time commitment, which is in line with market practice.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
There has been no change to Non-Executive Director fees since 2012. 
The base Non-Executive Director’s fee in respect of the Board remains at 
$130,000 per annum. Given the core role which Antofagasta Minerals plays 
in the management of the mining operations and projects, all Directors 
also serve as directors of Antofagasta Minerals. The annual fee payable 
to directors of Antofagasta Minerals remains at $130,000. Therefore, the 
combined base fees payable to Non-Executive Directors amounted to 
$260,000 per annum.
The Board remains satisfied that the current fee levels and structure are 
aligned with the Group’s international peers and is not recommending any 
change this year, but will continue to review fee levels from time to time, in 
accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
In addition to Board fees, Non-Executive Directors also received fees for 
their participation on Board Committees during the year. In 2016, with 
the assistance of Willis Towers Watson, the Committee reviewed the fee 
levels and decided that other than recommending a new annual fee for the 
Senior Independent Director, the existing Committee fees should remain 
unchanged, as they have since 2012.

REPORT
2016 REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION REPORTING 
FRAMEWORK
This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance 
with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended). 
It also describes how the Board has applied the principles of good 
governance as set out in the Corporate Governance Code. 
100 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 1. From 1 January 2016 until 30 April 2016, fees payable in respect of Ollie Oliveira’s 
service as a Director were paid to Greengrove Capital LLP, a partnership in which 
Ollie Oliveira was a partner.
2. During 2016, remuneration of $533,000 (2015 – $524,000) for the provision of 
services by Ramón Jara was paid to Asesorías Ramón F Jara Ltda. This amount is 
included in the amounts attributable to Ramón Jara of $833,000 (2015 – $876,000). 
3. Amounts disclosed for Diego Hernández in 2016 relate to (i) the pro rata value of 
his base salary, benefits and annual bonus from 1 January 2016 until 8 April 2016; 
and (ii) Strategic Awards that vested on 30 April and 1 August 2016 – after his 
transition out of the role of Group CEO (as set out in detail on page 107) – and 
which have not been pro-rated in the single figure table. The LTIP awards granted to 
Diego Hernández in 2014 which were due to vest on 19 March 2017 were forfeited 
by Mr Hernández as a condition of entitlement to the Strategic Awards. No pension 
was payable to Diego Hernández. The benefits expense represents the provision of 
life and health insurance and does not include taxable benefits relating to expenses.
4. The amounts disclosed for 2016 relate to remuneration paid to Iván Arriagada from 
8 April 2016, including base salary and benefits and the pro rata value of his annual 
bonus and LTIP awards vesting in 2016. No pension is payable to Iván Arriagada. 
The benefits expense represents the provision of life and health insurance and 
does not include taxable benefits relating to expenses.
5. Includes amounts which are deemed by UK tax authorities to be taxable benefits 
relating largely to the costs of Non-Executive Directors’ expenses in attending 
Board meetings in the UK (including associated hotel and subsistence expenses). 
Given these expenses are incurred by Directors in the fulfilment of their duties, 
the Company also pays the tax incurred by Directors on these expenses. These 
amounts were not disclosed in the 2015 Remuneration Report because the 
Company was not alerted until after the 2016 Annual General Meeting that these 
amounts were taxable. The figures for 2015 are higher than for 2016 because there 
were more meetings in London in 2015 than in 2016 and the 2015 figures include 
spouse travel costs which did not apply in 2016. Amounts for Jean-Paul Luksic 
include the provision of life, accident and health insurance. Amounts for Ramón Jara 
include the provision of accident insurance.
6. The annual bonus paid to Diego Hernández in 2015 is reported based on the 
exchange rate as at 1 April 2015. In the 2015 Remuneration Report a slightly lower 
figure of $321,000 was reported, which reflected the anticipated exchange rate at 
the date the 2015 Remuneration Report was published.
7. As explained on page 105, awards granted pursuant to the LTIP are split between 
Restricted Share Awards and Performance Share Awards. Amounts relating to 
Restricted Share Awards are reported in the year that they vest. Performance 
Share Awards are reported in the year that the performance period ends.
8. The 2016 amounts payable to Iván Arriagada under the LTIP relate to Restricted 
Share Awards granted in 2015 that vested in 2016. The amount is the pro 
rata portion of the payment in relation to the period from 8 April 2016 until 
31 December 2016.
9. The 2015 amounts payable to Diego Hernández under the LTIP relate to Restricted 
Share Awards and Performance Share Awards granted in 2013 and to Restricted 
Share Awards granted in 2012 and 2014. The performance period for Performance 
Share Awards granted in 2013 concluded on 31 December 2015 and the 
awards vested on 8 April 2016. This figure is the final amount paid for the entire 
performance period. In the 2015 Annual Report an estimate was used because the 
2013 Performance Share Awards had not yet vested. 
10. Details of the performance conditions and vesting dates attaching to this award are 
explained in more detail on page 107.

1. Jean-Paul Luksic’s interest relates to shares held by Aureberg Establishment, an 
entity that he ultimately controls.
2. Ramón Jara’s interest relates to shares held by a close family member.
There have been no changes to the Directors’ interests in the shares of the 
Company between 31 December 2016 and the date of this report.
The Directors had no interests in the shares of the Company during the 
year other than the interests set out in the table above. No Director had any 
material interest in any contract (other than a service contract) with the 
Company or its subsidiary undertakings during the year other than in the 
ordinary course of business.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
The Group does not have shareholding guidelines or requirements for 
Directors, all of whom are non-executive, or for the Group CEO and 
Executive Committee members, all of whom are based in Chile.
Chairman Jean-Paul Luksic and Non-Executive Director Andrónico Luksic 
C are members of the Luksic family; members of the Luksic family are 
interested in the E. Abaroa Foundation which controls the Metalinvest 
Establishment and Kupferberg Establishment (which, in aggregate, hold 
approximately 60.66% of the Company’s ordinary shares and approximately 
94.12% of the Company’s preference shares). In addition, Mr Jean-Paul 
Luksic controls the Severe Studere Foundation which, in turn, controls 
Aureberg Establishment (which holds approximately 4.26% of the 
Company’s ordinary shares). This creates significant alignment between 
these members of the Board and shareholders.
Certain senior executives participate in the Group’s LTIP, which entitles 
them to cash-based contingent share awards linked to Antofagasta’s share 
price. Further details of the LTIP are set out on page 105.
The Committee believes that cash-based awards are appropriate because 
share based awards would be taxable on the date of grant 
for Chilean employees.
During the period, no Non-Executive Director was eligible for any 
short-term or long-term incentive awards and no Non-Executive 
Director owns any shares that have resulted from the achievement 
of performance conditions.
LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
Each Non-Executive Director has a letter of appointment from the Company. 
The Company has a policy of putting all Directors forward for re-election at 
each AGM, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. Under 
the terms of the letters, if the shareholders do not confirm a Director’s 
appointment, the appointment will terminate with immediate effect. In other 
circumstances, the appointment may be terminated by either party on one 
month’s written notice.
There is a contract between Antofagasta Minerals and Asesorías Ramón 
F Jara Ltda dated 2 November 2004 for the provision of advisory services 
by Ramón Jara. This contract does not have an expiry date but may be 
terminated by either party on one month’s notice. No other Director is party 
to a service contract with the Group.
VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURES – 
EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION 
Iván Arriagada is responsible for leading the senior management team 
and for the executive management of the Group. Members of the Executive 
Committee report to Mr. Arriagada and are responsible for leading the 
day-to-day operation of the Group’s mining and transport businesses. 
No member of the Executive Committee, nor the Group CEO, sits on 
the Board of the Company. Consequently, the following disclosures have 
been made voluntarily to demonstrate the remuneration arrangements that 
the Committee believe are appropriate for the Group CEO and the Group’s 
executives including the variable pay mechanisms (Annual Bonus Plans and 
LTIP) which are designed to motivate the Group CEO and the Group as a 
whole to effectively implement the Group’s strategy.
REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES
The remuneration arrangements in place for Iván Arriagada and the 
Executive Committee align remuneration with performance, the Group’s 
strategic objectives and shareholders’ interests. Iván Arriagada and each 
Executive Committee member are eligible to receive a combination of base 
salary and other benefits, as well as variable remuneration in the form of 
an annual cash bonus and cash-based contingent awards linked to the 
Company’s share price pursuant to the LTIP.
The performance components of variable remuneration are selected 
to incentivise the delivery of the Group’s strategy, to reward Group 
and individual performance and to motivate Iván Arriagada and the 
Executive Committee.
The table on page 110 shows the total remuneration for the Group’s CEO 
over the last eight years. The total remuneration for the Group CEO in 2016 
was 7% lower than in 2015.
Iván Arriagada’s base salary and potential remuneration are currently 
significantly lower than they were for Diego Hernández.
The Committee will closely monitor Iván Arriagada’s performance and pay 
arrangements. If the Committee determines that an above-inflation base 
salary increase is necessary, the Committee will explain the rationale for the 
increase in the Remuneration Report for the relevant financial year within 
the voluntary disclosures.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Board will consider any proposal for an executive to serve as a Non-
Executive Director of another company on a case-by-case basis. The 
Board would carefully consider the time commitments of the proposed role, 
the industry of the company, whether or not it is a supplier, customer or 
competitor and whether it would be appropriate for the executive to retain 
remuneration for the position.
LEAVING ARRANGEMENTS FOR DIEGO HERNÁNDEZ
Diego Hernández did not receive any payments upon leaving other than 
the entitlement to one month’s base salary for each year of service as 
envisaged in his employment contract, the details of which have previously 
been disclosed.
SALARY AND BENEFITS
The total remuneration paid to Diego Hernández and Iván Arriagada in 2016 
in the role of Group CEO was $2.27 million. Fixed remuneration comprises 
base salary and benefits, and in 2016 represented less than 29% of 
total remuneration.
Benefits payable to Diego Hernández and Iván Arriagada reflect amounts 
paid to maintain life and health insurance policies. 
2016 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
102 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 According to Chilean law, all employees are required to pay their 
own pension and compulsory healthcare contributions. No additional 
contributions are made by the Group. 
Iván Arriagada’s total remuneration package is determined by the 
Committee, taking into account the performance of the Group and his 
personal performance. The Company also benchmarks each element of 
his remuneration and his total remuneration package by reference to peers 
in the FTSE 100 and FTSE mining indices and comparable international 
mining companies.
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
Iván Arriagada is employed under a contract of employment with 
Antofagasta Minerals, a subsidiary of the Company. His contract is governed 
by Chilean labour law. It does not have a fixed term and can be terminated 
by either party on 30 days’ notice in writing. Except in the case of 
termination for breach of contract or misconduct under the Chilean Labour 
Code, Iván Arriagada is entitled to receive one month’s base salary for 
each year of service on termination, otherwise no other compensation or 
benefits are payable on termination of his employment. The salary payable 
to Iván Arriagada under his employment contract as of 8 April 2016 was 
Ch$31,500,814 ($47,484) per month and his salary is adjusted for inflation 
in Chile every three months. 
Iván Arriagada was appointed Group CEO on 8 April 2016. His total salary 
payments for 2016 from that date were Ch$278,182,966 ($416,856) and, 
other than adjustments for inflation, there were no other adjustments to his 
salary in 2016. Under his employment agreement, Iván Arriagada is entitled 
to 20 working days’ paid holiday per year. He is also entitled to life and 
health insurance. 
Because Iván Arriagada’s salary is paid in Chilean pesos, it is subject to 
annual exchange rate movements when reported in US dollars.
ANNUAL BONUS PLAN
Employees are eligible to receive cash bonuses under the Annual Bonus 
Plan based on Group and individual performance. The Annual Bonus 
Plan focuses on the delivery of annual financial and non-financial targets 
designed to align remuneration with the Group’s strategy and create a 
platform for sustainable future performance. Individual award levels are 
calibrated at the conclusion of each annual performance period to ensure 
that performance targets remain stretching and that high or maximum 
payments under the plan are received only for exceptional performance.
In 2016, the bonus payable to the Group CEO and members of the Executive 
Committee was 70% attributable to the performance of the Group and 
30% to personal performance, according to metrics that were fixed at the 
beginning of the year. 
The bonus payable to the Group CEO for achieving both Group and personal 
performance targets in 2016 was 50% of annual base salary. The maximum 
bonus receivable by the Group CEO for achieving stretch performance 
targets in 2016 was 100% of annual base salary.
The average maximum available bonus for the Executive Committee 
members under the Annual Bonus Plan, for achieving their maximum 
individual and Group performance targets, is 70% of base salary. In 
2016, the average bonus for the Executive Committee members was 
approximately 38% of base salary.
The Group performance criteria for the Annual Bonus Plan and the 
individual performance criteria for the Group CEO are set annually by the 
Committee. The individual performance criteria for the Executive Committee 
are set by the Group CEO and reviewed by the Committee.
We have provided greater detail on the Annual Bonus Plan metrics this 
year, on a voluntary basis, including the outcomes against each of the 
performance metrics relating to business development and sustainability 
and organisational capabilities. This is to provide shareholders with even 
further clarity on the structure of the metrics and reassurance that the 
metrics are based on stretching performance. 
A critical issue for a mining company is the commodity price and we 
carefully review the impact of changes in this price on our long-term 
and annual performance targets to ensure there is fair opportunity for 
achievement under each metric.

GROUP PERFORMANCE UNDER THE 2016 ANNUAL BONUS PLAN 
In 2016, Group performance under the Annual Bonus Plan was as follows. The choice of these criteria, and their respective weightings, reflects the 
Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be tied both to the overall performance of the Group and to those areas of the business that the 
relevant individual can directly influence.

1. Performance range is 90-110 where 90 = threshold (0% bonus), 100 = target (50% bonus), and 110 = stretch (100% bonus).
2. Mining division only. Net of copper price and exchange rate fluctuations and adjusted for the impact of IFRIC 2016 which results in an outcome of 108, not 110.
3. 100% basis, except for Zaldívar (50%).
4. Measured against the implementation of planned works at each of the Group’s mining operations to sustain the mining operations during the year and progress against the 
budget for the year associated with those works where Threshold is 85% completion of planned works on budget, Target is between 90% and 100% of progress on budget 
and Maximum is more than 105% of planned works within budget. The weighted outcome for the Group’s mining operations was 92. 
5. Split between the Encuentro Oxides (1.5%) and Centinela Molybdenum Plant (1.5%). Specific targets based on budgets for costs incurred, capex and PEM date with opportunity 
for Maximum if capex 5% lower than the 2016 budget. Dates and capex for both projects matched budget with costs incurred slightly below budget for Encuentro Oxides. 
6. Split between closing the Brisbane office (1%) – Target 30 June 2016, with Maximum achieved if closed before 1 May 2016 and mining property savings (1%) achieved by 
consolidating mining properties in high potential areas with a target of discarding 100,000 Ha, with Maximum achieved if 150,000 Ha or more discarded. The Brisbane office 
closed in April 2016 and 214,000 Ha of mining property was discarded.
7. Split between fatality risk management at the Group’s operations (3%) through the implementation of critical controls for fatality risks, as verified by the executive team 
with responsibility for Sustainability and Corporate Affairs, and performance against global lost time accidents frequency index (1%) and performance in reporting near-
miss accidents with high potential (1%). Outcomes were 110 for fatality risk management and reporting of near-miss accidents with high potential and 94.6 for global lost 
time accidents.
8. Split between the implementation of an action plan for organisational skills analysis and talent upgrade programme (2.5%) with a Target of 31 December 2016 and Maximum if 
implemented by 30 November 2016, and (2.5%) for implementing permanent productivity improvements at the Group’s operations with a Target of a 5% productivity increase 
for the year to 31 December 2016 and Maximum achieved if the improvement is 10% or more. Outcomes were 105 for both criteria.
9. Split between the control of critical environmental risks (2.5%) with Target of no operating incidents with environmental impact of high potential and Maximum where 
additional compliance with corrective measures is defined for high potential incidents as reported in 2015/2016, submission of the EIA for the Los Pelambres Incremental 
Expansion project (1.25%) with a Target submission date of 30 April 2016 and Maximum performance subject to responding to initial comments before 31 December 2016 
and improvement of processes to control critical environmental risks (1.25%) with a Target implementation date of 31 December 2016 and Maximum if implemented before 
31 October 2016. Outcomes were 104 for the control of critical environmental risks, 100 for submission of the EIA and 90 for the improvement of processes to control critical 
environmental risks.
10. Split between the control of risks relating to social incidents (3%) performance of certain steps set out in the Somos Choapa programme within budget and reaching an 
agreement with the Caimanes community to improve social relations at Los Pelambres (4%), and approval of a Social and Communications strategy for the Antofagasta Region, 
including a work plan by the Sustainability and Stakeholder Management Committee (3%). Outcomes were 104 for the control of risks, 109 for progress on Somos Choapa and 
the Caimanes agreement and 100 for the Social and Communications strategy.
11. As noted in the Company’s 2015 Remuneration Report, stand-alone adjustment triggers apply to the Annual Bonus Plan, which includes a 15% adjustment to the performance 
score – upwards if there are no fatalities during the year and downwards if there are one or more fatalities during the year. This resulted in an automatic reduction of 1.7 to the 
final Group performance score (ie 15% of 101.4 – 90).
104 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 IVÁN ARRIAGADA – INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE UNDER THE 2016 ANNUAL BONUS PLAN 
The Committee, with input from the Board, assessed Iván Arriagada’s performance against his individual objectives as 108 (within a range of 90 (Threshold) 
to 110 (Maximum)) for his individual contribution to the business during the year. This performance score counts towards 30% of his annual bonus. Iván 
Arriagada’s performance against his individual objectives is summarised below:
CATEGORY PERFORMANCE
Results Substantially met the key objectives set out by the Board at the beginning 
of the year:
 − Production guidance for the year was met. 
 − Net cash costs were 20% lower than the previous year. 
 − Centinela thickener issues were resolved and production improved by 
7% compared with 2015. 
 − The start-up of Antucoya was in line with guidance. 
Leadership Strong leadership was demonstrated by:
 − Initiation of processes to drive safety leadership across the Group.
 − Introduction of an operating excellence programme at the Group’s 
operations, targeting maintenance, planning and execution.
 − Following through on the cost reduction programmes started in 2015 to 
deliver measurable savings in 2016.
 − Development of succession plans and the creation of synergies across 
the Group’s operations.
 − Successful integration of Zaldívar, with operating improvements 
now underway.
Strategic development Focused on the priorities established by the Board, namely to cut costs 
and improve performance of the Group’s operations, in order to maintain 
competitiveness in a low copper price environment. 
Capital projects Capital projects progressed on time and on budget.
Based on performance achieved against targets during the 2016 financial year, the Committee determined that Iván Arriagada would receive a bonus 
payment of $356,754 for 2016. This figure was determined as follows:
Overall Performance Score (70% x 99.7) + (30% x 108) = 102.19
Overall Performance Score as a percentage to be applied to the Maximum (102.19 – 90) ÷ 20 = 60.95%
Gross Annual Bonus 60.95% of Ch$386,020,102 (Maximum) = Ch$235,279,252
In USD using exchange rate of $1 = Ch$659.5 $356,754
As the annual bonus is paid in Chilean pesos, it is subject to annual exchange rate movements when reported in US dollars.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
The Company introduced the LTIP at the end of 2011. Eligibility to participate in the LTIP is determined by the Committee each year on an individual basis and 
all members of the Executive Committee currently participate. Awards are normally granted annually. Directors are not eligible to participate.
Under the LTIP, participants are eligible to receive “phantom” share awards (conditional rights to receive a cash payment by reference to a specified number 
of the Company’s ordinary shares), which are paid in cash upon vesting based on the price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the time of vesting.
LTIP awards are split between Restricted Share Awards (RSAs) and Performance Share Awards (PSAs). The RSAs vest only if the relevant employee 
remains employed by the Group on the vesting date. The PSAs vest subject to both the satisfaction of performance conditions and the relevant employee 
remaining employed by the Group on the vesting date. The same performance criteria apply to all participants in the LTIP and are designed to link business 
objectives, shareholder value and senior management rewards.
 − PSAs reward performance over three years. There is no additional holding period before these amounts are paid.
 − RSAs vest one-third in each year over a three-year period following grant of the award.
The number of PSAs and RSAs awarded to each member of the Executive Committee is calculated as a percentage of salary up to a limit of 200% of base 
salary or 325% of base salary if the Committee determines that exceptional circumstances apply. The market value of shares in relation to which the award 
is to be granted is equal to the closing price on the dealing day before the grant, or, if the Committee determines, the average closing price during a period 
set by the Committee not exceeding five dealing days ending with the last dealing day before the grant.
Iván Arriagada participates in the LTIP and received total payments of $59,608 in respect of the RSAs granted in 2015 that vested in 2016, which amounted 
to 14% of his base salary. 
STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
105 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK During 2017 the PSAs granted in 2014 will vest. Iván Arriagada does not hold these PSAs and performance will not be finally determined by the Committee 
until after the date of this report, once the Group’s 2016 results have been released to the market. The performance criteria attaching to these PSAs and the 
anticipated performance against these criteria, based on estimates as at the date of this report, are as follows:

* Due to market conditions in 2015 and 2016, the Board made certain decisions that resulted in a slow-down of the execution timetable for the Group’s projects portfolio. As 
a result, the Committee has agreed to adjust the outcome of the performance criteria that apply to PSAs granted in 2014 relating to execution of the Encuentro Oxides and 
Centinela Second Concentrator projects and the Los Pelambres expansion project.
1. Anticipated performance is based on estimates made as at the date of this report. These awards will not vest until after the Group’s 2016 results have been released to 
the market.
2. Total shareholder return is calculated to show a theoretical change in the value of a shareholding over a specified period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase 
additional shares at the closing price applicable on the ex-dividend date. Total shareholder return for the Euromoney Global Mining Index is calculated by aggregating the 
returns of all individual constituents of that index and, for the purposes of comparison with the Company’s share performance, taking an average of the index over three months 
before the beginning and the end of the period respectively.
3. Targets are calculated based on the Group’s accumulated EBITDA over the period from 2014-2016, versus the 2014 budget figure and the Group’s 2014 internal base case 
figures for 2015 and 2016. The final calculation will not be adjusted for commodity price or exchange rate fluctuations.

DIEGO HERNÁNDEZ – STRATEGIC AWARDS
Diego Hernández received Strategic Awards in 2015, in lieu of the LTIP awards that he may otherwise have received and in substitution for the PSAs and 
RSAs granted in 2014. The purpose of these Strategic Awards was to align his performance goals with the Group’s strategy, taking into account his new 
role and its associated responsibilities, and also his planned retirement in 2016 following a smooth handover to his successor.
The Strategic Awards were cash awards not linked to the Company’s share price. The amount paid to Diego Hernández during 2016 in relation to these 
awards was $1,180,000, 77% of the maximum.

107 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK 2016 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
INDICATIVE CEO’S TOTAL REMUNERATION IN 2017
The Group CEO’s total remuneration in 2017 will consist of the same elements as in 2016, including:
 − Annual base salary of Ch$386,040,204 ($567,706) as at 1 January 2017, subject to adjustments for Chilean inflation, as described above, and using an  
exchange rate of $1 = Ch$680 
 − An annual bonus equivalent to 50% of base salary if Target performance is achieved, with a Maximum of 100% if stretch targets are met
 − The vesting of LTIP awards granted before 8 April 2016, equivalent to a maximum of 33% of base salary (using the average share price for the last 
quarter of 2016)
 − A significant proportion of the remuneration available to Iván Arriagada is dependent on the performance of the Group.
2017 ANNUAL BONUS PLAN
The Board has agreed Group performance criteria for the 2017 Annual Bonus Plan as follows:
WEIGHTING OBJECTIVE MEASURE THRESHOLD TARGET MAXIMUM
60% Core Business
10% EBITDA $m ≤-10% The Group’s future metals price assumptions 
are commercially sensitive and therefore

The weighting attributable to core business has decreased from 70% of the total scorecard in 2016 to 60% in 2017, and the weighting attributable to 
Business Development – Growth Projects Execution has increased from 5% in 2016 to 15% in 2017. This reflects the importance of the Group’s current 
project portfolio and an increasing focus on exploration at this point in the copper price cycle.
108 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 2017 LTIP AWARDS
The Committee commenced a review of the LTIP in 2016. This included 
reviewing the plan’s objectives, methodology, participants, performance 
KPIs and targets. As part of this process, the plan was benchmarked 
against peers both globally and in the UK. Participants were asked to 
give feedback on the plan, including whether or not the performance 
KPIs adequately reflect current business challenges. As a consequence, 
total shareholder return will account for 35% of the performance criteria 
attaching to 2017 PSAs (decreased from 40% in 2016), resources increase 
will account for 15% (increased from 5% in 2016), and project development 
and sustainability will account for 30% (decreased from 35% in 2016).
The PSAs granted in 2017 will be measured over a three-year performance 
period. The specific targets will be determined by the Committee after 
the publication of the Group’s 2016 results. The performance conditions 
are anticipated to be those set out below as at the date of this report. If 
the performance conditions set by the Committee end up being materially 
different from those disclosed below, the revised performance conditions 
will be disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report.

Figures do not include PSAs (because the first tranche of PSAs awarded 
in 2015 will not vest until 2018) and are based on the following assumptions:
 − Minimum consists of base salary plus benefits only and excludes 
adjustments for inflation.
 − Target consists of base salary, benefits and incentive awards at 50% of 
the maximum potential award. 
 − Maximum consists of base salary, benefits and incentive awards at 100% 
of the maximum potential award.
 − There is no change in the share price in calculating potential awards.
 − Long-term variable elements are calculated using the average closing 
share price for the last quarter of 2016 of 630.5p and an exchange rate 
of £1 = $1.242.
 − Base salary, benefits and incentive awards are estimated in Chilean 
pesos and long-term variable elements are estimated by reference to the 
Company’s share price, which is in sterling. These figures are therefore 
subject to exchange rate fluctuations.
REMUNERATION STRUCTURE
The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration arrangements for 
Iván Arriagada and the Executive Committee are linked to performance, 
appropriately stretching and aligned to the Group’s strategy. Variable 
remuneration is a core component of Executive Committee remuneration 
and in 2017 up to 60% of the Executive Committee’s total annual 
remuneration may be received under the Annual Bonus Plan and the LTIP.

2. The Chairman was not eligible for variable remuneration and the 2014 percentage figures therefore only relate to the 2014 annual bonus and LTIP awards vesting for 
the Group CEO. 
3. The 2015 figure has been restated – an estimate was included in the 2015 Remuneration Report because these awards had not yet vested as at the date of that report. 
No PSAs will vest for the Group CEO for 2016. As RSAs do not have a performance element, they are not included in these calculations. 
COMPARISON OF OVERALL PERFORMANCE AND 
REMUNERATION
The following graph shows the Company’s performance compared with 
the performance of the FTSE All-Share Index and the Euromoney Global 
Mining Index over an eight-year period, measured by total shareholder 
return (as defined below). The FTSE All-Share Index has been selected as 
an appropriate benchmark as it is the most broadly-based index to which 
the Company belongs and relates to the London Stock Exchange, where the 
Company’s ordinary shares are traded.
Total shareholder return represents share price growth plus dividends 
reinvested over the period. Total Return Basis Index – 31 December 2008 
= 100.
Total shareholder return performance in comparison with the Euromoney 
Global Mining Index is one of the performance criteria for PSAs granted 
pursuant to the LTIP, as described above.
Total shareholder return is calculated to show a theoretical change in 
the value of a shareholding over a period, assuming that dividends are 
reinvested to purchase additional shares at the closing price applicable on 
the ex-dividend date. Total shareholder return for the FTSE All-Share Index 
and the Euromoney Global Mining Index is calculated by aggregating the 
returns of all individual constituents of those indices at the end of an eight-
year period.

2016 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
110 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 RELATIVE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION
The aggregated total remuneration paid to Diego Hernández and Iván 
Arriagada as Group CEO for 2016 was 7% lower than the total remuneration 
paid to Diego Hernández as Group CEO in 2015. This included a 24% 
decrease in fees/base salary and a 36% decrease in benefits.
The equivalent average percentage change in total remuneration for Group 
employees as a whole was an increase of 4%. This comprised a 2.6% 
increase in salaries, a 2.6% increase in benefits and an 11% increase in 
annual bonus. It is common for employment contracts in Chile to include an 
annual adjustment for Chilean inflation and most Group employees’ base 
salaries in Chile are linked to inflation. In 2016, Chilean inflation was 2.7%.
The table below compares the changes from 2015 to 2016 in fees/base 
salary, benefits and annual bonus paid to the Group CEO and Group 
employees as a whole. The underlying elements of Group CEO pay are 
calculated using the values reported in the single figure remuneration table 
on page 101.

1. The figures for Group CEO relate to the percentage changes for the aggregate 
amount paid to Diego Hernández and Iván Arriagada in 2016 and the amount paid to 
Diego Hernández in 2015.
2. The percentage change in annual bonus for the Group CEO is higher than for Group 
employees because under the terms of the Annual Bonus Plan employees are 
entitled to their full annual bonus if their employment terminates during the last six 
months of the year. Because Diego Hernández’s employment terminated in August 
2016, the element of Group CEO Annual Bonus attributable to Diego Hernández is 
therefore higher than for the equivalent period in 2015.
3. This figure relates to the percentage change in average annual bonus for mining 
division employees and does not include a one-off bonus paid to employees as a 
result of the conclusion of collective bargaining agreements with labour unions at 
Antucoya, Los Pelambres and Zaldívar in 2016. Mining division employees were 
chosen as the comparator group because the mining division accounts for more 
than 90% of the Group’s revenue and the Annual Bonus Plan that applies to the 
Executive Committee is the same plan that applies to the mining division as a whole.

By order of the Board
TIM BAKER
CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION AND TALENT 
MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
13 March 2017
STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
111 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK The Committee presents the 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Policy (Policy), 
which will be put to a binding vote of shareholders at the Company’s 2017 
Annual General Meeting. 
Subject to shareholder approval, this Policy will take effect from the 
2017 Annual General Meeting with the intention that it will supersede the 
remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting (2014 Policy) and will remain in place for three years. Once the 
Policy is approved, the Company will only make remuneration payments 
to current or prospective Directors, or payments for loss of office, if the 
payment is in line with the Policy.
If the Committee is required, or wishes, to change the Policy within this 
period, it will submit a revised Policy to shareholders for approval.
The policies that are summarised in this section are consistent with those 
that have been in place at the Company for a number of years which the 
Committee believes are effective and simple to understand.
CHANGES TO 2014 POLICY 
On 1 September 2014, Jean-Paul Luksic stepped back from his position 
of Executive Chairman to become Non-Executive Chairman. As there are 
currently no executives on the Board and the Company does not expect an 
Executive Director to be appointed during the next three years, the Policy 
does not include components relating to Executive Directors which were 
included in the 2014 Policy.
POLICY SCOPE
The policies that are summarised in this section apply to Non-Executive 
Directors only. The Board has considered the pros and cons of having 
executives on the Board and continues to be of the view that the existing 
structure is effective in ensuring that the Board maintains objectivity and 
independence from management and appropriate given the CEO, Executive 
Committee and most senior managers are based in Chile where local 
company law prohibits CEOs of public companies from serving as directors 
of those companies. 
Although the policies that are summarised in this section do not cover 
executive remuneration, the Company will continue to embrace the spirit 
of the UK remuneration reporting regulations and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code by voluntarily reporting each year on the remuneration 
and incentive pay design for the Company’s CEO as if he were a Director 
and by providing detailed information in relation to the structure and 
components of the other Executive Committee members’ remuneration. 
The Policy is broken into a number of sections:
 − remuneration policies that relate solely to Non-Executive Directors; and
 − statements regarding the contextual information the Committee 
considers when reaching remuneration decisions in respect of the Non-
Executive Directors.
The Company’s policy is to ensure that Non-Executive Directors are fairly 
rewarded with regard to the responsibilities undertaken, and to consider 
comparable pay levels and structures in the UK, Chile and the international 
mining industry. 
The Chairman’s fees and other terms are set by the Committee. Non-
Executive Directors’ fees and other terms are set by the Board upon 
recommendation of the Committee.
2017 DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION POLICY
2017 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
112 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 PURPOSE OPERATION MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY
DIRECTORS
Fees To attract and retain high-calibre, 
experienced Directors by offering 
globally competitive fee levels.
Fees are reviewed annually and the 
competitiveness of total fees is assessed 
against companies of a similar nature, size 
and complexity.
Directors receive a base fee for services to the 
Company’s Board as well as additional fees 
for chairing or serving as a member of any of 
the Board’s Committees or serving as Senior 
Independent Director. The Chairman receives a 
higher base fee which reflects his responsibility, 
experience and time commitment to the role.
Separate base fees are paid for services to the 
Antofagasta Minerals board (all Non-Executive 
Directors are members of both boards), and for 
serving as a director, or chairing, any subsidiary 
or joint-venture company Boards.
Ramón Jara also receives a base fee for 
advisory services provided to Antofagasta 
Minerals pursuant to a separate service 
contract. This fee is currently denominated in 
Chilean pesos and is automatically adjusted for 
Chilean inflation 
All other fee levels are currently denominated 
in US dollars and are not automatically adjusted 
for inflation. The Committee may determine fee 
levels and/or pay fees in any other currency if 
deemed necessary or appropriate.
In normal circumstances, the maximum 
annual fee increase will be 7%. However, the 
Committee has discretion to exceed this in 
exceptional circumstances, for example:
 − if there is a sustained period of high inflation;
 − if fees are out of line with the market; and/or
 − if fees for chairing or serving as a member of 
any of the Board’s Committees or performing 
a specific role on the Board such as Senior 
Independent Director are out of line with 
the market.
Any increases will take into account the factors 
described under “operation”, will not be 
excessive, and the rationale for the increase will 
be disclosed in the remuneration report for the 
relevant financial year.
Fee levels for additional roles within the 
Group are set based on the needs and time 
commitment expected and may be determined 
and/or paid in a combination of currencies 
including US dollars and Chilean pesos.
Chilean peso denominated fees will be increased 
to take account of Chilean inflation and may 
be reported from one year to the next as an 
increase or decrease as a result of exchange 
rate movements only. Because all amounts are 
reported in US dollars, any exchange rate impact 
will not be taken into account when applying the 
maximum annual fee increase described above.
Variable
remuneration
Given the non-executive composition of the Board, there are no arrangements for Directors to acquire benefits through the acquisition 
of shares in the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, to benefit through performance-related pay or to participate in long-
term incentive schemes. The Code states that remuneration for Non-Executive Directors should not include share options or other 
performance-related elements.
Benefits To provide appropriate benefits 
and reimburse appropriate 
expenses that are incurred in 
the performance of duties of 
the Directors.
Benefits include the provision of life, accident 
and health insurance and may also include 
professional advice and certain other minor 
benefits including occasional spousal travel in 
connection with the business and any Company 
business expenses which are deemed to be 
taxable. The Company will pay any tax payable 
on those benefits on behalf of Directors.
The Committee retains the discretion to 
provide additional insurance benefits in 
accordance with Company policy, should this be 
deemed necessary.
Set at a level appropriate to the individual’s role 
and circumstances. The maximum opportunity 
will depend on the type of benefit and cost of 
its provision, which will vary according to the 
market and individual circumstances.
Pension No Director receives pension contributions. The Code considers that the participation by a Non-Executive Director in a company’s 
pension scheme could potentially impact on the independence of that Non-Executive Director.
As Directors do not receive variable remuneration, there are no provisions in place to recover sums paid or to withhold payments made to Directors.
SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENTS
The Company does not currently have shareholding guidelines or requirements for Directors. However, Chairman Jean-Paul Luksic and Non-Executive 
Director Andrónico Luksic C are members of the Luksic family; members of the Luksic family are interested in the E. Abaroa Foundation which controls 
the Metalinvest Establishment and Kupferberg Establishment (which, in aggregate, hold approximately 60.66% of the Company’s ordinary shares and 
approximately 94.12% of the Company’s preference shares). In addition, Mr Jean-Paul Luksic controls the Severe Studere Foundation which in turn, controls 
Aureberg Establishment (which holds approximately 4.26% of the Company’s ordinary shares). This creates significant alignment between these members 
of the Board and shareholders.
STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
113 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK RECRUITMENT POLICY
The appointment of Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) is handled through the Nomination and Governance Committee and Board processes. 
The current fee levels are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. Details of each element of remuneration paid to the Chairman and Directors are 
set out in the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 100.
The terms of appointment for any new Non-Executive Director will be consistent with those in place for current Non-Executive Directors as summarised in 
the service contracts and letters of appointment policy. 
Variable pay will not be considered and, as such, no maximum applies. Fees will be consistent with the policy at the time of appointment.
A timely announcement with respect to any Director appointment will be made to the regulatory news services and posted on the Company’s website.
TERMINATION POLICY
The letters of appointment for the Non-Executive Directors do not provide for any compensation for loss of office beyond payments in lieu of notice, and 
therefore the maximum amount payable upon termination of these letters is limited to one month’s payment.
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
All Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours and 
at the Annual General Meeting (for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting).
Each Director has a letter of appointment with the Company. The Company has a policy of putting all Directors forward for re-election at each Annual 
General Meeting in accordance with the Code. Under the terms of the letters, if shareholders do not confirm a Director’s appointment or reappointment, 
the appointment will terminate with immediate effect. In other circumstances, the appointment may be terminated by either the Director or the Company 
on one month’s prior written notice. The letters require the Directors to undertake that they will have sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities.
A summary of the key terms of the letters of appointment for all Directors is set out below.

There is also a contract between Antofagasta Minerals and Asesorías Ramón F Jara Ltda (formerly E.I.R.L.) dated 2 November 2004 for the provision of advisory services by Ramón 
Jara. This contract does not have an expiry date but can be terminated by either party on one month’s notice. The amounts payable under this contract for services are denominated in 
Chilean pesos and, as is typical for employment contracts or contracts for services in Chile, are adjusted in line with Chilean inflation, and are also reviewed periodically in line with the 
Company’s policy on Directors’ pay.
CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT 
CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE 
COMPANY
When the Committee reviews Director compensation, it also reviews pay 
conditions across the rest of the Group. This is set in the context of very 
different working environments and geographies and therefore is not a 
mechanical process. However, this acts as one input into the pay review 
process. The Committee does not currently use any other remuneration 
comparison metrics when determining the quantum and structure of 
Director compensation and does not solicit employees’ views.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR OTHER 
EMPLOYEES
Remuneration arrangements are determined throughout the Group based 
on the principle that reward should be granted for delivery of the Group’s 
strategy. A significant proportion of the CEO and Executive Committee 
members’ remuneration is in the form of variable pay. The CEO and 
Executive Committee are eligible to participate in the LTIP and Annual 
Bonus Plan, which are both subject to performance criteria aligned with the 
Group’s strategy. The remuneration structure for other Group employees 
varies according to their role, location and working environment.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Company maintains a dialogue with institutional shareholders and 
sell-side analysts, as well as potential shareholders. This communication is 
managed by the Investor Relations team, and includes a formal programme 
of presentations to update institutional shareholders and analysts on 
developments in the Group following the announcement of the half-year 
and full-year results. The Board receives regular summaries and feedback 
in respect of the meetings held as part of the Investor Relations programme, 
as well as receiving analysts’ reports on the Company. 
The Senior Independent Director meets with shareholders regularly and the 
Chairman, and the Chairman of the Committee, are also regularly available 
to meet shareholders to discuss matters of importance, including the 
Group’s remuneration structures. 
The Company’s Annual General Meeting is also used as an opportunity to 
communicate with both institutional and private shareholders. 
This ongoing dialogue allows us to respond to the needs and concerns of all 
shareholders throughout the year and the Directors’ pay arrangements will 
continue to be reviewed each year in line with the policy, taking into account 
the views of all of the Company’s shareholders.
2017 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED

challenges and recent achievements at the Group’s corporate headquarters in Santiago and was followed 
by a dinner reception hosted by the Chairman, who engaged with shareholders on a broad range of topics. 
The General Managers of Los Pelambres, Centinela and Antucoya hosted shareholders and analysts at their

DIRECTORS
Directors that have served during the year and summaries of current 
Directors’ key skills and experience are set out in the Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 72 to 74.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
There have been no post balance sheet events.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Details of the Company’s policies on financial risk management are set out 
in Note 25 to the Financial Statements.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The consolidated profit before tax (excluding exceptional items) has 
increased from $242.8 million in 2015 to $875.9 million in 2016.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 15.3 cents per ordinary 
share. No final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2015 was paid. An 
interim dividend of 3.1 cents was paid on 30 September 2016 (2015 interim 
dividend – 3.1 cents). This gives total dividends per share proposed in 
relation to 2016 of 18.4 cents (2015 – 3.1 cents) and a total dividend amount 
in relation to 2016 of $181.4 million (2015 – $30.6 million).
Preference shares carry the right to a fixed cumulative dividend of 5% 
per annum. The preference shares are classified within borrowings and 
preference dividends are included within finance costs. The total cost 
of dividends paid on preference shares and recognised as an expense 
in the income statement was $0.2 million (2015 – $0.2 million). Further 
information relating to dividends is set out in the Financial Review on page 
64 and in Note 13 to the Financial Statements.
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS
The Group did not make political donations during the year ended 
31 December 2016 (2015 – nil).
AUDITORS
The auditors, PwC LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office 
and a resolution seeking to reappoint them will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
The Directors in office at the date of this report have each confirmed that:
(a) so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which 
the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
(b) they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors 
in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Details of the authorised and issued ordinary share capital, including details 
of any movements in the issued share capital during the year, are shown 
in Note 30 to the Financial Statements. The Company has one class of 
ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income. Each ordinary share 
carries one vote at any general meeting of the Company.
Details of the preference share capital are shown in Note 23 to the Financial 
Statements. The preference shares are non-redeemable and are entitled 
to a fixed cumulative dividend of 5% per annum. Each preference share 
carries 100 votes on a poll at any general meeting of the Company.
The nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital is approximately 
96.1% of the total Sterling nominal value of all issued share capital, and the 
nominal value of the issued preference share capital is approximately 3.9% 
of the total Sterling nominal value of all issued share capital. Originally, 
the ordinary shares and preference shares had the same voting rights. 
However, the number of ordinary shares has increased over time through 
stock splits and bonus issues so that a holding of one ordinary share in 
1982 would now amount to a holding of 100 ordinary shares (before taking 
into account all the rights issues since then).
The preference shares were not split at the same time as the ordinary 
shares, and the voting rights attaching to these shares were increased 
purely to maintain the relative votes of each class, not to give additional 
weighting to the preference shares.
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of shares or on their 
voting rights beyond those standard provisions set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association and other provisions of applicable law and regulation 
(including, in particular, following a failure to provide the Company with 
information about interests in shares as required by the Companies Act 
2006). The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders 
of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the 
Company is governed by, and has regard to, its Articles of Association, 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, the Companies Act 2006 and 
related legislation. The Articles of Association may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders. There are no significant agreements in place 
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company. 
There are no agreements in place between the Company and its Directors 
or employees that provide for compensation for loss of office resulting from 
a change of control of the Company.
AUTHORITY TO ISSUE SHARES AND AUTHORITY TO 
PURCHASE OWN SHARES
At the 2016 AGM, held on 18 May 2016, authority was given to the Directors 
to allot unissued relevant securities in the Company up to a maximum 
amount equivalent to two-thirds of the shares in issue (of which one-third 
may only be offered by way of rights issue). This authority expires on the 
date of this year’s AGM, scheduled to be held on 24 May 2017. No such 
shares have been issued. The Directors propose to renew this authority at 
this year’s AGM for the following year. 
A further special resolution passed at the 2016 AGM granted authority to the 
Directors to allot equity securities in the Company for cash, without regard 
to the pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act 2006. This authority 
also expires on the date of this year’s AGM and the Directors will seek to 
renew this authority on similar terms for the following year by way of two 
separate resolutions, in line with the Investment Association’s guidance and 
the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles.
STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
117 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK The Company was also authorised by a shareholders’ resolution passed at 
the 2016 AGM to purchase up to 10% of its issued ordinary share capital. 
Any shares which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares 
or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of the 
purchase, thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued and 
authorised share capital. This authority will expire at this year’s AGM and 
a resolution to renew the authority for a further year will be proposed. 
No shares were purchased by the Company during the year.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS AND INDEMNITIES
Details of Directors’ contracts and letters of appointment, remuneration 
and emoluments, and their interests in the shares of the Company as at 
31 December 2016 are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. No 
Director had any material interest in a contract of significance (other than 
a service contract) with the Company or any subsidiary company during 
the year.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and to the extent 
permitted by the laws of England and Wales, Directors are granted an 
indemnity from the Company in respect of liabilities personally incurred 
as a result of their office. The Company also maintained a Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance policy throughout the financial year. A new 
policy has been entered into for the current financial year.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Companies Act 2006 requires that a Director must avoid a situation 
where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or 
possibly may conflict, with the Company’s interests. The Company has 
undertaken a process to identify and, where appropriate, authorise and 
manage potential and actual conflicts. Each Director has identified his or her 
interests that may constitute conflicts including, for example, directorships in 
other companies. The Board, with detailed assistance from the Nomination 
and Governance Committee, has considered the potential and actual conflict 
situations of each of the Directors and decided in relation to each situation 
whether to authorise it and the steps, if any, which need to be taken to 
manage it. The authorisation process is not regarded as a substitute for 
managing an actual conflict of interest if one arises. The monitoring and, 
if appropriate, authorisation of actual and potential conflicts of interest is 
an ongoing process. Directors are required to notify the Company of any 
material changes in those positions or situations that have already been 
considered, as well as to notify the Company of any other new positions 
or situations that may arise. In addition to considering any new situations 
as they arise, the Board usually considers the conflict position of all 
Directors formally each year.
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDINGS
Notifiable major share interests in which the Company has been made 
aware are set out on page 70.
EXPLORATION AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Group’s operating companies carry out exploration and research 
and development activities that are necessary to support and expand 
their operations.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
118 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION TO THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have prepared the 
Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union, and the 
Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law), including Financial Reporting Standard 
101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”). Under company law, 
the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 − select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 − make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 − state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable 
UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101, have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and 
Parent Company Financial Statements respectively; and
 − prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Corporate Governance Report, confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
 − the Group Financial Statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
 − the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report include a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ANTOFAGASTA PLC 
REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
OUR OPINION 
IN OUR OPINION: 
Antofagasta plc’s Group financial statements and Parent Company financial 
statements (the ‘financial statements’) give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2016 and 
of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended; 
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by 
the European Union; 
– the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; 
and 
– the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED 
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements (the ‘Annual Report’), comprise: 
– the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2016; 
– the Balance Sheet of the Parent Company as at 31 December 2016; 
– the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the year then ended; 
– the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow for the year then ended; 
– the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; 
– the Statement of Changes in Equity of the Parent Company for the year 
then ended; and 
– the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual 
Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-
referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of 
the Group financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
and applicable law. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), and applicable law. 
 
OUR AUDIT APPROACH 
OVERVIEW 
 
 
– Overall Group materiality: $45 million which represents 5% of the three-year average of profit before tax adjusted 
for one-off items. 
– We identified the four mine sites, Los Pelambres, Centinela, Antucoya and Zaldívar, which in our view, required an 
audit of their complete financial information.  
– Taken together, the locations and functions where we performed our audit work accounted for 96% of revenue 
and approximately 85% of absolute adjusted profit before tax (i.e. the sum of the numerical values without regard 
to whether they were profits or losses for the relevant locations and functions). 
– Impairment assessments at Antucoya, Twin Metals and Alto Maipo. 
– Finalisation of Zaldívar purchase price accounting 
 
THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT AND OUR AREAS OF FOCUS 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where 
the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as ‘areas of focus’ 
in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS – MINING PROPERTIES
  
In accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of assets” the Directors are required 
to perform a review for impairment of long-lived assets at any time an 
indicator of impairment exists.  
The Directors identified that impairment indicators existed at Antucoya where 
post declaration of commercial production the higher carrying value did not 
appear supported by the latest estimate of the recoverable value.  
The resulting impairment review determined that the recoverable amount was 
below their carrying value. Accordingly an impairment provision of $215.6 m 
was recognised, along with a deferred tax credit of $99.4m, resulting in a 
post-tax impairment of $116.2m. The Directors determined that there were no 
indicators of impairment at Centinela. The Directors considered if there were 
impairment indicators at the Group’s other mines, including considering the 
results of a carrying value review, but concluded that there were not. 
The determination of recoverable amount was based on the higher of value-
in-use and fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD”), which requires 
judgement on the part of the Directors in valuing the relevant CGUs. As a 
value-in-use methodology does not permit future expansion or optimisation 
plans to be included within the discounted cash flow model, the Directors 
have used a FVLCD valuation methodology to determine the recoverable 
amount, applying assumptions that a market participant would use to 
determine fair value.  
Refer to Note 4 Exceptional items. 
 
 We considered the Directors’ impairment trigger analysis and agree that 
impairment indicators existed at Antucoya and that this was the appropriate 
CGU for impairment testing purposes. We considered whether impairment 
indicators existed for other CGUs and concluded they did not. 
We evaluated the Directors’ future cash flow forecasts, and the process by 
which they were drawn up, including verifying the mathematical accuracy of 
the cash flow models and agreeing future capital and operating expenditure to 
the latest Board approved budgets, modified as required for FVLCD modelling 
purposes, and the latest approved Life of Mine plans. We assessed the 
reasonableness of the Directors’ future capital and operating expenses in light 
of their historical accuracy and the current operating results and concluded 
the forecasts had been appropriately prepared, based on updated 
assessments of future operating performance and cost savings initiatives. 
Utilising our valuation experts, we evaluated the appropriateness of key 
market related assumptions in the Directors’ valuation models, including the 
copper prices, discount rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We noted 
that the required impairment charge was particularly sensitive to changes in 
the long-term copper price and discount rate assumptions.  
We formed an independent view of the copper price that a market participant 
might use in a fair value less cost to dispose scenario. We found that the 
Directors’ long-term copper price assumption of $3.00/lb was at the higher 
end of a reasonable range. We independently calculated a weighted average 
cost of capital by making reference to market data, and considering the CGU 
specific risks. The discount rate used by the Directors of 8% fell within a 
reasonable range. We performed sensitivity analysis around the key 
assumptions within the cash flow forecasts using a range of higher discount 
rates and lower long term copper prices. 
In light of the above, we reviewed the appropriateness of the related 
disclosures in Note 4 of the financial statements, including the sensitivities 
provided, and concluded they were appropriate. 
AREA OF FOCUS  HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE AREA OF FOCUS 
IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS – OTHER ASSETS 
  
In accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of assets” the Directors are required 
to perform a review for impairment of long-lived assets at any time an 
indicator of impairment exists. 
The Directors identified that impairment indicators existed at its wholly owned 
exploration subsidiary Twin Metals in the US where the Bureau of Land 
Management declined to renew two federal mineral leases. In response a 
federal lawsuit has been filed, noting that rescinding of the leases is 
inconsistent with federal law, the terms of leases themselves, and the federal 
government’s established precedent in supporting and renewing the leases 
over the past five decades. The Directors have announced that they remain 
committed to progressing the project and will continue to pursue legal 
avenues to protect the Group’s contractual mineral rights, carried at $150m. 
Accordingly no impairment has been recognised at this time. 
The Directors also concluded that there was an indication that the Group’s 
interest in the Alto Maipo hydro project was impaired following the 
announcement of forecast cost increases and the Group’s subsequent 
decision to exit the project for nominal consideration.  
Accordingly, an impairment provision of $367.6m was recognised, comprising 
$74.0m with respect to the investment in associate balance and $52.6m of 
mark-to-market losses in respect of derivative financial instruments held by 
Alto Maipo previously deferred in reserves, resulting in a $126.6m loss 
reflected in the profit from associates and joint ventures lines and $241.0m of 
loan financing (including interest receivable) reflected in operating cost. This 
impairment provision resulted in a deferred tax credit of $95.0 million 
resulting in a post-tax impact of $272.6m. 
Refer to Note 4 Exceptional items. 
 
 
 We discussed the impact of the actions of the Bureau of Land Management 
with management to help us assess the implications on the Group’s ability to 
continue to progress the Twin Metals project. We noted the Directors remain 
committed to the project, have filed a federal lawsuit and believe that the 
Group’s contractual mineral rights can be protected through this legal avenue. 
We corroborated these views with management’s external counsel. 
The actions and resulting lawsuit are very recent which makes predicting the 
outcome inherently judgemental. Additionally, the actions only relate to two of 
the mineral leases, rather than all leases, further complicating the 
assessment. However we concluded no impairment had occurred by the 
balance sheet date. 
With respect to Alto Maipo, we reviewed the terms of the agreements and 
concluded that a full impairment of related balances was appropriate. We also 
reviewed the work of management’s tax expert as part of our assessment of 
the related tax consequences.  
We reviewed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in Notes 36 and 4 
of the financial statements and concluded they were appropriate.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ANTOFAGASTA PLC CONTINUED 
AREA OF FOCUS  HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE AREA OF FOCUS 
FINALISATION OF ZALDÍVAR PURCHASE PRICE ACCOUNTING
Accounting for acquisitions of joint ventures under IFRS is inherently complex, 
requiring the Directors to perform a purchase price allocation exercise to fair 
value the assets and liabilities of the acquired business. As Zaldívar was 
acquired on 1 December 2015, there was limited time to conduct this exercise 
in the prior year and in particular, the working capital adjustment period 
remained open. 
Following an adjustment to the final consideration for the purchase to 
$949.7m, the provisional purchase price allocations previously recorded have 
now been finalised. 
The main adjustment was a revision to working capital balances. 
Refer to Note 19 – Compania Minera Zaldívar SPA transaction. 
 We obtained and reviewed the purchase agreements and related 
amendments and confirmed that the appropriate consideration had been 
recorded. We also reviewed the amendments to the initial purchase price 
allocations and considered if these were supportable and noted no exceptions. 
The Group engaged an independent valuation expert to perform the purchase 
price allocation exercise and we assessed the competency and objectivity of 
the expert, and the scope of their work. Specifically in relation to ore 
stockpiles we read the expert’s report and discussed with the expert their 
valuation methodology for inventory, along with the key judgements they 
made in determining the fair values. We determined that the methods used by 
the Directors’ expert were appropriate and the fair values appeared 
reasonable based on the judgements made. 
We concurred with the Directors’ expert’s assessment of the purchase price 
allocation and the appropriateness of the related disclosures in Note 19 of the 
financial statements. 
 
HOW WE TAILORED THE AUDIT SCOPE 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work 
to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into 
account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.  
The core mining business consists of four assets: Los Pelambres; Centinela; 
Antucoya, which has commenced production during the year; and Zaldívar, a 
joint venture with Barrick Gold Corporation operated by the Group. These 
mines produce copper cathodes, copper concentrates and significant volumes 
of by-products. 
In addition to mining, the Group has a transport division that provides rail and 
road cargo services in northern Chile predominantly to mining customers, 
including to the Group’s own operations. 
All of the above operations are located in Chile. In addition, the Group has 
corporate head offices located in both Santiago, Chile (Antofagasta Minerals) 
and London, UK (Antofagasta plc). The Group also has exploration projects in 
various countries. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the 
type of work that needed to be performed at each of the four mine sites and 
the corporate offices in Chile, by us, as the Group engagement team and by 
component auditors from PwC Chile operating under our instruction. Los 
Pelambres and Centinela were considered to be financially significant 
components of the Group, due to their contribution towards Group profit 
before tax, and so required audits of their complete financial information. 
Antucoya and Zaldívar were also subject to an audit of their complete financial 
information, in response to the risks of impairment to Antucoya’s carrying 
value and the carrying value of inventory at Zaldívar. 
We also requested that component auditors perform specified procedures 
over the corporate offices in Chile, and specific line items of other entities 
within the Group to ensure that we had sufficient coverage from our audit 
work for each line of the Group’s financial statements. For all other non-
financially significant components, the Group team performed analytical 
review procedures. 
Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level 
of involvement we needed to have in the audit work to be able to conclude 
whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for 
our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
A UK senior manager was seconded to PwC Chile to be an integral part of the 
team. In addition the Senior Statutory Auditor visited Chile four times, 
including two mine site visits, key audit meetings with management and 
meetings with our component auditors. The Group team also reviewed the 
component auditor working papers, attended local audit clearance meetings, 
and reviewed other forms of communications dealing with significant 
accounting and auditing issues. 
MATERIALITY 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set 
certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative 
considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement 
line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole as follows: 
OVERALL GROUP 
MATERIALITY 
$45 million (2015: $65 million). 
 
HOW WE 
DETERMINED IT 
5% of the three-year average of profit before tax adjusted 
for one-off items. 
 
RATIONALE FOR 
BENCHMARK 
APPLIED 
We believe that profit before tax is the primary measure in 
assessing the performance of the Group, and is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark. We used a three-year 
average due to the impact on profit before tax of the 
inherent volatility in copper commodity prices, and adjusted 
for one-off items to eliminate the volatility that they 
introduce. 
 
COMPONENT 
MATERIALITY 
For each component in our audit scope, we allocated a 
materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. 
The range of materiality allocated across components was 
between $12 million and $30 million. Certain components 
were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was 
also less than our overall Group materiality. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above $1.5 million (2015: $3 million) 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons. 
GOING CONCERN 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, 
set out on page 22, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have 
anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ 
statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. We have nothing material 
to add or to draw attention to.  
  
124 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016  
 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Parent 
Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the 
financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that 
the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements 
are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. 
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING 
CONSISTENCY OF OTHER INFORMATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS 
COMPANIES ACT 2006 REPORTING 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
– the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and 
– the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group, the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are 
required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We have nothing to report in this respect. 
ISAS (UK & IRELAND) REPORTING 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
– information in the Annual Report is: materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group and Parent Company acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or otherwise misleading. 
 
We have no exceptions  
to report 
– the statement given by the Directors on page 119, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘Code’), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for members to assess the Group’s and Parent Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Parent Company acquired in the course of 
performing our audit. 
 
We have no exceptions  
to report. 
– the section of the Annual Report on pages 88 to 91, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
 
We have no exceptions  
to report. 
THE DIRECTORS’ ASSESSMENT OF THE PROSPECTS OF THE GROUP AND OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS THAT WOULD 
THREATEN THE SOLVENCY OR LIQUIDITY OF THE GROUP: 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to: 
– the Directors’ confirmation on page 23 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
 
We have nothing material 
to add or to draw 
attention to. 
– the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated. 
 
We have nothing material 
to add or to draw 
attention to. 
– the Directors’ explanation on page 22 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, 
and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
 
We have nothing material 
to add or to draw 
attention to. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group and the Directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only 
consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the 
relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our 
audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AND THE AUDIT 
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THOSE OF THE DIRECTORS 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out 
on page 119, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 
16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to 
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
WHAT AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INVOLVES 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of:  
– whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the 
Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed;  
– the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and 
– the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and 
evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis 
for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the 
effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by 
us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report. With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we 
consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable 
legal requirements.

130 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016  
 
 
 
1 BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and with those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. For these purposes, 
IFRS comprise the standards issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB”) and IFRS Interpretations Committee  
(“IFRS IC”) that have been endorsed by the European Union (“EU”). 
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. 
Details of the factors which have been taken into account in assessing the 
Group’s going concern status are set out within the Directors´ Report. 
Antofagasta Plc is a company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled  
in the United Kingdom at Cleveland House, 33 King Street, St James’s  
London SW1Y 6RJ. 
The immediate parent of the Group is Metalinvest Establishment, which is 
controlled by E. Abaroa Foundation, in which members of the Luksic family 
are interested. 
The nature of the Group entities’ operations are mainly related with mining 
and exploration activities, rail and road cargo.  
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING 2016  
The Antucoya operation achieved commercial production on 1 April 2016,  
and its revenue and costs have accordingly been recognised in the income 
statement from that date onwards. 
The Group has revised its estimation of deferred stripping costs which has 
resulted in the capitalisation of $118.1 million of deferred stripping costs for 
Los Pelambres mine during 2016. 
In 2015 Antofagasta acquired a 50% stake in Compañia Minera Zaldívar SpA 
(“Zaldívar”) from Barrick Gold Corporation. Total preliminary consideration for 
the transaction was $1,005.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments based on 
the net debt and working capital levels of Zaldívar at the completion date. The 
net debt and working capital adjustments were finalised in August 2016 and 
resulted in a final adjusted consideration of $949.7 million. 
The Group completed the sale of Minera Michilla SA to Haldeman Mining 
Company S.A., on 30 December 2016. In these financial statements the net 
results of Michilla for the twelve months to December 2016 are shown in  
the income statement on the line for “Profit for the period from discontinued 
operations”. The comparative results for the prior year have been restated in 
order to present the comparative net result on the “Profit for the period from 
discontinued operations” line. 
Impairment charges have been recognised during 2016 in respect of Minera 
Antucoya SA, the Alto Maipo and the Energia Andina joint venture.  
The investment in associate balance relating to Tethyan Copper Company 
Limited (“Tethyan”) is a negative balance $3.1 million. The negative balance 
has been recognised because the Group funds the on-going expenses and 
liabilities of Tethyan. Given the balance is negative it has been included within 
non-current liabilities. The prior year negative balance of $2.5 million has 
been reclassified to non-current liabilities. 
A) ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations became 
effective in the current reporting period: 
– IFRS 14, Regulatory Deferral Accounts 
– IAS 19, Defined Benefit Plans, Employee Contributions (Amendments  
to IAS 19) 
– Annual improvements 2010 – 2012 Cycle – improvements to six IFRSs 
– Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations (Amendments 
to IFRS 11) 
– Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 
(Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38) 
– Agriculture: Bearer Plants (Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41) 
– Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (Amendments to IAS 27) 
– Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or 
Joint Venture (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28) 
– Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception (Amendments to 
IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28) 
– Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 1 
– Annual improvements 2012 – 2014 Cycle – improvements to four IFRSs 
The application of these standards and interpretations effective for the first 
time in the current year has had no significant impact on the amounts 
reported in these financial statements.  
B) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT  
NOT YET EFFECTIVE  
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following 
Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial 
statements were in issue but not yet effective: 
– IFRS 9, Financial Instruments 
– IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
– IFRS 16, Leases 
– IFRIC 22, Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 
– Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses (Amendments  
to IAS 12) 
– Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 7) 
– Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions 
(Amendments to IFRS 2) 
– Applying IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ with IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’ 
(Amendments to IFRS 4) 
– Transfers of Investment Property (Amendments to IAS 40) 
– Annual Improvements to three IFRS Standards 2014–2016 Cycle 
The Group is continuing to evaluate in detail the potential impact of IFRS 9  
and IFRIC 22. 
In respect of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts the current expectation is  
that the principal impact will relate to situations where the Group is effectively 
providing a shipping service to customers who have purchased copper from 
the Group, to transport that copper to a destination port specified by the 
customer. Such shipping services will represent a separate performance 
obligation and should be accounted for over time separately from the sale  
of goods. The impact of recognising shipping revenue over time rather  
than at a point in time is not expected to have a material impact on the 
financial statements.  
IFRS 16 Leases will result in most of the Group’s existing operating leases 
being accounted for similarly to finance leases under the current IAS 17, 
resulting in the recognition of additional assets within property, plant and 
equipment in respect of the right of use of the lease assets, and additional 
lease liabilities. The operating lease charges currently reflected within 
operating expenses (and EBITDA) will be eliminated, and instead depreciation 
and finance charges will be recognised in respect of the lease assets and 
liabilities. Based on the operating leases in place at 31 December 2016 it is 
currently estimated that this would result in the recognition of additional lease 
assets within property, plant & equipment and additional lease liabilities as at  
1 January 2017 of approximately $100 million in each case. It is also estimated 
that this would result in a decrease in annual operating expenses before 
depreciation (and therefore an increase in EBITDA) of approximately  
$75 million, an increase in annual depreciation of approximately $70 million, 
an increase in finance costs of less than $15 million, and a net impact on profit 
before tax of less than $15 million. 
 
  
STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
2 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
A) ACCOUNTING CONVENTION 
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention as modified by the use of fair values to measure certain financial 
instruments, principally provisionally priced sales as explained in Note 2(f) and 
financial derivative contracts as explained in Note 2(x). 
B) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of 
Antofagasta plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively “the Group”). 
a) Subsidiaries – A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control, 
which is the case when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity. The consolidated financial 
statements include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash 
flows of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating inter-company 
balances and transactions. For partly-owned subsidiaries, the net assets 
and profit attributable to non-controlling shareholders are presented as 
“Non-controlling interests” in the consolidated balance sheet and 
consolidated income statement. 
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle  
their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event  
of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-
controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made 
on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other types of non-controlling interests 
are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in 
another IFRS. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-
controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition  
plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. 
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even  
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not  
result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as 
equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group’s interests and the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative 
interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of 
the Company. 
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognised in 
profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of 
the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained 
interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including 
goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. 
When assets of the subsidiary are carried at revalued amounts or fair  
values and the related cumulative gain or loss has been recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, the amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are 
accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the relevant assets  
(i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings  
as specified by applicable IFRSs). The fair value of any investment retained  
in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair 
value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the cost on 
initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture. 
Acquisitions and disposals are treated as explained in Note 2(g) relating to 
business combinations and goodwill. 
C) INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES 
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise 
significant influence, but not control or joint control, through the power to 
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of that entity. The 
results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these 
consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.  
This requires recording the investment initially at cost to the Group and then, 
in subsequent periods, adjusting the carrying amount of the investment to 
reflect the Group’s share of the associate’s results less any impairment and 
any other changes to the associate’s net assets such as dividends. When  
the Group loses control of a former subsidiary but retains an investment in 
associate in that entity the initial carrying value of the investment in associate 
is recorded at its fair value at that point. When the Group’s share of losses  
of an associate exceeds the Group’s interest in that associate the Group 
discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses  
are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or  
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. 
D) JOINT ARRANGEMENTS 
A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have 
joint control. Joint arrangements are accounted depending on the nature of 
the arrangement. 
i) Joint ventures – are accounted for using equity method in accordance  
with IAS 28 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures as described  
in Note 2I. 
ii) Joint operations – are accounted for recognising directly the assets, 
obligations, revenues and expenses of the joint operator in the joint 
arrangement. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are  
accounted for in accordance with the relevant IFRS.  
When a Group entity transacts with its joint arrangements, profits and losses 
resulting from the transactions with the joint arrangements are recognised in 
the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in 
the joint arrangements that are not related to the Group. 
E) CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as  
the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. 
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity  
are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency are retranslated at year end exchange rates. Gains and 
losses on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period within 
other finance items. 
The presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of  
the Company is the US dollar. On consolidation, income statement items for 
entities with a functional currency other than the US dollar are translated into 
US dollars at average rates of exchange. Balance sheet items are translated 
at period-end exchange rates. Exchange differences on translation of the  
net assets of such entities are taken to equity and recorded in a separate 
currency translation reserve. Cumulative translation differences arising  
after the transition date to IFRS are recognised as income or as expenses  
in the income statement in the period in which an operation is disposed of. 
On consolidation, exchange gains and losses which arise on balances between 
Group entities are taken to reserves where that balance is, in substance, part 
of the net investment in a foreign operation, i.e. where settlement is neither 
planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. All other exchange gains 
and losses on Group balances are dealt with in the income statement. 
Fair value adjustments and any goodwill arising on the acquisition of  
a foreign entity are treated as assets of the foreign entity and translated  
at the period-end rate. 
F) REVENUE RECOGNITION 
Revenue represents the value of goods and services supplied to third parties 
during the year. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration 
received or receivable, and excludes any applicable sales tax. 
A sale is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
have passed. This is generally when title and any insurance risk has passed  
to the customer, and the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed 
location or when any services have been provided. 
  
132 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016  
Revenue from mining activities is recorded at the invoiced amounts with an 
adjustment for provisional pricing at each reporting date, as explained below. 
For copper and molybdenum concentrates, which are sold to smelters and 
roasting plants for further processing, the invoiced amount is the market  
value of the metal payable by the customer, net of deductions for tolling 
charges. Revenue includes amounts from the sale of by-products. 
Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode 
sale agreements generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time 
of shipment, with final pricing based on the monthly average London Metal 
Exchange (“LME”) copper price or the monthly average market molybdenum 
price for specified future periods. This normally ranges from one to five 
months after delivery to the customer. Such a provisional sale contains  
an embedded derivative which is required to be separated from the host 
contract. The host contract is the sale of metals contained in the concentrate 
or cathode at the provisional invoice price less tolling charges deducted, and 
the embedded derivative is the forward contract for which the provisional sale 
is subsequently adjusted. At each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal 
sales together with any related tolling charges are marked-to-market, with 
adjustments (both gains and losses) being recorded in revenue in the 
Consolidated income statement and in trade debtors in the balance sheet. 
Forward prices at the period end are used for copper concentrate and 
cathode sales, while period-end average prices are used for molybdenum 
concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of 
the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
Dividend income from available-for-sale investments, associates and joint 
ventures is recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment has 
been established and for associates and joint venture is recorded as decrease 
of the investment at balance level. 
G) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL 
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair 
value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of  
the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the 
former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group  
in exchange for control of the acquiree. The results of businesses acquired 
during the year are brought into the consolidated financial statements from 
the effective date of acquisition. The identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a business which can be measured reliably  
are recorded at their provisional fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition  
date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination 
includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date 
fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business 
combination. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that 
qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively,  
with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period 
adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained 
during the “measurement period” (which cannot exceed one year from  
the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the 
acquisition date. 
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent 
consideration that do not qualify as “measurement period” adjustments 
depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent 
reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. 
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is 
remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39. 
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously 
held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the 
acquisition date (i.e. the date when the Group obtains control) and the 
resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising 
from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously 
been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or 
loss where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were 
disposed of. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end  
of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports 
provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. 
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period  
(see above), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new 
information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the 
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised  
at that date. 
Goodwill arising in a business combination is measured as the excess of  
the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held 
equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed. Any goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is 
separately disclosed, while any goodwill on the acquisition of associates  
and joint ventures is included within investments in equity accounted entities. 
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised. Where the fair values of  
the identifiable net assets acquired exceed the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the surplus is credited to the profit or loss in the period of 
acquisition as a bargain purchase gain. 
The Group often enters into earn-in arrangements whereby the Group 
acquires an interest in a project company in exchange for funding  
exploration and evaluation expenditure up to a specified level of expenditure  
or a specified stage in the life of the project. Funding is usually conditional  
on the achievement of key milestones by the partner. Typically there is no 
consideration transferred or funding liability on the effective date of acquisition 
of the interest in the project company and no goodwill is recognised on this 
type of transaction. 
The results of businesses sold during the year are included in the 
consolidated financial statements for the period up to the effective date of 
disposal. Gains or losses on disposal are calculated as the difference between 
the sales´ proceeds (net of expenses) and the net assets attributable to the 
interest which has been sold. Where a disposal represents a separate major 
line of business or geographical area of operations, the net results attributable 
to the disposed entity are shown separately in the income statement as a 
discontinued operation. 
H) EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION EXPENDITURE 
Exploration and evaluation costs, other than those incurred in acquiring 
exploration licences, are expensed in the year in which they are incurred. 
When a mining project is considered to be commercially viable (normally 
when the project has completed a pre-feasibility study, and the start  
of a feasibility study has been approved) all further directly attributable  
pre-production expenditure is capitalised. Capitalisation of pre-production 
expenditure ceases when commercial levels of production are achieved.  
Costs incurred in acquiring exploration licences are accounted for as mining 
properties included in property, plant and equipment in accordance with the 
policy in Note 2(k) and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses. 
I) STRIPPING COSTS 
Pre-stripping and operating stripping costs are incurred in the course of the 
development and operation of open-pit mining operations. 
Pre-stripping costs relate to the removal of waste material as part of the  
initial development of an open-pit, in order to allow access to the ore body. 
These costs are capitalised within mining properties within property, plant  
and equipment. The capitalised costs are depreciated once production 
commences on a unit of production basis, in proportion to the volume of ore 
extracted in the year compared with total proven and probable reserves for 
that pit at the beginning of the year. 
  
STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
133 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
2 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CONTINUED 
Operating stripping costs relate to the costs of extracting waste material  
as part of the ongoing mining process. The on-going mining and development 
of the Group’s open-pit mines is generally performed via a succession of 
individual phases. The costs of extracting material from an open-pit mine  
are generally allocated between ore and waste stripping in proportion to  
the tonnes of material extracted. The waste stripping costs are generally 
absorbed into inventory and expensed as that inventory is processed and sold. 
Where the stripping costs relate to a significant stripping campaign which is 
expected to provide improved access to an identifiable component of the ore 
body (typically an individual phase within the overall mine plan), the costs of 
removing waste in order to improve access to that part of the ore body will  
be capitalised within mining properties within property, plant and equipment. 
The capitalised costs will then be amortised on a unit of production basis,  
in proportion to the volume of ore extracted compared with the total ore 
contained in the component of the pit to which the stripping campaign relates. 
J) INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Intangible assets include the cost of acquiring exploration licences. 
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the 
end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being 
accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful 
lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. 
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised 
separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the 
acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). 
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets  
that are acquired separately. 
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic 
benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from 
derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between  
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are 
recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. 
K) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of 
acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are capitalised 
as property, plant and equipment in the year in which they are incurred, when 
a mining project is considered to be commercially viable (normally when the 
project has completed a pre-feasibility study, and the start of a feasibility study 
has been approved). The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises the 
purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the 
location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended. Once a project has been established as commercially viable, 
related development expenditure is capitalised. This includes costs incurred  
in preparing the site for mining operations, including pre-stripping costs. 
Capitalisation ceases when the mine is capable of commercial production, 
with the exception of development costs which give rise to a future benefit. 
Interest on borrowings related to construction or development of projects  
is capitalised, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their 
intended use or sale which, in the case of mining properties, is when they  
are capable of commercial production. 
L) DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT  
AND EQUIPMENT AND AMORTISATION OF 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over  
the remaining life of the operation if shorter, to residual value. The major 
categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated as follows: 
(i) Land – freehold land is not depreciated unless the value of the land is 
considered to relate directly to a particular mining operation, in which 
case the land is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected 
mine life. 
(ii) Mining properties – mining properties, including capitalised financing 
costs, are depreciated on a unit of production basis, in proportion to the 
volume of ore extracted in the year compared with total proven and 
probable reserves at the beginning of the year. 
(iii) Buildings and infrastructure – straight-line basis over 10 to 25 years. 
(iv) Railway track (including trackside equipment) – straight-line basis over 
20 to 25 years. 
(v) Wagons and rolling stock – straight-line basis over 10 to 20 years. 
(vi) Machinery, equipment and other assets – are depreciated on a unit of 
production basis, in proportion to the volume of ore / material processed 
or on a straight-line basis over 5 to 20 years. 
(vii) Assets under construction – no depreciation until asset is available  
for use. 
(viii) Assets held under finance lease – are depreciated over the shorter of 
the lease term and their useful life. 
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at 
least annually, and changes to residual values and useful lives are accounted 
for prospectively. 
The concession right is amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the 
concession, or the useful life of any component part if less. 
M) IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT  
AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
(EXCLUDING GOODWILL) 
Property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed  
for impairment if there is any indication that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment (if any). Where 
the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. Any intangible asset with an indefinite useful 
life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that 
the asset may be impaired.  
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value 
in use. Fair value less costs of disposal reflects the net amount the Group 
would receive from the sale of the asset in an orderly transaction between 
market participants. For mining assets this would generally be determined 
based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows arising from  
the continued use, further development or eventual disposal of the asset.  
The estimates used in determining the present value of those cash flows are 
those that an independent market participant would consider appropriate. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated  
to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the 
recoverable amount. An impairment charge is recognised in the income 
statement immediately. Where an impairment subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount is increased to the revised estimate of recoverable amount, 
but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying value 
that would have been determined if no impairment had previously been 
recognised. A reversal is recognised in the income statement immediately. 
  
134 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016  
N) INVENTORY 
Inventory consists of raw materials and consumables, work-in-progress and 
finished goods. Work-in-progress represents material that is in the process  
of being converted into finished goods. The conversion process for mining 
operations depends on the nature of the copper ore. For sulphide ores, 
processing includes milling and concentrating and results in the production  
of copper concentrate. For oxide ores, processing includes leaching of 
stockpiles, solvent extraction and electrowinning and results in the production 
of copper cathodes. Finished goods consist of copper concentrate containing 
gold and silver at Los Pelambres and Centinela and copper cathodes at 
Centinela, Antucoya and Michilla. Los Pelambres also produces molybdenum 
as a by-product. 
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost, on a weighted average basis, and net 
realisable value. Net realisable value represents estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling 
and distribution. Cost of finished goods and work-in-progress is production 
cost and for raw materials and consumables it is purchase price. Production 
cost includes: 
– labour costs, raw material costs and other costs directly attributable to the 
extraction and processing of ore; 
– depreciation of plant, equipment and mining properties directly involved in 
the production process; and 
– an appropriate portion of production overheads. 
Stockpiles represent ore that is extracted and is available for further 
processing. Costs directly attributable to the extraction of ore are generally 
allocated as part of production cost in proportion to the tonnes of material 
extracted. Operating stripping costs are generally absorbed into inventory,  
and therefore expensed as that inventory is processed and sold. If ore is not 
processed within 12 months of the statement of financial position date it is 
included within non-current assets. If there is significant uncertainty as to 
when any stockpiled ore will be processed it is expensed as incurred. 
O) TAXATION 
Tax expense comprises the charges or credits for the year relating to both 
current and deferred tax. 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit may differ 
from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items 
of income or expense that are taxable and deductible in different years and 
also excludes items that are not taxable or deductible. The liability for current 
tax is calculated using tax rates for each entity in the consolidated financial 
statements which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary 
differences (i.e. differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used  
in the computation of taxable profit). Deferred tax is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method and is provided on all temporary differences 
with certain limited exceptions as follows: 
(i)  tax payable on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, associates and 
joint ventures is provided except where the Group is able to control the 
remittance of profits and it is probable that there will be no remittance  
of past profits earned in the foreseeable future; 
(ii) deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that does not affect accounting profit or taxable 
profit and is not a business combination; nor is deferred tax provided on 
subsequent changes in the carrying value of such assets and liabilities, 
for example where they are depreciated; and 
(iii) the initial recognition of any goodwill. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that 
they will be recovered through sufficient future taxable profit. The carrying 
amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also 
taken directly to equity. 
P) PROVISIONS 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the 
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the 
reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding 
the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated 
to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of 
those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material). 
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are 
expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an 
asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the 
amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. 
Q) PROVISIONS FOR DECOMMISSIONING AND 
RESTORATION COSTS 
An obligation to incur decommissioning and restoration costs occurs  
when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing 
production of a mining property. Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal 
closure plan and are subject to regular formal review. 
Such costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation 
work, discounted to their net present value, are provided and capitalised at  
the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. 
These decommissioning costs are charged against profits over the life of the 
mine, through depreciation of the asset and unwinding or amortisation of the 
discount on the provision. Depreciation is included in operating costs while  
the unwinding of the discount is included as financing costs. Changes in the 
measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other 
site preparation work are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related 
asset in the current year. 
The costs for restoration of site damage, which is created on an ongoing  
basis during production, are provided for at their net present values and 
charged against operating profits as extraction progresses. Changes in the 
measurement of a liability relating to site damage created during production  
is charged against operating profit. 
R) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods 
or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At the 
end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of 
settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair 
value recognised in profit or loss for the year. The Group currently does not 
have any equity settled share-based payments to employees or third parties. 
S) POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
The Group operates defined contribution schemes for a limited number of 
employees. For such schemes, the amount charged to the income statement 
is the contributions paid or payable in the year. 
Employment terms may also provide for payment of a severance indemnity 
when an employment contract comes to an end. This is typically at the rate  
of one month for each year of service (subject in most cases to a cap as to 
the number of qualifying years of service) and based on final salary level. The 
severance indemnity obligation is treated as an unfunded defined benefit plan, 
and the calculation is based on valuations performed by an independent 
actuary using the projected unit credit method, which are regularly updated. 
The obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of 
the severance indemnity obligation. Actuarial gains and losses are immediately 
recognised in other comprehensive income.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
2 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CONTINUED 
T) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held on call  
with banks, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known 
amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in 
value, net of bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand. Cash and  
cash equivalents normally have a maturity period of 90 days or less. 
U) LIQUID INVESTMENTS 
Liquid investments represent highly liquid current asset investments such  
as term deposits and managed funds invested in high quality fixed income 
instruments. They do not meet the IAS 7 definition of cash and cash 
equivalents, normally because even if readily accessible, the underlying 
investments have an average maturity profile greater than 90 days from  
the date first entered into. These assets are designated as fair value through 
profit or loss.  
V) LEASES 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement 
account in equal annual amounts over the term of the lease. 
Assets under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at 
inception of the lease at the lower of fair value or the present value of the 
minimum lease payments derived by discounting at the interest rate implicit  
in the lease. The interest element is charged within financing costs so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of  
the liability. 
W) OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance 
sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  
the instrument 
(i) Investments – Investments which are not subsidiaries, associates or 
joint ventures are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs. 
Investments are classified as either held for trading or available-for-sale, 
and are normally measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. 
Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 26(b). 
Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market 
price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably 
measured are measured at cost. Securities are classified as “held-for-
trading” when they are acquired principally for the purpose of sale in the 
short term, and gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are 
included in profit or loss for the period. Other investments are classified 
as “available-for-sale”, and gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value are recognised directly in equity, within the “Fair value reserve”, 
until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which 
time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is 
included in profit or loss for the period. Dividends on available-for-sale 
and held-for-trading equity investments are recognised in the income 
statement when the right to receive payment is established. 
(ii) Trade and other receivables – Trade and other receivables do not 
generally carry any interest and are normally stated at their nominal 
value less any impairment. Impairment losses on trade receivables are 
recognised within an allowance account unless the Group considers that 
no recovery of the amount is possible, in which case the carrying value 
of the asset is reduced directly. 
(iii) Trade and other payables – Trade and other payables are generally  
not interest-bearing and are normally stated at their nominal value.
(iv) Borrowings (loans and preference shares) – Interest-bearing loans 
and bank overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net 
of direct issue costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised  
on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method  
of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through 
the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter 
period. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals 
basis using the effective interest rate method. Amounts are either 
recorded as financing costs in profit or loss or capitalised in accordance 
with the accounting policy set out in Note 2(k). Finance charges are 
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise.  
The Sterling-denominated preference shares issued by the Company 
carry a fixed rate of return without the right to participate in any surplus. 
They are accordingly classified within borrowings and translated into US 
dollars at period-end rates of exchange. Preference share dividends are 
included within finance costs. 
(v) Equity instruments – Equity instruments issued are recorded at  
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Equity instruments  
of the Company comprise its Sterling-denominated issued ordinary 
share capital and related share premium. As explained in Note 2(e), the 
presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the 
Company is US dollars, and ordinary share capital and share premium 
are translated into US dollars at historical rates of exchange based on 
dates of issue. 
(vi) Derivative financial instruments – As explained in Note 25(d), the 
Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to 
foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price movements. The 
Group does not use such derivative instruments for trading purposes. 
The Group has applied the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 
“Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. The effective 
portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
that are designated and qualify as hedges of future cash flows have 
been recognised directly in equity, with such amounts subsequently 
recognised in profit or loss in the period when the hedged item affects 
profit or loss. Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit 
or loss. Realised gains and losses on commodity derivatives recognised 
in profit or loss are recorded within revenue. The time value element of 
changes in the fair value of derivative options is excluded from the 
designated hedging relationship, and is therefore recognised directly in 
profit or loss within other finance items. Derivatives embedded in other 
financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate 
derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related  
to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair 
value. Changes in fair value are reported in profit or loss for the year. 
The treatment of embedded derivatives arising from provisionally-priced 
commodity sales contracts is set out in further detail in Note 2(f) relating 
to revenue. 
(vii) Impairment of financial assets – Financial assets, other than those  
at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of 
impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired 
where there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events 
that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset the 
estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted. For 
loans and receivables the amount of the impairment is the difference 
between the asset’s carrying value and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.  
Any impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately. 
  
136 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016  
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the  
impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception  
of trade receivables. 
With the exception of available-for-sale equity instruments, if, in a 
subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases  
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after 
the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment 
loss is reversed through profit or loss immediately to the extent that  
the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is 
reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been  
had the impairment not been recognised. In respect of available-for-sale 
equity instruments, any increase in fair value subsequent to an 
impairment loss is recognised directly in equity. 
X) EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 
Exceptional items are material items of income and expense which are  
non-regular or non-operating and typically non-cash movements.  
Y) ROUNDING 
All amounts disclosed in the Financial Statements and notes have been 
rounded off to the nearest million dollars unless otherwise stated. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.  
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS 
AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION 
UNCERTAINTY 
Determining many of the amounts included in the Financial Statements 
involves the use of judgement and/or estimation. These judgements and 
estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts 
and circumstances having regard to prior experience, but actual results may 
differ from the amounts included in the Financial Statements. Information 
about such judgements and estimates is included in the principal accounting 
policies in Note 2 or the other notes to the Financial Statements, and the key 
areas are set out below. 
A) CAPITALISATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND 
EQUIPMENT AND OF PROJECT COSTS 
As explained in Note 2(k) the costs of developing mining properties are 
capitalised as property, plant and equipment in the year in which they are 
incurred, when the mining project is considered to be commercially viable. 
Management reviews amounts capitalised to ensure that the treatment of  
that expenditure as capital rather than operating expenditure is reasonable,  
in particular in respect of the commercial viability of the project. Commercial 
viability is normally considered to be demonstrable when the project has 
completed a pre-feasibility study, and the start of a feasibility study has  
been approved. 
B) USEFUL ECONOMIC LIVES OF PROPERTY, PLANT 
AND EQUIPMENT AND ORE RESERVES ESTIMATES 
As explained in Note 2(l), mining properties, including capitalised financing 
costs, are depreciated in proportion to the volume of ore extracted in the  
year compared with total proven and probable reserves at the beginning  
of the year. 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, and 
assumptions that were valid at the time of estimation may change when new 
information becomes available. These include assumptions as to grade 
estimates and cut-off grades, recovery rates, commodity prices, exchange 
rates, production costs, capital costs, processing and reclamation costs and 
discount rates. The actual volume of ore extracted and any changes in these 
assumptions could affect prospective depreciation rates and carrying values. 
The majority of other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives. Management reviews 
the appropriateness of useful economic lives at least annually and, again, any 
changes could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values. 
C) IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS 
As explained in Note 2(m), the Group reviews the carrying value of its 
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets are impaired. In making assessments 
for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash flows are 
allocated to an appropriate cash-generating unit (“CGU”). The recoverable 
amount of those assets, or CGU, is measured at the higher of their fair  
value less costs to sell and value in use. Details of the impairment reviews 
undertaken as at 31 December 2016 are set out in Note 4. 
Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets to CGUs,  
in estimating the probability, timing and value of underlying cash flows and  
in selecting appropriate discount rates to be applied within the fair value less 
cost to dispose calculation. The key assumptions are set out in Note 2(m) and 
Note 4. Subsequent changes to CGU allocation, licencing status, reserves and 
resources, price assumptions or other estimates and assumptions in the fair 
value less cost to dispose calculation could impact the carrying value of the 
respective assets. 
D) PROVISIONS FOR DECOMMISSIONING AND SITE 
RESTORATION COSTS 
As explained in Note 2(q), provision is made, based on net present values,  
for decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs as soon as the obligation 
arises following the development or ongoing production of a mining property. 
The provision is based on a closure plan prepared with the assistance of 
external consultants. 
Management uses its judgement and experience to provide for and (in the 
case of capitalised decommissioning costs) amortise these estimated costs 
over the life of the mine. The ultimate cost of decommissioning and site 
rehabilitation is uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response to many 
factors including changes to relevant legal requirements, the emergence  
of new restoration techniques or experience at other mine sites. 
The expected timing and extent of expenditure can also change, for example 
in response to changes in ore reserves or processing levels. As a result, there 
could be significant adjustments to the provisions established which would 
affect future financial results. 
E) DEFERRED TAXATION 
As explained in Note 2(o), deferred tax is not provided for future tax payable 
on undistributed earnings where the Group is able to control the remittance of 
profits and it is probable that there will be no remittance of past profits earned 
in the foreseeable future. 
Management uses its judgement in estimating the probability of such 
remittances. These are based on Group forecasts and include assumptions  
as to future profits and cash flows (which depend on several factors including 
commodity prices, operating costs, production levels, capital expenditures, 
interest costs, debt repayment and tax rates) and cash requirements (which 
may also depend on several factors including future dividend levels). A change 
in the assumptions used or in the estimate as to the probability that past 
profits will be remitted would impact the deferred tax charge and balance 
sheet provision.

(i) Alto Maipo 
The Group has a 40% interest in Alto Maipo SpA (“Alto Maipo”), which  
is developing two run-of-river hydroelectric power stations located in the 
upper section of the Maipo River, approximately 50 km to the southeast of 
Santiago. The remaining 60% interest is held by AES Gener (“Gener”). The 
Group has been reviewing its options with respect to its investment in Alto 
Maipo following the announcement of a significant forecast cost overrun for 
the project. In January 2017 the Group entered into an agreement with Gener 
to dispose of its stake in Alto Maipo to Gener for a nominal consideration. 
Accordingly, an impairment provision of $367.6 million has been recognised  
in respect of the total carrying value relating to the project, comprising the 
$74.0 million investment in associate balance and $52.6 million of mark-to-
market losses in respect of derivative financial instruments held by Alto Maipo 
previously deferred in reserves, resulting in a $126.6 million loss reflected  
on the profit from associates and joint ventures line and $241.0 million of  
loan financing (including accrued interest) reflected in operating cost. This 
impairment provision resulted in a deferred tax credit of $95.0 million and  
so the post-tax impact is $272.6 million. 
(ii) Antucoya 
An impairment review has been conducted for the Antucoya operation. 
Following the completion of construction, Antucoya achieved commercial 
production in April 2016 and then reached full production capacity in August 
2016. This process was slower than originally forecast, meaning that the 
costs capitalised during the ramp-up period were greater than originally 
forecast and net depreciation of the assets commenced later than originally 
anticipated. The achievement of commercial production and full capacity 
during the year has allowed a final determination of the total capital cost  
of the project, including costs capitalised during the ramp-up to commercial 
production, along with an understanding of the actual operating performance 
of the mine.  
The impairment review determined that the recoverable amount (fair value 
less costs of disposal) of Antucoya’s assets was $1,502.3 million, compared 
with the carrying value of $1,717.9 million, and accordingly an impairment 
provision of $215.6 million (on a pre-tax basis) has been reflected in respect 
of Antucoya. This impairment provision resulted in a deferred tax credit of 
$99.4 million and so the post-tax impact is $116.2 million. All of the provision 
has been allocated against Antucoya’s property, plant and equipment. 
The key assumptions to which the value of the assets are most sensitive  
are future commodity prices, the discount rate used to determine the  
present value of the future cash flows, future operating costs, sustaining and 
development capital expenditure and ore reserve estimates. The commodity 
price forecasts (representing the Group’s estimates of the assumptions that 
would be used by independent market participants in valuing the assets)  
are based on the forward curve for the short term and consensus analyst 
forecasts including both investment banks and commodity consultants for  
the longer term. A long term copper price of 300 c/lb has been used in the 
calculations. A real post-tax discount rate of 8% has been used in determining 
the present value of the forecast future cash flow from the assets. 
To illustrate the sensitivity of the valuation of Antucoya to negative  
movements in these parameters, a 5% decrease in the forecast long-term 
copper price would result in an increase in the impairment of $121 million, and 
an increase in the discount rate from 8% to 9% would result in an increase  
in the impairment of $89 million. These are simple sensitivities, looking at 
illustrative movements in the long-term copper price and discount rate in 
isolation. In reality, a deterioration in the long-term copper price environment 
is likely to result in corresponding improvements in a range of input cost 
factors, as well as potential operating changes, which could partly mitigate 
these estimated potential sensitivities. 
(iii) Energia Andina 
The Group’s Energia Andina joint venture holds an investment in the Javiera 
solar plant in Chile. In February 2017 the disposal of the interest in Javiera 
was agreed. The terms of the sale agreement indicate a recoverable value  
for the interest in Javiera which is $8.1 million below the carrying value, and 
accordingly an impairment provision for this amount has been recognised. 
The terms of the sale agreement is subject to certain closing conditions,  
and the transaction is expected to complete during the first half of 2017. 
(iv) Other asset sensitivities 
There were no indicators of impairment for the Group’s other mining 
operations, and accordingly no detailed impairment reviews have been 
performed for those operations. However, in order to provide an indication  
of the sensitivities of the valuations of these assets, a sensitivity analysis has 
been performed. For all of the other mining operations a valuation exercise 
using assumptions consistent with those used in the Antucoya impairment 
review confirmed that the recoverable amount of the assets was in excess  
of their carrying value. The recoverable amount of the assets still remained in 
excess of their carrying value for all of the other mining operations with either 
a 5% decrease in the forecast long-term copper price or an increase in the 
discount rate from 8% to 9%.  
  
138 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016  
5 SEGMENT INFORMATION 
The Group’s reportable segments are as follows: 
– Los Pelambres 
– Centinela 
– Michilla (sold in 2016) 
– Antucoya 
– Zaldívar 
– Exploration and evaluation 
– Railway and other transport services 
– Water concession (sold in 2015) 
– Corporate and other items 
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two business 
divisions based on their products – Mining and Railway and other transport 
services. The Group disposed of its Water division in 2015. The mining division 
is split further for management reporting purposes to show results by mine 
and exploration activity. Los Pelambres, Centinela and Antucoya (since April 
2016) are operating mines, Michilla was sold at the end of 2016 and Zaldívar, 
in which the Group has acquired a 50% stake, was acquired in December 
2015. The Michilla mine was placed on care and maintenance at the end  
of 2015, and was disposed of in December 2016. Los Pelambres produces 
primarily copper concentrate and molybdenum as a by-product. Centinela 
produces primarily copper concentrate containing gold as a by-product  
and copper cathodes. Antucoya and Zaldívar produce copper cathodes,  
as did Michilla. The transport division provides rail cargo (based in Chile and 
formerly Bolivia) and road cargo (based in Chile) together with a number of 
ancillary services (based in Chile). The water division, which produced and 
distributed potable water to domestic customers and untreated water to 
industrial customers in Chile’s Antofagasta Region, was sold during 2015.  
The Exploration and evaluation segment incurs exploration and evaluation 
expenses. “Corporate and other items” comprises costs incurred by the 
Company, Antofagasta Minerals SA, the Group’s mining corporate centre  
and other entities, that are not allocated to any individual business segment. 
Consistent with its internal management reporting, the Group’s corporate  
and other items are included within the mining division.  
The Chief Operating decision maker monitors the operating results of 
business segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about 
resources to be allocated and of assessing performance. Segment 
performance is evaluated based on the operating profit of each of  
the segments.

An analysis of the Group’s total revenue is as follows:

2015 
(RESTATED) 
$M 
Sales of goods 3,486.8 3,097.0

Investment income 26.9 17.5 
Total income 3,668.8 3,277.1 
Copper and molybdenum concentrate sale agreements and copper cathode sale agreements generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time  
of shipment, with final pricing being based on the monthly average London Metal Exchange copper price or monthly average molybdenum price for specified 
future periods. This normally ranges from one to five months after shipment to the customer. The provisional pricing mechanism within the sale agreements  
is an embedded derivative under IFRS. Gains and losses from the marking-to-market of open sales are recognised through adjustments to revenue in the 
income statement and to trade debtors in the balance sheet. The Group determines mark-to-market prices using forward prices at each period end for copper 
concentrate and cathode sales, and period-end month average prices for molybdenum concentrate sales due to the absence of a futures market in the market 
price references for that commodity in the majority of the Group’s contracts. 
In addition to mark-to-market and final pricing adjustments, revenue also includes realised gains and losses relating to derivative commodity instruments.  
Details of these realised gains or losses are shown in the tables below. Further details of derivative commodity instruments in place at the period end are given 
in Note 25. 
Copper and molybdenum concentrate sales are stated net of deductions for tolling charges, as shown in the tables below.

Current tax charge   
– Corporate tax (principally first category tax in Chile) (222.1) (54.8)
– Mining tax (royalty) (35.3) (20.4)
– Withholding tax (3.8) (12.9)
– Exchange losses on corporate tax balances – (1.0)

– Withholding tax provision – (1.9)
 152.6 (65.3)
Total tax charge (108.6) (154.4)
The rate of first category (i.e. corporate) tax in Chile is currently 24% (2015 – 22.5%). The rate will increase to 25.5% in 2017 and then 27% from 2018 onwards. 
In addition to first category tax, the Group incurs withholding taxes on remittance of profits from Chile and deferred tax is provided on undistributed earnings  
to the extent that remittance is probable in the foreseeable future. Withholding tax is levied on remittances of profits from Chile at 35% less first category  
(i.e. corporate) tax already paid in respect of the profits to which the remittances relate.

Tax expense and effective tax rate for the year (313.5) 35.8 (108.6) 38.2  (154.4) 63.6 
The tax charge for 2016 was $108.6 million and the effective tax rate was 38.2%.The exceptional impairment provisions had an impact on the overall tax  
charge and the reconciliation of the effective tax rate, and accordingly we have presented the tax reconciliation above both including and excluding the impact  
of the exceptional items. Excluding these exceptional impairment provisions, the 2016 tax charge was $313.5 million and the effective tax rate was 35.8%. This 
effective tax rate varied from the statutory rate principally due to the effect of increase in future first category tax rates on deferred tax balances (impact of 
$24.6 million / 2.8%), the effect of expenses not deductible for Chilean corporate tax purposes (principally the funding of expenses outside of Chile) and items 
not subject to first category tax (impact of $15.2 million / 1.7%) and the mining tax (impact of $60.1 million / 6.9%). 
The current and deferred tax relating to items that are charged directly to equity was $2.1 million (2015 – $1.4 million). 
The main factors which are expected to impact the sustainability of the Group’s existing effective tax rate (excluding exceptional items) is the increase in the rate 
of first category (i.e. corporate) tax in Chile from the 2016 rate of 24% to 25.5% in 2017 and then 27% from 2018 onwards. 
There are no significant tax uncertainties which would require critical judgements, estimates or potential provisions.

158 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016  
INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATES 
(i) The Group’s 40% interest in Inversiones Hornitos SA, which owns the 165MW Hornitos thermoelectric power plant operating in Mejillones, in Chile’s 
Antofagasta Region. The Group has a 16-year power purchase agreement with Inversiones Hornitos SA for the provision of up to 40MW of electricity  
for Centinela. 
(ii) The Group’s 30% interest in ATI, which operates a concession to manage installations in the port of Antofagasta. 
(iii) The Group´s 30% interest in El Arrayan, which operates a 115MW wind-farm project, The Group has a 20-year power purchase agreement with  
El Arrayan for the provision of up to 40MW of electricity for Los Pelambres. 
(iv) The Group has a 40% interest in Alto Maipo SpA (“Alto Maipo”), which is developing two run-of-river hydroelectric power stations located in the upper  
section of the Maipo River, approximately 50 kilometres to the southeast of Santiago. The remaining 60% interest is held by AES Gener SA (“Gener”).  
As explained in Note 3, the Group has been reviewing its options with respect to its investment in Alto Maipo following the announcement of a significant 
forecast cost overrun for the project. In January 2017 the Group entered into an agreement with Gener to dispose of its stake in Alto Maipo to Gener for  
a nominal consideration. Accordingly, an impairment provision of $367.6 million has been recognised in respect of the total carrying value relating to  
the project, comprising the $74.0 million investment in associate balance as shown above, $241.0 million of loan financing (including accrued interest)  
and $52.6 million of mark-to-market losses in respect of derivative financial instruments held by Alto Maipo previously deferred in reserves. 
During 2016 the Group made provision for capital contributions of $36.0 million (2015 – $42.8 million). During the year the Group provided nil  
loan financing (2015 – $63.9 million) to Alto Maipo. The balance due from Alto Maipo to the Group at 31 December 2016 was nil after provision  
(2015 – $229.7 million) representing loan financing with an interest rate of LIBOR six-month rate plus 4.25%. During 2016 a fair value loss of  
$4.1 million (2015 – $14.4 million loss) was recognised in relation to the mark-to-market of the derivative financial instruments with this amount  
deferred in reserves as it formed part of a designated cash flow hedging relationship. 
The Group has a 20-year power purchase agreement with Alto Maipo for the provision of up to 110 MW of electricity for Los Pelambres from the 
completion date of the project. 
INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES 
(v) The Group’s 50% interest in Minera Zaldívar SpA (“Zaldívar”), was acquired on 1 December 2015 (see Note 19). Zaldívar is an open-pit, heap-leach copper 
mine located in Northern Chile, which produces approximately 100,000 tonnes of copper cathodes annually. 
Total preliminary consideration for the transaction was $1,005.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments based on the net debt and working capital levels of 
Zaldívar at the completion date. The net debt and working capital adjustments were finalised in August 2016 and resulted in a final adjusted consideration 
of $949.7 million. Including capitalised acquisition costs of $7.0 million the initial investment in joint venture balance is therefore $956.7 million. The 
allocation of the fair values of the individual assets and liabilities effectively contained within the overall investment in joint venture balance was also 
completed during 2016. 
(vi) The Group’s 50.1% (2014 – 50.1%) interest in Energia Andina, which is a joint venture with Origin Geothermal Chile Limitada for the evaluation and 
development of potential sources of geothermal and solar energy.  
In February 2017 the disposal of the interest in Javiera was agreed. The terms of the sale agreement indicate a recoverable value for the interest in 
Javiera which is $8.1 million below the carrying value, and accordingly an impairment provision for this amount has been recognised. The terms of the sale 
agreement is subject to certain closing conditions, and the transaction is expected to complete during the first half of 2017. 
(vii) The Group’s 50% interest in Tethyan Copper Company Limited (“Tethyan”), which is a joint venture with Barrick Gold Corporation over Tethyan’s mineral 
interest in Pakistan, which is now subject to international arbitration. As the net carrying value of the interest in Tethyan is negative it is included within 
non-current liabilities, as the Group is liable for its share of the joint venture’s obligations.

19 COMPAÑIA MINERA ZALDÍVAR SPA TRANSACTION 
On 1 December 2015 Antofagasta completed its acquisition of a 50% stake in Compañia Minera Zaldívar SpA (“Zaldívar”) from Barrick Gold Corporation 
(“Barrick”), pursuant to an agreement entered into on 30 July 2015. As a result, Antofagasta has become operator of the Zaldívar mine. Zaldívar is an open-pit, 
heap-leach copper mine located in Northern Chile, which produces approximately 100,000 tonnes of copper cathodes annually.  
Given that Antofagasta and Barrick have joint control over Zaldívar, Antofagasta is accounting for its 50% stake in Zaldívar as a joint venture.  
Total preliminary consideration for the transaction was $1,005.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments based on the net debt and working capital levels of 
Zaldívar at the completion date. The net debt and working capital adjustments were finalised in August 2016 and resulted in a final adjusted consideration of 
$949.7 million. Including capitalised acquisition costs of $7.0 million the initial investment in joint venture balance is therefore $956.7 million. The allocation of  
the fair values of the individual assets and liabilities effectively contained within the overall investment in joint venture balance was also completed during 2016.

The largest balances of trade receivables are held with equity participants in the key mining projects. Many other significant trade receivables are secured  
by letters of credit or other forms of security. The average credit period given on sale of goods and rendering of service is 60 days (2015 – 41 days). There  
is no material element which is interest-bearing. Trade debtors include mark-to-market adjustments in respect of provisionally priced sales of copper and 
molybdenum concentrates which remain open as to final pricing. Where these have resulted in credit balances, they have been reclassified to trade creditors. 
Other debtors are mainly related to interest receivables, VAT receivable and prepayment to suppliers.

25 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
A) CATEGORIES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

2016 
$M 
2015 
$M 
Financial assets   
Derivatives in designated hedge accounting relationships 2.4 0.2 
Available-for-sale investments 4.6 2.7 
Loans and receivables at amortised cost (including cash and cash equivalents) 1,519.1 1,703.9 
Fair value through profit and loss (liquid investments and mark-to-market debtors) 1,375.5 925.4 
Financial liabilities   
Derivatives in designated hedge accounting relationships (2.5) (3.5)
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost (3,725.5) (3,235.5)
Fair value through profit and loss (mark-to-market creditors) (3.0) (22.9)
 (829.4) (629.7)
B) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: 
– the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference 
to quoted market prices; 
– the fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing 
models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions; and 
– the fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted cash flow analysis 
based on the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives. 
The fair value of each category of financial asset and liability is not materially different from the carrying values presented for either 2016 or 2015. 
Financial assets and liabilities measurement as fair value through profit and loss are designated as such upon initial recognition. 
The following table provides an analysis of the financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 
based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: 
– level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
– level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
– level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable 
market data (unobservable inputs).

C) FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including commodity price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), 
credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in general to reduce exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest 
rate movements. The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Group’s risk management framework. The Audit and Risk Committee assists the Board with its review 
of the effectiveness of the risk management process, and monitoring of key risks and mitigations. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of 
risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee. 
(I) COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
The Group generally sells its copper and molybdenum concentrate and copper cathode output at prevailing market prices, subject to final pricing adjustments 
which may range from one to five months after delivery to the customer, and it is therefore exposed to changes in market prices for copper and molybdenum 
both in respect of future sales and previous sales which remain open as to final pricing. In 2016, sales of copper and molybdenum concentrate and copper 
cathodes represented 84.4% of Group revenue and therefore revenues and earnings depend significantly on LME and realised copper prices. 
The Group uses futures, min-max instruments and options to manage its exposure to copper prices. These instruments may give rise to accounting volatility  
due to fluctuations in their fair value prior to the maturity of the instruments. Details of those copper and molybdenum concentrate sales and copper cathode 
sales which remain open as to final pricing are given in Note 6. Details of commodity rate derivatives entered into by the Group are given in Note 25(d). 
Commodity price sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the copper price on the financial instruments held as at the reporting date. A movement in  
the copper forward price as at the reporting date will affect the final pricing adjustment to sales which remain open at that date, impacting the trade receivables 
balance and consequently the income statement. A movement in the copper forward price will also affect the valuation of commodity derivatives, impacting  
the hedging reserve in equity if the fair value movement relates to an effective designated cash flow hedge, and impacting the income statement if it does not. 
The calculation assumes that all other variables, such as currency rates, remain constant. 
– If the copper forward price as at the reporting date had increased by 10 cents, profit attributable to the owners of the parent would have increased by  
$21.0 million (2015 – increase by $18.5 million) and hedging reserves in equity would have increased by $0.1 million (2015 – decrease less than $0.4 million). 
– If the copper forward price as at the reporting date had decreased by 10 cents, profit attributable to the owners of the parent would have decreased by  
$20.5 million (2015 – decrease by $17.2 million) and hedging reserves in equity would have increased by $0.4 million (2015 – increase less than $0.4 million). 
In addition, a movement in the average copper price during the year would impact revenue and earnings. A 10 cents change in the average copper price  
during the year would have affected profit attributable to the owners of the parent by $69.4 million (2015 – $62.5 million) and earnings per share by 7.0 cents  
(2015 – 6.3 cents), based on production volumes in 2016, without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing and hedging activity. A $1 change in the 
average molybdenum price for the year would have affected profit attributable to the owners of the parent by $6.7 million (2015 – $9.4 million), and earnings 
per share by 0.7 cents (2015 – 1.0 cents), based on production volumes in 2016, and without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing. A $100 
change in the average gold price for the year would have affected profit attributable to the owners of the parent by $12.2 million (2015 – $10.4 million), and 
earnings per share by 1.2 cents (2015 – 1.1 cents), based on production volumes in 2016, and without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing. 
(II) CURRENCY RISK 
The Group is exposed to a variety of currencies. The US dollar, however, is the currency in which the majority of the Group’s sales are denominated. Operating 
costs are influenced by the countries in which the Group’s operations are based (principally in Chile) as well as those currencies in which the costs of imported 
equipment and services are determined. After the US dollar, the Chilean peso is the most important currency influencing costs and to a lesser extent sales. 
Given the significance of the US dollar to the Group’s operations, this is the presentational currency of the Group for internal and external reporting. The US 
dollar is also the currency for borrowing and holding surplus cash, although a portion of this may be held in other currencies, notably Chilean pesos and sterling, 
to meet short-term operating and capital commitments and dividend payments. 
  
STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
25 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
When considered appropriate, the Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency swaps to limit the effects of movements in exchange rates in foreign 
currency denominated assets and liabilities. The Group may also use these instruments to reduce currency exposure on future transactions and cash flows. 
Details of any exchange rate derivatives entered by the Group in the year are given in Note 25.d. 
The currency exposure of the Group’s cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments is given in Note 22, and the currency exposure of the Group’s borrowings 
is given in Note 23.b. The effects of exchange gains and losses included in the income statement are given in Note 9. Exchange differences on translation of  
the net assets of entities with a functional currency other than the US dollar are taken to the currency translation reserve and are disclosed in the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity on page 128. 
Currency sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the US dollar/Chilean peso exchange rate on the financial instruments held as at the  
reporting date. 
The impact on profit or loss is as a result of the retranslation of monetary financial instruments (including cash, cash equivalents, liquid investments, trade 
receivables, trade payables and borrowings). The impact on equity is as a result of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are effective 
designated cash flow hedges, and changes in the fair value of available-for-sale equity investments. The calculation assumes that all other variables, such  
as interest rates, remain constant. 
If the US dollar had strengthened by 10% against the Chilean peso as at the reporting date, profit attributable to the owners of the parent would have decreased 
by $1.3 million (2015 – decrease of $2.9 million); and hedging reserves in equity would have decreased by nil (2015 – nil). If the US dollar had weakened by  
10 % against the Chilean peso as at the reporting date, profit attributable to the owners of the parent would have increased by $3.2 million (2015 – increase  
of $1.7 million); and hedging reserves in equity would have increased by nil (2015 – nil). 
(III) INTEREST RATE RISK 
The Group’s policy is generally to borrow and invest cash at floating rates. Fluctuations in interest rates may impact the Group’s net finance income or cost, and 
to a lesser extent the value of financial assets and liabilities. The Group occasionally uses interest rate swaps and collars to manage interest rate exposures on a 
portion of its existing borrowings. Details of any interest rate derivatives entered into by the Group are given in Note 25.d.(i) 
Interest rate exposure of the Group’s borrowings is given in Note 23. 
Interest rate sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in interest rates in relation to the financial instruments held as at the reporting date. The impact 
on profit or loss reflects the impact on annual interest expense in respect of the floating rate borrowings held as at the reporting date, and the impact on annual 
interest income in respect of cash and cash equivalents held as at the reporting date. The impact on equity is as a result of changes in the fair value of derivative 
instruments which are effective designated cash flow hedges. The calculation assumes that all other variables, such as currency rates, remain constant. 
If the interest rate increased by 1%, based on the financial instruments held as at the reporting date, profit attributable to the owners of the parent would  
have decreased by $3.8 million (2015 – increase of $4.4 million) and hedging reserves in equity would have increased by $0.3 million (2015 – increase of  
$0.7 million). This does not include the effect on the income statement of changes in the fair value of the Group’s liquid investments relating to the underlying 
investments in fixed income instruments. 
(IV) OTHER PRICE RISK 
The Group is exposed to equity price risk on its available-for-sale equity investments. 
Equity price sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a movement in the equity values of the available-for-sale financial assets held as at the reporting date. 
If the value of the available-for-sale investments had increased by 10% as at the reporting date, equity would have increased by $0.5 million (2015 – increase  
of $0.3 million). There would have been no impact on the income statement. 
(V) CASH FLOW RISK 
The Group’s future cash flows depend on a number of factors, including commodity prices, production and sales levels, operating costs, capital expenditure 
levels and financial income and costs. Its cash flows are therefore subject to the exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks described above as well as 
operating factors and input costs. To reduce the risk of potential short-term disruptions to the supply of key inputs such as electricity and sulphuric acid, the 
Group enters into medium– and long-term supply contracts to help ensure continuity of supply. Long-term electricity supply contracts are in place at each of  
the Group’s mines, in most cases linking the cost of electricity under the contract to the current cost of electricity on the Chilean grids. The Group seeks to lock 
in supply of sulphuric acid for future periods of a year or longer, with contract prices agreed in the latter part of the year, to be applied to purchases of acid in  
the following year. Further information on production and sales levels and operating costs are given in the Operating review on pages 32 to 51. 
(VI) CREDIT RISK 
Credit risk arises from trade and other receivables, cash, cash equivalents, liquid investments and derivative financial instruments. The Group’s credit risk is 
primarily to trade receivables. The credit risk on cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments and on derivative financial instruments is limited as the 
counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit agencies. 
All customers are subject to credit review procedures, including the use of external credit ratings where available. Credit is provided only within set limits, which 
are regularly reviewed. The main customers are recurrent with a good credit history during the years while they have been customers. 
Outstanding receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. 
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The amounts presented in the 
balance sheet are net of allowances for any doubtful receivables. 
168 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016  
As detailed in Note 4 the Group provided a total of $241.0 million of loan financing to its associated company Alto Maipo SpA (“Alto Maipo”). This loan financing 
formed part of the Group’s total funding of the Alto Maipo project, along with the capital contributions the Group has made to Alto Maipo, and the recovery of 
this balance would have derived from the cash flows generated by the project once construction is complete and the project is operating. 
(VII) LIQUIDITY RISK 
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and financing facilities, through the review of forecast and actual cash flows. 
The Group typically holds surplus cash in demand or term deposits or highly liquid investments, which typically can be accessed or liquidated within 24 hours. 
The majority of borrowings comprise a short-term loan at Los Pelambres, repayable over a period of up to one year, project financing (senior debt)  
at Centinela, repayable over approximately 3.5 years, project financing (senior debt) at Antucoya repayable over approximately 10.5 years, long-term 
subordinated debt at Antucoya repayable over approximately 10.5 years, and a corporate loan at Antofagasta plc repayable over approximately 5 years. 
At the end of the 2016 the Group was in a net debt position (2015 – net debt position), as disclosed in Note 32.c. Details of cash, cash equivalents and liquid 
investments are given in Note 22, while details of borrowings including the maturity profile are given in Note 23.d. Details of undrawn committed borrowing 
facilities are also given in Note 23.e. 
The following table analyses the maturity of the Group’s contractual commitments in respect of its financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The 
table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest 
and principal cash flows.

(VIII) CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group’s objectives are to return capital to shareholders while leaving the Group with sufficient funds to progress its short, medium and long-term  
growth plans as well as preserving the financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. This policy remains unchanged. The Group 
monitors capital on the basis of net cash (defined as cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments less borrowings) which was a net debt of $1,071.7 million  
at 31 December 2016 (2015 – net debt $1,023.5 million), as well as gross cash (defined as cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments) which was $2,048.5 
million at 31 December 2016 (2015 – $1,731.6 million). The Group’s total cash is held in a combination of on demand and term deposits and managed funds 
investing in high quality, fixed income instruments. Some of the managed funds have been instructed to invest in instruments with average maturities greater 
than 90 days. These amounts are presented as liquid investments but are included in net cash for monitoring and decision-making purposes. The Group has a 
risk averse investment strategy. The Group’s borrowings are detailed in Note 23. Additional project finance or shareholder loans are taken out by the operating 
subsidiaries to fund projects on a case-by-case basis.

25 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
D) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Group occasionally uses derivative financial instruments, in general to reduce its exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
movements. The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
The Group has applied the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. Changes in the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows have been recognised directly in equity, with such amounts subsequently 
recognised in the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. Realised gains and losses on commodity derivatives recognised in the income statement have been recorded within revenue. The time value element 
of changes in the fair value of derivative options is excluded from the designated hedging relationship, and is therefore recognised directly in the income 
statement within other finance items. Realised gains and losses and changes in the fair value of exchange and interest derivatives are recognised within  
other finance items for those derivatives where hedge accounting has not been applied. When hedge accounting has been applied the realised gains and  
losses on exchange and interest derivatives are recognised within other finance items and interest expense respectively. 
(I) MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS AND INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT

26 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
The long-term incentive plan (the “Plan”) was introduced at the end of 2011. Awards granted pursuant to the Plan form part of the remuneration of senior 
managers in the Group. Directors are not eligible to participate in the Plan. 
DETAILS OF THE AWARDS 
Under the Plan, the Group may grant awards based on the price of ordinary shares in the Company and cannot grant awards over actual shares. 
– Restricted Awards: These awards are conditional rights to receive cash payment by reference to a specified number of the Company’s ordinary shares, 
subject to the relevant employee remaining employed by the Group when the Restricted Award vests; and 
– Performance Awards: These awards are conditional rights to receive cash payment by reference to a specified number of the Company’s ordinary shares 
subject to both the satisfaction of a performance condition and the relevant employee remaining employed by the Group when the Performance Award vests. 
When awards vest under the Plan, participants become entitled to receive a cash payment by reference to the number and portion of awards that have vested 
and the market value of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of vesting. There is no exercise price payable by participants in respect of the awards. 
Restricted Awards can only vest in full if participants remain employed by the Group for three years from the date that Restricted Awards are granted. In 
ordinary circumstances, the first one-third of a Restricted Award will vest after one year, the second one-third will vest after two years and the remaining  
one-third will vest after three years. There are no performance criteria attached to Restricted Awards. The fair value of Restricted Awards granted under the 
Plan is recorded as a compensation expense over the vesting periods, with a corresponding liability recognised for the fair value of the liability at the end of each 
period until settled. 
Performance Awards only vest if certain performance criteria are met. The performance criteria reflect a number of factors including total shareholder return, 
earnings levels, growth in the Group’s reserves and resources and project delivery targets. The fair value of Performance Awards under the Plan is recorded 
as a compensation expense over the vesting period, with a corresponding liability at the end of each period until settled.

VALUATION PROCESS AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE AWARDS 
The fair value of the awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The inputs into the Monte Carlo simulation model are as follows: 
 2016 2015 
Weighted average forecast share price at vesting date $9.20 $10.07 
Expected volatility 36.39% 27.31% 
Expected life of awards 3 years 3 years 
Expected dividend yields 0.34% 1.90% 
Risk free rate 0.44% 0.13% 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous five years. The expected life of awards  
used in the model has been adjusted based on management’s best estimate for the effects of non-transferability and compliance of the objectives determined 
according to the characteristic of each plan. 
The number of awards outstanding at the end of the year is as follows: 
 
RESTRICTED 
AWARDS 
PERFORMANCE 
AWARDS 
Outstanding at 1 January 2016 669,864 1,019,316

Outstanding at 31 December 2016 562,136 1,173,092 
Number of awards that have vested 403,209  
The Group has recorded a liability for $6.8 million at 31 December 2016, of which $3.6 million is due after more than one year (31 December 2015 –  
$8.9 million, of which $3.4 million was due after more than one year) and total expenses of $3.4 million for the year (2015 – expense of $4.0 million).  
The intrinsic value is $6.8 million. 
27 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS 
A) DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES 
The Group operates defined contribution schemes for a limited number of employees. The amount charged to the income statement in 2016 was $0.1 million 
(2015 – $0.1 million), representing the amount paid in the year. There were no outstanding amounts which remain payable at the end of either year. 
B) SEVERANCE PROVISIONS 
Employment terms at some of the Group’s operations provide for payment of a severance indemnity when an employment contract comes to an end. This  
is typically at the rate of one month for each year of service (subject in most cases to a cap as to the number of qualifying years of service) and based on final 
salary level. The severance indemnity obligation is treated as an unfunded defined benefit plan, and the obligation recognised is based on valuations performed 
by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method, which are regularly updated. The obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the 
present value of the severance indemnity obligation. Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in other comprehensive income. 
The most recent valuation was carried out in 2016 by Ernst & Young, a qualified actuary in Santiago, Chile who is not connected with the Group. 
The main assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were as follows: 
 2016 2015 
Average nominal discount rate 4.5% 4.8% 
Average rate of increase in salaries 1.7% 1.6% 
Average staff revenue 11.8% 8.6%

The discount rate is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future severance payments to their present value. The table below shows the principal 
instruments and assumptions utilised in determining the discount rate:  
Rate of increase in salaries 
This represents the estimated average rates of future salary increases, reflecting likely future promotions and other changes. This has been based on historical 
information for the Group for the period from 2013 to 2016. 
Revenue rate 
This represents the estimated average level of future employee revenue. This has been based on historical information for the Group for the period from  
2013 to 2016.  
Sensitivity analysis 
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase and staff revenue. The sensitivity 
analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while 
holding all other assumptions constant. 
– If the discount rate is 100 basis points higher the defined benefit obligation would decrease by $8.3 million. If the discount rate is 100 basis points lower the 
defined benefit obligation would increase by $9.7 million. 
– If the expected salary growth increases by 1% the defined benefit obligation would increase by $8.9 million. If the expected salary growth decreases by 1% 
the defined benefit obligation would decrease by $7.8 million.  
– If the staff revenue increases by 1% the defined benefit obligation would decrease by less than $0.1 million. If the staff revenue decreases by 1% the defined 
benefit obligation would increase by less than $0.1 million.

The credit to the income statement of $48.6 million (2015 – $83.0 million charge) includes a credit for foreign exchange differences of $0.1 million (2015 – 
includes a credit of $1.1 million). 
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. 
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balance (after offset): 
 
2016 
$M 
2015 
$M 
Deferred tax assets 82.8 124.6 
Deferred tax liabilities (880.9) (1,076.2)
Net deferred tax balances (798.1) (951.6)
At 31 December 2016, the Group had unused tax losses of $7.4 million (2015 – $9.9 million) available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset of 
$2.7 million has been recognised in respect of these losses in 2016 (2015 – $2.7 million). These losses may be carried forward indefinitely. 
At 31 December 2016, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities 
have not been recognised was $4,826.8 million (2015 – 4,963.9 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is  
in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is likely that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant. 
The deferred tax balance of $798.1 million (2015 – $951.6 million) includes $878.8 million (2015 – $965.0 million) due in more than one year. All amounts are 
shown as non-current on the face of the balance sheet as required by IAS 12.

regular independent formal review. It is estimated that the provision will be utilised from 2024 until 2059 based on current mine plans. 
During the year ended 31 December 2016, the decommissioning and restoration provisions at the Group’s mining operations decreased by a net total  
of $1.9 million.

36 LITIGATION AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
Antofagasta plc or its subsidiaries are subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. None of these claims are currently expected  
to result in any material loss to the Group. Details of the principal claims in existence either during, or at the end of, the period and the current status of these 
claims are set out below: 
LOS PELAMBRES – CERRO AMARILLO WASTE DUMP  
In 2004, Los Pelambres received all of the required authorisations from the Chilean government to deposit waste-rock from its mining activities in its current 
location (the “Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump”). According to the then official Chilean maps (1996), this area was located entirely within Chile. In 2007, Chile 
modified the official maps in this area without making the changes public. 
In February 2012, a binational border commission, established to clarify the exact position of the Chile/Argentina border, determined accurately the location of 
the border in the area of the Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump, showing that part of the Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump was located in Argentina. 
In May 2014, Xstrata Pachón SA (“Xstrata Pachón”), a subsidiary of Glencore plc and the holder of the mining properties on the Argentinian side of the border, filed  
a claim against Los Pelambres before the Federal Court of San Juan, Argentina, alleging that Los Pelambres had unlawfully deposited waste-rock on its property. 
Xstrata Pachón has also filed a criminal complaint before a different Federal Court of San Juan alleging that when Los Pelambres was depositing rock on the 
Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump it violated several Argentinian laws relating to the misappropriation of land, unlawful appropriation of water bodies and that peoples’ 
health was in jeopardy from the alleged contamination that the Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump might generate. 
In both cases, Los Pelambres has submitted preliminary objections to the Argentinian courts. 
In the civil case, a final decision on these preliminary objections is still pending and substantive arguments will not be made until and unless these preliminary 
objections are finally rejected. 
In April 2016, in accordance with a preliminary measure required by the Federal Court of San Juan, Los Pelambres and the Province of San Juan executed an 
agreement by means of which Los Pelambres has committed itself to perform a preventative process to isolate any environmental impacts of the Cerro Amarillo 
Waste Dump, regularly monitor underground and surface waters, and undertake other additional actions requested by the Province. 
In November 2016, the Province set aside the agreement. Notwithstanding so, between November 2016 and January 2017, Los Pelambres completed the 
retirement of the pneumatic tyres formerly placed at the Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump. 
In February 2017, at the Province of San Juan’s request, Los Pelambres filed a Provisional Action Plan for the Cerro Amarillo Waste Dump’s closing before the 
civil courts, which is currently subject to review by the parties to the proceedings and the judge.  
In the criminal proceedings, current and former directors and officers of Los Pelambres are in the process of providing testimony as named co-defendants  
in this case. 
TWIN METALS MINNESOTA – FEDERAL MINERAL LEASES MNES-1352 AND MNES-1353 
On 8 March, 2016, the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior issued a legal opinion concluding that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has discretion to 
deny Twin Metals’ application for renewal of federal mineral leases MNES-1352 and MNES-1353. The United States Forest Service (USFS) declined to consent 
to renewal of the leases on 14 December, 2016, and BLM rejected Twin Metals’ application to renew the leases the next day. 
The BLM’s denial relied on the Solicitor’s Opinion’s conclusion that it had discretion to deny the renewal, and BLM took the view that USFS consent was 
required to renew the leases. According to BLM, because the USFS refused consent, BLM was required to reject the lease renewal application.  
The Forest Service’s decision was based on the potential environmental impacts of sulfide-ore copper mining in the Boundary Waters watershed. The USFS 
decision did not discuss the terms and conditions of the leases or the project, nor did it address Twin Metals’ legal rights to the leases.  
On 12 September, 2016, Twin Metals filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota against the United States, the U.S. Department of the Interior, 
Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, Solicitor Hilary C. Tompkins, and BLM. Twin Metals brought claims under the Quiet Title Act (QTA) and the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA) seeking to secure its rights to the two federal mineral leases. Following the USFS withholding of consent and BLM’s denial of renewal, 
Twin Metals filed an amended complaint on 3 January, 2017, adding the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Secretary of Agriculture Thomas J. Vilsack, the USFS, 
and Chief of the USFS Thomas L. Tidwell as defendants. The amended complaint seeks similar relief under the QTA and APA, and also requests that the court 
overturn the government’s denial of the leases.  
The government has not yet responded to the amended complaint.

182 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016  
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.  
38B PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE PARENT COMPANY 
A) CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
The Company’s functional currency is the US dollar. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling  
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities, including amounts due from or to subsidiaries, denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currency are retranslated at year end exchange rates. Gains and losses on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the year. 
B) REVENUE RECOGNITION 
Dividends proposed by subsidiaries are recognised as income by the Company when they represent a present obligation of the subsidiaries, i.e. in the period in 
which they are formally approved for payment. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
C) DIVIDENDS PAYABLE 
Dividends proposed are recognised when they represent a present obligation, i.e. in the period in which they are formally approved for payment. Accordingly,  
an interim dividend is recognised when paid and a final dividend is recognised when approved by shareholders. 
D) INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES 
Investments in subsidiaries represent equity holdings in subsidiaries and long-term amounts owed by subsidiaries. Such investments are valued at cost  
less any impairment provisions. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may  
not be recoverable. The recoverable amount of the investment is the higher of fair value less cost to dispose. As explained in Note 39D, amounts owed by 
subsidiaries due in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at year end rates of exchange with any exchange differences taken to the  
profit and loss account. 
E) CURRENT ASSET INVESTMENTS AND CASH AT BANK AND IN HAND 
Current asset investments comprise highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk 
of changes in value, typically maturing within 12 months. 
Cash at bank and in hand comprise cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand 
F) BORROWINGS  
Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. They are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method. 
G) BORROWINGS – PREFERENCE SHARES 
The sterling-denominated preference shares issued by the Company carry a fixed rate of return without the right to participate in any surplus. They are 
accordingly classified as borrowings and translated into US dollars at year-end rates of exchange. Preference share dividends are included within finance costs. 
H) EQUITY INSTRUMENTS – ORDINARY SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM 
Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Equity instruments of the Company comprise its sterling-
denominated issued ordinary share capital and related share premium. 
As explained above, the presentational and the functional currency of the Company is US dollars, and ordinary share capital and share premium are translated 
into US dollars at historical rates of exchange based on dates of issue. 
38C EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE  
A) AVERAGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES 
The average number of employees was 4 (2015 – 5). 
B) AGGREGATE REMUNERATION

Remuneration Report.

60.6 478.0 538.6 
The above amount of $478.0 million (2015 – $478.0 million) in respect of amounts owed by subsidiaries due after more than one year relates to long-term 
funding balances which form an integral part of the Company’s long-term investment in those subsidiary companies.  
A one-off repayment of capital following the sale of ADASA was made during 2015 and therefore it is still appropriate to consider the rest of the loans as part of 
the investment in subsidiary. 
B) TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES – AMOUNTS OWED BY SUBSIDIARIES DUE AFTER ONE YEAR 
At 31 December 2015 an amount of $500.0 million was owed to the Company by an indirect subsidiary, pursuant to a 10 year loan agreement. 
C) TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES – AMOUNTS OWED BY SUBSIDIARIES DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR  
At 31 December 2016, amounts owed by subsidiaries due within one year were $50.9 million (2015 – $49.8 million). 
38E BORROWINGS – PREFERENCE SHARES 
The authorised, issued and fully paid preference share capital of the Company comprised 2,000,000 5% cumulative preference shares of £1 each at both  
31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015. As explained in Note 23 B, the preference shares are measured in the balance sheet in US dollars at period-end 
rates of exchange. 
The preference shares are non-redeemable and are entitled to a fixed 5% cumulative dividend, payable in equal instalments in June and December of each 
year. On a winding-up, the preference shares are entitled to repayment and any arrears of dividend in priority to ordinary shareholders, but are not entitled  
to participate further in any surplus. Each preference share carries 100 votes (see Note 23A (xv)) at any general meeting.

39 ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
This Annual Report includes a number of alternative performance measures, in addition to IFRS amounts. These measures are included because they are 
considered to provide relevant and useful additional information to users of the accounts. Set out below are definitions of these alternative performance 
measures, explanations as to why they are considered to be relevant and useful, and reconciliations to the IFRS figures. 
A) EBTIDA 
EBITDA refers to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation. EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation, amortisation, profit or loss on 
disposals and impairment charges to operating profit. This comprises 100% of the EBITDA from the Group´s subsidiaries, and the Group´s proportional share of 
the EBITDA of its associates and joint ventures. 
EBTIDA is considered to provide a useful and comparable indication of the current operating earnings performance of the business, excluding the impact of the 
historic cost of property, plant & equipment or the particular financing structure adopted by the business.

B) CASH COSTS 
Cash costs are a measure of the cost of operating production expressed in terms of cents per pound of payable copper produced. 
This is considered to be a useful and relevant measure as it is a standard industry measure applied by most major copper mining companies which reflects the 
direct costs involved in producing each lb of copper. It therefore allows a straightforward comparison of the unit production cost of different mines, and allows 
an assessment of the position of a mine on the industry cost curve. It also provides a simple indication of the profitability of a mine when compared against the 
price of copper (per lb).

C) ATTRIBUTABLE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS & LIQUID INVESTMENTS, BORROWINGS AND NET DEBT 
Attributable cash, cash equivalents & liquid investments, borrowings and net debt reflects the proportion of those balances which are attributable to the equity 
holders of the Company, after deducting the proportion attributable to the non-controlling interests in the Group’s subsidiaries. 
This is considered to be a useful and relevant measure as the majority of the Group’s cash tends to be held at the corporate level and therefore 100% 
attributable to the equity holders of the Company, whereas the majority of the Group’s borrowings tends to be at the level of the individual operations, and  
hence only a proportion is attributable to the equity holders of the Company.

1. The 2012 figures have been restated as a result of the adoption of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and the application of the amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits in 2013. The 
investment in associate balance relating to Tethyan Copper Company Limited (“Tethyan”) is a negative balance $3.1 million. The negative balance has been recognised because the 
Group funds the on-going expenses and liabilities of Tethyan. Given the balance is negative it has been included within non-current liabilities. The 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 
negatives balance have been reclassified to non-current liabilities. 
2. In 2012 the income statement included $500.0 million as a provision against the carrying value of property, plant and equipment relating to the Antucoya project. Excluding this 
exceptional item profit before tax was $3,179.1 million. 
3. EBITDA refers to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation. EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation, amortisation, profit or loss on disposals and 
impairment charges to operating profit. This comprises 100% of the EBITDA from the Group´s subsidiaries, and the Group´s proportional share of the EBITDA of its associates and 
joint ventures. 
4. The 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 figures have been restated as results of IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for sale and Discontinued Operations related to ADASA and FCA sale 
during 2015 and Michilla during 2016.

189 ANTOFAGASTA.CO.UK OTHER INFORMATION: ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES ESTIMATES 
AT 31 DECEMBER 2016 
INTRODUCTION 
The ore reserves and mineral resources estimates presented in this report 
comply with the requirements of the Australasian Code for Reporting of 
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2012 edition (the 
JORC Code) which has been used by the Group as minimum standard for the 
preparation and disclosure of the information contained herein. The definitions 
and categories of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are set out below.  
The information on ore reserves and mineral resources was prepared by or 
under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in the JORC Code. 
The Competent Persons have sufficient experience relevant to the style of 
mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity 
which they are undertaking. The Competent Persons consent to the inclusion 
in this report of the matters based on their information in the form and 
context in which it appears. The Competent Person for Exploration Results 
and Mineral Resources is Aquiles Gonzalez (CP, Chile), Manager of Mineral 
Resource Evaluation for Antofagasta Minerals S.A. The Competent Person for 
Ore Reserves is Murray Canfield (P.Eng. Ontario), Technical Manager of 
Mining for Antofagasta Minerals S.A.  
The Group’s operations and projects are subject to a comprehensive 
programme of audits aimed at providing assurance in respect of ore reserves 
and mineral resources estimates. The audits are conducted by suitably 
qualified Competent Persons from within a particular division, another division 
of the Company or from independent consultants.  
The ore reserves and mineral resources estimates represent full reserves 
and resources, with the Group’s attributable share for each mine shown in the 
‘Attributable Tonnage’ column. The Group’s economic interest in each mine is 
disclosed in the notes following the estimates on pages 198 to 199. The totals 
in the table may include some small apparent differences as the specific 
individual figures have not been rounded. 
DEFINITIONS AND CATEGORIES OF ORE 
RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES 
A ‘Mineral Resource’ is a concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic 
economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, quality and quantity 
that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The 
location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral 
Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological 
evidence and knowledge. Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of 
increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured 
categories. 
An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
tonnage, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of 
confidence. It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not 
verified geological and/or grade continuity. It is based on information gathered 
through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drill holes which may be limited or of uncertain quality and 
reliability. 
An ‘Indicated Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content 
can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence. It is based on 
exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill 
holes. The locations are too widely or inappropriately spaced to confirm 
geological and/or grade continuity but are spaced closely enough for 
continuity to be assumed. 
A ‘Measured Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content 
can be estimated with a high level of confidence. It is based on detailed and 
reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes. The locations are spaced closely enough to confirm 
geological and grade continuity. 
An ‘Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or 
Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for 
losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate 
assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of 
and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, 
marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. These 
assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could 
reasonably be justified. Ore Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing 
confidence into Probable Ore Reserves and Proved Ore Reserves. 
A ‘Probable Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, 
and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. It includes diluting 
materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is 
mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and 
include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, 
metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and 
governmental factors. These assessments demonstrate at the time of 
reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified. 
A ‘Proved Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a Measured 
Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses 
which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and 
studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and modification 
by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, 
environmental, social and governmental factors. These assessments 
demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably 
be justified.

AT 31 DECEMBER 2016 
 
NOTES TO ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES ESTIMATES 
The ore reserves mentioned in this report were determined considering specific cut-off grades for each mine and using a long-term copper price of $3.10/lb 
(unchanged from 2015), $9.00/lb molybdenum ($10.00/lb in 2015) and $1,250/oz gold ($1,300 in 2015), unless otherwise noted. These same values have been 
used for copper equivalent (CuEq) estimates, where appropriate. 
In order to ensure that the stated resources represent mineralisation that has “reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction” (JORC code) the 
resources are enclosed within pit shells that were optimised based on measured, indicated and inferred resources and considering a copper price of $3.60/lb 
(unchanged from 2015). Mineralisation estimated outside these pit shells is not included in the resource figures. 
A) LOS PELAMBRES 
Los Pelambres is 60% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of ore reserves is 0.42% copper and for mineral resources is 0.35% 
copper. For 2016 the mineral resource model has been updated with 28 drill holes for a total of 6,264 metres. The decrease of 52 million tonnes in ore 
reserves is due principally to depletion in the period and reflects the remaining capacity of the existing tailing dams, limiting the amount of mineral resource that 
can be converted into ore reserves. Mineral resources in the measured plus indicated categories decreased by 58 million tonnes, also due principally to 
depletion in the period. Resources in the inferred category increased by 38 million tonnes as a result of incorporation of new information from the drilling 
campaign to the resource model. 
B) CENTINELA (CONCENTRATES & CATHODES) 
Centinela is 70% owned by the Group and consists of Centinela Concentrates (Esperanza + Esperanza Sur, mostly sulphide porphyry deposits) and Centinela 
Cathodes (Tesoro Central, an oxide deposit + the oxide portion of the Mirador deposit) operations. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of ore reserves 
for Centinela Concentrates is 0.20% equivalent copper, with 0.15% copper used as a cut-off grade for mineral resources. The cut-off grade used for the 
Centinela Cathodes deposits is as follows: Tesoro Central deposit is 0.41% copper for ore reserves and 0.30% for mineral resources; the Mirador Oxides 
deposit is 0.30% copper for ore reserves and 0.15% for mineral resources. The cut-off grade applied to oxides contained in the Esperanza deposit (processed 
separately as Run-of-Mine leach, or ROM) is 0.20% copper for ore reserves and 0.15% copper for mineral resources. Centinela ore reserves decreased by a 
net 36 million tonnes after depletion of 31 million tonnes, while mineral resources increased by a net 60 million tonnes. The increase is mainly in Esperanza and 
Esperanza Sur deposits due to updates to the economic parameters in the period. The Centinela Cathodes ore reserves are made up of 80.7 million tonnes at 
0.60% copper of heap leach ore and 109.2 million tonnes at 0.28% copper of ROM ore. 
C) ENCUENTRO 
Encuentro is 100% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of mineral resources for both oxides and sulphides is 0.15% copper. The 
oxide portion of the porphyry copper deposit is part of the Encuentro Oxides project currently in construction and will feed into the Centinela Cathodes 
operation. Ore Reserves are related to the Encuentro Oxide project, use a cut-off grade of 0.20% copper and have remained virtually unchanged from 2015. 
The decrease of 54 million tonnes in mineral resources is mainly due to changes in economic assumptions impacting the sulphide portion of the deposit. 
D) MIRADOR 
Mirador is 100% owned by the Group. A portion of Mirador Oxides is subject to an agreement between the Group and Centinela, whereby Centinela purchased 
the rights to mine the oxide ore reserves within an identified area. The ore reserves and mineral resources for Mirador Oxides subject to the agreement with 
Centinela are included in the Centinela Cathodes section. The resources not subject to the agreement are reported in this section. The cut-off grade applied to 
the determination of mineral resources for oxides is 0.15% copper and for sulphides is 0.20% copper. For 2016 the resource model has been updated with 122 
drill holes for a total of 20,002 metres. The increase of 32 million tonnes in resources is due principally to a decrease in projected processing costs. 
E) LLANO 
The Llano deposit is covered by AMSA and Centinela mining tenements shared in different proportions, with the Group owning 71.1% of the resource.  
The cut-off grade applied to the determination of mineral resources is 0.15% copper. For 2016 the resource model has not been updated.  
F) PALEOCANAL 
The Paleocanal deposit is covered by AMSA and Centinela mining tenements shared in different proportions, with the Group owning 90.2% of the resource.  
The cut-off grade applied to the determination of mineral resources is 0.15% copper. For 2016 the resource model has not been updated.  
G) POLO SUR 
Polo Sur is 100% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of mineral resources for both oxides and sulphides is 0.20% copper.  
For 2016 the resource model has been refined without additional drill holes. 
H) PENACHO BLANCO 
Penacho Blanco is 51% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of mineral resources for both oxides and sulphides is 0.20% 
copper. For 2016 the resource model has been refined without additional drill holes. 
I) ANTUCOYA 
Antucoya is 70% owned by the Group. The ore reserve cut-off grade is calculated using an economic formula with a minimum of 0.16% copper, while the 
cut-off grade for mineral resources is 0.15% copper. Despite depletion in the period of 24 million tonnes, ore reserves have increased by 10 million tonnes 
mainly due to changes in economic assumptions and an updated pit design. Mineral Resources have increased by 40 million tonnes due to changes in economic 
assumptions and changes to the geo-metallurgical model. 
J) LOS VOLCANES 
Los Volcanes is 51% owned by the Group. The cut-off grade applied to the determination of ore reserves and mineral resources is 0.20% copper. For 2016 the 
mineral resource model has not been updated. 
K) MICHILLA 
During 2016 Michilla was sold to Haldeman Mining Company S.A. 
198 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016  
L) TWIN METALS MINNESOTA LLC 
Twin Metals Minnesota LLC ("Twin Metals") is owned 100% by the Group.  
Twin Metals has a 70% interest in the Birch Lake Joint Venture ("BLJV") which holds the Birch Lake, Spruce Road and Maturi Southwest deposits, as well as a 
portion of the main Maturi deposit. With these interests taken into consideration, Twin Metals owns 82.9% of the resource. The resource estimate remains 
unchanged from 2015. 
The cut-off grade applied to the determination of mineral resources is 0.3% copper, which when combined with credits from nickel, platinum, palladium and 
gold, is deemed appropriate for an underground operation. In the resource table ‘TPM’ (Total Precious Metals) refers to the sum of platinum, palladium and gold 
values in grammes per tonne. The TPM value of 0.57 g/tonne for the Maturi resource estimate is made up of 0.15 g/tonne platinum, 0.34 g/tonne palladium and 
0.08 g/tonne gold. The TPM value of 0.30 g/tonne for the Maturi Southwest resource estimate is made up of 0.08 g/tonne platinum, 0.17 g/tonne palladium and 
0.05 g/tonne gold. The TPM value of 0.70 g/tonne for the Birch Lake resource estimate is made up of 0.19 g/tonne platinum, 0.41 g/tonne palladium and 0.10 
g/tonne gold. The Spruce Road resource estimate does not include TPM values as they were not assayed. 
The Solicitor of the Department of the Interior (DOI) issued a legal opinion concluding that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has discretion to deny Twin 
Metals’ application for renewal of federal mineral leases MNES-1352 and MNES-1353. The United States Forest Service (USFS) declined to consent to renewal 
of the leases on 14 December 2016, and BLM rejected Twin Metals’ application to renew the leases the next day. These leases represent only a portion of Twin 
Metals’ total mineral resources shown above. 
On 12 September 2016, Twin Metals (TMM) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota against the DOI. TMM brought claims seeking to secure its 
rights to the two federal mineral leases. Following the USFS withholding of consent and BLM’s denial of renewal, TMM filed an amended complaint on 
3 January 2017, adding the USDA and the USFS as defendants. The amended complaint seeks similar relief and also requests that the court overturn the 
government’s denial of the leases. The government has not yet responded to the amended complaint. As stated in the lawsuit filed in September 2016, TMM 
believes denial of the leases is inconsistent with federal law, the terms of leases themselves and the federal government's established precedent in supporting 
and renewing the leases over five decades. While TMM is assessing the impact of the agencies' lease renewal decision, Twin Metals is committed to progressing 
the project and will continue to pursue legal avenues to protect its contractual mineral rights. 
M) ZALDÍVAR 
Zaldívar is 50% owned by the Group. Ore Reserves have been estimated considering a copper price of $3.10/lb ($3.00/lb in 2015), while the Mineral Resources 
estimated considering a copper price of $3.60/lb ($3.50/lb in 2015). Cut-off grades are calculated using an economic formula which is equivalent to 
approximately 0.20% copper. For 2016 the mineral resource model has not been updated. Mineral Resources have increased by 47 million tonnes due to 
changes in economic assumptions and changes to the geo-metallurgical model. Ore Reserves increased by 5.5 million tonnes mostly due to a change in criteria 
related to ore-in-process. In-situ plus stockpiled ore is estimated to be 405.3 million tonnes at 0.54% copper (330.6 million tonnes of heap leach ore plus 74.7 
million tonnes of dump leach ore), while ore-in-process is estimated to be 54.8 million tonnes at 0.28% copper (17.4 million tonnes of heap leach ore plus 37.4 
million tonnes of dump leach ore). The heap leach process has a leach cycle of approximately one year and the dump leach process has a leach cycle of 
approximately two years. Ore Reserves in the Proved category decreased by 89 million tonnes, while Probable Ore Reserves increased by a corresponding 94 
million tonnes. This is mostly due to a change in criteria for the conversion of Resources to Reserves in a portion of the deposit with a lower density of 
geo-metallurgical information, whereby Measured Resources are converted to Probable Reserves. Additionally, Dump Leach ore-in-process as categorised both 
as Indicated Resource and Probable Reserve. 
N) OTHER MINERAL INVENTORY 
In addition to the Mineral Resources noted above, the Group has interests in other deposits located in the Antofagasta Region of Chile, some of them containing 
gold and/or molybdenum. At the moment they are in exploration or in the process of resource estimation. The potential quantity and grade of each of the 
deposits is conceptual in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define these deposits as mineral resources, and it is uncertain if further exploration 
will result in the determination of a mineral resource. These include:

O) ANTOMIN 2 AND ANTOMIN INVESTORS 
The Group has an approximately 51% interest in two indirect subsidiaries, Antomin 2 Limited (“Antomin 2”) and Antomin Investors Limited (“Antomin 
Investors”), which own a number of copper exploration properties in Chile’s Antofagasta Region and Coquimbo Region. These include, among others, Penacho 
Blanco, Los Volcanes (ex-Conchi) and Brujulina (see Note N(ii) above). The remaining approximately 49% of Antomin 2 and Antomin Investors is owned by 
Mineralinvest Establishment (“Mineralinvest”), which is owned by a Liechtenstein foundation, in which members of the Luksic family are interested.

By-products (credits in 
copper concentrates)
Products obtained as a result of copper 
processing. Los Pelambres and Centinela 
Concentrates receive credit for the 
gold and silver content in the copper 
concentrate sold. Los Pelambres also 
produces molybdenum concentrate.
Concentrate The product of a physical concentration 
process, such as flotation or gravity 
concentration, which involves separating 
ore minerals from unwanted waste 
rock. Concentrates require subsequent 
processing (such as smelting or leaching) 
to break down or dissolve the ore 
minerals and obtain the desired elements, 
usually metals.
Contained copper The proportion or quantity of copper 
contained in a given quantity of ore 
or concentrate.
Copper cathode Refined copper produced by 
electrolytic refining of impure copper 
by electrowinning.
Cut-off grade The lowest grade of mineralised material 
considered economic to process and used 
in the calculation of ore reserves and 
mineral resources.
Flotation A process of separation by which 
chemicals in solution are added to 
materials, some of which are attracted to 
bubbles and float, while others sink. This 
results in the production of concentrate.
Grade A copper cathode Highest-quality copper cathode (LME 
registered and certified in the case of 
Centinela Cathodes).
Greenfield project The development or exploration of a new 
project at a previously undeveloped site.
Heap-leaching or leaching A process for the recovery of copper 
from ore, generally oxides. The crushed 
material is laid on a slightly sloping, 
impermeable pad and leached by 
uniformly trickling (gravity fed) chemical 
solution through the beds to ponds. The 
metal is then recovered from the solution 
through the SX-EW process.

appropriate assessments have been 
carried out to demonstrate that at a 
given date extraction could be reasonably 
justified. These include consideration 
of and modification by realistically 
assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, 
marketing, legal, environmental, social and 
governmental factors.
Oxide and sulphide ores Different kinds of ore containing copper. 
Oxide ore occurs on the weathered 
surface of ore-rich lodes and normally 
results in the production of cathode 
copper through a heap-leaching process. 
Sulphide ore comes from an unweathered 
parent ores process and normally 
results in the production of concentrate 
through a flotation process which then 
requires smelting and refining to produce 
cathode copper.
Payable copper The proportion or quantity of contained 
copper for which payment is received 
after metallurgical deduction.
Porphyry A large body of rock which contains 
disseminated chalcopyrite and other 
sulphide minerals. Such a deposit is 
mined in bulk on a large scale, generally 
in open pits, for copper and its by-
product molybdenum.
Run-of-Mine (“ROM”) A process for the recovery of copper from 
ore, typically used for low-grade ores. 
The mined, uncrushed ore is leached with 
a chemical solution. The metal is then 
recovered from the solution through the 
SX-EW process.
Stockpile Material extracted and piled for future use.
SX-EW Solvent extraction and electrowinning. 
A process for extracting metal from an

RESULTS IN BRIEF
CONTENTS
Front Cover ‘51˚02’, Bristol City Centre I am pleased to report a highly successful year for Redrow.
When the share buy-back took place in October 2000, the
Board highlighted its focus on delivering increased shareholder
value. I am therefore delighted to report further strong 
growth in earnings per share of 34%. Part of this increase
reflects the capital restructuring but the greater part is the 
consequence of the strong financial and operational 
performance of the business.
Redrow’s financial strength is demonstrated by two key 
measures, its margins and its return on capital employed. Both
are at the top of our industry’s range. This year the operating
margin within the Homes Division was 17.6%, a considerable
achievement and one which the Board regards as sustainable in
the current markets. Equally, the return on capital employed at
30% continues to reflect the emphasis we place on the efficient
use of capital. The increased volume of the business, generated
both within the existing Redrow companies and from the 
acquisition of Tay Homes, has enabled us to grow operating
profits before integration costs relating to the acquisition by
24% from £79.5m to £98.4m. I am therefore glad to report that
once again the Board is able to recommend increasing the 
dividend by 10%, maintaining the progressive dividend policy
since flotation. 
Sustaining profitable growth is one of the key objectives of the
Board and we have therefore taken a number of important steps
aimed at underpinning the continuation of our successful 
performance. Firstly, Tay Homes was acquired in January this
year which established critical mass in two operating areas,
Yorkshire and Scotland, enabling us to bring them closer to
maturity faster than would otherwise have been possible. The
acquisition also brought useful new opportunities in the
Midlands. The purchase was almost entirely funded out of cash
generated by selling a number of successful developments by
Redrow’s commercial arm, which generated turnover of £30.2m
and an operating profit of £3.1m this year. As a result I can not
only report that gearing of the Company as a whole fell from
60% at the start of the year to 42% at the half-year end but that
there has been a further fall to 39% at the end of the second
half. The Company remains strongly cash generative while
gearing reflects a prudent balance between leveraging our 
Shareholders’ funds and maintaining an appropriately cautious
approach to debt.
4 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Robert Jones Chairman 
I am pleased to report a highly successful 
year for Redrow. Secondly, building techniques throughout the industry
have failed to change sufficiently to reflect the problems
the country faces as a result of shortages of certain skilled
trade workers. After careful consideration of alternative 
solutions and pilot schemes using timber-frame and light 
steel-frame methods, as well as modular construction, Redrow
has decided that the benefits from the use of light steel-frame 
warrant the establishment of a joint venture for their 
manufacture. This joint venture with Corus brings together 
our expertise in residential development with their skills in steel
manufacture and application. Both companies are investing into
a stand-alone joint venture company the equivalent of up
to £3.0m. We anticipate that the utilisation of light steel 
frames will benefit the Company in terms of build times and
quality resulting in improved customer satisfaction.

Optima, the 27,000 sq.ft. office development,
St.David’s Park, Flintshire Two other areas are critical to the sustainability of the business;
land and people. Redrow has consistently anticipated changes 
in the planning system. By placing emphasis on the
Government’s aims of sustainability and increased densities, our
land acquisition programme has brought substantial financial
benefits. I am therefore pleased to report a further increase in
our current land bank from 14,300 plots to 15,600 plots. This
means that the vast majority of land we will develop in the next
three years is already owned or controlled by the Company.
Much of this is brownfield land which currently represents 69%
of our land bank. Beyond that, there are approximately 25,000
plots within our forward land bank which have a realistic
prospect of securing planning permission in the future.
Our workforce at every level is highly skilled and dedicated to
the success of the Company. However, such skills require 
continuous honing and updating and we continue to dedicate
considerable resources to training. Redrow aims to build its
strength in people not only through internal promotions but
also from external sources and I am particularly pleased to 
welcome those members of Tay’s staff who have joined Redrow
and whose contribution is proving highly beneficial.  Two new
members of the Main Board have joined us this year.  
John Tutte joined the Company as a regional chairman in the
South in January and brings with him a wealth of experience of
our industry. In July he was appointed to the Board reflecting 
his significant contribution during his short tenure with the
Company. Brian Duckworth joins us as a non-executive director
and will bring his significant experience of business in general to
the Board.
It is always gratifying that so many people comment favourably
on the quality and range of our developments, varying as they
do from stylish inner city apartments to refurbished buildings
and from traditional family properties to attractive new design
schemes. There is indeed a home for every type of customer
within our range. As in recent years, Redrow has secured a 
significant number of awards but what is particularly pleasing is
that in addition to this public recognition of the quality of our
homes, many of our customers recommend us to their friends
and relatives or move from one Redrow home to another.
6 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

Lansdowne Gardens, Leckwith, Cardiff 7 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
For the future, our industry is not being permitted 
to build more than three-quarters of the minimum 
number of homes estimated to be necessary as a result 
of demographic change and the deterioration of older 
housing stock. Inevitably therefore, whilst there is 
house-price inflation, affordability remains good as a 
result of low interest rates. On the basis of our belief that 
the housing market remains sound, we can be confident that
Redrow has an excellent future since our high quality products,
low cost current land bank and focused management team are
the very essence of sustainability in our industry.
Robert Jones Chairman

Fedden Village, Portishead, Bristol

Guinea Hall Farm, Southport, Lancashire
Right
The Maltings, Braintree, Essex Our corporate philosophy is to deliver long term sustainable
growth and by so doing deliver value to our Shareholders. The
results for the last twelve months represent our continuing 
commitment to that philosophy. Earnings per share have
increased to 38.5p representing compound growth over the last
five years of 30% p.a. This has been achieved through a 
combination of growth in operating profits which, over that
period, have increased from £35.4m to £94.1m and the 
successful share buy-back effected in October 2000.
Our focus on high quality financial returns is equally reflected
within these results. Return on capital employed, having 
averaged 28% for the last five years, has increased in the current
year to 30% whilst operating margins within the Homes
Division pre-integration costs are at 17.6%. The combination 
of these financial returns represents one of the 
strongest performances within our sector.
Although the trading fundamentals for the U.K. housing market
remain sound, the number of new homes constructed by our
industry is at its lowest level since 1924. This is principally 
due to restrictive planning policies which have constrained the
new homes industry for a number of years. The recent
announcements by the Government to tackle the growing 
housing shortage are to be welcomed. However these
‘announcements’ must be turned into ‘actions’. For the new
homes industry to respond and at the same time address the
issues arising from skilled labour trade shortages, it is important
to embrace ‘new’ construction practices to facilitate increased
output whilst improving build quality and speed. After 
undertaking extensive research and trials we announced in 
July 2002 the formation with Corus plc of a joint venture 
company, Framing Solutions plc.

Redrow’s financial returns represent one of the
strongest within our sector. 9 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Framing Solutions has been funded by an equity 
investment from both parties of up to £3.0m each and 
will harness Corus’ manufacturing skills with Redrow’s
development expertise to provide light steel frames, a viable
and sustainable solution primarily targeted at the U.K. 
residential market.  Initially, light steel frames will be introduced
on selected Harwood and ‘Design Scheme’ developments across
the country.
The last twelve months have been a period of significant
achievement, with Redrow continuing to recognise its
responsibilities to its shareholders, its customers and the 
broader community.

Over the last 20 years, Redrow Homes has been firmly 
established as a major developer of new homes. Our growth and
success have been founded on three core strengths, namely:-
• An excellent management team with a style and culture 
unique to Redrow
•A long term land policy which has delivered a substantial 
low cost land bank 
• An outstanding product portfolio combined with a clear 
focus on customer care
These strengths have historically served the Division well and
will continue to form the basis for continued organic growth.
To expand our opportunities for growth, the decision was taken
during the year to divide the existing operation in the South
East into two separate trading companies, Redrow Homes
(Eastern) and Redrow Homes (South East). The former will
trade from the existing office at Waltham Cross and focus on
the area north of the Thames, whilst the latter has been 
established at a new office at Maidstone with a focus south of
the Thames.
The acquisition of Tay Homes in January 2002 provided an
opportunity to enhance our organic growth. Through the 
acquisition, our land bank was increased by approximately 1,400
plots thereby facilitating an expansion of the Group’s operations
in both Yorkshire and Scotland whilst providing additional
trading outlets within the Midlands. The rebranding of 
developments, together with the replanning of sites where 
appropriate, has been smoothly achieved whilst the retained 
Tay Homes staff have been welcomed into their respective
Redrow teams.
Redrow Homes has again reported record results with turnover
increasing by 21.8% to £506.9m and operating profit by 20% 
to £89.5m. These results were secured from 3,573 legal 
completions, with an average selling price of £141,900, an
18.1% increase on last year, reflecting in part the increased 
contribution from the Southern and Western Regions and from
In the City schemes. 
The legal completion profile of the Heritage, Harwood and 
In the City brands was broadly in balance between the first and
second halves with 1,728 and 1,845 legal completions 
respectively. In addition the Tay Homes’ developments 
delivered a further 335 legal completions in the second half
with an average selling price of £108,100. 11 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 12 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW

During the year Redrow Homes has continued to expand its
market share. Sales reservations have increased by 9.1% in 
volume and by 22.0% in value. As a result, having allowed for
the forward sales within Tay Homes at the time of acquisition,
the Division ended the year with a record forward sales position
of 1,526 units, having a sales value of £218.0m, 23.9% ahead of
the record levels of last year.
Cost pressures within the industry have increased over the last
twelve months. Whilst material price increases have been 
controlled in line with inflation, on-going trade shortages have
resulted in more significant cost increases of between 5% and
10% for some labour trades. In addition, the ever-increasing 
burden of building regulations and the various tax increases
imposed by central Government have together increased the
cost base within our industry.
Operating margins within Redrow Homes were 17.7% as 
compared with 17.9% last year. This reduction was due to the
reduced contribution from the Heritage brand, which derives 
the greatest benefit from the enhanced margins emanating from
land acquired through the forward land bank.
Tay Homes delivered an operating margin of 16.0% largely
reflecting the profitability of the developments at the time of
acquisition.  Subsequently, the adoption of the Redrow product
portfolio combined with identified cost savings will bring the
operating margin more in line with Redrow Homes.
I referred last year to ‘the Redrow philosophy of “in-house expertise”
with the formation of a centralised Health and Safety Function’.
The development of this corporate responsibility has been, and
will continue to be, an integral part of our management culture
with all health and safety issues considered and controlled on a
more cohesive basis. During the year, this philosophy has been
extended to the creation of a centralised Research and
Development team. This team is charged with identifying 
and evaluating new construction techniques and products.  
It has also been instrumental in the co-ordination and 
reassessment of previously undertaken research and the 
management of further tests which resulted in the decision 
to form the joint venture company, Framing Solutions. 13 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
REGIONAL 
PERFORMANCE 
The Northern Region delivered 1,621 legal completions, as
compared with 1,695 in the previous year, representing 45.4% of
the Redrow Homes completions. The average selling price
increased by 14.9% to £122,900 to yield an overall increase in
turnover of 9.8%. In addition 267 legal completions were
secured from the Tay Homes’ developments at an average selling
price of £94,100.
The Southern Region achieved 1,050 legal completions, an
increase on the previous year of 7.4% and representing 29.4% of
the total completions of Redrow Homes.  The average selling
price increased by 19.7% to £171,300 to give an overall increase
in turnover of 28.5%. A further 68 legal completions were
secured from the Tay Homes’ developments at an average selling
price of £163,000.  
The Western Region continued to make significant progress
with legal completions increasing by 14.2% to 902 units and the
average selling price by 17.8% to £141,500. As a result, 
turnover increased by 34.5% to £127.6m.

The Maltings, Braintree, Essex
Far right
Brindley Point, Birmingham City Centre The last twelve months have witnessed the continuing 
development of the Redrow portfolio. The decision to allow
each subsidiary company full access to the Heritage, Harwood,
Renaissance and In the City brands has been a major factor in the
continuing development of the Homes Division and has greatly
extended the product offering within each subsidiary company.
Our ability to offer our customers a variety of choice both in
terms of product and lifestyle has been, and will continue to be,
a major factor in their decision to acquire a new Redrow home
and is the cornerstone of our recently launched advertising 
campaign on digital TV.
Our recognition of increasing customer expectations and 
changing lifestyles resulted in the introduction of the new
Sapphire and Emerald specifications for the Heritage Range,
which last year represented 67% of our legal completions and
had an average selling price of £152,400. The importance of
individual customer lifestyles is further recognised through our
highly successful ‘Design Schemes’ which create community
environments whilst embracing current planning criteria.
Over the last two years the Harwood brand has been extended
from its origins in the North West and the West Midlands to
represent an increasingly significant element of the Division’s
portfolio in Scotland, Yorkshire, South West and South Wales.
These stylish and contemporary homes, which had an average 
selling price in the year of £81,800, now account for 20% of
legal completions.  Further, as the majority of the Tay Homes’
developments in Yorkshire and Scotland were more suited to the
Harwood Range, it is anticipated that its contribution will
increase significantly in the new financial year.
Within Heritage and Harwood, Renaissance represents a further
opportunity for customer choice through the careful restoration
of historic buildings. In addition many refurbishment schemes
provide major opportunities for new build development. 
A prime example is the former Victorian hospital at Pen-y-Fal,
Abergavenny. This historic building has been refurbished to 
provide 63 luxury apartments complemented by a Heritage
development of 110 apartments and houses within the grounds.
In the City developments contributed 13% of legal 
completions, with an average selling price in the year of
£181,100. The schemes at ‘51˚02’ in Bristol, Rigarossa in
Cardiff, Brindley Point in Birmingham and Park Wharf in
Nottingham are now complete. Odyssey in London and
Whitworthwest in Manchester continue to progress successfully
and in the new financial year will be complemented by 
additional developments, Jupiter in Birmingham and Velocity 
in Leeds.

One of the fundamental strengths of Redrow remains its long
term land policy which has delivered a substantial low cost 
land bank.
Over the last twelve months, the current land bank has
increased substantially from 14,300 plots to 15,600 plots 
representing, on an historic basis, a four year land supply.  
As a result of significant planning successes during the year,
13,400 of these plots have the benefit of a planning consent, an
increase on the previous year of 2,100 plots. The balance are
held under contract awaiting, in the vast majority of cases, the
grant of a satisfactory planning consent.
During the year, the Homes Division acquired 6,000 plots for a
total consideration of £136.3m, representing an average plot
cost of £22,700. This included the 1,400 plots secured on the
acquisition of Tay Homes.  At the financial year end, the 
average plot cost has increased marginally from £20,900 to
£21,200, but expressed as a percentage of annual historic sales
price, continues to reflect its downward trend, reducing from
18.5% in 1998 to 15.3% for the current year. The quality of the
current land bank provides inherent support to the Homes
Division in delivering future sustainable profitability.

process following the publication of the Planning 
Green Papers in November 2001, and more recently
through the Ministerial reshuffle, forward land has 
contributed 1,150 plots to the current land bank during 
the year. At the year end the forward land bank stood at 
approximately 25,000 plots but of particular significance
is the number of plots allocated in either draft or adopted local
plans. Despite the contribution to the current land bank during
the year, these allocations have been maintained at over 8,000
plots, representing in excess of 30% of the forward land bank.
These allocations include 750 plots at Bracknell where we have
recently secured planning consent subject to the completion of  
a planning gain agreement. This major development in a 
strategically important location will provide a backbone for 
Redrow Homes (Southern) for a considerable number of years.

Right
The Willow/Hornbeam housetype combination from the
Harwood Range The results for Redrow Commercial reflect a turnover of £30.2m
and an operating profit of £3.1m. These results were secured
from the investment sale of the 138,500 sq. ft. office 
development at Windsor Office Park, fully let to Centrica plc,
the investment sale of the 26,000 sq. ft. office and 6,000 sq. ft.
trade warehouse at Altrincham, Manchester, fully let to ICI plc,
and the freehold sale of the 8,000 sq. ft. office development at
Wakefield to ICM Computer Group plc. These sales secured the
appropriate level of profitability within Redrow Commercial 
and provided the finance to enable the Group to acquire 
Tay Homes without any significant increase in gearing.
In last year’s review, I detailed the changes within the 
management team enabling the structure within Redrow
Commercial to mirror that of the Homes Division. These
changes have given the Group the ability to focus successfully
on mixed use developments. In addition, the extensive project
management skills within Redrow Commercial have been 
harnessed to provide the appropriate controls on all In the City
schemes undertaken throughout the Group.  
Buckshaw Village in Chorley, Lancashire, exemplifies the 
success of the Group’s mixed use philosophy.  During the year
the extensive remediation works to the initial phase have been
completed, and detailed planning consent secured for the major
infrastructure works together with the first phase of the 
commercial development. In March 2002 development of this
400 acre mixed use scheme commenced on site and has already
generated significant commercial interest.
Our mixed use philosophy has also proved successful at
Whitworthwest in Manchester. The ground floor retail space
within this highly successful 224 residential apartment scheme
has been pre-let to Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Ltd and, subject to
market conditions at the time, the resulting investment will be
marketed for sale during the new financial year.

The new structure within Redrow Commercial 
provides the Group with the ability to focus  
successfully on mixed use developments. I reported last year the land sale at Western Approach,
Severnside to Next plc for a 100,000 sq. ft. distribution 
facility.  This facility is now construction complete and the
activity on site has resulted in an increase in enquiries and 
in particular a pre-let to MacFarlane Group U.K. Ltd for a
51,000 sq. ft. distribution warehouse. In addition, a funding
agreement has been completed for the sale of this investment
upon practical completion. To complement this development, 
a further 51,000 sq. ft. distribution warehouse will be 
constructed on a speculative basis.
At St. David’s Park, the 27,000 sq. ft. speculative office 
development, ‘Optima’, is nearing completion and enquiry 
levels are encouraging.

One of the core strengths of the Group remains the ‘Redrow
Team’. The importance of that team can never be overstated.
Our continuing growth, combined with the increasing 
complexity of our industry, means that Redrow must be 
recognised as ‘an employer of choice’ so as to be able to 
attract the highest calibre of employee, whether they be craft 
apprentices and graduates commencing their careers within our
industry or more experienced staff.
To achieve that objective we must work to enhance the image
of our industry within the community in addition to providing
the appropriate support and training for our staff.  Last year we
announced the launch of the ‘Curriculum Resource Pack’. This
is now freely available to all primary schools in the U.K. and
seeks to promote a better understanding of the development
process, building upon the National Curriculum. Recently we
have launched a new initiative with the National Trust to bring
together children from contrasting backgrounds at selected
National Trust properties to enhance their experiences and to
promote a better understanding of the role of their communities.
Within the Group the focus remains on providing 
comprehensive training initiatives. Programmes have been
specifically designed for craft apprentices and graduates and to
assist our staff at all levels in gaining professional qualifications
and enhancing their management skills.
Redrow remains a committed member of Business in the
Community, an organisation which seeks to link the corporate
sector with the community. Through this organisation Redrow
employees continue to participate in a number of important 
initiatives so promoting a better understanding of our industry.

THE REDROW TEAM. . . THE COMMUNITY . . .
Redrow remains a committed member of Business
in the Community, an organisation which seeks
to link the corporate sector with the community. Redrow has entered the new financial year in 
excellent health.  The Homes Division enjoys 
record forward sales and an inherently profitable 
land bank together with a product portfolio that 
recognises the needs and aspirations of our customers.  
Redrow Commercial has established a development 
programme harnessing the combined residential and 
commercial skills within the Group to maximise the value 
from mixed use schemes. Further, the utilisation of the 
project management expertise on all residential city centre 
developments provides the Group with an enhanced level 
of control.
Accordingly, barring the impact of factors totally outside the
control of the Group, Redrow can look forward with confidence
to maintaining its record of delivering long term sustainable
growth and by so doing deliver value to our Shareholders.

The financial statements for the year ended June 2002 and the

with applicable accounting standards.
The accounts continue to reflect the adoption of the 
transitional rules of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17
in respect of Retirement Benefits as well as for the first time
FRS 19 “Accounting for Deferred Taxation”.
FRS 17 has no effect on the results for the year and the 
disclosures required by FRS 17 are included under Note 7 to the
accounts. The implementation of FRS 19 has resulted in the
restatement of the prior year profit and loss account through an
increase in the tax charge of £2.6m. The Five year summary on
page 27 has been restated to reflect FRS 19 and the effect 
of FRS 19 on the current year is to increase the tax charge 
by £0.3m.
Acquisition of Tay Homes Plc
The acquisition of Tay Homes plc (Tay Homes) was completed
on 9 January 2002 for a total consideration of £30.6m.  
The Tay Homes net assets acquired have been reviewed and fair
value adjustments have been made that are set out in Note 9 to
the accounts. Overall, the book value of the net assets acquired
totalling £33.1m was reduced by £2.5m to the fair value of
£30.6m equalling the total consideration. Consequently there
was no goodwill arising on the acquisition of Tay Homes.
The results for the year include post acquisition trading of Tay
Homes for six months. During that period 335 homes were
legally completed at an average selling price of £108,100 
generating turnover of £36.2m and operating profits of £5.8m.  
Non-recurring costs of £4.3m associated with the integration of
Tay Homes have been charged. These include redundancy 
costs and costs associated with the disposal of certain surplus
leasehold properties following rationalisation of offices. Synergy
benefits arising from the rationalisation of the regional office
structure and closure of the Tay Head Office result in savings of
£5.0m per annum.
22 FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW
FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW
Neil Fitzsimmons Finance Director  Trading
This was another year of growth with turnover increasing by
36.1% to £573.3m. Homes Division turnover was £543.1m
including £36.2m relating to the trading of Tay Homes. The
increase in turnover, excluding the contribution of Tay Homes,
was 27.5% equating to £115.9m of which £90.7m related to the
Homes Division, an increase of 21.8%. The Commercial
Division increased its turnover by £25.9m to £30.2m primarily
reflecting the disposal of developments at Windsor and
Altrincham during the first half of the financial year.
The Homes Division legally completed 3,908 units in the year
including the 335 in respect of Tay Homes, an increase of
12.9%.  Redrow Homes legally completed 3,573 units, an
improvement of 3.2% on last year. The average selling price for
the Homes Division increased by 15.6% to £139,000. Within
Redrow Homes, the average selling price was up 18.1% to
£141,900 with the Tay Homes average selling price at £108,100.
The higher average selling price in Redrow Homes partly
reflects the higher proportion of units in the Southern and
Western Regions as well as the increase in number of In the City
units. These increased from 168 to 464 representing 13% of
legal completions (2001: 5%) with the average selling price
increasing from £111,700 to £181,100 and turnover increasing
to £84.0m. The selling price increase reflected the legal 
completion in the previous year of social housing units at the
Odyssey development in London Docklands. As the number
of properties from In the City schemes increased, the number 
of legal completions from the Heritage brand reduced to 
2,386 (2001: 2,600) representing 67% of the Redrow Homes
total. The average selling price for Heritage increased by 
13.7% to £152,400 (2001: £134,000) so that turnover from the 
Heritage brand was up by 4% to £363.6m. The number of 
legal completions for the Harwood brand increased by 4% to 
723 representing 20% of legal completions in Redrow Homes.
The average selling price for the brand increased by 15.9% to
£81,800 (2001: £70,600) so that turnover from the Harwood
brand was up by 20% to £59.1m.
Operating profits increased by 18.4% to £94.1m (2001: £79.5m).
The operating profits before the non-recurring integration costs
of £4.3m increased by £18.9m equivalent to 23.8%. Redrow
Homes significantly improved operating profits by 20.0% to
£89.5m with Tay Homes contributing £5.8m prior to integration
costs. The Commercial Division also increased operating profits
from £1.8m to £3.1m. The prior year operating profits included
£1.7m from the finalisation of the Park Heights development in
Jersey as well as a profit of £1.4m on the sale of listed investments.
The operating margin for the Homes operations prior to the
exceptional costs were 17.6%. The Redrow operations achieved
an operating margin for the year of 17.7% as compared with
17.9% in the previous year.   
Capital employed
Return on capital employed remains a key performance 
indicator in the management of the Group. Capital employed
increased by £32.4m to £331.7m as at June 2002 of which
£317.8m related to the Homes Division (2001: £268.6m) and
£13.9m related to the Commercial Division (2001: £30.7m).  In
the year to June 2002, the average capital employed being the
average of the opening and closing Shareholders’ funds adjusting
for net cash and borrowings was £315.5m. The inherent 
profitability of the Group’s operations has resulted in the return
on capital employed increasing to 30% and averaging 28% over
the last four years.
In the Homes Division, the increase of £49.2m in capital
employed primarily reflected the higher investment in both land
held for development and work-in-progress of £51.6m and
£46.9m respectively. These were offset by increases in land 
creditors of £31.2m and other capital employed of £18.1m.  
23 FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW 24 FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW
The higher investment in land reflected the land bank with
planning in the Homes Division increasing from 11,300 to
13,400 plots. The average plot cost remained virtually
unchanged at £21,200 (2001: £20,900). Whilst there are also
extensive forward land interests over some 25,000 plots, the
Group considers it prudent to write off all costs incurred in 
connection with this forward land with costs only being written
back when planning is secured and the land is acquired.  
The investment in work-in-progress on the In the City schemes
remained at similar levels to the end of last year. The increase in
work-in-progress includes the impact relating to the Tay Homes’
sites. Part exchange stocks at the year end had a book value of
£2.0m (2001: £3.0m) representing only 14 properties as the
Group continues to use this sales incentive on a selective basis.
The increase in land held for development and work-in-progress
has been partly funded by an increase in land creditors. These
increased from £35.7m up to £66.9m with the amount payable
after more than one year increasing from £11.1m to £25.9m.
The land creditors are either secured by way of legal charge 
over the land to which they relate or supported by financial
guarantees provided by the Group’s sureties.
The reduction of capital employed of £16.8m during the year for
the Commercial Division reflected the disposal of completed
developments at Windsor, Altrincham and Wakefield.
Investment in the Division is now primarily focused on 
mixed use schemes with on-going projects at Buckshaw Village,
St David’s Park, and Western Approach, as well as a further
phase at Altrincham.
Cash flow and interest charges
During the year net borrowing reduced from £112.2m to
£93.1m.  Cash flow generated from operations was £104.6m.
The reduction in net borrowing of £19.1m was achieved after
paying £30.6m relating to the acquisition of Tay Homes and
assuming debt on the acquisition of £12.9m. The net borrowings
represented 39% of Shareholders’ funds as at 30 June 2002, a
significant reduction from the 60% as at June 2001. The net
borrowing at 30 June 2002 is more than twice covered by 
the value of the Group’s forward sales in the Homes Division 
of £218m.
Interest is written off as incurred. Finance costs in the year were
£9.0m (2001: £7.4m) and the charge was 10.5 times covered by
operating profits.
Profit before tax, earnings per share and dividends
The Group increased its profit before tax by 18.0% to £85.1m
having charged £4.3m relating to the integration of Tay Homes.
The Group’s effective tax rate after taking into account the
effects of FRS 19 is 28.5% as compared with 30.0% restated for
last year.  It is anticipated that the effective rate will 
approximate to a standard rate in the new financial year.
Basic earnings per share increased by 33.7% to 38.5p per share
(2001: restated 28.8p). The increase reflected not only the
20.4% increase in earnings but also the change in the capital
structure of the Company resulting from the share buy-back of
30% of the issued share capital in October 2000 which resulted
in the weighted number of shares in issue reducing to 158.1m
(2001: 175.5m). The increase in earnings per share pre the Tay
Homes integration costs was 40.3%.
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on
4 November 2002, a final dividend of 4.04p per share
(2001: 3.67p) will be paid on 22 November 2002. The full year 
dividend will be 6.06p (2001: 5.50p), which is 6.4 times covered
by the basic earnings (2001: 5.2 times). This dividend will 
represent an increase of 10.2% and maintains our progressive
dividend policy that has seen the dividend increase by a 
compound rate of 10% per annum since flotation in 1994.     25 FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW
Treasury
Redrow plc arranges all banking and surety facilities on behalf of
the Group.  Each operating company in the Group has a bank
account managed within an overall offset arrangement.
Arrangements are made by Redrow plc to borrow or invest the
net funds at competitive rates.  Close relationships are 
maintained with the Group’s bankers and sureties with regular
updates provided to both groups in respect of current trading
and the financial position of the Group.
Following the share buy-back in October 2000, the Group
entered into a three year Syndicated Loan to provide a
long-term facility for core borrowing with additional bilateral
facilities being separately negotiated.  As at June 2002, the
Group had total borrowing facilities of £200m as compared with
net borrowing at £93.1m.  These facilities included £110m
under the Syndicated Loan that was due to expire in September
2003.  The Group also had bilateral facilities of £90m.
On 9 August 2002, Redrow plc entered into a Supplemental
Agreement under which the Syndicated Loan was increased to
£180m and the period of the loan was extended until 9 August
2007.  This provides Redrow plc with a five-year committed
facility for core borrowing requirements.  On completion of the
Supplemental Agreement the bilateral facilities reduced to
£70m to give total facilities of £250m that are all unsecured.
Interest rates on borrowings are linked either to LIBOR in
respect of money market borrowings or base rate in respect of
overdrafts.  
The Main Board agrees the strategy with regard to interest rate
and foreign currency rate derivatives. The Group also monitors
its interest rate exposure in relation to current and forecast 
conditions.  In September 2000, the Group put in place an
interest rate cap at 7.5% on £100m of debt for a period of three
years so as to limit exposure to any significant increase in 
interest rates.  It also entered into other interest rate swaps in
respect of £75m of debt to manage the interest cost. The Group
operates entirely within the U.K. and has no material exposure
to movements in foreign currency rates.
In addition, the Group has £67.0m of bonding and financial
guarantee facilities provided by its sureties of which £38.7m
were utilised as at June 2002.  The Group also has bonding 
facilities made available through the National House Building
Council.
Pensions
The Group believes that the provision of pension benefits is an
important benefit for all employees.  Following a review of the
costs associated with the provision of defined benefits on an 
on-going basis in the light of changes in taxation of pension
schemes, investment performance and changes in mortality
rates, the Group decided to close this section of the pension
scheme as from 1 October 2001 to new members except existing
employees below the age of 21 and any new employees as 
determined by the Company.  At the same time a new 
defined contribution section of the scheme was set up for 
new employees.
With effect from 1 July 2001, the Company increased its 
contribution rate in respect of the defined benefits section of
the scheme by 2% to 12% with members increasing their 
contributions by 1% to 6% of pensionable salary as from 
1 July 2002.  Under the defined contribution section of the
scheme, monthly paid members contribute 5% with the
Company contributing between 5% and 12.5% of pensionable
salary depending on the age of the employee.  Weekly paid
members contribute 3% with the Company contributing 3%. The disclosures required under the transitional provisions of
FRS 17 are set out in Note 7 to the accounts. However, in 
summary as at June 2002, the market value of the scheme’s
assets were £26.6m as compared with the present value of 
liabilities of £28.9m resulting in a net pension deficit in the
scheme as calculated in accordance with FRS 17 after taking
into account the related deferred tax asset of £1.6m.  It should
be recognised that the method for calculating the net pension
deficit under FRS 17 may lead to volatility in the calculation
and therefore the amount that would be included in the balance
sheet. This volatility relates both to the market value of 
long-term AA bond yields used in calculating pension liabilities
under FRS 17 and market movements in the value of equities
which represent the principal constituent of the scheme’s assets.   
Information technology
Redrow has continued to progress the in-house development of
information technology systems with improvements made to the
Direct Cost Control system. Electronic communication of orders
and invoicing with key suppliers has been further developed and
Redrow continues to play a leading role in eBuild-XML, a 
project to establish the industry standards for electronic trading.
During the year, the new Sales and Build Management System
commenced development and is now on test on three sites 
within the Group. The new system encompasses IT at point 
of sale, a new legal conveyancing package and improved 
information on both sales and construction to enhance the 
buying experience for customers.
The Group continues to update and enhance the capabilities of
its web site (www.redrow.co.uk) which provides an important
source of customer enquiries with on average over 12,000 
visitors per week. As well as providing details of development
sites, the web site incorporates information on Redrow
Commercial, land acquisition, employment opportunities and
corporate information.
Outlook
The focus in Redrow remains to deliver consistently high return
on capital employed, sector leading operating margins and 
sustainable and profitable growth and by so doing to deliver
value to our Shareholders. With a record forward sales position
and effective low cost land bank in the Homes Division and an
established development programme in the Commercial
Division together with a strong balance sheet, Redrow continues
to be well placed to meet its objective.

commercial development.
Turnover and profit on ordinary activities before taxation are
stated at £573.3m and £85.1m respectively. After providing for
taxation of £24.3m and paying an interim dividend of £3.2m, the
Directors recommend a final dividend of £6.4m and the transfer
of the balance of £51.2m to reserves.
A detailed review of the Group’s activities during the year and 
of its prospects is contained within the Chairman’s statement,
Chief Executive’s review and Finance Director’s review.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to 
prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the
Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit of the
Group for that period. In preparing the financial statements the
Directors ensure that suitable accounting policies have been used
and applied consistently, that reasonable and prudent judgements
and estimates have been made and that applicable accounting
standards have been followed. The Directors are required to 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. The Directors are responsible for 
maintaining adequate accounting records, and are also 
responsible for taking such steps and instituting and maintaining
such systems and controls as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud
and other irregularities.  
The maintenance and integrity of the Redrow plc website is the
responsibility of the Directors. The work carried out by the
Auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and
accordingly, the Auditors accept no responsibility for any
changes that may have occurred to the financial statements 
since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the U.K. governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation
in other jurisdictions.
Going concern
The Directors have considered the Group’s financial position
and trading prospects and consider they have a reasonable 
expectation for stating that Redrow plc has adequate resources to
continue trading for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.
Substantial shareholding
S P Morgan has a 9.6% beneficial interest in the 
issued ordinary share capital.
P E Morgan has a 4.8% beneficial interest in the

person had, either at 30 June 2002 or 31 August 2002, more
than a 3.0% material interest in the issued ordinary share capital.

Training and career development is available, equally and 
without discrimination, to all levels and categories of staff.
The Group supports the employment of disabled persons 
wherever possible through recruitment and by the retention 
and retraining of those who become disabled during their 
employment.
The Directors recognise the importance of good communications
with employees. Companies within the Group are encouraged to
make their employees aware of the financial and economic 
factors affecting their respective companies and the Group. This
is assisted through the medium of regular management meetings
and staff publications.
Employee share ownership is encouraged through savings related
and other employee share schemes. The Save As You Earn
scheme is administered via a Qualifying Employee Share
Ownership Trust (QUEST).
Creditor payment policy
The Group values its relationship with suppliers and 
sub-contractors.  It is the policy to agree credit terms prior to
commencement of trading. Subject to any items of genuine 
dispute, it is policy to pay creditors within the terms agreed.
At June 2002 the Group had 38 days’ purchases outstanding 
in respect of payments to suppliers and sub-contractors

European Monetary Union (EMU)

continues to monitor the implications of EMU.
Research and Development
The Group has a centralised Research and Development team
charged with identifying and evaluating new construction 
techniques and products.
Environment
Redrow recognises its responsibilities to the community as a
whole and has adopted an environmental strategy which is a
core part of the Group's objectives.
In recognition of the importance of environmental issues,
Redrow has an environmental committee under the
Chairmanship of Robert Jones to oversee this aspect of the
Group's activities. 
Redrow has documented its environmental strategy within
‘Developing a better future’ which is published on the Group’s
website. The principal elements of the strategy are as follows: 
The Group is committed to meeting the challenges set by the
Government on the use of brownfield land and the regeneration
of derelict sites. Approximately 69% of the land bank at June
2002 was brownfield land. Redrow works with the appropriate
regulatory organisations to ensure all contaminated land is 
carefully researched and remediation undertaken in accordance
with regulatory requirements.
Redrow seeks to preserve and create features to maintain natural
habitats for wildlife. This has been recognised by the Group 
31 DIRECTORS’ REPORT winning 30 Daily Mail “Green Leaf” Awards specifically for 
environmental quality in the last three years.
Redrow pursues imaginative waste management schemes. It is
committed to re-using surplus materials on site, to reduce 
transportation whilst eliminating the environmental impact of
disposal of these materials.
Energy efficiency is important in our homes and often industry
standards are exceeded. Where possible, products and materials
are specified which generate the least environmental impact.
This includes the use of timber from managed plantations and
the use of non-toxic paints. Redrow seeks to partner with 
suppliers and sub-contractors who have their own environmental
codes of practice. 
Recognising the Group's commitment to sustainability, changing
lifestyles and researching environmentally friendly new 
technologies, Redrow made a significant investment in the
“House for the Future” project with the National Museum and 
Galleries of Wales.
Notice of Annual General Meeting
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint the auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration Committee Report
In line with best practice, a resolution to receive and adopt the
Remuneration Committee report will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting.
Share Capital
Resolutions 10, 11 and 12 set out in the Notice of Annual 
General Meeting on pages 56 and 57 concern the Company’s
share capital.
Resolution 10 – authority to allot shares
Under the Companies Act 1985, the Directors of the Company
may only allot unissued shares if authorised to do so by the
Shareholders in a General Meeting.  Resolution 10 renews the
Directors’ existing authority by authorising the Directors to allot
shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £5,582,312 which
such authority shall expire on the date of the next Annual
General Meeting of the Company.  This represents 55,823,120
ordinary shares of 10p each and is equivalent to approximately
35% of the Company’s current issued ordinary share capital.
Except in relation to the issue of ordinary shares arising from the
exercise of options under the Company’s employee share option
schemes, the Directors have no present intention of issuing any
of the authorised but unissued ordinary shares of the Company.
Resolution 11 – limited authority to allot shares for cash
The Directors may only allot shares for cash to persons who are
not already Shareholders in the Company if authorised to do so
by the Shareholders in a General Meeting.  This resolution
renews authority for the Directors to allot shares for cash without
first offering them to existing members up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £791,855.  This sum represents 7,918,550
ordinary shares of 10p each, being equivalent to approximately
5% of the Company’s current issued ordinary share capital.
The resolution also enables the Directors to modify the strict
requirements for a rights issue in circumstances where they 
consider it necessary or expedient.
The authority will expire on whichever is the earlier of 
the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or 
4 February 2004.
Resolution 12 – purchase of the Company’s own shares
This resolution seeks authority from Shareholders for the
Company to purchase up to 15,837,103 ordinary shares, an
aggregate nominal amount of £1,583,710, which is equivalent to
approximately 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital at 30 June 2002.  The authority will expire at the end of
next year’s Annual General Meeting and the resolution specifies
the maximum and minimum prices at which the shares may be
bought.  Other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing
levels and the overall financial position of the Company will be
taken into account before deciding upon this course of action.
Any shares purchased in this way will be cancelled and the 
number of shares in issue will accordingly be reduced. The
Directors have no immediate intention of exercising the 
proposed authority when it becomes effective, but believe that
the ability of the Company to buy its own shares if, in the
Directors’ opinion, market prices do not reflect the Company’s
worth, will be in the best interests of the Company and its 
Shareholders. The Directors intend to exercise this power only 
if they believe the effect of such purchases will increase earnings
per ordinary share. The authority will expire on whichever is the
earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or
4 February 2004.

32 DIRECTORS’ REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
33 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Combined Code
The Board of Redrow plc is committed to high standards of 
corporate governance and has considered the requirements of
the Combined Code adopted by the Stock Exchange.
The Directors confirm that, with the exception set out below,
the Group has complied with Section 1 throughout the year
ended 30 June 2002.
Under provision B.1.6, the deferred element of the Redrow Long
Term Share Incentive Plan (LTSIP), which was in operation
from July 1996 to June 2000, vests in the participants in under
three years. This was considered justified having regard to the
total executive remuneration package during that time. An
amendment was made to the Redrow LTSIP following the
Annual General Meeting on 13 October 2000 such that options
awarded to Directors in respect of years after June 2000 do not
vest in the participants for a period of three years.  Details are
set out in the Remuneration report on page 35.
Under provision D.2.1 of the Combined Code, the Company is
required to report on internal control. The Company’s report on
internal control can be found on page 34 within this Corporate
governance statement.
Board and committees
The Board of Redrow plc comprises of six Executive and four
Non-Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors comprise not
less than one third of the Board and all Non-Executive Directors
are considered to be independent. The Board is responsible to
Shareholders for the management of the Company and for the
protection of its assets. The Board meets regularly on a formal
basis and not less than ten times a year.
A formal schedule of matters is reserved for the Board including
authorisation of major land acquisitions and contracts, approval
of budgets and accounts and monitoring of business performance.
Strategy on interest rate and currency exposures is also reserved
for the Board.
R B Jones is the Non-Executive Chairman and P L Pedley is the
Chief Executive. The Senior Non-Executive Director is J Martin
who was re-appointed as the Senior Non-Executive Director on 
26 February 2002.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary and the Board acknowledges that in 
certain circumstances individual Directors may wish to take
independent professional advice in connection with their duties.
The Company will meet the reasonable expenses incurred in 
this regard.
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to committees,
the members of which are as follows and each comprises entirely
of Non-Executive Directors.
Audit Committee
R G Williams (Chairman)
R B Jones
J Martin
B Duckworth
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include the
appointment of and liaison with External Auditors, the review 
of annual and interim financial statements, the review of the
statement on internal control and consideration of any major
findings of internal investigations.
The Committee meets with the External Auditors four times a
year to discuss the interim accounts and the Annual Report and
Accounts as well as internal control including the work of
Internal Audit, risk assessment and other issues within the
Group.
PricewaterhouseCoopers were appointed auditors in 1987 and
the current audit partner was appointed in 1999. 
The fees relating to non-audit services provided by
PricewaterhouseCoopers are disclosed in Note 2 to the
Accounts, summarised according to different types of work
undertaken and are less than £0.1m. The main area of non-audit
work relates to advice provided to the Company in connection
with the operation and valuation of the pension scheme. The
Audit Committee has reviewed the level of non-audit work
undertaken and has concluded this level of fee does not affect
the independence of the Audit. Future appointments in respect
of non-audit work will be approved by the Audit Committee.

B Duckworth 34 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The Environmental Committee oversees not only environmental
issues relating to Redrow plc but also community and ethical
issues. During the year, the Committee reviewed and approved
the “Corporate Social Responsibility Charter” adopted in March
2002 which is summarised below and “Developing a better
future” which documents Redrow’s environmental strategy, 
community involvement and role in education. 
Copies of this document are available on the Company’s website
at www.redrow.co.uk.
Corporate responsibility and business ethics
In March 2002, the Board adopted a ‘Corporate Social
Responsibility Charter’.  The Charter provides guidelines 
regarding the Group’s relationships with employees, 
customers, suppliers and shareholders as well as its involvement
in community and environmental issues.  The main features of
the Charter are as follows:
Employees
• Clear and fair terms of employment through a letter of 
appointment and Staff Handbook with maximum 
standard hours of work and fixed holiday entitlements.  
All employees over the age of 18 are entitled to join the
pension scheme and private medical insurance is 
available to all monthly paid staff.
•A commitment to equal opportunities for and 
prevention of harassment of all staff with a clearly 
defined grievance procedure.  
•All staff are appraised annually which includes the 
setting of future performance goals. Opportunities are 
provided through in-house training and external 
courses for employees to develop their skills. 
•A Health & Safety policy relating to operations on 
development sites and within offices communicated to 
all employees endorsed by the Executive Directors and 
supported by a dedicated in-house Health & Safety 
department that reports monthly directly to the Board.
Customers
•A reservation process that sets out the relationship with 
the customer and the requirements placed on the 
customer during the transaction.
• Provision of a comprehensive customer care service post 
completion in addition to the NHBC or similarly 
recognised 10-year warranty.
• Post completion surveys of customers to identify issues 
and opinions in relation to the buying experience and 
product.
Suppliers
• Clearly defined orders setting out the terms and 
conditions of business with payments made in 
accordance with those terms and conditions.
• Buying procedures including requirements regarding 
ethical relationships with suppliers.
• Regular surveys of key suppliers regarding the 
relationship with each relevant business unit within the 
Group.
Community and Environment
•A policy of involvement in communities in areas of 
operation with a focus on promotion to children of 
safety awareness.
• Adoption of an environmental strategy that is a core 
part of Group objectives with a focus on use of 
brownfield land, waste management and energy 
efficiency.
• Support for the link between the corporate sector and 
the community via membership of “Business in the 
Community”.
Shareholders
•A policy of meetings with major Shareholders and an 
opportunity for all Shareholders to put questions to the 
Directors at the Annual General Meeting.
• Clearly set out internal control procedures summarised 
in the Annual Report to provide reasonable assurance 
against misstatement or loss.
Internal control
The Board of Directors recognises its overall responsibility for
the Group’s systems of internal control and for monitoring their
effectiveness. However, in reviewing the effectiveness of internal
control, such systems can only provide reasonable but not
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Key business activities including land acquisition, product
design, specification and procurement and information 
technology are controlled by the Executive Directors. All
activity is organised within a defined structure with formal 
lines of responsibility, designated authority levels and a 
structured reporting framework.
The Board has reviewed its operations and has identified risk
areas which have been assessed for their potential impact and
internal controls in relation to those risks have been identified.
The Executive Directors through quarterly meetings review the 
areas of risk on an on-going basis and consider whether the
internal controls identified in relation to those risks are 
appropriate. This procedure also takes place at Regional Board
Meetings on a quarterly basis. The Audit Committee also
reviews its assessment of risk at twice yearly meetings. The key
features of the Group’s internal controls are as follows:
•A Policy and Procedures Manual covers all the 
significant aspects of the Group’s operations and 
describes the systems and controls that are to be applied 
across the whole Group. The Manual is reviewed and 
updated with amendments being signed off by an 
Executive Director. The Board of each trading entity is 
required to formally confirm on an annual basis that 
they have complied in all material respects with these 
procedures.
• Defined authorisation levels established over key areas 
such as land purchase and the placing of orders and 
contracts.
•A formalised reporting structure which includes the 
setting of annual budgets with updated forecasts during 
the year which are considered at both Regional and 
Group Board level. In addition, each trading entity has a
monthly Board meeting at which all key aspects of the 
business are discussed including comparison of actual 
performance with budgets and updated forecasts.
• The Group’s systems provide weekly updates on key 
statistics in relation to sales and production. In addition,
daily statements of a reconciled cash position identifying
significant payments are prepared.
• On an annual basis, each trading entity is required to 
prepare a strategic plan which covers key aspects of the 
operation and identifies medium term objectives and 
areas of risk to the business.
In addition to the above, the Group has an Internal Audit 
function which has direct reporting to the Audit Committee.
The annual work programme of Internal Audit is approved in
advance by the Audit Committee and commented upon by the
External Auditors. The Internal Audit function updates the
Audit Committee on its work at each meeting. All reports are
distributed to the Group Board as well as to the External
Auditors. 35 REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION REPORT
Remuneration Committee and policy
The responsibilities and composition of the Committee are set out
in the Corporate governance statement on page 33.
The Committee considers that in framing its remuneration policy
it has given full consideration to the provisions of Section 1 of the
Combined Code.
The Group provides competitive remuneration packages at all 
levels in order to attract, retain and motivate staff who are 
expected to meet high levels of performance.   
Salaries are reviewed each June and senior employees receive 
further benefits commensurate with their position and the 
employment market.  These include fully expensed cars or cash 
equivalent, private health care, permanent health insurance 
and pension provisions as well as cash and share based incentives.
Further details on remuneration are provided in Note 7 to the
financial statements.
Under the Redrow Long Term Share Incentive Plan (LTSIP) in
operation from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 2000, it is acknowledged
that deferred elements vest in the participants in under three
years. The Remuneration Committee considered this to be 
acceptable in the context of the total remuneration package.
At the Annual General Meeting on 13 October 2000, the LTSIP
was amended such that options over shares granted to the
Executive Directors and senior executives under the LTSIP in
respect of future years do not vest in the participants in under
three years.  
For the year ended 30 June 2002 the basis for issuing options
under the LTSIP for senior managers with shares vesting in 
participants after one year was retained as the scheme was in effect
their annual bonus. With effect from 1 July 2002, the bonus
scheme for senior managers will be entirely cash based.
In accordance with best practice, the Remuneration report will be
put before Shareholders for adoption at the Annual General
Meeting on 4 November 2002.
Service agreements
The Executive Directors and senior executives have service 
agreements which may be terminated by either party giving 
formal notice of six months and three months respectively. The
agreements do not include provision for pre-determined 
compensation for early termination and mitigation will be applied
to any compensation payments where considered justified by the
Committee due to poor performance.
Executive incentive schemes
On 17 November 1995, the Annual General Meeting approved
the LTSIP which was in operation for the years ended June 1996
to June 2000.
Under this LTSIP , Executive Directors, senior executives and 
senior managers earned performance related bonuses in Redrow
shares. The initial share bonuses awarded in the form of options
have a value of up to 25% of salary subject to seniority and 
performance. 
For years ended 30 June 1997 onwards, the shares are held in trust
for a minimum period of one year and thereafter can vest in the 
participants.  However, they may decide to leave the shares in the
trust which will earn additional incentive shares.  The value of the
incentive shares will depend on the value of the initial share
bonus, seniority and the period of time held in trust.  As a result,
the value of the initial share bonus could be increased between
25% and 100% after a further three years service.  For Executive
Directors, the value of the initial share bonuses could increase by
166% over a five year period. 
A revision to the LTSIP was approved at the Annual General
Meeting on 13 October 2000.
Under the current bonus arrangements, the Executive Directors
and senior executives in the Group are able to earn a bonus of up
to 70% of salary based on performance during the year.
Performance is measured against pre-determined targets based on
either Group performance or the performance of specific business
units as appropriate and the targets relate to profitability, return on
capital, land procurement and sales performance as well as other
specific targets as determined by the Non-Executive Directors in
relation to business objectives. A cash element is payable of up to
40% of salary dependent upon seniority and performance and is
payable in September following each financial year end. The 
balance of the bonus will be awarded as options over shares which
will be held in trust for a period of three years.  
These shares will only vest in the participant if they are still
employed by the Group at that date subject to certain specified
circumstances.
In addition, Executive Directors and certain senior executives are
entitled to receive additional incentive shares depending on the
financial performance of the Group over a three year period.  If
the average annual compound growth rate in earnings per share
over the three year period exceeds 10%, the number of initial
shares awarded will be increased by one third.  If the growth rate is
more than 15%, the number of initial shares will be increased by
two thirds.  If the growth rate is more than 20%, the number of
initial shares will be doubled.
The Remuneration Committee sets annual objectives for the
Executive team and individual Executive Directors. These 
objectives are considered as part of the executive’s annual 
appraisal either with the Chief Executive or the Chairman as
appropriate.
Further details on share options are provided in Note 7 to the
financial statements. 
An additional incentive scheme for key executives was approved
at the Annual General Meeting on 5 November 2001. 
Under the scheme, participants are granted a phantom option
over a number of shares at the market value at the date of grant.
At the end of seven years, the participant will be able to exercise
the phantom option in three equal instalments over three years.
The exercise price in respect of each instalment will be the market
value of the shares at the first exercise. The option will only be
exerciseable if the compound growth rate in earnings per share of
the Company has increased by 4.5% over RPI since the date of
grant. The option may be exercised on a change of control of the
Company provided compound growth rate of 4.5% over RPI has
been achieved since the date of grant.  
Save As You Earn
All employees are eligible to participate in the Redrow Sharesave
Scheme under which employees are periodically invited to enter
into a savings contract which, on completion after three, five or
seven years, can be used to exercise share options granted at the
start of the contract. 36 REMUNERATION REPORT

Phantom Share Option Scheme
Under the Phantom Share Option Scheme approved by Shareholders on 5 November 2001, 
N Fitzsimmons, G H Locke, B K Harvey and C E Lewis were each awarded a phantom option over
200,000 shares on 5 November 2001 at 221p.
On 11 July 2002, J F Tutte was awarded a phantom option over 200,000 shares at 248p.
Pension Scheme
The Group believes that the provision of pension benefits is an important benefit for all employees
and membership of the Redrow Staff Pension Scheme is available to all staff over the age of 18.
Following a review of the costs associated with the provision of defined benefits on an on-going
basis in the light of changes in the taxation of pension schemes, investment performance and
changes in mortality rates, the Group decided to close this section of the Scheme as from 
1 October 2001 to new members except existing employees below the age of 21 and any new
employees as determined by the Company.  At the same time a new defined contribution section 
of the Scheme was set up for new employees.
With effect from 1 July 2001, the Group increased its contribution rate in respect of the defined
benefits section of the Scheme by 2% to 12% with employees increasing their contributions by 1%
to 6% of pensionable salary as from 1 July 2002.  The Scheme can enable members to achieve the
maximum pension of two thirds of their calculated final pensionable salary after 40 years’ service.
Benefits only accrue on salary up to the level of the earnings cap.
Under the new defined contribution section of the Scheme, monthly paid employees contribute
5% with the Group contributing between 5% and 12.5% of pensionable salary depending on the
age of the employee.  Weekly paid employees contribute 3% with the Group also paying 3%.
Both sections of the Scheme provide lump sum benefits and the defined benefit section also 
provides dependents’ pension in the event of death in service. Annual bonuses and benefits in kind
are not part of pensionable salary.
All the Executive Directors of the Company are members of the defined benefits section of the
Scheme on the same terms as other members.  As from 11 June 2001, N Fitzsimmons, G H Locke,
B K Harvey and C E Lewis agreed to accrue future pension benefits from the Company based only
on the level of the earnings cap in return for an adjustment in their salary as from 1 July 2001 to
mitigate this change in pension benefit. This amount is disclosed separately within the directors
emoluments on page 38 of this report.
Details of the Executive Director’s pension entitlements are as follows:
The accrued pension shown above is the amount of the pension entitlement that would be paid
each year on retirement at age 65 based on service to the end of the current year.
The transfer value shown above has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance
with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, less Directors’ contributions.

Independent Auditors' report to the members of 
Redrow plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the
consolidated profit and loss account, the Group and Company
balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, the
related notes and details of Directors remuneration reported
within the Remuneration report.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual report
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in
the statement of Directors' responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements,
United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board and the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to
you if, in our opinion, the Directors' report is not consistent
with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept 
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law or the Listing Rules regarding
Directors' remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual report
and consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the financial statements. The other information comprises
only the Directors' report, the Chairman's statement, the 
Chief Executive's review, the Finance Director’s review, the
report of the Remuneration committee and the Corporate
governance statement.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement
reflects the Company's compliance with the seven provisions of
the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing
Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to 
consider whether the Board's statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures or
its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and 
judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Company's circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 
30 June 2002 and of the profit and cash flows of the Group 
for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom.  
A summary of the more important accounting policies is set
out below.
Changes in accounting policies
The Group has adopted FRS19 “Accounting for Deferred
Taxation” in the financial statements. The adoption of this 
new standard represents a change in accounting policy and the
comparative figures have been restated accordingly.  The effect
of this change in accounting policy was to increase tax on profit
on ordinary activities by £0.3m (2001:£2.6m) and to decrease
profit for the financial year by £0.3m (2001:£2.6m).
(a) Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, modified to include the
revaluation of the investment in subsidiary companies.
In accordance with FRS 15 ‘Tangible Fixed Assets’ 
revaluations of freehold properties will not be undertaken 
but, as permitted under the transitional rules, the Group 
will continue to carry certain freehold properties at their
existing revaluations less accumulated depreciation.
(b) Basis of preparation and consolidation
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of Redrow plc and all its subsidiaries for 
the year ended 30 June 2002.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the
year are included from or up to the date of acquisition or
disposal.  On the acquisition of a subsidiary, fair values are 
attributed to the net assets acquired.  Prior to the
introduction for the year ended June 1998 onwards of 
FRS 10 ‘Goodwill and Intangible Assets’, the difference 
between the consideration paid and these values was 
transferred to reserves. Since the introduction of FRS 10, 
the difference is capitalised and amortised.
(c) Turnover and profit recognition
Turnover represents sales of residential housing and 
commercial developments.
Profit is recognised on legal completion.
(d) Interest on borrowings
Interest is written off when incurred.
(e) Fixed assets
(1) Freehold properties are included at cost or valuation 
(as permitted under the transitional provisions of 
FRS 15). The freehold land element is not depreciated 
whilst the buildings element is depreciated on a straight
line basis at an annual rate of 2%.
(2) All other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis 
over their expected useful lives at the following 
principal annual rates:
Fixtures and fittings 20%-35%
Plant and machinery 20%
(3) The investment in subsidiary companies represents the 
book value of the underlying net assets, the surplus or 
deficit arising on the revaluation being transferred to 
non-distributable reserves.  This basis of valuation 
has been adopted so as to present more fairly the 
investment by the Company in these companies.
(f) Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value less cash on account. Cost includes 
materials, labour and sub-contract work.
(g) Forward land
All expenditure relating to forward land, including options, 
fees etc. is provided for when incurred.  After exercise of an 
option and acquisition of the land following the securing of 
planning permission, the provisions relating to that land are 
released.
(h) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences arising 
from the recognition of income and expenditure in different
periods for taxation and accounting purposes where timing 
differences have originated but not reversed by the balance 
sheet date in accordance with FRS19 “Accounting for 
Deferred Taxation”.
Deferred tax is provided at the average tax rates that
are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing 
differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that 
it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be 
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of 
the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities recognised have not been 
discounted.
(i) Pension scheme
The Group operates a contributory pension scheme for all 
its staff. The Scheme comprises two sections: a defined
benefits section and a defined contribution section.The 
Scheme is externally invested and the funds of the Scheme 
are administered by trustees. The Group’s contributions to 
the defined benefits section, which are made in accordance 
with the recommendations of independent actuaries, are 
charged against profits in accordance with Statement of 
Standard Accounting Practice No. 24. Contributions to the
defined contribution section are charged in the year in 
which the contributions are made. Further disclosures 
including those required under FRS 17 transitional rules are
contained within Note 7 to the financial statements.
(j) Operating leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged against 
profit on a straight line basis over the lease term.
(k) Treasury instruments
Hedge accounting principles are applied to these 
instruments and the gains and losses are recognised in 
the profit and loss account within interest cost in the 
period to which they relate.

arising from the running of the Tay office facilities prior to their closure following the 
implementation of the reorganisation plan.
In 2001, net operating expenses of £26.8m comprised administrative expenses of £28.2m and other
operating income of £1.4m in respect of listed investments. A charitable donation of £1.0m was

Note 6.  Earnings per Ordinary Share
The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share of 38.5p (2001: Restated 28.8p) is based on
Group profit on ordinary activities after taxation of £60.8m (2001: Restated £50.5m) and on the
weighted average number of 10p ordinary shares of 158,097,193 (2001: 175,528,157).
The weighted average reflects an adjustment in respect of surplus shares held in trust under the
Redrow Long Term Share Incentive Plan.  Diluted earnings per share has been calculated in 
accordance with FRS 14, based on the weighted average number of 10p ordinary shares of
158,763,954 (2001: 176,526,272).
Adjusted earnings per share before integration costs (net of tax) of 40.4p is calculated based on
earnings of £63.8m and on the weighted average number of shares in issue disclosed above. 
The directors have disclosed the adjusted basic earnings per share before integration costs
(net of tax) to demonstrate the underlying trading performance of the business.

(d) Pension scheme
The Redrow Staff Pension Scheme comprises two sections: a funded, self-administered, defined
benefits section and a funded defined contribution section, both of which are contracted out of the
State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.
As from 1 October 2001, the Group closed the defined benefits section of the Scheme to new
members except existing employees below the age of 21 and any new members as determined by
the Group. At the same time, the defined contribution section of the Scheme was set up for new
employees and also weekly paid staff as part of the Group's implementation of the new Stakeholder
pension requirements.
The pension charge for the year was £2.1m (2001: £2.0m).
During 2002, redundancy costs of £1.0m were incurred following the acquisition of Tay Homes plc
(see Note 9). These are included in the £4.3m integration costs (see Note 1).
A full independent actuarial valuation was last undertaken as at 1 January 2000. The method used
was the Projected Unit Method.
The main assumptions were an investment return of 6.9% per annum compound, salary increase of
6.3% per annum compound, and mortality in accordance with similar schemes. In the opinion of
the Actuary, the Scheme's assets covered the benefit liabilities in accordance with the Scheme's
rules and with a funding level of 150%.
The valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme was updated to June 2002 for FRS 17
purposes by a qualified independent actuary.
The main assumptions used by the actuary in measuring the present value of the Scheme 
liabilities were:
30 June 2002 30 June 2001
Discount rate 5.75% 6.19%
Rate of increase in salaries 5.70% 5.60%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.70% 2.60%

(d) During the year the Group operated within Great Britain. The directors consider that to give full 
particulars of all subsidiary undertakings would lead to a statement of excessive length. The principal 
subsidiary companies are detailed in the Corporate Information on page 58.  All are incorporated in
Great Britain except Redrow Homes (Jersey) Limited which is incorporated in Jersey. A full list of 
subsidiary undertakings as at 30 June 2002 will be appended to the Company’s next annual return. The
capital of all the subsidiary companies, consisting of ordinary shares, is wholly owned.  Redrow Holdings
Ltd, Redrow Corporate Services Ltd and Redrow Group Services Ltd are directly owned by Redrow plc.
(e) Other investments at 30 June 2002 comprised capitalised ground rents.
Note  9.  Acquisitions 
On 9 January 2002 the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of T ay Homes plc (now renamed
Redrow Corporate Services Ltd) for a total consideration of £30.6m. This acquisition has been accounted
for using the acquisition method of accounting. The consolidated profit and loss account of T ay Homes
plc from 1 July 2001, the beginning of its financial year, to the date of acquisition showed a profit after
taxation of £2.0m. The consolidated profit after taxation on ordinary activities for the year ended 
30 June 2001 was £3.2m.
The analysis of net assets acquired and the fair value to the Group is as follows:
The book value of the assets and liabilities shown above has been taken from the consolidated
management accounts of Tay Homes plc at the date of acquisition.
The other adjustments represent: 
the restatement of land to its estimated market value
the write down of work in progress to an assessment of its net realisable value
the assessment of further costs in relation to completed sites
The accounting policy alignment relates to a provision against option and pre-development costs
which were included within work in progress by Tay Homes plc and which is not in accordance
with the accounting policies of the Group.
The taxation adjustment relates to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of the fair 
value adjustments and losses in the acquired group in accordance with FRS 19.
Cash consideration of £30.6m includes £0.7m of fees and incidental costs relating to the 
acquisition including stamp duty.

Note 23.  Financial Instruments
The section headed Treasury within the Finance Director's review on page 25 summarises the
Group's financial risk management and treasury policies. The Group does not trade in financial
instruments.
The numerical disclosures FRS 13 requires are set out below.
Short term debtors together with short term creditors, excluding bank overdrafts and amounts due
in respect of development land, are excluded from the analysis.
a) Interest rate risk
At 30 June 2002, the Group had total bank borrowing facilities of £200.0m, representing £130.0m
committed facilities and £70.0m uncommitted facilities.
After taking account of interest rate swaps, as at 30 June 2002, £75.0m of debt was at a fixed rate of
5.3%. The swaps expire between December 2003 and March 2004. All other debt is subject to
floating interest rates linked either to LIBOR or base rate at a range of margins, though a £100.0m
interest rate cap is in place at a rate of 7.5% until September 2003.
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, options and 
forward rate agreements. All interest rate exposures are sterling denominated.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates.
The amounts receivable within debtors after more than one year and fixed asset investments are
not interest bearing.

By order of the Board
R E Walker Secretary

Notes:
1. Proxies: A member entitled to attend and vote may appoint a proxy or 
proxies to attend and, on a poll, to vote instead of him.  A proxy need 
not be a member of the Company.
A form of proxy is enclosed which, if required, should be completed in 
accordance with the instructions set out therein and returned so as to
reach the Company’s Registrars not later than 48 hours before the time 
of the Meeting or any adjourned meeting.  Members who complete a
form of proxy will not be precluded from attending the Meeting and 
voting in person if they so wish.
2. Documents available for inspection:
The Register of Directors’ interests will be available for inspection at the 
place of the Meeting from 12 noon on 4 November 2002 until the 
conclusion of the Meeting.
3. Directors’ Service Contracts: None of the Directors has a service 
contract which cannot be terminated within one year without payment 
of compensation.
4. The Company specifies, pursuant to Regulation 34 of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 1995, that only those shareholders registered in 
the Register of Members of the Company as at 6pm on 1 November 
2002 shall be entitled to attend or vote at the Meeting in respect of the 
number of shares registered in their respective names at that time.  
Changes to entries on the Register after that time will be disregarded in 
determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the Meeting. 58 CORPORATE INFORMATION

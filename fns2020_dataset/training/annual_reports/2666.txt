Inside  
this report
See our online report at 
www.bwinparty.com Our strategy and vision stretches far beyond 
real money gaming on the internet: our aim 
is to ‘let the world play for real’ by extending 
our reach into new areas of digital 
entertainment on a global scale. 
Technology, consumer tastes and 
government regulations are changing fast. 
This makes for a challenging business 
environment but, given the underlying 
growth prospects for our sector, we 
are embracing change to secure long-term 
outperformance.

Overview
Integration update
We completed the merger of bwin Interactive 
Entertainment and PartyGaming on 
31 March 2011, creating the world’s largest 
listed online gaming company. It also marked 
the start of our operations as one company 
and the implementation of our detailed 
integration plans.
In 2011 our focus was very much on 
integration and regulation. Delivering 
the targeted €40m of synergies from 
the Merger in 2012 remains a top 
priority, as well as ensuring that we 
foster and protect the value of 
opportunities relating to newly 
regulated and to-be-regulated markets. 
Balancing these two sometimes 
competing objectives has been a 
challenge, having been forced to 
reschedule certain of our integration 
plans in order to meet strict schedules 
imposed by governments and 
regulators alike. 
As more governments embrace 
the regulation of online gaming 
markets, so the dynamics of our 
industry are shifting. Real money and 
social gaming, together with other 
forms of digital entertainment are 
converging. At the same time mobile 
platforms are increasingly important 
channels of distribution – each of 
these developments is being driven 
by advances in technology, new 
regulations and changes in 
consumer demand.

Overview
The global online gaming industry is a growing and valuable 
segment of the digital economy with an increasing share of 
the global gaming market. Excluding the US, 2011 online Gross 
Gaming Revenue or Yield (‘GGY’) for the four major product 
segments, sports betting, poker, casino and bingo was 
estimated to be worth ¤18.8bn, up 7.4% versus the previous 
year. This growth is forecast to continue, reaching ¤24.7bn by 
2015, implying a compound annual growth rate (‘CAGR’) of 7 .2%

Europe
Several countries in Europe have introduced or are planning to introduce online 
gaming regulations.
USA
An opinion issued by the Department of Justice on 23 December 2011 prompted several 
states to initiate proposals that would seek to implement online gambling regulations. 
With a number of draft bills in both the Senate and House of Representatives, there is 
speculation that the federal government may also seek to introduce a nationwide 
regulatory framework. Below is a summary of some of the initiatives that have been 
seen in individual states to date.

Chairman’s 
statement
Twelve months into the merger of bwin 
and PartyGaming, the combined enterprise 
is ahead of schedule in integrating the 
businesses and delivering the synergies 
expected and is on track to extend its reach 
into new areas of digital entertainment. 
Integration and regulation
The rapid evolution of the online 
gaming industry is continuing, driven 
by advances in technology and changes 
to the regulatory landscape, resulting 
in a business environment that is both 
challenging and full of opportunity.
In such an environment, where the 
competitive landscape is usually settled 
within a short space of time, late entry 
into any newly-regulated market is not 
an option. The enlarged enterprise of 
bwin.party provides a unique platform 
from which to launch into new markets 
with the requisite scale to take full 
advantage of the freedom to advertise, 
often for the first time. As part of our 
goal of participating in all major newly-
regulated markets, we were among the 
first wave of operators to launch on the 
opening of the Danish market at 
the beginning of 2012, as we will be 
when Spain opens later this year. 
Our agreements with MGM and Boyd 
mean that we are well-placed to be in 
the first wave when regulations allow 
entry into the United States, either 
on a federal or state-by-state basis. 
The early performance and the 
potential of bwin.party are 
encouraging, as detailed in the 
‘Co-CEOs’ Review’ on pages 10 to 17, 
where they expand upon the Group’s 
progress and business strategy. In 
addition to reaping the rewards from 
our investment in technology, brands 
and people, we will extend our reach 
into new areas of digital entertainment, 
such as social gaming, by capitalising 
on the Group’s existing resources to 
create new revenue streams.
• Completion of Merger on  
31 March 2011
• On-track with integration –  
delivering synergies
• Ready to enter new markets – 
including US
• Extending our reach into digital 
entertainment
• Final dividend of 1.56p per share
• Over 31 million shares repurchased

Governance
As we navigate this critical phase in the 
Company’s development, the Board’s 
approach to corporate governance 
has to be mindful of both the need to 
avoid disrupting the integration of two 
businesses with different governance 
backgrounds and the detailed 
negotiations that led up to the Merger. 
During those negotiations bwin and 
PartyGaming agreed a balanced Board 
would be in the best interests of the 
combined Group, a decision that is 
supported by the success of the 
integration to-date. However, this 
resulted in a Board structure that was 
not in compliance with the Code on 
Corporate Governance in terms of the 
balance between independent and non-
independent Directors.
Despite this imbalance, the Board 
is satisfied that it has maintained 
a sufficient degree of independence 
for the following reasons:
• On the majority of business items 
considered by the Board, a non-
independent Non-Executive Director 
is independent because the interests 
of the relevant founder shareholders 
and the Company do not conflict; 
• On issues when the interests of the 
Company and interests of a founder 
shareholder may conflict, mechanisms 
in the relationship agreement and/or 
letters of appointment for the non-
independent Non-Executive Director 
allow the independent Directors to 
exclude them from the decision-
making process;
• The independent Directors have not 
been and will not be in a minority to 
the Executive Directors;
• The Chairman of the Board was 
independent on appointment; and
• The Board had the appropriate 
balance of skills and experience to 
manage the imbalance appropriately.
This matter, together with details about 
how the Board oversees the interests 
of bwin.party through its operating and 
management structure, is explored in 
more depth in the Governance Review 
on pages 70 to 101 of this Annual report. 
The Board has considered Lord Davies 
of Abersoch’s review, ‘Women on 
Boards’, which requested FTSE 350 
companies to set out aims for having 
women serve on boards. Gender 
diversity is an important factor that we 
will take into account when considering 
any new candidates to join the Board. 
However, gender is only one of many 
issues that have to be considered 
alongside a candidate’s experience, 
knowledge and skills. Our aim is to 
appoint at least one woman to the 
Board by the end of 2013 and to have 
at least two women serving on the 
Board by 2015. 
Directors
Further to the additions to the Board 
that became effective on completion 
of the Merger, Geoff Baldwin replaced 
Rami Lerner as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company on 15 July 2011. 
Mr Baldwin’s appointment was made 
following a nomination under the terms 
of a relationship agreement entered 
into by amongst others, bwin.party 
digital entertainment plc, Emerald Bay 
Limited and Stinson Ridge Limited that 
was approved by shareholders on 
28 January 2011. All Directors will be 
standing for re-election at the 
forthcoming AGM. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 1.56p per share which, 
together with the interim dividend of 
1.56p per share, makes a total dividend 
of 3.12p per share for the year ended 
31 December 2011 (2010: nil). The final 
dividend, if approved at the Annual 
General Meeting will be payable to 
shareholders on the register of 
shareholder interests on 11 May 2012. 
It is expected that dividends will be paid 
on 12 June 2012. Shareholders wishing 
to receive dividends in Euros rather 
than pounds sterling will need to file 
a currency election and return it to 
the Group’s registrars on or before 
25 May 2012. Further details are 
contained in Share information 
on pages 154 to 156.
Share buyback
Since launching our €75m buyback 
programme in September, the Group 
had purchased 15.7 million shares at 
a total purchase price of £19.9m by 
31 December 2011. As at 22 March 2012, 
we had purchased a further 15.5 million 
shares. All purchased shares have 
been cancelled.
Outlook
Current trading has been robust  
and in-line with our expectations. 
The enlarged Group is in a strong 
position to capture a greater share 
of the expanding digital 
entertainment market.  Jim Ryan

Co-CEO’s review
We have provided a detailed review of 
the operational performance in 2011 and 
our progress on integrating bwin and 
PartyGaming. In addition, we have set 
out our business strategy, achievements 
against that strategy to-date and our 
objectives for 2012.
We made excellent progress in 2011. 
The swift execution of a number of 
integration plans for our technology, 
people, products and brands has been 
rewarded with financial synergies 
coming through more quickly than 
expected, offsetting increased gaming 
duties payable as markets regulate. 
We remain on-track to deliver 
approximately €40m of synergies 
this year and €65m in 2013. 
2011 results
The Group’s robust operating 
performance in 2011 is confirmation of 
our progress. Despite the operational 
challenges of integrating two 
businesses in such a dynamic business 
environment, the Group delivered total 
pro forma revenue from Continuing 
operations of €816.0m (2010: €814.0m) 
and pro forma Clean EBITDA from 
Continuing operations of €199.3m 
(2010: €193.2m). However, the financial 
numbers do not tell the whole story: a 
simple comparison of the year-on-year 
financial performance appears to show 
modest growth on both metrics, but, 
as explained in our ‘Review of 2011’, 
this belies the transformation of our 
business, an increasing proportion 
of which is now licensed, regulated 
and taxed. 
As more governments embrace the 
regulation of online gaming markets, 
so the dynamics of our industry are 
shifting. Real money and social gaming 
together with other forms of digital 
entertainment are converging. 
At the same time mobile platforms 
are increasingly important channels of 
distribution – each of these developments 
is being driven by advances in technology, 
new regulations and changes in 
consumer demand.

Co-CEO’s review
Integration
The integration process touched 
upon each of our core assets in 2011: 
our people, technology, products 
and brands.
People 
Following completion, our first step 
was to appoint the members of the 
senior management team, each 
with responsibility for leading the 
integration of their respective 
disciplines and designing and 
implementing an organisation 
structure to deliver the business 
strategy and synergies already 
identified. We reorganised the business 
into four product verticals so that all 
personnel, so far as practicable, are 
allocated to one of the verticals. This 
structure should help us maintain our 
leadership position in each vertical 
which is now able to allocate its own 
development and financial resources 
to execute its plans. Following some 
initial adjustments, the target 
organisation structure was completed 
in the fourth quarter of 2011. Aligning 
business processes and controls is an 
ongoing task but just 12 months after 
completion, the majority of our internal 
procedures are already up and running. 
With employees located on three 
continents, differences of language and 
culture posed additional challenges as 
we executed the integration plan and 
continued to drive the business 
forward. Thanks to the direction and 
diligence of our dedicated Integration 
Management Office and the enormous 
efforts of our management and 
employees, we are delivering on 
our plans.
Technology
One advantage of the long lead-time 
between the merger announcement 
on 29 July 2010 and completion on 
31 March 2011 was that we had several 
months to plan the integration, 
including the assessment of our 
technology needs. Having two of 
everything it was clear that choosing 
one technology platform for each task 
would release resources and generate 
value. This was challenging for the 
senior team given the implications for 
our staff and key locations. Drafting the 
technology roadmap was relatively 
straightforward compared with the 
complexity of moving from two systems 
to a unified back-office platform, as well 
as having a single gaming platform for 
each of the product verticals. This was 
complicated further by the introduction 
of new regulated markets such as 
Denmark and Spain, that each have 
different technology requirements. 
Although these interruptions delayed 
the integration of our technology 
platforms, we expect to move to a single 
e-gaming platform by the end of 2012 
and deliver the €40m of synergies as 
previously announced. A further €25m 
of synergies are expected in 2013.

Products and brands
Choosing bwin as our lead brand for 
sports betting was obvious given its 
leading presence across Europe. 
Choosing PartyPoker as our lead poker 
brand was also straightforward given 
its brand strength not just in existing 
markets across Europe, but also 
potential new markets, such as the 
United States. Notwithstanding this, 
we will also continue to offer bwinPoker 
across all key markets and intend to 
continue to make full use of the World 
Poker Tour (‘WPT’). In Italy we will 
continue to use GD Poker. In casino, 
as a large proportion of our customers 
continue to come from poker and 
sports betting, we will continue to 
offer games through both bwin and 
PartyPoker, as well as the industry-
leading PartyCasino brand. We believe 
that the quality of the product offering 
in casino is key and so have continued 
to add new games to our suite using our 
in-house development team as well as 
through selective licensing deals with 
third parties. Bingo remains a localised 
product and Foxy Bingo and Cheeky 
Bingo will remain our core brands in 
the UK and Gioco Digitale in Italy. As we 
move into new markets we will launch 
additional bingo brands that will be 
tailored for local tastes.
Market environment
We believe that the underlying drivers 
of revenue growth in the online gaming 
sector remain strong: the increasing 
prevalence of broadband; growth in 
smartphone and tablet technology; 
an expanding population of online 
consumers with an increasing 
propensity to socialise, transact and 
play games online; and a growing 
acceptance that gaming online is 
a mainstream activity, one that can and 
should be regulated (see ‘Spotlight on: 
our business environment’ on pages 
6 to 7). While these long-term drivers 
remain, shifts in the regulatory, 
competitive as well as technological 
landscapes can and already have had a 
significant impact on the online gaming 
market in the short-term. 
Regulation
A number of national developments 
took place in 2011, most of which 
represented a further positive step 
in the transition from an embryonic 
unregulated activity just a few years 
ago into one that is increasingly 
becoming fully licensed and regulated. 
While this transition brings additional 
compliance costs and gaming taxes, 
it is also likely to prompt industry 
consolidation as consumers gravitate 
to the larger operators and brands. 
Germany (22% of pro forma net 
gaming revenue in 2011)
3
In April 2011, 15 out of the 16 German 
states or Länder, put forward a proposal 
for a new regulatory framework. While 
it proposed to regulate, license and tax 
online sports betting for the first time, 
it proposed to do so in a very restrictive 
way that was not compliant with EU 
law. Following criticism from the 
European Commission, the draft was 
amended in December 2011 but 
remains highly restrictive. Limited to 
sports betting only it includes a de facto 
ban on live betting, limits on the stakes 
wagered in any month and a maximum 
of 20 licensees. We believe this revised 
proposal also fails to meet the 
requirements of EU law. Having been 
asked by the Länder for a ‘green light’ 
to proceed with the proposals, the 
European Commission issued a 
response on 20 March 2012 stating that 
the Länder needed to provide detailed 
evidence in order for the Commission to 
assess whether or not the restrictions 
embodied within the draft State Treaty 
comply with EU law. The Commission 
was also unable to assess the 
consistency and coherence of the 
proposals due to a lack of notification 
of federal legislation amending the 
rules for slot machines and horse race 
betting. In the absence of such 
notifications and evidence, the 
Commission did not give the Länder the 
‘green light’ they required to proceed. 
Meanwhile, Schleswig-Holstein, 
Germany’s most northern Land has 
adopted its own licensing regime for 
online sports betting, poker and casino
4
 
with a 20% tax on gross gaming revenue 
and which has been approved by the 
European Commission. bwin.party 
along with many other reputable 
operators has applied for a licence 
in Schleswig-Holstein and intends 
to operate under that licence across 
Germany. While the position of the 
other 15 Länder remains unclear, 
we remain committed to securing a 
commercially viable regulatory regime, 
one that complies with EU law and 
meets the needs and desires of 
consumers, operators and regulators.
Italy (10% of pro forma net gaming 
revenue in 2011)

Italy expanded its online gaming 
regime to include cash game poker and 
certain casino table games in July 2011. 
The Group launched both products 
under its main brands including 
bwin, PartyPoker and Gioco Digitale 
and now has a strong market share

United Kingdom (10% of pro forma 
net gaming revenue in 2011)
5
The UK Government has announced 
that it intends to amend the existing 
Gambling Act and extend its licensing 
regime to include offshore online 
operators. It is unclear when the 
legislation to effect such a change 
will be considered. Meanwhile, the UK 
Treasury has announced a consultation 
on changing the taxation regime in 
line with the Department for Culture, 
Media and Sport’s proposals and 
taxing operators on the basis of 
customer location. The potential 
outcome of its conclusions remain 
unclear. The industry argued strongly 
that any changes to the basis of 
taxation should only be introduced 
if and when the requisite amendments 
to the UK Gambling Act have already 
been effected, if at all. Such proposals, 
if introduced, may be subject to legal 
challenge by online gaming operators.
France (7% of pro forma net gaming 
revenue in 2011)
5
Despite the calls for changes to the 
French regulatory model put forward 
by Monsieur Villotte, president of the 
French regulator, ARJEL, who argues 
that the regime is not working 
effectively, no change has yet been 
made. Other senior figures such as 
Senator Trucy and Jean-Francois 
Lamour MP have also expressed 
concerns that the regime is preventing 
regulated operators from making 
an economic return as they cannot 
compete with black market operators –
evidenced by the decline in the French 
regulated sports betting market in the 
fourth quarter 2011. There has been 
speculation in the media that some 
changes might be effected before the 
end of 2012 although any such changes 
are unlikely to take place until after 
the Presidential election in May 2012. 
Whether or not this will include any 
reduction in taxation or an expansion 
in the number of regulated products 
is unclear.
Greece (4% of pro forma net gaming 
revenue in 2011)
5
Greece has pressed ahead with its 
proposals for a new gaming law that 
was enacted in August 2011 despite 
the receipt of a detailed opinion from 
the European Commission that raised 
a number of concerns. The requirement 
to have a legal presence in Greece 
together with a proposal to impose 
taxes on operators retrospectively from 
1 January 2010 are just two aspects that 
we believe are in breach of EU law and 
which are the subject of a formal 
complaint submitted by the Remote 
Gambling Association. In the absence 
of any clarity we continue to keep the 
situation under review. 
Spain (5% of pro forma net gaming 
revenue in 2011)
5
It has been reported that over 290 
licence applications have been filed 
with the Spanish regulator by 59 
companies, including bwin.party 
ahead of the country’s new regulatory 
framework coming into force. Whilst 
the exact date upon which licences will 
be issued remains unclear, we expect 
that this will take place during the 
second quarter of 2012. The regulations 
cover all forms of online gaming, 
including live betting and bingo 
but excludes online slot games, with 
a 25% tax on gross gaming revenue. 
In accordance with the regulations we 
have been paying taxes on all Spanish 
revenue generated since 29 May 2011.

Denmark (2% of pro forma net gaming 
revenue in 2011)
5
The new regulatory framework that 
covers sports betting, casino and 
poker went live on 1 January 2012. 
We launched services in each licensed 
product category as well as on behalf 
of our local B2B customer, Danske 
Licens Spil, the leading Danish land-
based gaming operator. Gaming duty 
is payable at 20% of gross 
gaming revenue.
While several other countries are in 
the throes of discussing, drafting as 
well as legislating new laws to regulate, 
the trend is clear: online gaming is 
becoming increasingly recognised as a 
legitimate activity in most EU countries 
and is a branch of eCommerce that can 
and should be regulated. Following the 
adoption of a report by the European 
Parliament
6
 in 2011, there is also an 
acceptance that agreeing a common 
approach to the regulation of online 
gaming is in the interests of European 
stakeholders and consumers. 
United States (Nil share of pro forma 
net gaming revenue in 2011)
5
An opinion from the US Department 
of Justice on 23 December 2011 made 
clear that regulated intra-state online 
games of chance did not breach any 
federal laws. This prompted several 
initiatives in a number of states seeking 
to regulate license and tax online 
gaming activities including California, 
Iowa, Hawaii, New Jersey and 
Mississippi. The state of Nevada has 
already enacted the requisite legislation 
to allow intra-state online poker. With 
the prospect of a ‘patchwork quilt’ of 
regulation, compliance and tax rules, 
the federal government may yet decide 
that it needs to regulate this activity at 
a national level. Estimated to have been 
worth approximately $1.6 billion of 
gross gaming revenue (‘GGR’) in 2006, 
assuming a federal bill was introduced 
the US online poker market could be 
worth up to $4.2 billion in GGR
7
 in the 
first full year after regulation.
Through our joint venture agreements 
with MGM Resorts International and 
Boyd Gaming Corporation that were 
concluded during the year, we believe 
that we are well-placed to capitalise on 
any such opportunities as and when 
they arise.
Competition
The competitive landscape is also 
continuing to evolve rapidly, partly 
as a result of some of the regulatory 
changes outlined above and partly due 
to other factors. The indictment of the 
founders of PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker 
and Absolute Poker/Ultimate Bet on 15 
April 2011 represented the start of what 
we believe will prove to be a 
fundamental shift in the shape and 
structure of the global online poker 
market. With the exception of 
PokerStars, all of these sites have now 
closed. PokerStars’ relative size meant 
that it was able to capture the lion’s 
share of Full Tilt’s non-US players, 
consolidating its position as market 
leader in most territories. This makes for 
a challenging operating environment 
for our poker business but we believe 
that we can remain one of the largest 
networks in each market. Our position 
should be further enhanced when we 
pool our player liquidity across our 
poker brands in the dotcom as well as 
the ring-fenced markets in Italy and 
France later this year. 
Separately, the past 18 months have 
seen the emergence of a new gaming 
phenomenon on the internet: social 
gaming. Zynga, Playdom, Playfish and 
other social gaming platforms have all 
experienced spectacular growth with 
their virtual currency and virtual goods-
driven business models that have 
attracted millions of customers across 
the globe. Zynga’s CEO, Mark Pincus was 
quoted recently saying that online 
gambling is a “natural fit” with virtual 
goods and social games.
We believe it is only a matter of time 
before the worlds of real money gaming 
and social gaming converge. This 
represents a major opportunity for 
bwin.party and we have a number of 
initiatives already underway in this 
area that we expect to drive value for 
shareholders in the medium to long-term.

Technology developments
The continued evolution of smartphone, 
tablet and other mobile technology 
has driven strong growth in the 
consumption of gaming products 
through the mobile channel. Customers 
no longer have to be in front of their PC 
or laptop to enjoy playing online games. 
We expect this trend to continue as 
new devices emerge but also as 
network infrastructure continues to 
improve and as payment processing 
and personal identification 
technologies evolve.
In its recent filing with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, Facebook 
stated that 425 million or 50.2% of 
users accessed its services via a 
mobile device. The penetration of 
smartphones is continuing to expand 
and is already greater than PCs or 
laptops. In its recent fourth quarter 
results for 2011, Apple Inc. announced 
that it had sold 37 million iPhones and 
over 15 million iPad’s, a 128% and 
11% increase respectively over the 
previous year. 
Whilst transactional-based gambling 
such as sports betting is already 
flourishing over existing networks, 
the next generation of networks are 
emerging and can be expected to 
revolutionise the gaming experience 
on mobile platforms. With transmission 
speeds of up to 10 Mbps (Megabits per 
second) these networks will be over 
five times the speed of existing 3G 
networks, significantly improving the 
mobile gaming experience, particularly 
for games such as poker, casino and 
bingo that typically require greater 
volumes of data traffic. The other 
dynamic that is driving the accessibility 
of online games is the increasing 
prevalence of Wi-Fi that is available in 
public locations and that most mobile 
devices are now able to use. In its March 
2012 budget the UK Government 
announced funding for ultrafast 
broadband and Wi-Fi in ten of the UK’s 
biggest cities, with additional funding 
for smaller cities too.
Against this backdrop, our business 
is continuing to perform well and we 
remain on-track.
Summary, current trading 
and outlook
Since 31 December 2011, the Group 
has performed in-line with the Board’s 
expectations with growth in all 
verticals versus the previous quarter. 
A summary of the current trading 
performance relative to the fourth 
quarter of 2011 is shown below:
Pro forma and Actual
Gross average  
daily revenue (€)
Period 
ended  
24 March 
2012 Q4 11 Change
Sports betting 932,600 900,200 4%
Casino & games 923,800 902,700 2%
Poker 747,300 747,200 0%
Bingo 324,100 319,000 2%
Total 2,927,800 2,869,100 2%
The pace of regulatory, technological 
and competitive change is showing no 
sign of slowing down. But, the scale and 
breadth of our revenue base, coupled 
with our significant resources all mean 
that we are in a strong position to 
capture a bigger share of the expanding 
digital entertainment market. Current 
trading has been robust with gross 
average daily revenue in the 12 weeks 
to 24 March 2012 up 2% versus the 
fourth quarter of 2011 to €2,927,800 
(Q4 11: €2,869,100). While the current 
macroeconomic environment appears 
to be impacting performance in parts of 
southern Europe, this is being offset by 
stronger performances elsewhere. 
Active player days increased in all 
verticals versus the previous quarter 
and amounts wagered in both sports 
and casino were up strongly although  Overview 02

there was a small drop in gross win 
margin to 7.9% in sports (Q4 11: 8.5%) 
and 3.9% in casino (Q4 11: 4.1%).
Should the proposed regulatory 
framework in Schleswig-Holstein 
become effective and we are awarded 
a licence, we propose to offer sports 
betting, casino and poker products 
across Germany and pay the proposed 
tax of 20% of gross gaming revenue 
on all products. While this will impact 
Clean EBITDA in 2012, we have identified 
€10m – €15m of savings in 2012 and 
2013 that will partially mitigate the 
impact on our financial performance. 
While regulatory uncertainties 
continue, the prospect of the Euro 2012 
championship later this year, the 
opening of the regulated Spanish 
market and our delivery of additional 
synergies mean that we remain 
confident about the Group’s prospects.
2011 was the year of integration and 
regulation. 2012 will be the year of 
integration, regulation and innovation – 
we have made an excellent start.
“Even in such a 
challenging business 
environment we 
continue to deliver 
positive cashflow 
thanks to the 
strength of our 
business model.”

Our business model
We are focused on delivering long-term profitable growth through growing 
revenue and managing our cost base. As a consumer-facing business we need to 
be consistent in the delivery of great content in a safe and secure environment, 
at a price that represents good value for money and in a way that is easy to use.
Revenue
Whilst the dynamics vary by product, our revenue model applies to each of our 
four verticals: how many players do we have on a daily basis and how much do 
they spend each time they visit? Multiply one by the other and we have gross 
gaming revenue. Other revenue comes from our business-to-business (‘B2B’) 
customers (such as PMU in France and Danske Licens Spil in Denmark) and 
non-gaming activities such as WPT, InterTrader (our financial spread betting 
site) and payment services supplied to third parties.

Our business model
Key Performance Indicators
Each of our KPIs lies behind one of our core revenue drivers, affecting either 
the number of active players or average player yield. We provide quarterly, 
data on each of these metrics on our website. Other factors influencing 
revenue include player retention and the number of existing players that leave 
the site through ‘churn’; the mix of games played (as different games/bets have 
different revenue characteristics); how often people play and the mix of 
players i.e. are they experienced high value players or novice low value players? 
Each of our product KPIs are detailed in the Review of 2011 on pages 37 to 42.

New common platform  
(loyalty, player management, customer support, data warehouse and payments)
Cost base
We categorise costs as follows: ‘distribution’ or marketing-related costs 
that tend to be more variable in nature, rising and falling with revenue; and 
‘administrative expenses’ that tend to include those items that are more fixed 
in nature and therefore provide a source of operational leverage.
We maintain a tight control on costs and have identified €65m in annual 
synergies from the Merger, three quarters of which are cost savings such as 
rationalisation of surplus systems and technology, greater purchasing power 
from our increased scale and reduced reliance on third-party suppliers. 
The balance is expected to come from revenue synergies such as cross-selling 
and improved yield management.
Balance sheet
We generate net cash and have no net debt. We paid a €15m half year dividend 
in October 2011 and are recommending a final dividend of approximately €15m. 
Since September 2011 we have also repurchased 31.2 million ordinary shares 
for a total consideration of approximately £44.9m. Our policy is to continue to 
manage our balance sheet whilst retaining the flexibility to seize opportunities 
should they arise.
Strategy
Our strategy to deliver long-term revenue growth includes five key elements:
• focus on regulated and to-be-regulated markets;
• invest in our core assets; 
• secure long-term strategic partnerships;
• extend our reach into new areas of digital entertainment; and
• act responsibly
Organisation and business structure
We are organised into four product verticals: sports betting, casino & games, 
poker and bingo. This provides greater control over resources for each product 
and greater flexibility to manage the particular challenges and different 
dynamics faced by each. This also reflects the way in which the business is 
being structured technically with each of the gaming verticals plugged into 
a common technical platform that hosts all of the back-office functions such 
as loyalty, payments, data warehouse and customer service.

and casino games into Italy in July 2011 
and have already secured meaningful 
market share in each segment. In 
France, we sustained our market share 
in poker and increased it in sports 
betting despite the country’s 
challenging fiscal and regulatory 
regime. We continue to lobby for 
change to the current regime and are 
encouraged by the recent comments by 
Monsieur Villotte, the French regulator, 
who has called for an “analysis of the 
fiscal constraints and economic model”. 
Elsewhere, much of the second half of 
2011 was spent preparing our systems 
and offerings for the newly regulated 
markets of Denmark and Spain. While 
our poker, casino and sports betting 
offering launched successfully in 
Denmark on 1 January 2012 as planned, 
a change of government meant that the 
opening of the Spanish market was 
delayed until later this year.
Focus on regulated and to-be-regulated markets
The transition to regulated markets is 
continuing to gather momentum. Several 
countries in Europe are moving towards the 
implementation of a regulated framework 
for online gaming. The US is also moving in 
a similar direction. This transition is a major 
opportunity for bwin.party although it 
comes at the cost of greater gaming duties.

• 27% of 2011 net gaming revenue  
came from regulated markets (France, 
Italy and UK)
• Introduced a new sports software 
framework, increasing delivery speeds 
and flexibility that is vital for newly 
regulated markets
Plans for 2012
The transition to regulated markets 
will continue with the opening of the 
Spanish market where we plan to 
launch sports betting, poker, casino 
and bingo. Should we be successful in 
securing a licence in Schleswig-Holstein, 
we plan to launch all products except 
bingo in Germany under this regime.
The exact timing of when markets will 
open is always a challenge for operators 
as are additional amendments to 
legislative requirements by regulators. 
However, through an active programme 
of engagement with regulators and 
governments around the world, we 
aim to stay fully informed and are ready 
to mobilise our launch teams quickly. 
Our objective is always to launch as 
soon as regulations allow.

2011 achievements
Our live betting offer has improved 
significantly with a new interface and 
increased coverage by our live-betting 
traders through greater automation, 
allowing us to redeploy bookmakers 
to cover additional events. In casino 
we launched into Italy and added 21 
new casino games of which 14 were 
developed in-house. We also launched 
our own no-download casino product 
onto the existing bwin technology 
platform in October 2011 and the early 
results have been very encouraging. In 
poker, we changed to a weighted 
contribution rake calculation that 
benefited more recreational players 
and helped us secure the clear number 
two position behind PokerStars in the 
dotcom liquidity pool, a position that 
has been sustained into 2012
2
. In bingo 
we consolidated our UK bingo networks 
into a single liquidity pool with bigger 
prizes and higher jackpots thereby 
making our offering more attractive 
and this is beginning to feed through 
into our financial performance.
The challenge of merging two working 
cultures across multiple locations has 
been met through the implementation 
of several people-related initiatives 
including a new Leadership 
Development Programme spanning all 
levels of our management structure as 
well as the introduction of a unified 
approach to training across the Group. 
We have also put in place a new identity 
and market positioning for IVY 
Comptech, our subsidiary that provides 
software development and IT-enabled 
business process outsourcing. IVY has 
also relocated to a brand new, state-of-
the-art facility and has put in place an 
improved incentive scheme to attract 
and retain the very best talent in 
Hyderabad, India.
Invest in our core assets – technology, product,  
brands and people
To attract and retain real money players we 
have to provide the very best online gaming 
experience, which is why we continue to 
invest in our technology, products and 
brands as well as the people that make it all 
happen. Through targeted allocation of our 
capital we enhance our reputation for trust 
and quality, driving revenue and cashflow.

Our bwin brand is synonymous with 
sports, supported by our long-term 
marketing relationships with some of 
the world’s most recognised brands 
such as Real Madrid and MotoGP . 
Our sports sponsorship strategy 
remains focused on European football, 
motorcycle racing and basketball where 
we sponsor Euroleague Basketball and 
the industry association, FIBA. 
2011 achievements
Preparing for the launch of our 
B2B service for Danske Licens Spil in 
Denmark on 1 January 2012 was a major 
project in 2011. Similar to our deals with 
PMU and ACF in France, the agreement, 
which covers poker and casino games, 
is designed to augment our B2C offering 
as well as generate additional revenue. 
We also announced similar arrangements 
with MGM and Boyd Gaming two of the 
largest and most respected casino 
operators in the US, in anticipation of 
either state or federal legislation, the 
objective again being to support our 
planned B2C franchise should 
regulations allow.
During the year we extended our 
sponsorship with FIBA and Euroleague 
Basketball until 2014, MotoGP until 
2013 and also began a multi-year 
sponsorship of the Pro Padel Tour.
Secure long-term strategic alliances
We continue to leverage our own assets

As a result, the Board has added a new 
element to the strategy, one that is 
focused on extending our reach into 
these new and exciting markets. 
Social gaming
Social gaming is a rapidly growing 
market and shares many characteristics 
with our core business including the 
need to develop high quality online 
games, manage large numbers of 
simultaneous players with the support 
of fully-integrated business intelligence 
and analytics, provide a payments 
platform as well as sophisticated online 
marketing through a range of channels. 
However, we recognise that it is also very 
different in terms of what drives customer 
behaviour and how revenue is generated. 
Having researched the business case 
thoroughly and balanced this against 
other opportunities, the Board has 
formally adopted this addition to the 
strategy and we have established a 
stand-alone and dedicated vehicle 
to pursue social gaming opportunities 
that sits outside our core real money 
gaming activities. Recognising the 
different skills required we have 
recruited a knowledgeable and 
experienced management team that 
will be supported by its own software 
development resource that will develop 
a range of social games for launch in 2012.
Mobile
The mobile channel is not new to  
bwin.party having launched our first 
mobile sports betting in 2001. However, 
the advent of smartphone and tablet 
technology in conjunction with 
increasing connection speeds has 
revolutionised the mobile gaming 
proposition. A fast-growing part of our 
business, mobile gross gaming revenue 
increased by 104% year-on-year to 
€25.3m (2010: €12.4m) and we expect 
further strong growth in 2012. 
2011 achievements
We established a dedicated resource 
within the Group to manage all of our 
development and investment in each  
of the mobile platforms. Called Mobile, 
Touch, Video, we continued to expand 
our mobile offer with the launch of 
multiple apps on both Android and 
iOS platforms – our products are now 
available in app stores in 18 countries 
and there were over 31,000 downloads 
of our bwin sports betting iPhone app 
in January 2012. On the social gaming 
front we launched a beta version of a 
new poker concept called Aces Hangout 
on Google+ that has a social webcam 
platform connecting each of the 
participating players.
Extend into new areas of digital entertainment
At the time of the Merger we recognised the 
opportunity to extend our assets and skills 
into new areas of digital entertainment, in 
particular social gaming. We also identified 
a major opportunity to exploit our existing 
products and brands through mobile, touch 
and video.

During 2012 we will establish a 
proprietary social game technology 
platform and launch online and 
smartphone applications in several 
of the Group’s core product verticals, 
as well as an independent social game 
destination website. The first social 
gaming product to launch will be a 
poker-based product followed by a 
casino and sportsbook application 
by the end of 2012. In Mobile, we will 
launch a new PartyPoker mobile app 
and plan to launch HTML5 mobile 
versions of our key gaming sites.
As we complete elements of our 
integration plans in 2012, we will be able 
to redeploy even more resources into 
extending our business into these 
exciting new business areas.

Since 2005 we have been working 
with the Division on Addiction (‘DOA’), 
Cambridge Health Alliance, a Harvard 
Medical School teaching affiliate in 
order to both expand our knowledge 
of gambling-related problems and also 
to help us develop a multi-layered 
responsible gaming tool that can be 
tailored to an individual’s requirements. 
However, our approach to 
responsibility extends beyond our 
core gaming business and includes all 
of our core stakeholders including the 
communities where we have a physical 
presence. For more details regarding 
our approach to stakeholder 
management please see the 
Sustainability section of our corporate 
website: www.bwinparty.com. 
2011 achievements
We continued our pioneering 
collaboration with the DOA that 
published three more peer-reviewed 
academic papers into gambling-related 
issues in 2011. As well as being widely 
acclaimed in the academic world, 
our collaboration with the DOA was 
commended as part of the independent 
assessment of our working practices 
by GoodCorporation (see page 60). In 
Europe, we helped to establish a Europe-
wide agreement on responsible remote 
gambling measures. The European 
Committee of Standardisation (‘CEN’) 
adopted the agreement in February 
2011, outlining 134 practical measures 
aimed at safeguarding a high level of 
consumer protection and ensuring that 
remote gambling operators behave 
responsibly in the European Union. In 
2011, together with some of the world’s 
largest corporations including Google 
and Vodafone, bwin.party became a 
founding member of the ICT Coalition 
for a Safer Internet for Children and 
Young People – details of the coalition 
were published in January 2012

. 
As well as these corporate initiatives, 
our employees have also been playing 
their part in acting responsibly by 
participating in pro bono activities for 
worthy causes in local communities. 
In recognition of our efforts during the 
year we were again entered into the 
FTSE4Good Index Series.
Act responsibly
Being responsible is a prerequisite for 
success. However, to sustain our business 
model we choose to go beyond the 
requirements prescribed by regulation and 
statute with the objective of providing the 
world’s safest and most innovative gaming 
platform founded upon operational 
excellence and scientific research.

is not limited to the DOA, we are also 
committed to supporting the GREaT

Co-CEOs
The Merger was completed on 31 March 2011. 
For accounting purposes PartyGaming is treated as 
the acquirer of bwin and as a result the Group’s statutory 
results for the year ended 31 December 2011 include 
a full period from PartyGaming while bwin is included 
from 1 April 2011 only. 
Introduction
In preparing these full year results for 2011, we have provided 
a detailed review of the operational performance of the 
combined business and our progress on integrating bwin 
Interactive Entertainment AG (‘bwin’) and PartyGaming Plc 
(‘PartyGaming’). In addition, we have included a detailed 
review of our business strategy, achievements against that 
strategy to-date and objectives for 2012.
To assist analysts and investors in assessing the performance 
of the Group, we have also produced pro forma results that 
set out the financial performance of the Group as if the 
combined operations had always been in place.

Continuing and Discontinued operations are contained in

Results overview
Total revenue was slightly ahead at €816.0m (2010: €814.0m) 
with a strong casino performance offset by a soft first half in 
poker, the loss of French casino revenues in the second half of 
2010 and the absence of the FIFA World Cup that flattered our 
overall performance in 2010. However, with merger synergies 
coming through more quickly than previously expected, pro 
forma Clean EBITDA increased to €199.3m (2010: €193.2m). 
This was despite a €27.8m increase in gaming duties versus 
2010. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of increased 
gaming duties, the closure of our French casino and the 
2010 FIFA World Cup, pro forma Clean EBITDA would have 
increased by 27% to €225.3m (2010: €177.1m). 
Actual total revenue for the period was up 93% to €691.1m 
(2010: €357.3m) primarily due to the Merger. Each of the 
product verticals benefited from the Merger reflecting 
the inclusion of bwin’s business activities for the first time. 
Actual Clean EBITDA from Continuing operations also 
increased primarily as a result of the Merger by 79% to 
€168.3m (2010: €94.2m).
Although the Merger was effectively a merger of equals with 
all consideration satisfied in shares, IFRS requires the Merger 
to be accounted for as if PartyGaming had acquired bwin. The 
accounting for this resulted in the recognition of goodwill at 
the time of the Merger measured as the difference in the fair 
value of the consideration and the fair value of the separately 
identified assets and liabilities of bwin. Proposed regulatory 
changes in Germany that were announced one week later 
resulted in a substantial reduction in the Company’s share 
price. As a result, the financial statements include a non-cash 
impairment of the goodwill of €391.7m. Had the Merger 
completed one week later, no such impairment would have 
been required. These items together with one-off deal and 
restructuring costs associated with the Merger of €23.8m 
(2010: €12.6m) meant that on a pro forma basis the Group’s 
Continuing operations reported a pro forma loss before tax of 
€407.8m (2010: profit before tax of €85.8m). On an actual basis, 
the Group’s Continuing operations reported a loss before tax 
of €422.9m (2010: profit before tax of €43.8m). Overview 02

Discontinued operations relate to the Ongame B2B business 
that is in the process of being sold to Shuffle Master and on-
going costs associated with the Company’s Non-Prosecution 
Agreement (‘NPA’) that was reached with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (the 
‘USAO’) on 6 April 2009. The total loss after tax after taking 
Discontinued operations into account was €422.3m (2010: 
profit after tax of €50.4m). On an actual basis, the total loss 
after tax was €431.0m (2010: profit after tax of €38.9m).
Clean EPS from Continuing operations was down 3% at 
18.5 € cents (2010: 19.0 € cents), and on an actual basis 
Clean EPS from Continuing operations increased by 1% to 
17.9 € cents (2010: 17.8 € cents). The increased amortisation 
and impairment of acquired intangibles during 2011 meant 
that on an actual basis the basic loss per ordinary share from 
Continuing operations was 56.0 € cents (2010: EPS 9.8 € cents). 
Taking into account Discontinued operations, Clean EPS was 
up 8% to 16.0 € cents (2010: 14.8 € cents) whilst on an actual 
basis was 15.8 € cents (2010: 17.7 € cents).

Key developments 
In 2011 our focus was very much on integration and 
regulation. Delivering the targeted €40m of synergies from 
the Merger in 2012 remains a top priority, as well as ensuring 
that we foster and protect the value of opportunities relating 
to newly regulated and to-be-regulated markets. Balancing 
these two sometimes competing objectives has been a 
challenge, having been forced to reschedule certain of our 
integration plans in order to meet strict schedules imposed 
by governments and regulators alike.

Pro forma results
Total revenue increased slightly to €816.0m (2010: €814.0m) 
driven by a strong and consistent performance throughout 
the period from casino & games and other revenue that 
more than offset year-on-year declines in poker and bingo. 
Casino & games grew by 9%, despite the closure of our 
French casino business that generated revenue of €7.5m in 
2010. Sports betting was broadly flat in the period which 
implied underlying growth as 2010 was flattered by the 
FIFA World Cup. Poker declined year-on-year due to continued 
pressure from US facing sites in the first half. However, 
following the closure of Full Tilt and the launch of cash games 
in Italy, poker was stable in the second half of the year. Bingo 
continued to suffer from the intense competition in both the 
UK and Italy. Other revenue, that includes B2B revenue, WPT, 
payment processing fees and InterTrader, grew by 20%. Faster 
than expected realisation of financial synergies from the 
Merger meant that pro forma Clean EBITDA increased to 
€199.3m (2010: €193.2m) and with it the Clean EBITDA margin 
also increased to 24.4% (2010: 23.7%), slightly above the top 
end of our target range for 2011 of 22% to 24%. This has been 
achieved despite the increase in gaming taxes that reached 
€65.7m (2010: €37.9m) together with the financial impact of 
marketing campaigns in newly regulated markets.
Actual results
The year-on-year comparison of the actual results, while 
also affected by the absence of the FIFA World Cup and the 
closure of French casino, were driven by the inclusion of bwin 
from 1 April 2011 as well as a strong performance from the 
casino & games vertical. Total revenue increased by 93% to 
€691.1m (2010: €357.3m) and actual Clean EBITDA increased 
by 79% to €168.3m (2010: €94.2m). 
Both pro forma and actual Discontinued operations 
represent primarily the Ongame B2B business along with 
costs associated with US customers that were no longer 
accepted following the enactment of the UIGEA.

Average daily net 
revenue (€000) 2,180.3 2,184.1 (0%) 1,847.9 954.4 94% 
On a pro forma basis, active player days declined by 8% 
reflecting the absence of the FIFA World Cup and a shift in our 
poker marketing strategy where we have continued to reduce 
our reliance on affiliates, a number of which were successfully 
generating large numbers of player acquisitions but that 
were only marginally profitable. This change in mix also fed 
through into the movement in new player sign-ups and the 
daily average number of players that were down 12% and 
8% respectively. However, there was also a corresponding 
positive impact on yield per active player day that increased 
by 8%, effectively offsetting the reduced volume of players. 
The net impact was that pro forma average daily net revenue 
remained stable at €2,180,300 (2010: €2,184,100).
On an actual basis, most of our consolidated key performance 
indicators trended positively, reflecting the inclusion of bwin 
for the first time. The one exception was yield per active 
player day that declined due to the shift in the revenue mix. 
The net effect was that actual average daily net revenue for 
the period increased by 94% year-on-year to €1,847,900 
(2010: €954,400).

Pro forma results 
Lower player volumes impacted the amounts wagered which 
were down 3% year-on-year to €3,759.5m (2010: €3,873.5m) 
primarily due to the FIFA World Cup in 2010. The impact on 
gross revenue was offset by an increase in gross win margin 
to 7.7% (2010: 7.5%) after a particularly strong second half that 
benefited from operational improvements in our live betting 
product and an increase across the former PartyGaming 
sports betting brands (PartyBets and Gamebookers), both of 
which are now benefiting from being part of a larger sports 
book operation. A small decrease in bonus costs meant that 
overall net revenue increased to €259.7m (2010: €258.6m). 
Clean EBITDA was stable at €64.4m (2010: €64.6m) as increased 
gaming duty was offset by cost savings elsewhere.
Actual results
The scale of the bwin sports business meant that all key 
metrics increased substantially on an actual basis. Total 
amount wagered increased by 711% driving both gross 
and net revenue. The increase in gross win margins to 7.6% 
(2010: 7.2%) reflects the factors outlined above, as does the 
increase in bonus costs, although as a percentage of the 
amount wagered these have fallen to 0.9% (2010: 1.4%) due to 
the greater strength of the bwin brand and product offering. 
The net impact was to increase yield per active player day to 
€6.2 (2010: €5.6) and average net daily revenue to €531,200 
(2010: €56,900). The substantial increase in net revenue fed 
through to Clean EBITDA that increased substantially to 
€46.1m (2010: €9.0m).  bwin.party

A summary of the key performance indicators for sports 
betting during 2011 both on a pro forma and actual basis 
is shown in the table below:

Average daily net 
revenue (€000) 711.5 708.5 0% 531.2 56.9 834% 
The absence of the FIFA World Cup can clearly be seen from 
the year-on-year movement in player activity. Active player 
days were down 6% while new player sign-ups fell 19%. 
However, the impact on average daily revenue was mitigated 
through a 7% increase in yield per active player day as a result 
of higher gross win margins. 
As part of the preparation to integrate our existing sports 
betting platforms into a single sports betting platform by the 
end of 2012, we made some important changes to our sports 
software in 2011 that is now much more flexible and allows us 
to deliver any requisite changes for newly regulated markets 
much more easily and faster than before. We introduced new 
semi-automatic trading models for more sports, resulting 
in a marked improvement in all aspects of performance and 
in live betting, that represented 72.9% of the total amount 
wagered in 2011 (2010: 72.4%), we increased the number 
of events covered with a 9% increase on bwin and a 57% 
increase on PartyBets/Gamebookers. Our live gross win 
margin increased across all sports betting labels and for 
the Group as a whole in 2011 it was 5.5% (2010: 5.2%). 
Our mobile offer continued to grow strongly in 2011. Sports 
net gaming revenue through the mobile channel increased by 
92% to €20.5m in 2011 (2010: €10.7m) and in some of our larger 
markets, represented between 20–35% of our active sports 
betting users (the average across all countries is 16%). WAP 
remained the largest platform and the iPhone our fastest 
growing mobile channel with our iOS apps now available in 
19 countries. Mobile is a core element of our strategy in sports 
betting and we will be continuing to drive it further in 2012.
We have applied for a licence in Schleswig-Holstein and, 
assuming we are successful, we expect to offer online sports 
betting across Germany under this licence. We also expect to 
launch our new regulated Spanish sports offer as soon as the 
new regulations become effective later this year.

Pro forma results
The Group’s casino & games business delivered another 
strong performance in 2011 with strong growth in revenue 
and Clean EBITDA. While the amount wagered was down on 
the previous year, this was due to the closure of the French 
casino business at the end of June 2010 and lower poker 
volumes that remain a major source of casino customers. 
The total amount wagered fell 6% year-on-year to €7.7bn 
(2010: €8.2bn). However, the trend seen in the first half 
continued during the second half with lower bonus costs and 
an improvement in the gross win margin that for the year as a 
whole was 4.0% (2010: 3.7%). This increase is as a direct result 
of the drive to improve the games mix as we continue to 
increase the proportion of player activity on higher hold 
games such as slots and jackpot slots. The launch of casino 
games (excluding slots) in Italy in July 2011 was also a positive 
factor helping to increase revenue in the second half. Overall 
net revenue increased to €262.7m (2010: €241.0m). Clean 
EBITDA increased by 17% to €92.5m (2010: €79.2m) reflecting 
the growth in net revenue and faster than expected synergies 
from the launch of the no-download casino for bwin 
customers, partially mitigated by the increased gaming 
taxes payable.
Actual results
The amount wagered increased by 38% to €7.1bn 
(2010: €5.1bn) reflecting the addition of the bwin casino 
business that increased gross revenue by a similar percentage 
to €283.3m (2010: €204.0m). As bwin had a much more casual 
player base with significantly lower average yields, bonus 
costs were also significantly lower and this fed through into 
net revenue that increased by 56% to €237.5m (2010: €152.1m). 
Clean EBITDA margins increased to 35.0% (2010: 34.6%) driven 
by the inclusion of bwin casino which generated additional 
scale economies. 
During 2011, we added 21 new games to our portfolio of 
which 14 were developed in-house. This remains a core 
element of our casino strategy and a key differentiator from 
many of our competitors. Our own proprietary slot games 
remain some of our most popular representing approximately 
50% of the amount wagered on casino slots in December 
2011. We continued to innovate with the launch of the first 
ever raffle jackpot slot and new jackpot slots that are now 
contributing towards our industry leading Big One jackpot 
that currently stands at over $5m. For the current year we 
have increased our production capacity and expect to launch 
28 new games in 2012. bwin.party

Average daily net

Active player days increased by 4% buoyed by the opening of 
the Italian casino market in July 2011 as well as the launch of 
our own no-download casino on bwin.com in November 2011. 
Player yields continued to benefit from our efforts to both 
improve the mix of games being played as well as increase 
yields from bwin casino customers. Since we launched the 
PartyCasino no download version on the bwin platform we 
have already started to see a marked improvement but yields 
still remain below that on PartyCasino which is why there 
was a decline on an actual basis. The net result was that 
average daily revenue in the period was up 9% on a pro forma 
basis, despite these factors, and up 57% on an actual basis.

There has been a small adjustment to 2010 numbers to 
reflect the fact that backgammon is now included within the 
casino & games vertical. Prior year comparatives have been 
adjusted accordingly. 
Pro forma results
On a combined basis, the Group’s poker networks continue 
to hold a significant share of the three major liquidity pools: 
dotcom, Italy and France although trading remains tough 
given the competitive nature of all markets. In the aftermath 
of the legal actions launched by the US authorities on 15 April 
2011, Full Tilt Poker was forced to close at the end of June 2011 
which helped the revenue performance in the second half. 
The Group is now a clear number two player ahead of iPoker 
in the dotcom market, while in France and Italy, where player 
liquidity is ring-fenced, we continue to hold market shares of 
15% and 14% respectively
1
. While net revenue declined by 7% 
year-on-year, the second half was stable versus the first half 
of 2011, reflecting the benefit from Full Tilt’s demise as well 
as the launch of cash game poker in Italy in July 2011. An 
increased focus on more casual players allowed us to reduce 
bonus costs to 20.5% of gross gaming revenue (2010: 23.1%) 
while other revenue benefited from another strong 
performance from our B2B partners in the period. The net 
impact was that total revenue fell by 6%. The impact of lower 
marketing spend in regulated markets meant that Clean 
EBITDA margins increased to 13.8% (2010: 12.2%) and Clean 
EBITDA increased by 6% to €29.4m (2010: €27.7m).

Actual results
The impact of the Merger, together with the launch of cash 
game poker in Italy resulted in a significant increase in gross 
revenue. The impact of lower bonus rates that fell to 21.1% 
of gross gaming revenue (2010: 25.5%) helped to drive net 
revenue to €184.6m, a 49% increase over the prior year 
(2010: €124.2m). Clean EBITDA increased by 32% to €25.5m 
(2010: €19.3m) due to the increased revenues arising from 
the Merger. However, margins fell from 15.4% to 13.6% due to 
the lower margin on the bwin poker business and increased 
gaming taxes payable on poker revenues in France 
and Austria.
A summary of the key performance indicators for poker 
during 2011 both on an actual and pro forma basis is shown 
in the table below:

Average daily net 
revenue (€000) 574.5 620.0 (7%) 505.8 341.9 48% 
While overall player activity was down year-on-year with an 
11% reduction in active player days and daily average players, 
this reflects our focus on overall player value management 
and in particular a shift in the ecology of our poker rooms. 
Our shift to a weighted contributed rake calculation for 
player points has helped us to rebalance the way that player 
rewards are distributed, making it better for the more casual 
player and reducing significantly our bonus costs. While this 
impacted player activity as a number of high volume players 
sought more generous offers elsewhere, the impact upon 
player yields has been positive, increasing by 4% . These steps, 
together with the closure of Full Tilt and the launch of Italian 
cash games meant that poker remained stable in the second 
half of 2011.

Pro forma results
The performance of our bingo business was somewhat 
disappointing with a softer performance in both Italy and to a 
lesser extent the UK. Gross gaming revenue declined by 9% to 
€130.4m (2010: €143.9m) reflecting a more intense competitive 
environment in both countries but particularly in Italy, where 
a number of operators have entered the market and Gioco 
Digitale’s first mover advantage has been eroded. In the UK 
a number of our competitors launched aggressive marketing 
campaigns in the second half that held back our financial 
performance. In an effort to defend our market position in 
both countries we increased bonuses as a percentage of 
gross revenue to 51.2% (2010: 50.5%) and while successful 
in maintaining a strong market position in both Italy 
(30% market share
3
) as well as the UK (estimated 29% market 
share
4
), it also meant that net revenue was impacted. Clean 
EBITDA reduced marginally year on year to €20.6m (2010: 
€21.1m) as the reduction in revenue was almost fully offset 
by a reduction in costs. 
Actual results
The addition of Gioco Digitale in Italy via the Merger was 
the primary driver behind the increase in both gross and net 
revenue in the period. Similarly, the 30% increase in Clean 
EBITDA to €19.8m (2010: €15.2m) was also primarily due to the 
Merger. We expect to launch a brand new bingo brand for 
Spain when the market opens later this year.

during 2011 both on an actual and pro forma basis is shown 
in the table below:

While actual player activity levels benefitted from the 
inclusion of Gioco Digitale, underlying player activity was 
down by 8% due to competitive pressures in each of our 
major markets. Player yields also fell on a pro forma basis 
reflecting increased bonus rates in an effort to hold market 
share coupled with a challenging economic climate. On an 
actual basis, the yield per active player day increased by 6% to 
€7.3 reflecting the higher yields enjoyed by the Italian bingo 
business. While average daily net revenue increased by 
14% on an actual basis it fell by 11% on a pro forma basis, 
reflecting the challenges faced in our two largest markets.

Other revenue
Other revenue, that includes revenue from network services, 
payment services to third parties, domain sales, WPT and 
InterTrader was up 20% to €20.2m on a pro forma basis (2010: 
€16.8m) and up 87% to €16.6m on an actual basis (2010: €8.9m). 
Cost of sales
The largest element within cost of sales is gaming duties 
payable in newly regulated and in some cases to-be-regulated 
markets. The full year impact of gaming duties in France and 
Austria together with just over seven months’ duties in Spain 
saw total cost of sales increase to €69.4m on a pro forma 
basis (2010: €41.9m) and to €55.7m on an actual basis (2010: 
€6.9m). Other items within cost of sales include television 
production costs in respect of WPT. As more markets regulate, 
cost of sales and in particular gaming duties as a proportion 
of total revenue can be expected to increase.
Other operating expenses
These are primarily merger and acquisition-related expenses 
totalling €17.4m (2010: €11.9m) on a pro forma basis and 
€12.0m (2010: €4.9m) on an actual basis. We still expect 
that the total amount of pro forma merger-related and 
restructuring-related costs, will be within the €50m 
estimate that we gave when the Merger was announced.
To-date a total of €29.2m of merger and acquisition 
related expenses and €7.8m of reorganisation costs have 
been incurred.
Share buyback programme
Having commenced our share buyback programme on 
6 September 2011, by 31 December the Company had 
bought back 15,710,401 shares for cancellation at a total 
cost, including commission of £19,915,861. Since the year end 
and up to 22 March 2012, the Company had purchased for 
cancellation a further 15,501,381 shares. The total number of 
bwin.party shares in issue as at 22 March 2012 is 821,882,694 
and the total number of voting rights in issue is 819,161,516

Distribution expenses as

Pro forma results
Overall distribution expenses, that represent the majority 
of the Group’s variable and marketing-related expenses, fell 
to 34.5% of total revenue (2010: 36.2%). The absence of the 
FIFA World Cup together with a more focused approach on 
marketing our core brands meant that customer acquisition 
and retention expenses fell year-on-year both in absolute 
terms as well as a percentage of total revenue, representing 
18.2% of total revenue in 2011 (2010: 21.1%). The scale of the 
reduction was flattered by the fact that in 2010 we conducted 
a major marketing push into the newly regulated French 
market in order to secure a meaningful market position that 
was not repeated in 2011. Affiliate costs increased to reach 
8.5% of total revenue (2010: 7.9%) due to increased affiliate 
activity around the closure of Full Tilt and Absolute Poker on 
29 June 2011. Third-party content costs such as software and 
brand licensing fees increased slightly to 4.1% (2010: 3.9%) of 
total revenue due to the strong growth in casino and games 
revenue relative to the other product verticals. Webhosting 
and technical services costs increased to 2.7% of total 
revenue (2010: 2.4%) reflecting our expansion into newly 
regulated markets.  bwin.party

Pro forma results
Transaction fees increased by 1%, in-line with the increase 
in revenue and remained stable at 5.3% of total revenue 
(2010: 5.2%). Staff costs remained flat in absolute terms 
as inflationary pressures were fully mitigated by synergy 
benefits. Outsourced services fell by 10% to €20.4m (2010: 
€22.6m) due to a reduction in the number and the off-shoring 
of certain technical contract staff. Other overheads have 
continued to fall throughout 2011 reflecting lower expenses 
incurred ahead of the launch into regulated markets in 2010 
and Merger-related synergies. The net effect was that Clean 
EBITDA administrative expenses fell to 32.7% of total revenue 
(2010: 34.9%).
Investment in additional infrastructure as part of the 
integration meant that depreciation increased to 2.6% of 
total revenue (2010: 1.8%). As expected, the nature of the 
assets acquired under the terms of the Merger meant that 
there was a large movement year-on-year related to the 
amortisation charge that totalled €124.3m or 15.2% of total 
revenue (2010: 6.3%). The impairment losses on intangible 
assets relate to proposed changes to the regulatory and fiscal 
landscape in a number of European countries, including 
Germany that remains the Group’s largest market as well as 
software acquired as part of the Merger, €15.3m of which was 
accounted for in the first half of 2011. Reorganisation costs 
increased slightly in the second half versus the first six 
months of the year reflecting the completion of the 
organisation blueprint. As mentioned above, total Merger-
related transaction and reorganisation costs are still 
expected to be within than the €50m originally announced.
Actual results
All administrative expenses increased due to the Merger. 
The largest absolute movement year-on-year relates to 
the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 
associated with the Merger (see note 10 to the financial 
statements on page 127). The underlying year-on-year 
movements are more easily explained using the pro forma 
figures above.

Taxation 
The tax credit for the period is €8.2m (2010: charge of €3.6m) 
reflecting an effective tax rate for Continuing operations 
of 2.0% (2010: 8.2%). The tax credit is caused by deferred tax 
arising from increased amortisation that is partially mitigated

Review of 2011
Continuing operations 
Underlying cashflow from operations remained strong. 
Adjusting for merger-related expenses and reorganisation 
costs that both increased versus the prior year, net cashflow 
from operating activities increased to €105.3m. Working 
capital movements were negative in the period primarily 
reflecting $30.0m of payments due under the NPA and the 
settlement of expenses associated with the Merger.
The Group’s share buyback programme began in September 
2011 and by the year end €23.2m had been spent out of the 
total cap of €75m to be achieved by the end of June 2012. 
The Group declared a half year dividend of €15.0m that 
was paid in October 2011 while investment in integration 
related activities and regulated markets as well additional 
infrastructure costs meant that capital expenditure 
increased to €28.8m. The purchase of investments relates 
primarily to investments in the Conspo joint venture and 
NewGame Capital. The effect of all these movements was 
that net cashflow from Continuing operations increased 
to €134.6m (2010: €71.2m).
Discontinued operations 
The decrease in trade and other payables is largely due 
to the ongoing semi-annual payments relating to the  
Non-Prosecution Agreement, netted against an increase 
in creditors in Ongame’s B2B business.
Principal risks 
The principal risks facing the Group are set out on pages  
55 to 57 and are unchanged from those reported in the 
Group’s Annual report for the year ended 31 December 2010 
and the Company’s prospectus and circular published on

Market snapshot
The global sports betting market is highly fragmented, with 
a large number of privately owned companies in addition to 
a few large publicly-listed operators. Excluding the US, the 
global online sports betting market was estimated to be 
worth €9.6bn in GGY in 2011, an increase of 6.9% on the prior 
year. This growth is forecast to continue, with the market 
worth an estimated €12.5bn by 2015, a CAGR of 6.8%

.
Success factors
Offering odds on a wide variety of sporting events is clearly 
important but so too is scale. By having a broadly-based pool 
of bets, a sports book operator is better able to manage its 
portfolio of risk. Punters bet against the house and so it is 
possible for the operator to lose money if it fails to set odds 
correctly. But, across a wide variety of bets and events, an 
operator should be able to make a positive return, or gross 
win margin. The increasing popularity of live betting means 
that operators also need to be able to offer an extensive

Sports betting is our second largest product vertical, 
generating total revenue of €260.6m (2010: €258.6m) or 32% of 
the total and Clean EBITDA of €64.3m (2010: €64.6m) 31% of the 
total

. The Group’s offer is led by the bwin brand, a pioneer in 
online sports betting, which today offers odds on more than 
90 different sports in 22 different languages with up to 30,000 
bets being placed simultaneously. We also operate a number 
of smaller brands including Gamebookers and PartyBets, 
which are focused on regional markets.
More than 100 bookmakers are responsible for managing our 
sports offer and work around the clock to manage odds on 
sports including all popular ball-related sports, US Sports and 
motorsport such as Formula 1 and MotoGP . By far our most 
popular sport is European football, where we offer odds on 
more than 500 leagues in over 100 different countries. 
As well as pre-event betting, we revolutionised the industry 
in 2002 with the creation of the first live bet on bwin.com, 
enabling customers to bet on sports events while they were 
taking place. We now offer live multi-bets and integrate real-
time streaming of audio and video coverage including all 
games in the German Football Bundesliga, games from the 
Spanish Liga BBVA (Primera Division), as well as the qualifiers 
for the Champions League, the Europa League and the 
European Championships.

How we make money:  
Gross revenue is total amount wagered less winnings. By 
offering odds that are attractive to customers, bookmakers 
seek to balance the portfolio of bets taken on a particular 
event so that they achieve a targeted return or ‘gross win 
margin’ based on the expected outcome. By predicting the 
correct result more often than not, a bookmaker can achieve 
an average gross win margin of 6–8% of the total amount 
wagered, depending upon the mix of live and pre-event 
betting that tend to generate different returns as 
summarised below

Mobile
Having launched our first mobile product in 2001, we have 
continued to innovate with the addition of dedicated mobile 
apps on a range of different platforms. In 2011 we launched 
an updated sports app for both of the major smartphone 
platforms, Apple’s iOS and Android, bringing together both 
live and pre-event betting for the first time. We also launched 
a prototype browser-based product that is optimised for 
tablet devices. These developments contributed to a 92% 
year-on-year increase in net sports betting revenue generated 
from our mobile channel. In 2012 our offer in sports betting 
will be further enhanced with the launch of a new touch-
based mobile portal and further optimisations to our existing 
apps portfolio.
Sponsorship
Sponsorship has always been a key aspect of the Group’s 
sports marketing programme and reflects our close 
connection with the world of sport. Our focus is on European 
football where bwin is the shirt sponsor for Real Madrid; is 
a premium partner to FC Bayern Munich; and is also the title 
sponsor of Italy’s second-tier football league, Serie B. Away 
from football, bwin sponsors MotoGP , the International 
Basketball Federation (‘FIBA’) European and World 
Championships, Euroleague Basketball and Pro Padel.
Each of our sponsorships is subject to a continuous process 
of evaluation including the impact on brand awareness and 
the media value obtained. Both Real Madrid and MotoGP 
have delivered outstanding media performance and brand 
awareness in Spain and Italy as well as across Europe. 
The total TV audience viewing figures for Real Madrid 
games exceeded five billion across European markets 
in 2010/2011 meaning that the bwin logo was on screen 
for more than 200 hours.

Market snapshot
Online casinos were some of the first online gaming 
sites to emerge in the mid-1990s and have been one of the 
best performing segments of the online gaming sector. 
Excluding the US, the global online casino market was 
estimated to be worth €5.0bn of GGY in 2011, up 10.2% 
versus 2010. It is forecast to reach €6.9bn by 2015, implying 
a compound annual growth rate of 8.4%

. 
Success factors
As players play against the house, player liquidity is not 
as important as in poker. However, scale does mean that 
an operator is able to offer larger jackpot prizes and this 
can act as a major draw for customers. Reputation is  also 
important as players need to be confident that games are fair 
and that if they win a major prize, the operator will pay them. 
Having a broad range of popular games that is continually 
being refreshed with new content is another important 
success factor, ensuring that players can always find a 
game they want to play.
Our offer
Our online casino business has a global footprint and is 
a market leader. In 2011, Casino & games generated total 
revenue of €263.7m (2010: €241.0m) or 32% of the total and 
Clean EBITDA of €92.3m (2010: €79.2m), 45% of the total
4
. 
These represent an increase of 9% and 17% over the 
previous year respectively.
In addition to our dotcom offer, our casino products are also 
now licenced in Italy (since July 2011) where we operate under 
the local Gioco Digitale brand and also in Denmark (since 
January 2012) under the PartyCasino brand. Table-based 
casino games are set to launch in Spain when the market 
regulates during 2012. 
PartyCasino is our largest brand and is the world’s largest 
online casino. In casino, ‘content is king’ and the Group has 
developed a unique portfolio of games including those 
produced by our in-house production team such as Loot’em 
Khamun, Aztec Gold and Kung Food. To supplement our own 
branded content, we partnered with several Hollywood 
studios and other companies to build an exclusive range 
of unique slot games including The Godfather Part I, Rambo, 
Terminator, Sin City, Gone With The Wind and Resident Evil. 
Developing our own games is a key point of differentiation 
from other operators that rely on third-party suppliers for 
their content. While this differentiation is a key attraction 
for customers, we also offer many well-established online slot 
games licensed from third-parties such as Monopoly, Midas 
Millions and Cleopatra.

As well as creating our own versions of existing games, we 
continue to develop new concepts such as Circus, the first 
role-playing slot game, and Raffle Jackpot which, instead of 
paying out on a certain outcome, is instead guaranteed to 
pay-out at a pre-determined time and date, just like a raffle. 
Our mega jackpots are some of the largest and most popular 
in the industry: our biggest jackpot winners include $4.5m 
that was paid out on our in-house produced Melon Madness 
slot. The chart opposite shows how our own games are an 
increasingly important driver of our casino revenues. 
The Group’s casino products are offered in both download 
and instant play variants, the latter, which is the most popular 
of the two options, does not require the installation of any 
software onto the customer’s computer. 
VIP
Just as in the land-based casino environment, high value 
players are an important feature of any online casino. As a 
result, we work hard to provide excellent customer support 
for our VIP players and seek to ensure that they are well 
looked after and have access to a variety of benefits including 
a concierge service and dedicated customer support. 
Mobile
Similar to sports betting, the mobile channel represents an 
exciting channel for future growth in our casino segment. 
In 2011 we enhanced our web-based mobile casino with 
the introduction of new games and through the expansion 
of the number of handsets supported on the Android 
platform. In 2012 we will add further titles from the 
PartyCasino offer and enter new regulated markets.

Market snapshot
Online poker is the third largest segment of the online gaming 
market. Excluding the US, the global online casino market was 
estimated to be worth €2.9bn of GGY in 2011, up 1.9% on 2010. 
It is forecast to reach €3.6bn by 2015, implying a compound 
annual growth rate of 5.7%
5
. 
The online poker market has experienced two major shocks 
over the past decade. The first was when the US enacted the 
UIGEA that prompted many of the world’s largest poker 
operators to withdraw from the US market. The second was 
in April 2011 when the founders of three online operators 
(PokerStars, Full Tilt and Absolute Poker/Ultimate Bet), were 
indicted by the US Department of Justice and their dotcom 
domains seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Whilst the legal proceedings against these individuals as well 
as related civil actions against the companies concerned have 
not yet run their course, the short-term impact prompted the 
collapse of Full Tilt and Absolute Poker/Ultimate Bet that had 
insufficient funds to repay their players. 
While our flagship brand, PartyPoker was able to pick up 
approximately 15% of Full Tilt’s active non-US player base, 
by far the greatest beneficiary was PokerStars that has 
consolidated its position as the world’s largest poker 
operator in the dotcom market. PartyPoker remains the 
second largest poker network
6
.
The regulation of certain markets has resulted in the 
fragmentation of the global poker player liquidity pool. 
In addition to the large dotcom liquidity pool, there is also a 
pool of ring-fenced player liquidity in France and a separate 
pool in Italy (i.e. Players in France cannot play against players 
in other countries). Denmark is a recent exception to this 
trend, its players being allowed to play against international 
players in the dotcom liquidity pool.
While the total online poker market is expected to grow over 
the next few years, given PokerStars’ size and player liquidity, 
they will remain a very strong competitor. However, an 
opening of the US online poker market could alter that course 
as it is not expected that PokerStars or other companies that 
continued to operate in the US post-UIGEA would be eligible 
to participate. 
Success factors
In addition to excellent software and safe and secure 
payments, having sufficient player liquidity is a prerequisite 
for success in online poker. It means that players can quickly 
find a table to play at the stakes they want. Being able to offer 
attractive tournaments and promotions are also important 
for success.

PartyPoker brand
4
 (see chart opposite). This position will be 
bolstered further in 2012, when we complete the migration 
of bwin Poker customers onto the PartyPoker network. 
In 2011 our poker segment generated total revenue of €213.0m 
(2010: €227.4m) or 26% of the total and Clean EBITDA of €30.0m 
(2010: €27.7m), 14% of the total
7
. 
While PartyPoker is our global poker brand, we will continue 
to operate bwinPoker due to both the strength of the bwin 
brand and also the importance of cross-selling poker to 
bwin’s sports betting customers. In France and Italy we 
operate ‘dot.national’ PartyPoker sites. In France a large part 
of our liquidity is driven through our strategic alliance with 
PMU, the French horseracing giant. In Italy our largest brand is 
GDPoker, part of the Gioco Digitale brand acquired by bwin in 
2010. The Group’s combined market share across all platforms 
in Italy is shown in the table opposite.
World Poker Tour
The World Poker Tour or ‘WPT’, while not included in our 
poker segment from a financial reporting perspective, is 
an important part of our overall poker offer. WPT was a major 
force behind the explosive growth in the early years of online 
poker, breaking new ground by televising high stakes 
tournaments that proved to be a hugely popular format. 
Televised coverage of poker games has soared since the WPT 
enabled viewers to see each player’s cards during a game, 
enhancing the broadcasting appeal of the game. 
Since its acquisition by the Group in late 2009, WPT has 
expanded its reach outside the US, hosting 22 main tour 
casino events in 2011 (2010: 17) in addition to ten new smaller 
events in the US (2010: 2). Now into its tenth season, WPT 
programming is broadcast in over 150 countries and the 
number of entrants who played in a WPT Main Tour event 
increased by 33% from 2010 to 2011. 
Mobile
From a relatively low base, our mobile poker offer grew 
significantly in the past year, gross gaming revenue was up 
by 410% following the successful introduction of dedicated 
iPhone and Android apps.
Whilst our mobile poker offer is mainly on bwinPoker, we plan 
to launch apps under the PartyPoker brand in 2012 as well as 
develop an HTML5-based product that works across multiple 
devices, channels and brands. Additionally our poker app is 
currently being optimised for tablet devices and a product 
launch is expected in the first half of 2012.

Growth in Global Bingo GGR (excluding US)
€m
Market snapshot
Bingo, our smallest product vertical, is a highly disparate and 
dynamic market. Excluding the US, the global online bingo 
market was estimated at €1.3bn of GGY in 2011, up 13.4% on 
2011. It is forecast by H2GC to reach €1.8bn by 2015, implying 
a compound annual growth rate of 8.5%. 
The UK is the world’s largest single bingo market, estimated to 
be worth €358.8m in 2011 (2010: €330.5m), our primary brand is 
Foxy Bingo, the UK’s number one bingo site supplemented by 
a number of secondary brands including Cheeky Bingo, which 
targets a younger demographic. Gioco Digitale is our leading 
brand in the Italian market.
Success factors
Like poker, player liquidity in bingo is important for long-term 
success. As a pari mutual game, the more players there are 
then the bigger the potential prizes on offer to customers 
that itself acts as a draw for customers. The online bingo 
experience has sought to replicate many of the offline bingo 
characteristics including the ability for players to socialise 
through online chat rooms. 
Another important success factor and business driver for 
online bingo operators are side games that are played while 
the main bingo game is taking place. 
Our offer
Our online bingo business generated total revenue of €64.6m 
(2010: €72.4m) or 8% of the total and Clean EBITDA of €20.6m 
(2010: €21.1m), 10% of the total
8
. Our primary markets 
for bingo are currently the UK and Italy where we have built 
leading market positions through the historical acquisitions 
of Cashcade and Gioco Digitale respectively. 
Currently our Cashcade brands remain hosted on a 
third-party platform until at least 2014. Gioco Digitale 
operates on its own bespoke platform. As we move to an 
integrated back-office, we will look to add bingo to our 
common platform.

Assessing key risks
We conduct a continuous process of Group-wide assessments 
that examine whether any risk has increased, decreased or 
become obsolete; identify any new risks, especially from 
recent key business events; and the likelihood of a risk 
occurring and what level of impact it would have on 
the Group.
Following the completion of the Merger, we held eight risk 
workshops across key business areas as well as for the 
executive team, that included the Co-CEOs, Jim Ryan and 
Norbert Teufelberger, the Chief Financial Officer, Martin 
Weigold, and the Chief Operating Officer, Joachim Baca.
In addition, the Group Risk Committee, chaired by 
Martin Weigold, has met twice since the Merger completed 
to ensure that all strategic risks were identified and to reach 
a consensus on the significant risks identified by the eight 
functional workshops. These risks are then reported to the 
Audit Committee for review.
The workshops also serve to impress the importance 
of risk management throughout all business functions. 
Facilitated by the Internal Audit & Risk Management team, 
the workshops involve key people from each of the Group’s 
prime functions including Technology, Marketing, each of the 
product verticals, Human Resources, Operations, Finance, 
Regulatory Affairs, Legal and Company Secretarial.
Many of the threats and challenges faced by online gaming 
companies are similar to those faced by other leisure and 
entertainment industries. They include competition, 
changes to consumer tastes, maintaining healthy financial 
ratios in compliance with banking covenants and loss of 
key personnel. 
The Merger has resulted in some changes to our key 
risks but our management of risk has not changed and 
reflects the previous approach adopted by both bwin 
and PartyGaming of asking: What if? 
Change in risk versus 2010 Rationale for change

changing systems

There are also certain risks that are more specific to  
bwin.party and to the online gaming industry that deserve 
particular mention. 
Our five main risk groups are:
• Technology
• Regulation and compliance
• Taxation
• Integration
• Unlevel playing field in poker
Technology
Technology is at the core of our business. Improving our 
gaming platform and products is a never-ending and vital 
process that maintains our competitive edge, keeps us 
abreast of evolving consumer tastes and upholds our 
valuable reputation for offering responsible, safe and 
secure gaming products. 
Most of our gaming technology is proprietary, which means 
that we are better placed to manage risks associated with 
technological and regulatory change than competitors that 
rely on third-party software and systems.
However, we share the industry’s general risks that arise from 
sourcing broadband and communications, data management 
and storage services as well as a raft of other services from 
external suppliers. We seek to offset these risks by not 
becoming overly reliant on any single supplier as well as 
having in place disaster recovery centres and business 
continuity plans across the Group.
The Merger has prompted an increase in technology risk as 
we migrate from separate platforms and systems to a single 
centralised operating system, one that supports four gaming 
verticals across multiple brands and territories. Other back-
office functions are also being harmonised and while less 
important from a revenue perspective, this also increases 
operational risk for the business. To mitigate this risk we have 
planned extensively and will run appropriate tests before 
switching to any new systems.
Regulation and compliance
Regulation is probably the most complex of our key risks and 
managing it effectively is a critical process for the Group, 
especially given the number of countries that are introducing 
regulatory regimes each of which have different requirements.
Our compliance obligations range from administration of 
our gaming licences in Gibraltar, Alderney, Denmark, France 
and Italy to assessing what impact country-specific and 
pan-regional rules and regulations might have on our business 
and the wider industry. Whilst political and cultural attitudes 
towards online gaming continue to evolve, there is always a risk 
that certain territories may seek to prohibit or restrict one or 
more of the products that we offer or online gaming entirely.
We have a dedicated regulatory and compliance function 
that reports directly to the Co-CEOs and is closely supported 
by our legal and country management teams. We undergo 
a series of external audits as required under our gaming 
licences and also perform our own compliance assessment 
process, ensuring that policies and procedures are being 
followed and are working effectively.
We advocate that the best way to protect consumers is to 
license and regulate online gaming with a commercially 
viable framework, one in which there is a greater incentive to 
be within the regulatory net than outside it. To do otherwise 
serves the interests of black-market operators that are only 
too happy to accept wagers from unsuspecting consumers 
focused on the best returns. Through our efforts, this is a 
concept that is now being grasped by several countries 
around the world and particularly so in Europe where a 
number of countries are actively considering developing 
their own regulatory regimes.
Taxation
Taxation is the third category of risk which we believe is 
material. Group companies operate for tax purposes only 
where they are incorporated, domiciled or registered. 
Revenues earned from customers located in a particular 
jurisdiction may give rise to further taxes in that jurisdiction. 
If such taxes are levied, either on the basis of existing law 
or the current practice of any tax authority, or by reason of 
a change in law or practice, then this may have a material 
adverse effect on the amount of tax payable by the Group. 
We manage these risks by considering tax as part of our 
overall business planning.

Integration
The process of integrating bwin and PartyGaming is 
extremely complex, requiring substantial management 
attention and other resources. While there can be no 
guarantee that all elements of the integration will be 
successful, the significant investment in planning and 
preparation ahead of the Merger has proved worthwhile. 
The main risks in this category are achieving financial 
synergies; the loss of key personnel; and the eventual 
migration of players to a single e-gaming platform. To ensure 
we remain on target, a dedicated Integration Management 
Office was established to, inter alia, drive and monitor 
progress across each of the synergy streams as well as 
identify constraints and inter-dependencies. The Board has 
put in place a series of incentive plans, the details of which 
can be found in the Remuneration Report, in order to ensure 
that key personnel are retained. There remains a risk 
associated with the migration of players to a single 
technology platform, however we have put together a 
detailed plan to ensure a smooth transition that will take 
place during the second half of 2012 and have already 
assumed a 15% player loss into our financial synergy 
targets disclosed at the time of the Merger. 
Unlevel playing field in poker
This risk arose principally from US-facing poker sites that 
up until 15 April 2011 had enjoyed a significant competitive 
advantage from the fact that they continued to accept 
wagers from US-based customers, providing superior player 
liquidity and cashflow that could be reinvested in European 
markets. However, following the steps taken on 15 April 2011 
by US authorities that resulted in the closure of the US-facing 
activities of PokerStars, Full Tilt and Absolute Poker/Ultimate 
Bet, this risk has now changed.
While PokerStars remains the largest operator in most 
markets and a very strong competitor, the risk level has been 
reduced to one of ‘strong competition’. Full Tilt Poker has 
been closed since losing its gaming licence on 29 June 2011 
and Absolute Poker/Ultimate Bet has also ceased trading.

Responsibility  
and relationships
A core objective is to embed acting responsibility into 
our business. As an industry leader, we aim to provide 
the world’s safest and most innovative gaming platform, 
one that is based upon customer trust, a desire for 
operational excellence and supported by evidence-
based scientific research. 
There is no set definition for corporate responsibility, but it is 
without question a complex area comprising many different 
components. We draw upon both internal and external 
expertise and procedures to uphold high standards. We have 
invested large amounts of human and financial capital in 
building the requisite trust and confidence in our products 
and brands: attributes that are valuable for our franchise 
and that we seek to protect.
As well as ensuring that we have a high level and independent 
oversight of our corporate and responsible gaming practices, 
our approach also covers wider corporate responsibility 
initiatives, including our contribution to society through 
charitable donations and a pro bono scheme that enables 
employees to take time out from work to support local 
community projects. 
Martin Weigold, Chief Financial Officer, has executive 
responsibility for our corporate responsibility matters, a role 
he has held since 2005. The overall process is overseen by 
the Ethics Committee of the Board chaired by Tim Bristow, 
an Independent Non-Executive Director. The Committee has 
three other Non-Executive Board members, Per Afrell, Helmut 
Kern and Lord Moonie who meet regularly to review ethical 
and social matters relating to all of our activities. 
There is no formal requirement to have an ethics committee, 
but the Board agrees that corporate responsibility is 
important for the Group’s long-term success. The Ethics 
Committee has a broad remit, including reviewing the 
adequacy of our corporate responsibility-related policies; 
proposals and procedures, which in turn include responsible 
gaming, compliance with our gaming licences, anti-money 
laundering, fairness and integrity of gaming systems; and 
our impact on the environment and communities where we 
have offices. 
The remainder of this section of the Annual report provides 
insight into our overall approach to each of our key 
stakeholder groups. 
Our focus is on the long-term returns that can be 
obtained from committed investment in responsible 
and sustainable business practices, particularly in 
relation to our core business and our key stakeholders 
including the communities where we have a 
physical presence.

GoodCorporation 
As part of our commitment to responsible and sustainable 
business practice, towards the end of 2011 we commissioned 
GoodCorporation to undertake an independent assessment 
of our management processes and policies regarding key 
stakeholders. GoodCorporation is recognised globally as 
a leading organisation working in the field of corporate 
responsibility and business ethics.
Assessment of 55 business practices impacting five 
stakeholder groups were conducted at six of our offices. 
The five stakeholder groups were employees, customers, 
shareholders, community, and management. Almost 150 
managers and employees were interviewed, equal to around 
5% of the total workforce as well as a number of our key 
external stakeholders.
For each of the stakeholder groups, the general scope of 
GoodCorporation’s independent assessment involved asking:
• Does a policy exist?
• Is there a system to implement the policy?
• Do records show that the system works in practice?
• Do stakeholders agree that it works and is fair?
Given that the assessment was conducted just nine months 
after the completion of our merger, during an intense period 
of integration activity and regulatory change, we were 
satisfied with GoodCorporation’s findings. We anticipated 
that the review would identify matters that needed to be 
addressed and areas where we could improve. Whilst we were 
aware of most of the items identified, there were also some 
additional issues raised and we plan to address these in 2012. 
Not surprisingly, many of the observations made by 
GoodCorporation related to unfinished integration work. 
For instance, there remained some inconsistencies across 
locations regarding employee contracts, policies and 
procedures. Many of these have already been rectified or are 
in the process of being updated. A number of issues will be 
and are being resolved through improvements in both 
internal communications and training.
At the positive end of the assessment spectrum, we were 
commended for our approach to corporate responsibility 
with GoodCorporation citing that: “The study on addiction 
and plans to use this to prevent problem gambling is industry-
leading.” As GoodCorporation noted, our challenge now is 
to convert the study on addiction into a workable model. 
This will take time, but we intend to make it happen. 
Our engagement with shareholders was also commended 
for “setting the standards for the sector”. 
The responsibility to rectify areas of weakness and also 
improve what is already working well falls upon our senior 
management team that has an action plan to implement 
during the course of 2012.

Millions of customers around the world 
place their trust in our promise to provide 
them with great entertainment in 
a safe and secure gaming environment. 
Trust  is more than a fundamental 
customer need: it is essential for our 
long-term success. 
We seek to engrain our approach to ‘act responsibility’ into 
everything we do. Our commitment to responsible gaming 
is underpinned by pioneering scientific research undertaken 
through our close collaboration with the Division on 
Addiction, Cambridge Health Alliance, a Harvard Medical 
School teaching Affiliate (‘DOA’).
Responsible gaming at bwin.party is built around three pillars:
Game fairness
Independent organisations closely monitor the fairness and 
random nature of our gaming products. We design our 
marketing communications to try and ensure that they are 
clear and not misleading and that they present a fair gaming 
offer. In addition, our in-house investigations teams and our 
experienced bookmakers work together to ensure customers 
are protected against fraud and manipulation. This protective 
shield is reinforced by our close cooperation with the 
European Sports and Security Association (‘ESSA’), an 
international non-profit organisation dedicated to 
promoting integrity in sports betting through the monitoring 
of bookmaker odds to identify suspicious betting patterns 
and report them within the framework of an early warning 
system to the relevant governing sporting body.
Keeping crime and corruption out of sports helps to ensure 
a level playing field for betting. The industry has developed 
a co-operation programme with the European Elite Athletes 
Association representing member associations from 15 
countries with over 25,000 professional athletes. The result 
has been a joint code of conduct to provide general advice to 
all athletes throughout Europe about the issues surrounding 
the integrity of sport and betting. In 2011, the code of conduct 
was accompanied by a comprehensive educational campaign 
carried out by top athletes in the locker room. Hearing about 
the dangers of corruption in sport and betting from 
fellow athletes has proven to be a powerful channel of 
communication and the programme has already reached 
more than 8,500 athletes. 
Protection of minors and vulnerable people
The vast majority of online gamblers play in a moderate way, 
purely as a means of entertainment – a claim that we can 
substantiate through analysis of our own players. However, 
gambling problems can arise for a small percentage of players 
– a number of national prevalence studies have shown that 
typically between 0.5% and 2% of populations are estimated 
to gamble excessively, possibly indicating pathological 
gambling. Our aim has been to understand our customers’ 
behaviour and to be able to develop player protection tools 
based upon a solid body of scientific evidence. It was this 
objective that prompted our close collaboration with the 
DOA to answer some fundamentally important questions:
• How do gamers play on the internet?
• How can we make online gambling safe? 
• Is it possible to create an algorithm to help identify online 
players who may be at risk? 
Since it began in 2005, this collaboration has resulted in the 
world´ s largest body of scientific evidence for online gambling 
based upon actual behaviour of tens of thousands of our 
customers.
The DOA has recognised the possibilities that the internet 
offers, utilising precise data about each individual gaming 
transaction to launch a stream of research documenting 
actual online gaming behaviour and creating new 
opportunities to develop safer online gaming environments.
Our gaming sites use several different verification 
mechanisms to prevent underage gambling and our policies 
are scientifically evaluated to protect players effectively.
Our approach to responsibility also led to the creation 
of our ‘Transparency Project’ that makes available 
all of the research data and studies online at:  
www.thetransparencyproject.org/ . 
To date, the collaboration with the DOA has resulted in 16 
scientific papers being published – three of them in 2011. 
All research is published only after a strict peer-review 
process in recognised international scientific journals.

We have continued to develop an international healthcare 
network to facilitate a valuable exchange of best practise and 
foster scientific -based co-operation for the prevention of 
problem gambling. Two more members joined the network 
in 2011 – the Federación Española de Jugadores de Azar 
Rehabilitados (Spain) and the Research Clinic on Gambling 
Disorders of Aarhus University Hospital (Denmark). 
A prime benefit of the network, which now spans seven EU 
Member States, is that customers can quickly access contact 
details for counselling services in several different languages. 
Other player protection mechanisms on our sites include 
deposit limits, self-exclusion and tools to help them assess 
whether they are at risk of developing a gambling problem. 
Soon after the end of 2011, we became a founding member 
of the ICT Coalition for a Safer Internet for Children and Young 
People (‘ICT’). Twenty-five of the world’s leading companies 
from across the information and communications technology 
sector are signatories to the ICT’s principles, which aim to 
ensure that children and young people obtain the greatest 
benefit from new technologies while avoiding the challenges 
and risks which are of concern to people worldwide. As well as 
bwin.party, other ICT members include Facebook, RIM, Nokia, 
Vodafone, France Telecom-Orange, LG Electronics and Google. 
(See: www.gsma-documents.com/safer_mobile/ICT_
Principles.pdf)
Player security
Security is a key priority. The protection of our players, 
especially their confidential data, is based upon the 
requirements of our gaming licenses and also the robust 
industry framework for self-regulation stipulated by the 
European Gaming and Betting Association (‘EGBA’). Protecting 
players also includes our compliance with the EU Money 
Laundering Directive and the reporting of any suspicious 
activity to the relevant authority. 
Following our engagement in 2010/11 with the European 
Committee for Standardisation to develop an evidence-
based standard for high level player protection on the 
internet, bwin.party has achieved certification for the 
134 control measures contained in the resulting CWA 
16259:2011 standard. 
Our efforts to take player protection standards to a higher 
level also involved working together with leading European 
non-profit organisations that included eCOGRA, which 
provides an international framework for best operational 
practice, and GamCare, the UK’s leading provider of 
information, advice, support and free counselling for 
the prevention and treatment of problem gambling. 
For our employees, we enhanced our online responsible 
gaming training programme in 2011. The training is called 
EMERGE (Executive, Management, Employee Responsible 
Gaming Education) and was developed by the DOA. 
Our efforts were rewarded in 2011 by being voted 
Socially Responsible Operator of the Year at the eGaming 
industry awards.

to corporate sustainability can be accessed at:

One of the unfortunate but inevitable 
consequences from a merger of equals is 
the need to remove duplicate roles across 
a number of disciplines. This is never an 
easy process. Having determined the right 
organisation structure, we then had to 
select the right people for the right jobs 
in the right locations. 
During 2011, 122 employees were made redundant with 
a further 81 due to leave during 2012. We put in place an 
Employee Assistance Programme, which includes utilising 
outplacement services where practicable, to help employees 
whose role was being removed to find a new job outside 
the Group.
Delivering the new organisation structure was of paramount 
importance: it marked the beginning of our future as one 
company. This was only the beginning of the process as we 
still had to meld different cultures, working practices, policies, 
reward schemes, training programmes and much more 
besides. We made great progress during 2011, but there 
are still things to do including:
• Unifying our approach to performance management, 
especially learning and development and the setting 
of measurable personal objectives;
• Ensuring that employees learn and benefit from bringing 
together different cultures; 
• Introducing a universal flexible approach to remuneration 
and benefits;
• Creating a new employer brand to articulate to current and 
future employees what it is like to work for bwin.party;
• Developing new employee values that enhance our business 
performance; and
• Rolling out a specially-developed leadership training 
programme for managers.
We believe that the investment we make in supporting 
employees with their continuing career development helps 
to create a sustainable approach to meet our current and 
future skill requirements. It also underpins our commitment 
to create a working environment that facilitates and 
enhances the career development and training of all 
employees. We provide employees with the time to develop 
skills and learn new ones to fulfil their personal potential.
Improving our internal communications remains a key focus. 
We know that a well-motivated and engaged workforce will 
understand and commit to our business strategy. We make 
extensive use of our intranet, strategy road shows, Town Hall 
meetings, email and other information channels – channels 
that are not just for managers to disseminate corporate 
messages, but also for employees to feedback to 
management, recognising the merits of open dialogue 
that flows throughout the organisation.

Just a few months after the completion 
of the Merger, our procurement systems 
became fully integrated using a single 
Enterprise Resource Planning system to 
govern each stage of the supply chain. 
Our procurement team in Gibraltar oversees the entire 
Group’s supply chain, adhering to policies and procedures 
that have been put in place to reduce risk, develop mutually 
beneficial long-term business relationships, and deliver best 
value from our suppliers on a long-term basis.
We have a large and diverse supplier base. Our affiliate 
network, which markets our online gaming brands, contains 
more than 11,200 unique active suppliers. In 2011 we used 
2,500 other suppliers for a diverse range of goods and services 
including; broadband and telephony services, advertising 
and marketing, computer hardware and software and media 
buyers. We conducted €10.5m of trade with our largest 
supplier and there were 33 other companies that were paid 
over €1.5m in 2011. 
Our procurement policy includes a ‘Supplier Acknowledgement 
and Self-Certification Checklist’, which requests information 
relating to:
• Financial strength, to ensure long-term reliability;
• Ability to deliver enduring quality and value;
• Commitment to innovation and their ability to help us 
develop new products, processes and ways of working that 
will give the Group a commercial advantage; and
• Commitment to a wider corporate responsibility agenda 
relating to the environment, labour/employment standards, 
equal opportunities and employee rights.
In return, we seek to operate to the highest professional 
standards and treat our suppliers in a fair and reasonable 
manner and aim to settle invoices promptly.
Our approach to investor relations is to 
be as transparent as possible through a 
regular programme of investor relations 
activities supported by transparent 
financial reporting.
The Merger combined two shareholder registers with 
different balances of institutional, retail and founder 
investors. Following completion there was some 
readjustment of the enlarged shareholder register, in part 
because a number of EU-based institutions were unable 
to hold sterling-denominated investments. 
We aim to build and maintain strong and long-term 
relationships with our investors and providers of capital 
through direct access to our senior management, a high level 
of financial and operational transparency, and regular 
investor road shows led by Jim Ryan and Norbert Teufelberger, 
Co-CEOs of bwin.party, supported by Martin Weigold, CFO and 
Peter Reynolds, Director of Communications. 
We raised the bar further with regards to our disclosure in 
2011, largely reflecting the demands to compare and contrast 
historic data and also to provide greater insight into our 
business strategy as a new company. 
Keeping analysts and investors informed about our 
trading performance and operational developments is 
also supplemented by a comprehensive investor section 
on the Group’s website where investors can access the 
latest consensus of analysts’ forecasts as prepared by 
an independent third-party, presentations and webcasts, 
share price tools and regulatory news announcements.
We know there is always room for improvement and we will 
aim to progress this year through the continued development 
of our corporate website www.bwinparty.com. For further 
information about our significant shareholders see page 98.

As an online business we believe that 
we are a ‘low-impact’ company from an 
environmental perspective, but we are 
not complacent. While we are a relatively 
small company in terms of numbers 
of employees versus many other 
corporations and produce little in the 
way of corporate ‘waste’, we do consume 
electricity and other basic utilities. 
As an international business we also 
spend money on travel and recognise 
that we can continue to try and reduce 
our environmental impact.
We aim to minimise energy and resource usage; support the 
reduction and recycling of materials; and ensure the legal 
disposal of all waste arising from the activities of the business 
throughout the Group. Wherever possible, product and 
materials purchased will be from sustainable sources with 
an emphasis on using recycled materials. 
Measures undertaken in our offices to reduce electricity 
consumption include switching off air-conditioning outside 
of normal office hours, using energy efficient light sources 
and ensuring computer and electrical equipment is switched 
off when not in use. 
We maintain tight control on employee travel. All flights by 
employees have to be approved by executive management. 
Greater use of video conferencing facilities between offices 
benefits the environment, our finances and also productivity 
by reducing travel time. We do not have a company car 
scheme and staff use public transport whenever possible.
As referenced above, we assess our suppliers’ commitment 
to a wider corporate responsibility agenda relating to the 
environment – this alignment of interests means that we can 
try and make a bigger difference with regards to our impact 
on the environment.
Our approach to reducing our environmental impact is not 
a new one – it was a common denominator for both bwin 
and PartyGaming. However, both companies differed in their 
approach to community engagement, with bwin heavily 
focused on advancing research in responsible gaming and 
tackling gambling addiction and PartyGaming’s bias towards 
greater community engagement through pro bono schemes 
and charitable donations to responsible gaming organisations 
and other worthy causes.
After assessing the merits of these differences, we decided 
to carry on with all of them. Why not? We have made some 
refinements, but we now house all of the elements under a 
single corporate responsibility roof. As highlighted in the 
‘Customers and responsible gaming’ section on pages 61 
and 62, our industry-leading research into gambling addiction 
will continue. So too will our philanthropy and community 
engagement – we plan that a greater allocation of our 
contribution to charities and good causes will be made 
available to the pro bono scheme that we plan to roll-out 
to former bwin offices in 2012. In aggregate we target 
approximately 0.2% to 0.25% of the prior year’s Clean EBITDA 
to be allocated for charitable and responsible gaming causes. 
At least 60% of which is earmarked for gambling-related 
charities such as the Gambling Research Education and 
Treatment Foundation in the UK and the establishment of the 
international healthcare network referred to above.
The pro bono scheme enables employees to spend 
4-8 hours of Company time on charitable, community or 
environmental projects so that they can enhance their 
personal development whilst returning something to 
our local communities. Whilst only former PartyGaming 
employees participated in pro bono initiatives in 2011, we 
are proud to say that a third of them took time out from 
work to provide help and support for the less fortunate in 
their local communities. We plan to extend the pro bono 
scheme to all of our main offices by the end of 2012.

Good corporate governance has become a necessary condition for 
sustainable success in business. The purpose of this section of the Annual 
report is to demonstrate how the Board oversees the interests of the 
Company through its operating structure and to review bwin.party’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’). 
This chapter comprises the following sections:
A Leadership
B How the Board functions
C Effectiveness
D Relations with shareholders
E Audit Committee Report
F Ethics Committee Report
G Integration Committee Report
H Nominations Committee Report
I Remuneration Report
J Other Governance & Statutory Disclosures and the 2012 AGM
While being strongly committed to good governance, the Company has 
undergone considerable change in the recent past and consequently did 
not comply with the Code in all respects during the reporting period. 
In particular, it did not comply in the following areas:
1 Less than half the Board are determined to be independent. 
This matter is addressed below on page 71.
2 The membership of the Audit Committee. However this was rectified 
on 31 March 2011 with the completion of the merger with bwin 
(see page 75).
3 The membership of the Remuneration Committee. However this was 
rectified on 31 March 2011 with the completion of the merger with 
bwin (see page 81).
4 In relation to various legacy share plans:
a) the performance-related elements of certain Executive Directors’ 
remuneration (see page 91);
b) executive share options being offered at a discount (see page 91); 
and
c) certain Non-Executive Directors holding share options 
(see page 91)
The explanations for these deviations and the actions that have already 
been taken or will be taken in an appropriate timeframe to remedy them 
are set out in this section.
Simon Duffy
Chairman
29 March 2012
Changes during 2011
During 2011 the following changes to the Board occurred:
• On completion of the merger with bwin on 31 March 2011, Simon Duffy, 
Norbert Teufelberger, Joachim Baca, Per Afrell, Manfred Bodner, Helmut 
Kern and Georg Riedl were appointed Directors on 31 March 2011. 
•  Rami Lerner stepped down as a Director and was replaced by Geoff 
Baldwin on 15 July 2011.
Simon Duffy succeeded Rod Perry as Chairman on 31 March 2011 and 
Rod Perry became the Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director, having been independent when originally appointed to the 
Board. Having served on the Board for six years, following a review of his 
independence by the Nominations Committee, Rod Perry was re-elected 
as a Director at the 2011 AGM.
The Chairman, Co-CEOs and Senior Independent Director
The responsibilities of the Chairman and the Co-CEOs are clearly defined 
and are summarised below:
Chairman
• Overseeing the effective running of the Board
• Ensuring that the Board as a whole plays a full and constructive part 
in the development and determination of the Company’s strategy and 
overall commercial objectives
•  Acting as the guardian of the Board’s decision-making process
• Promoting the highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate 
governance throughout the Company and particularly at Board level

Co-CEOs
•  Running the Company’s business
• Proposing and developing the Company’s strategy and overall 
commercial objectives, which they do in close consultation with 
the Chairman and the Board
• Responsible, with the executive team, for implementing the decisions 
of the Board and its Committees
• Promoting, and conducting the affairs of the Company with, the 
highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate governance
Senior Independent Director
As well as performing the normal duties expected of a Non-Executive 
Director, the Senior Independent Director is required to: 
•  Be available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact 
through the Chairman, Co-CEOs or CFO has failed to resolve or for 
which contact is inappropriate; 
•  Lead the Non-Executive Directors in evaluating the performance 
of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the 
Executive Directors;
• Maintain sufficient contact with shareholders to understand their 
issues and concerns; and
• Perform such other roles and responsibilities as the Senior 
Independent Director as may be contemplated by the Code or best 
practice guidelines in place from time to time.
Board independence
The Code recommends that at least half the members of a Board 
(excluding the Chairman) should be Non-Executive Directors who are 
independent in character and judgement and free from relationships 
or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, 
their judgement. 
During 2011 the Company has not complied with this recommendation. 
Prior to the completion of the merger with bwin on 31 March 2011, the 
Board was served by two independent Non-Executive Directors (Lewis 
Moonie and Tim Bristow), three non-independent Directors (Jim Ryan, 
Martin Weigold and Rami Lerner) and the Chairman of the of the Board 
(Rod Perry). A project to increase the number of independent Directors 
was instigated in 2010, but following the announcement of the proposed 
merger with bwin this recruitment exercise was suspended. 
Currently, excluding the Chairman, the Board is composed of five 
independent Non-Executive Directors (Rod Perry, Per Afrell, Tim Bristow, 
Helmut Kern and Lewis Moonie) and seven non-independent Directors 
(Joachim Baca, Geoff Baldwin, Manfred Bodner, Georg Riedl, Jim Ryan, 
Norbert Teufelberger and Martin Weigold). As part of the merger 
negotiations, both the bwin and PartyGaming boards agreed a balanced 
management structure was in the best interests of the combined Group, 
drawing upon the considerable management strength and experience 
of both organisations. The combined experience and knowledge of the 
bwin.party Board, coupled with continuity of leadership, have been 
critical to the initial stages of integrating the bwin and PartyGaming 
online gaming businesses, whilst also guiding the Group to focus on 
new business opportunities. 
Despite the technical imbalance of independent and non-independent 
Directors, the Board is satisfied that it has maintained a sufficient 
degree of independence for the following reasons:
• On the majority of business items considered by the Board, a non-
independent Non-Executive Director is independent, because the 
interests of the relevant founder shareholders and the Company 
do not conflict
• On issues when the interests of the Company and interests of a 
founder shareholder may conflict, mechanisms in the relationship 
agreement and/or letters of appointment for the non-independent 
Non-Executive Director allow the independent Directors to exclude 
them from the decision-making process
• The independent Directors have not been and will not be in a minority 
to the Executive Directors
• The Chairman of the Board was independent on appointment
• The Board had the appropriate balance of skills and experience 
to manage the imbalance appropriately
The Company stated in the Merger prospectus and circular that if the 
composition of the Board remained non-compliant with the Code’s 
independence recommendation on 31 December 2011, the composition 
of the Board would be changed by the appointment of two additional 
independent Directors to ensure compliance. For the reasons given 
above, the Board and in particular the independent Directors believe for 
the time-being sufficient independence exists to ensure the Board can 
operate effectively and in the best interests of shareholders as a whole. 
Furthermore, with 13 members the Board is already larger than the 
boards of most comparable companies. Therefore, rather than choosing 
to increase the size of the Board to comply with the Code’s independence 
criteria, which would have resulted in an unwieldy board of 15, the Board 
is going through a thorough Board performance evaluation using a 
third-party (see page 74) with the aim of reviewing how well the Board 
and its committees are operating and what improvements could be 
made to ensure it has the right experience and knowledge to lead 
the Company once the merger integration is complete. A statement 
regarding changes to the composition of the Board will be made 
later in 2012. 
The Board has also considered the review of Lord Davies of Abersoch 
entitled ‘Women on Boards’, published in 2011, which requested FTSE 
350 companies to set out aims for percentages of women serving on 
boards. Gender diversity on the Board will be an important factor the 
Nominations Committee will take into account when considering any 
new candidates to join the Board. However, gender is only one of a 
number of issues that the Nominations Committee must consider and 
the Directors will always regard a candidate’s experience, knowledge 
and skills as critical selection drivers. bwin.party will aim to appoint at 
least one woman to the Board by the end of 2013, with at least two 
women serving on the Board by 2015. Over that period the Board will 
also be reduced in size so that the percentage of women on the Board 
will be greater than it would be if it remained at its present size. bwin.party

B. How the Board functions
In accordance with the Code, the Company is headed by an effective 
Board, which is collectively responsible for the success of the Company. 
The Board provides entrepreneurial leadership of the Company whilst 
ensuring that a framework of prudent and effective controls exists in 
order to assess and manage risk.
Meetings
The Board and its committees met in Gibraltar throughout 2011 
and details of the number of meetings and attendance records are 
set out in the table overleaf. The agenda of Board meetings usually 
cover the following:
• Strategy, covering both the existing real-money gaming business 
(poker, sports, casino and bingo) as well as adjacent businesses such 
as social gaming, monetised digital gaming and payment systems
• Geographical expansion
• Operational and business performance updates
• Financial updates 
• Regulatory and licensing developments
• Industry consolidation opportunities
In order to ensure that the Board has an appropriate level of knowledge 
about the operations of the business and to enable it to assess the 
calibre of management below Executive Director level, members of the 
senior management team are regularly invited to attend meetings to 
present on and take part in discussions on particular items of business.
Following the independent assessment of the functioning of the Board, 
the Chairman will meet with the Non-Executive Directors individually 
to review governance issues. The Senior Independent Director has met 
with the Non-Executive Directors as part of the process of reviewing the 
performance of the Chairman and has communicated the results of that 
meeting to him. He will take account of the feedback in his future 
management of the Board and of governance issues. 
Responsibility and delegation
The Directors have adopted a formal schedule of matters reserved to 
the Board, setting out which issues must be referred to the Board for 
decision. These can be categorised into a number of key areas including 
but not limited to:
• Long-term business plan, strategy, budgets and forecasts;
• Restructuring or reorganisation of the Group and material 
acquisitions and disposals;
• The Group’s finance, banking and capital structure arrangements;
• Approval of capital expenditure and financial guarantees above 
certain levels;
• Financial reporting (interim and annual financial results and interim 
management statements);
• Dividend policy;
• Shareholder circulars, convening shareholder meetings and stock 
exchange announcements;
• Approval of the Group’s remuneration policy (following 
recommendations from the Remuneration Committee);
• Approval of the Group’s risk management and control framework and 
the appointment/re-appointment of the external auditors (following 
recommendations from the Audit Committee); and
• Approval of the Group’s policies in relation to corporate and social 
responsibility, health and safety and the environment

(iii) Lewis Moonie was absent in person from two meetings, because one meeting was convened in Gibraltar at short notice and in respect of the other meeting he had 
to remain in the United Kingdom to attend an important vote in the House of Lords. For both meetings he attended by telephone, however, the Company’s articles 
of association provide that any Director present by telephone from the United Kingdom cannot be regarded as present for the purposes of ascertaining a quorum bwin.party

 Governance
Internal controls
In accordance with the Code, the Board has reviewed, with assistance 
from the Audit Committee, the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems put in place to manage the 
risks attaching to the business in pursuing its strategic objectives. This 
review covers all material controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls. The Board is satisfied that the Company maintains 
an ongoing sound system for identifying, evaluating and managing risk.
For more information on this subject please see the Audit Committee 
report on page 76.
Tenure
The Company’s articles of association require every new Director to 
stand for re-election by shareholders at the next AGM immediately 
following their appointment. Thereafter each Director is required to 
seek re-election by shareholders at an AGM at least once every three 
years. The Code, however, recommends that Directors stand for 
re-election annually and in accordance with this recommendation, 
all the Directors are seeking re-appointment at the 2012 AGM.
The tenure of the current Board is as follows:
Number 
of Directors
Period 
of service
8 Less than 12 months
1 3–4 years
2 4–5 years
2 6–7 years
Succession 
The Nominations Committee keeps under review the succession plans 
for Directors and senior managers. In doing so, the Nominations 
Committee focuses on whether the Board is appropriately diverse with 
a range of generalist and specialist knowledge and skills. For further 
information please refer to the Nominations Committee report.
Insurance and indemnity
bwin.party maintains an insurance policy for its Directors and 
officers and the Company has also entered into deeds of indemnity 
with its Directors.
C. Effectiveness
Information flow to the Directors
The Chairman oversees, with the assistance of the Company Secretary, 
the process of ensuring that all Directors receive timely and accurate 
information in order to enable them to perform their duties. 
Management provides detailed information ahead of each Board or 
Committee meeting and additional information or updates between 
meetings when deemed necessary. 
Each Executive Director is readily available to the Non-Executive 
Directors if the latter should need clarification or amplification on any 
information provided. All the Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring Board procedures are complied with and advising the Board 
through the Chairman, on all governance matters. 
Independent legal advice
The Board has adopted a procedure for Directors to seek independent 
professional advice at the expense of the Company if they judge it 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities as Directors. Each 
Committee of the Board also has authority under its terms of reference 
to obtain outside legal or other independent professional advice if the 
Committee considers it necessary in order to perform its duties.
Induction and ongoing training
Each new Director receives a full induction on joining the Board 
and major Shareholders are offered the opportunity to meet new 
Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman ensures that all Directors 
continually update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the 
Company to fulfil their roles on the Board and Board Committees 
via reports and information collated by management, the Company 
Secretary and the Company’s advisers. 
Performance evaluation
Each year the Directors undertake a formal evaluation of the 
performance of the Board, its Committees and of individual Directors 
during the prior year. The evaluation of 2010’s performance (carried 
out in early 2011) resulted in a review of the content and format of 
management’s reports to the Board and a decision to increase the 
frequency of presentations by senior managers to Board meetings. 
Each year the Board has utilised the services of a third-party corporate 
governance consultancy to assist in the evaluation process. Even though 
the Board has existed in its present form for less than a year, for the 
review of 2011’s performance, carried out in early 2012, the Board 
decided to use the services of Lintstock Limited, a third-party corporate 
governance adviser, to carry out a full questionnaire and interview 
process. More information on the performance evaluation process is 
set out in the Nominations Committee’s report on page 79.
D. Relations with Shareholders
The Directors recognise the importance of maintaining effective 
communications with shareholders. This is serviced in the 
following ways:
• Throughout the year the Co-CEOs, Chairman and Director of 
Communications meet with existing and potential institutional 
investors
• All Directors attend the Annual General Meeting and shareholders are 
invited to attend and ask questions either during or after the meeting. 
Notice of the AGM is set out on page 158 of this document and details 
of the meeting are set out on pages 100 and 101. In accordance with 
the Code, the AGM notice has been dispatched to shareholders more 
than 20 working days before the AGM
• The corporate website contains useful information for all 
shareholders on the Company’s strategy, financial results, 
share price and announcements Overview 02

E. Audit Committee Report
Purpose
The Board is required by the Code to establish formal and transparent 
arrangements for considering how it should apply the required financial 
reporting and internal control principles and for maintaining an 
appropriate relationship with the Company’s joint auditors, BDO LLP 
and BDO Limited. 
Membership
The Board has done this by appointing an Audit Committee. 
The members of the Audit Committee are:
• Helmut Kern (Chairman)
• Tim Bristow
•  Rod Perry
Helmut Kern has recent and relevant financial experience and was 
appointed to the Audit Committee with effect from 31 March 2011. 
From 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2011 Lewis Moonie chaired the Audit 
Committee and Tim Bristow was regarded as the member with relevant 
financial experience. 
The Code recommends that a minimum of three independent directors 
should serve on the Audit Committee. From 1 January 2011 to 31 March 
2011 the Company was not compliant with this recommendation, 
because there were only two independent Directors serving on the 
Board. Since 31 March 2011 the Audit Committee has complied with 
the Code in having three independent Directors. 
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee has adopted terms of reference, approved by 
the Board that are available on the Company’s website: http://www.
bwinparty.com/AboutUs/CorporateGovernance/AuditCommittee.aspx. 
In summary the main responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to:
• Consider and make recommendations to the Board as regards the 
appointment of the head of the internal audit function and also the 
external auditors as well as the re-appointment of the latter;
• Recommend the audit fee to the Board and develop and recommend 
to the Board bwin.party’s policy in relation to the provision of non-
audit services by the external auditor;
• Monitor the integrity of the financial statements of bwin.party and 
any formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial 
performance and to review, and challenge where necessary, the 
actions and judgements of management in relation to the half-year 
and annual financial statements before submission to the Board;
• Meet with the external auditors post-audit at the reporting stage to 
discuss the audit, including problems and reservations arising from 
the audit, and any matters the auditor may wish to discuss (in the 
absence of management, where appropriate);
• Make recommendations to the Board concerning any proposed, 
new or amended accounting policy;
• Monitor and review the internal audit programme and its 
effectiveness; 
• Ensure co-ordination between the officers responsible for internal 
audit and the external auditors, and that the internal audit function 
is adequately resourced and has appropriate standing within  
bwin.party;
• Consider any major audit recommendations and the major findings 
of internal investigations and management’s response (in the 
absence of management, where appropriate); 
• Monitor and review bwin.party’s systems for internal control, 
financial reporting and risk management; and
• Reviewing the individual internal audit reports covering various areas

Audit Committee 
Report
December:
– Group risk register
– Latest internal audit status report and ongoing projects
– Follow-up in respect of the management letter arising from the 
last audit
– Updated code of conduct and whistle-blowing policy
– Updated report from the external auditors on their plans for auditing

At these meetings, members met with management and with the 
internal and external auditors. The Audit Committee members also met 
privately with the external auditors and separately with the internal 
audit function, without management representatives present. 
Through these meetings and review process the Audit Committee has 
satisfied itself that proper and satisfactory internal control systems 
remain in place to identify and contain business risks and that the 
integrity of the Company’s financial reporting is sound. In doing so the 
Audit Committee continues to exercise its authority to seek any 
information it requires from any employee of the Company.
In 2012, the Audit Committee has met once to review and recommend 
the approval of the 2011 full year results and the 2011 Annual Report.
Risk management and effective internal controls
The section, ‘Key risks’ on pages 55 to 57 of the Annual report sets out the 
main risks impacting the Group’s business.
bwin.party maintains a robust system of internal control for the purpose 
of safeguarding the investment of shareholders in the Company and the 
Group’s assets. At least annually the Board conducts a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls, covering all 
material controls, including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems. bwin.party’s system of internal 
control reduces the probability that business risks might impede the 
Company in achieving its objectives, but it cannot eliminate these risks 
and can therefore provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The Group has an internal audit department, which also carries out the 
Company’s risk management monitoring. During the year, management 
identified the risks attaching to the business and, on an ongoing basis, 
efforts are being taken to mitigate these risks. Throughout the year 
bwin.party’s internal auditors performed internal audits of offices and 
departments within the business to assess whether adequate internal 
controls are in place to protect the Group, its employees and 
shareholders. The internal audit reports are presented to the Audit 
Committee and the Head of Internal Audit meets regularly with the Audit 
Committee as well as Chairman of the Audit Committee, to whom he has 
direct access.
In accordance with the guidance contained in the Turnbull Report, the 
Board, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, has completed its 
annual review of the effectiveness of the internal system of control, 
and is satisfied that it is in accordance with that guidance.
The Group continues to adopt and publicise a formal ‘whistleblowing’ 
procedure by which employees can, in confidence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in financial or other matters. This procedure is set 
out in the Group’s employee handbooks and has been reviewed by the 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is satisfied that arrangements 
are in place for the proportionate and independent investigation of such 
matters and for appropriate follow-up action.
External Auditors
During the year ended 31 December 2011, BDO LLP was appointed under 
an engagement letter to act as auditors to enable the Company to meet 
its obligations to prepare financial statements in accordance with the 
Listing Rules. For the purposes of filing the Company’s financial 
statements in Gibraltar, BDO LLP and BDO Limited have been appointed 
to act as joint auditors to allow an audit report to be issued under 
section 10 of the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999.
In accordance with its duties, the Audit Committee made 
recommendations to the Board on the appointment of the external 
auditors, approved their remuneration (both subject to Shareholder 
approval) and also approved their terms of engagement. The Audit 
Committee has also established a policy regarding the appointment of 
auditors to perform non-audit services for the Group and will keep this 
under continual review. This policy dictates that in the Company’s 
financial year, the total fees for non-audit services provided by the 
external auditors, excluding non-audit fees for due diligence for 
acquisitions and other specific matters noted below, should not 
exceed the total fees for audit services they provide. In the year 
ended 31 December 2011, the proportion of total non-audit fees 
to total audit fees paid to the external auditors was 0.09:1.0.
In addition to their statutory duties, BDO LLP is also employed where, 
as a result of their position as auditors or for their specific expertise, 
they either must, or the Audit Committee accepts they are best placed 
to, perform the work in question. This is primarily work in relation to 
matters such as shareholder circulars, Group borrowings, regulatory 
filings and certain business acquisitions and disposals. In such 
circumstances the Audit Committee will separately review the specific 
service requirements and consider any impact on objectivity and 
independence of the auditors and any appropriate safeguards to this. 
As such the Audit Committee believes it appropriate for these non-audit 
services to be excluded from the 1:1 ratio set out above. In the year 
ended 31 December 2011 the total fees paid to the external auditors 
in respect of due diligence for acquisitions was €0.17 million.

Report
H. Nominations Committee Report
Purpose
The Board has adopted a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new Directors to the Board by appointing a 
Nominations Committee to lead the process of appointment and make 
recommendations to the Board. The Nominations Committee also 
advises the Board on its structure, size, composition and matters of 
Director and senior management succession. 
Membership
The members of the Nominations Committee are or have been:
• Simon Duffy (Chairman) (appointed 31 March 2011)
• Per Afrell (appointed 31 March 2011)
• Rod Perry
• Manfred Bodner (from 31 March 2011 to 15 March 2012)

• Helmut Kern (from 31 March 2011 to 15 March 2012)
• Lewis Moonie (until 15 March 2012)
• Georg Riedl (from 31 March 2011 to 15 March 2012)
• Jim Ryan (until 15 March 2012)
• Norbert Teufelberger (from 31 March 2011 to 15 March 2012)
From 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2011, Rod Perry chaired the 
Nominations Committee and Rami Lerner was a member.
Responsibilities
The Nominations Committee has adopted terms of reference, 
approved by the Board that are available on the Company’s website: 
http://www.bwinparty.com/AboutUs/CorporateGovernance/
NominationsCommittee.aspx. In summary, the main responsibilities 
of the Nominations Committee are to:
• Regularly review the structure, size and composition (including the 
skills, knowledge and experience) required of the Board compared 
to its current position and make recommendations to the Board with 
regard to any adjustments that are deemed necessary;
• Give full consideration to succession planning for Directors and other 
senior management in the course of its work, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Company, and what skills and 
expertise are needed on the Board in the future; 
•  Be responsible for identifying and nominating candidates for the 
approval of the Board, to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise; 
and
• Make recommendations to the Board concerning the re-appointment 
by shareholders of any Director.
Business during the year
During 2011 the Nominations Committee met twice to deal with the 
following business:
February:
– Agree the recommendation for the re-appointment of certain 
Directors at the 2011 AGM
– Review the Committee’s work and its terms of reference
December:
– Review the Board’s composition, size, independence and diversity 
The composition and size of the Board changed significantly in March 
2011 following the completion of the Merger. The Board has functioned 
well and effectively in overseeing the Merger integration process as 
demonstrated by the fact that bwin.party is now forecasting larger 
synergy savings than forecast when the Merger was originally proposed. 
The Nominations Committee, however, is mindful of both the Board’s 
size and the independence issue, as well as of the need to ensure it has 
an appropriate balance of skills and experience. Consequently, 
as disclosed on page 74, in 2012 the Board has undergone a detailed 
performance evaluation with Lintstock Limited, an experienced 
third-party corporate governance adviser. The aim of this exercise has 
been to review how well the Board and its committees are operating 
and what improvements can be made to ensure the experience and 
knowledge of the Board are appropriate to lead bwin.party beyond 
the Merger integration stage. This process required each Director to 
answer a series of questions on the performance of the Board, the 
Chairman, individuals and committees and was followed up by each 
Director being interviewed by Lintstock’s consultants. The results will 
be presented to the Nominations Committee and the Board once the 
Chairman has discussed the conclusions of the review with each 
Director individually. Thereafter the Nominations Committee will agree 
what recommendations to make regarding the Board’s composition. 
Terms of appointment
The letters of appointment for each of the Non-Executive Directors 
do not specify a fixed term of appointment. The Board has resolved, 
however, that if any Non-Executive Director remains in office for a 
period of six years, having satisfied annual performance evaluations and 
been re appointed by shareholders at an AGM at least twice, then that 
Non-Executive Director’s re-appointment will be subject to a review by 
the Nominations Committee and Board, both bodies taking into account 
the need to maintain an active and progressive Board. The Board does 
not expect that any Non-Executive Director will serve for a period of 
greater than nine years.
The Code recommends that notice or contract periods for Directors 
should be set at one year or less. As disclosed in the Remuneration 
Report on pages 93 and 94, the notice periods for all the Directors 
comply with this recommendation.
The letters of appointment for the Non-Executive Directors and the 
service agreements for the Executive Directors will be available for 
inspection 30 minutes prior to and during the AGM.

Directors’ Remuneration 
Report
I. Directors’ Remuneration Report
Introduction
bwin.party continues to operate in a dynamic and challenging 
environment and it remains a core objective of the Group’s 
remuneration policy to provide competitive remuneration packages 
that support the business and its strategic goals, by recruiting and 
retaining high calibre individuals. It is essential that these individuals 
have the necessary skills and entrepreneurial drive to grow this fast 
moving business and ensure bwin.party continues to be a leader in 
digital entertainment.
The Merger has been a time of significant change for employees and has 
raised retention challenges for the business. Simultaneously, the United 
States looks increasingly likely to introduce regulated online poker 
which, while a welcome business growth opportunity for bwin.party, 
creates additional employee retention issues, as US and other operators 
seek to build up their online gaming teams and look to bwin.party as a 
valuable source of knowledgeable and experienced staff. Despite these 
challenges, the remuneration policy, based on the new equity plans 
introduced in 2011, continues to attract, incentivise and retain the 
experienced online gaming experts and entrepreneurs who are key 
to bwin.party’s success. 
The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the Company’s risk 
policy against the operation of the Company’s incentive plans to ensure 
that their operation is consistent with this policy. The Committee 
believes that the opportunities within the incentive arrangements are 
warranted by the challenges set out above and that these arrangements 
encourage the sustainable long-term value of the Company.
This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board in accordance 
with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the ‘Regulations’). The report 
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied 
the principles and complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code relating to Directors’ remuneration. An advisory 
resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting on 7 June 2012. 
The auditors are required to report on the ‘auditable’ part of this report 
and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report Regulations 2002. BDO LLP and BDO Limited have audited the 
sections headed ‘Summary of the long-term incentive plans’ and 
‘Total emoluments overview’ to the extent they are required to 
do so by the Regulations.

Purpose of the Committee
The Board has appointed the Remuneration Committee to oversee 
the remuneration policy and practices adopted by the Group. The 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on bwin.party’s website, 
http://www.bwinparty.com/AboutUs/CorporateGovernance/
RemunerationCommittee.aspx.
The key objectives of the remuneration policy are to:
• Establish competitive remuneration terms that allow the Group 
to recruit, retain and incentivise the most talented managers;
• Promote the achievement of bwin.party’s rolling three-year business 
strategy through the provision of appropriate targets that stretch 
and motivate employees to deliver on the strategic objectives;
• Ensure effective risk management and sustainable performance 
is encouraged through reward; and
• Ensure senior executive remuneration is aligned with the interests 
of bwin.party’s shareholders and other stakeholders
The Committee’s main responsibilities are:
•  Agree the remuneration policy for the Chairman of the Board, 
Executive Directors, Company Secretary and senior executives 
(together the ‘Senior Officers’) and review regularly the ongoing 
appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy;
• Ensure the remuneration policy provides for individuals to receive 
appropriate remuneration and incentives to encourage enhanced 
performance and to be rewarded, in a fair and responsible manner, 
for their individual contributions to the success of the Group;
• Review annually the total individual remuneration package of the 
Senior Officers;
• Liaise with the Nominations Committee to ensure that the 
remuneration of any newly appointed Senior Officer is within the 
Company’s overall remuneration policy;
•  Set and monitor performance criteria for any bonus arrangements 
for the Senior Officers and the framework of the bonus structure for 
staff generally;
•  Approve the length and terms of all service contracts and the 
appointment letter for the Board Chairman and Executive Directors;
•  Review and approve the introduction of new share option and share 
award schemes, set or recommend the performance criteria for 
awards, determine each year whether awards will be made and the 
overall amount of the awards and approve any awards proposed for 
Senior Officers; and
• Approve the terms of termination of the Chairman of the Board or any 
Executive Director and ensure such terms are fair and reasonable and 
not excessive, that failure is not rewarded and that the duty to 
mitigate loss is fully recognised Overview 02

Advisers
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) in London provides guidance 
to the Remuneration Committee on remuneration trends, short and 
long-term incentives and general market remuneration developments. 
PwC was appointed by the Committee following a tender process 
in mid-2010 in which a number of potential advisers participated. 
A separate department of PwC provided an internal audit review of 
bwin.party’s marketing function during 2011, however this work was 
completely unrelated to and segregated from the work performed by 
PwC’s remuneration consultancy and in the Remuneration Committee’s 
view did not undermine their independence. Whilst Helmut Kern was 
a management consultant partner with PwC in Austria until October 
2011, he was not a Director when PwC were appointed and took no part 
in any decision regarding their continued appointment. His function 
with PwC Austria was completely independent of and segregated from 
the work performed by PwC’s remuneration team in London. 
The Company Secretary is the secretary to the Remuneration 
Committee. 
In performing its duties during the year, the Remuneration Committee 
consulted with the Chairman of the Board, the Group Human Resources 
Director, the Co-CEOs and the CFO. The Remuneration Committee 
ensured, however, that no individual was involved in any decisions 
about their own remuneration.

Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy continues to be to provide market-
competitive total remuneration packages enabling the business to 
recruit and retain high calibre entrepreneurs required to drive the future 
growth and performance of its business. The online gaming sector 
continues to be a highly competitive and dynamic environment and 
the following key factors are taken into account:
– The nature of the market in which the Group operates and, in 
particular, the fact that the regulation and legality of online gaming 
varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, is subject to uncertainties and 
may be impacted by adverse changes to regulation of online gaming 
or the interpretation of regulation by regulators;
– The need for incentive arrangements to incorporate suitable 
risk adjustment provisions to ensure executives do not receive 
unjustified windfalls;
– The need to attract and retain key talent and drive high performance; 
– Increasing regulation impacting the Group’s margins due to 
additional cost of compliance and taxation;
– The requirement for the Executive Directors and certain senior 
executives to relocate and discharge all of their responsibilities 
from Gibraltar;
– The opening of the US online gambling market under a federal or state 
licensing regime, together with the timing of such a development, 
may have a substantial impact on the Group’s financial and share 
price performance. The remuneration policy has to be flexible and 
durable enough to accommodate these changes without becoming 
compromised; and 
– The need to reconcile UK corporate governance guidance with 
market remuneration practices in all jurisdictions where the Group 
has employees
In this context particular focus is placed on providing a share-based 
remuneration package appealing to entrepreneurial and innovative 
executives. The current share-based awards were designed in 2010 and 
introduced in 2011 following the completion of the Merger and aim to 
take account of the risks associated with the online gaming business 
and seek to address the following:
– Long-term incentives with standard three-year performance periods 
are difficult to use to motivate and retain senior executives due to the 
fast moving nature of the market;
– Comparative total shareholder return targets are inappropriate as 
even direct industry comparators have a different focus on the 
various gaming verticals and different risk exposure;
– Incentives need to be flexible enough to deal with the changing 
regulatory environment in which the Group operates; and
– The remuneration challenge for the Group is to have remuneration 
arrangements in place where part of the reward provided to senior 
executives is linked to shareholder return and is not completely 
undermined by the risk factors impacting the sector and the Group
As a result of the above considerations, the Group has adopted a highly 
leveraged incentive policy to ensure that the profile of the remuneration 
on offer is supportive of the Group’s business strategy and the effect of 
legislative changes. In conjunction with this approach, the policy adopts 
comparatively modest elements for the fixed elements of the total 
remuneration package, with generally lower to median quartile salaries, 
minimal benefits and no pension provision.
Comparator groups
The Remuneration Committee has adopted a combination of the 
following comparator groups to benchmark its remuneration:
(i) Companies in the FTSE 250 Index;
(ii) Companies in the FTSE 51–100;
(iii)  A bespoke comparator group of the following international companies:

Median to  
Upper Quartile
This supports the performance based culture of the Company. Fixed costs are minimised and total 
short-term remuneration will only reach and exceed the median if the performance-based bonus is earned 
for the relevant financial year. In certain circumstances, the Remuneration Committee will, at its discretion, 
set base salary outside of policy in order to secure the recruitment and retention of the appropriate 
individual for the role. In such cases the Committee will take into account factors such as the individual’s 
skills and level of experience.
The policy in respect of long-term incentives and 
potential compensation value is an extension 
of the policy on total short term remuneration. 
Executive Directors will only receive a market 
competitive package if the annual bonus and long-
term incentives are earned.
The charts on page 84 show the on target and maximum compensation for each of the Executive Directors based on the following assumptions for 2012:

The Committee also considers corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’) issues when setting the remuneration 
of Executive Directors and senior managers, ensuring these good practice objectives are appropriately addressed in each individual’s objectives. 
The Remuneration Committee also reviews whether incentive structures may raise ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour 
and is of the view that this is not the case with the current incentive structures. bwin.party

Joachim Baca COO £428,500 £446,000 4.1
Martin Weigold CFO £428,500 £446,000 4.1
When determining the base salary of the Executive Directors the 
Committee takes into consideration:
• The levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable 
status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar 
size and complexity;
• The performance of the individual Executive Director; 
• The individual Executive Director’s experience and responsibilities; 
and
• Pay and conditions throughout the Company. The Committee has 
access to pay and conditions of other employees within the Group 
when determining remuneration for the Executive Directors and also 
considered the relationship between general changes to pay and 
conditions within the Group as a whole. The general increase in 
salaries across the Group was 3 to 4%
The Committee uses comparisons with caution to avoid increasing 
remuneration levels without a corresponding improvement 
in performance. 
b. Benefits
Policy – Lower Quartile of Comparator Groups
Benefits only include private medical insurance, permanent health 
insurance and life assurance. In line with the remuneration policy the 
level of fixed costs incurred as part of the executive remuneration 
package has been set at the minimum level. Details of the monetary 
values attributable to these benefits for 2011 are set out in the 
emoluments table on page 95.
c. Pensions 
Policy – No pension provision
During 2011 there was no company pension scheme in Gibraltar. In April 
2012 the Group is introducing a flexible benefits programme and this will 
provide the option for employees to contribute to a company provided 
pension, with a modest contribution by the employing entity of 1% of 
salary if the employee contributes at least 3% of their salary.
d. Incentives 
(Bonus and long-term incentives)
Policy – Upper Quartile of Comparator Groups
The incentive plans remain a core element of the remuneration policy in 
incentivising and retaining executives and aligning their interests with 
those of bwin.party’s shareholders.
During 2011 the Executive Directors participated in the Bonus Banking 
Plan and Value Creation Plan, which were both introduced in 2011 in 
conjunction with the Merger and following extensive shareholder 
consultation and a binding vote at the extraordinary general meeting 
of the Company’s shareholders on 28 January 2011. 
(i) Bonus Banking Plan (‘BBP’)
The key features of the BBP are:
• In 2011, at the beginning of the plan period of three financial years, 
participants were given a plan account to which contributions will 
be made
• No contribution is be made to a participant’s plan account unless the 
performance criteria are met
• Each participant has a maximum annual contribution as a percentage 
of salary, set out in the table overleaf, which provides the following 
total cash opportunities for the Executive Directors bwin.party

Top tier senior managers 150–200 236–690
* Total Cash is base salary plus targeted levels of bonus. It should be noted that under the BBP 50% of the element earned is deferred in shares.
• The Remuneration Committee sets the performance criteria for each 
plan year. The performance criteria are as follows:
– a minimum threshold level of Clean EBITDA for each financial year 
is required for there to be any payment under the BBP;
– assuming the threshold is met a percentage of Clean EBITDA 
is used to create the bonus pool;
– a participant’s annual payment from the bonus pool is also 
subject to the satisfaction of additional individual performance 
objectives; 
– where the forfeit threshold Clean EBITDA is not achieved 50% 
of the deferred balance in a participant’s plan account will be 
forfeited; and
• Participants are entitled to an annual payment of 50% of their plan 
account at the end of each plan year. All balances are deferred into 
shares. On the fourth anniversary of the start of the plan period 
(1 January 2014) the remainder of the balance of participants’ plan 
accounts will be paid
The Remuneration Committee believes that the BBP is appropriate and 
supports the remuneration policy for the following reasons:
(i) the BBP provides flexibility for the Remuneration Committee to set 
annual targets mitigating against some of the risks of the sector;
(ii) the use of strategic key performance indicators as additional 
conditions for payments to be made under the BBP allows a more 
holistic, flexible and durable approach rather than focusing purely 
on a relatively narrow set of financial metrics;
(iii) it ensures that any objectives based on integration and synergy 
savings from the Merger are underpinned by profit performance 
before any bonus is earned;
(iv) the minimum performance thresholds ensure that key executives are 
encouraged to focus on sustainable long-term performance; and
(v) the deferral in shares and the real risk of forfeiture through 
claw-back ensure a balance between the interests of shareholders 
and key executives

In addition, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance of the Executive Directors and senior executives against their personal 
objectives set for 2011. The objectives for the COO, CFO and senior executives were set by the Co-CEOs, whilst the objectives for the Co-CEOs were set 
by the Chairman. All the personal objectives were reviewed and approved by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of 2011 before being 
rolled out.

(ii) Value Creation Plan (‘VCP’)
The key features of the VCP are:
• Under the VCP , participants have been allocated a number of VCP 
points from a total pot and the Executive Directors have received 
the following:
Name Number of  
VCP Points 
% of VCP Pool
Jim Ryan 1,000,000 10
Norbert Teufelberger 1,000,000 10
Joachim Baca 1,000,000 10
Martin Weigold 1,000,000 10
Top-tier senior manager 200,000 – 400,000 2-4
•  These VCP points have no value on grant but give the participants 
the opportunity, during the three-year performance period, to share 
in 4% of the total value created for shareholders in excess of an annual 
hurdle of 10% share price growth from the initial share price at annual 
measurement points
•  The value to each participant will be set by reference to the number 
of VCP points held in proportion to the total VCP points allocated and 
will be delivered in shares 
• The size of the VCP Pool is not capped
• At each measurement date participants will bank shares (in the 
form of a nil-cost option) with a value equivalent to the excess value 
created using the prevailing share price. 50% of any banked shares 
will become exercisable at the end of year 3 (2013), with the remainder 
at the end of year 4 (2014)
• The level of value created for shareholders will be determined by 
reference to the appreciation in the Company’s share price, the 
amount of dividends paid and any share buybacks (absolute total 
shareholder return)
• The shareholder value created at each measurement date will be 
calculated using the average share price over the 30 day period prior 
to the relevant measurement date
• The annual hurdle will be the higher of:
– 10% compounded annually from the initial price; and
– the average share price at the start of the relevant year (or 
previous measurement date if this is higher than at the start of 
the relevant year); and
• The initial price for determining the level of value required to be 
generated in 2011 was 151.52 pence
The VCP fits with the Group’s remuneration policy because:
– it incentivises participants to focus on building shareholder value;
– key executives will only benefit from material increases in absolute 
total shareholder return ensuring a direct alignment between the 
benefits received and value to shareholders; and
– the annual banking of shares under the VCP results in an immediate 
shareholding which because of the restrictions on disposal provides 
an ongoing exposure to the share price of the Company, encourages 
decisions maintaining and enhancing shareholder value
The average share price for the 30-day period to 31 December 2011 
was 138.53 pence. With an initial price of 151.52 pence the share price 
had to reach a minimum of 166.67 pence before a VCP pool was created 
and therefore there are no awards to be granted under the VCP in 
respect of 2011.
The price at which a VCP pool will begin to be created in respect of 2012 
is if the average share price for the 30-day period to 31 December 2012 
is 183.34 pence.

Total remuneration
Policy – median to upper quartile of comparator groups
The Remuneration Committee’s policy is to set the potential total 
remuneration at the median to upper quartile of the comparator groups. 
The level of total remuneration actually received will be dependent on 
the level of bonus earned under the BBP and the shares awarded under 
the VCP .
The table below shows for each of the Executive Directors the following 
information:
• the total remuneration payable under the Company’s remuneration 
policy against the comparators. Total remuneration consists of:
– base salary
– on target bonus
– fair value of long-term incentives
– pension contributions
• the actual total remuneration provided by the Company for 2011

Other share plans
In addition to the above plans, the Company also operates the following 
plans some of which the Directors do or may participate in:
bwin.party Global Share Plan (Current Plan)
(All bwin.party employees including Executive Directors)
Under the Global Share Plan launched in 2011 following the Merger 
participants are able to purchase a maximum of £1,500 shares annually. 
Subject to retaining these purchased shares for three years and 
continued employment, the Company can provide a matching share for 
each employee share purchased. Participants, excluding the Executive 
Directors, may also be awarded a nil-cost option (no cost on grant and 
no strike price) or restricted bwin.party stock up to a value of £25,000 per 
annum (Executive Directors can only be granted an award up to £3,000 
in value per annum). These discretionary free share awards generally do 
not have any performance conditions and vest over a three-year period. 
New shares are used to satisfy free share awards, whilst shares are 
purchased in the market in respect of the purchased share and 
matching share programme.
bwin.party Bonus & Shares Plan (Current Plan) 
(bwin.party mid to senior management excluding those in the VCP 
and BBP)
The Bonus & Shares Plan, launched in 2011 after the completion of the 
Merger duplicates in many respects the BBP . It uses the same Clean 
EBITDA target set for the BBP and in determining a participant’s 
contribution performance against individual objectives set at the 
beginning of the year are considered. As with the BBP , bonuses are paid 
in the form of a cash payment and deferred shares (awarded as nil-cost 
share options or restricted stock), but unlike the BBP there is no 
clawback mechanism for underperformance in future years. Deferred 
shares vest over a three-year period. The maximum annual contribution 
that can be earned under this plan is 150% of basic salary. The deferred 
shares are funded through the allotment of new shares.

PartyGaming Plc Share Option Plan (legacy pre-Merger plan)
(Jim Ryan, Martin Weigold and former PartyGaming employees and 
consultants only)
Under this plan launched in 2005, option awards have been awarded 
with no cost on grant or exercise and generally without any 
performance conditions. The shares used to fund exercised awards 
under this plan come solely from the employee benefit trust, no new 
shares are allotted to satisfy awards and the shares were largely 
donated to the employee benefit trust by the founder shareholders of 
PartyGaming in 2005 and 2006. Whilst the Remuneration Committee at 
the time these options were granted recognised the recommendation 
in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (predecessor to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code) not to award Executive Directors 
long-term incentive awards without performance conditions or to 
award options at a discount, the Remuneration Committee deemed 
it necessary at the time to make these awards in order to attract and 
retain the services of the recipients. The awards generally vest over a 
period of five years. Other employees of the Group have participated 
in this plan and the majority of awards were made in the period 2005 
to 2007. No awards have been made under this plan since 2010 and no 
awards will be granted in the future. 
PartyGaming Plc Performance Share Plan (legacy pre-Merger plan)
(Jim Ryan, Martin Weigold and former PartyGaming senior management 
team only) 
Under this plan launched in 2007, awards of restricted stock were 
made and vested subject to the Company’s total shareholder return 
performance over a three-year period versus that of a peer group. 
Only the Executive Directors of PartyGaming and the senior 
management team participated in this plan. Details of how this legacy 
plan operated were set out in the 2010 Remuneration Report and all 
outstanding awards had their performance measured to 28 January 
2011, when shareholders approved the Merger. The vesting schedule for 
all outstanding awards did not change. As a result, the Remuneration 
Committee determined as follows:
– April 2009 awards: TSR performance outperformance of 11.2% so 
100% of each award will vest on 31 March 2012. As a result Jim Ryan 
will receive 125,000 shares and Martin Weigold will receive 
337,500 shares
– September 2009 awards: TSR performance of 4.4% determining that 
57.8% of each award will vest on 30 September 2012. None of the 
Executive Directors received an award
– April 2010 awards: The TSR threshold was not met and therefore these 
awards have lapsed in their entirety. Jim Ryan and Martin Weigold had 
250,000 and 200,000 shares respectively under these grants
No awards have been made under this plan since 2010 and no awards 
will be granted in the future. New bwin.party shares will be issued 
to satisfy vested awards.
bwin.party Rollover Option plan (legacy pre-Merger plan)
(Norbert Teufelberger, Joachim Baca, former bwin non-executive 
directors and former bwin employees only)
The Company introduced the bwin.party Rollover Option Plan (‘ROP’) at 
the time of the Merger. The purpose of this plan was to effect the grant 
of rollover options over bwin.party shares to replace unexercised 
options granted under the two bwin fair market value option plans, 
some of which were subject to performance conditions. On the day the 
Merger took effect the bwin options over bwin shares were rolled over 
into equivalent options under the ROP over bwin.party shares on 
terms which reflected the same exchange ratio as applied to bwin 
shareholders – 12.23 bwin.party shares for each bwin share. The shares 
continue to vest on the same vesting timetable as the original 
bwin options. 
New bwin.party shares will be issued to satisfy exercised ROP awards, 
however, as explained in the Merger prospectus and circular, these bwin.
party shares will not count towards the Company’s 10% dilution limit. 
Details of the awards under the ROP granted to Norbert Teufelberger, 
Joachim Baca, Per Afrell, Manfred Bodner, Helmut Kern and Georg Riedl 
are contained in the table in the section below. Whilst the UK Corporate 
Governance Code recommends against granting options to Non-
Executive Directors, Per Afrell, Manfred Bodner, Helmut Kern and Georg 
Riedl received their original bwin options under a different corporate 
governance regime (Austrian) and the ROP awards simply convert the 
value of these original awards into bwin.party shares. No further share 
awards will be made under the ROP . 
PartyGaming Plc Executive Share Option Plan (legacy pre-Merger plan)
(Jim Ryan, Martin Weigold and former PartyGaming senior management 
team only) 
Under this plan launched in 2007, Executive Directors and senior

If Norbert Teufelberger’s employment is terminated prior to 31 March 
2014 by the Company or by Norbert Teufelberger in certain prescribed 
circumstances under the Regulatory Process Agreement or on a change 
of control, in each case where there are no grounds for summary 
termination by the Company, the Company will offer to engage him 
as a consultant until 31 March 2014 on terms which are in respect of 
remuneration (including incentive arrangements) no less favourable 
when taken as a whole than the terms of his employment arrangements 
would have been had they continued until 31 March 2014. 
No compensation will be payable upon expiry of the term on the 
third anniversary of his appointment date unless the period of the 
consultancy agreement is less than 12 months, in which case Norbert 
Teufelberger will receive an additional payment on the expiry of the 
consultancy agreement equal to the amount (if any) by which the 
aggregate of any termination payments under the service agreement 
and payments under the consultancy agreement is less than the 
payment in lieu of notice which Norbert Teufelberger would have 
received under the service agreement if the Company had chosen 
to exercise its right to terminate the service agreement by making a 
payment in lieu of notice. If Norbert Teufelberger accepts the Company’s 
offer, he will have no right to claim compensation in respect of the 
termination of his contract of employment under the provisions 
described above.
If a change of control of the Company (as defined in each service 
agreement) takes place, each of the Executive Directors may, in 
the 12 months following the change of control, terminate his 
employment if the Company makes a material adverse change to 
his title, responsibilities or status or changes his principal place of 
work to a place other than Gibraltar by giving three months’ notice to 
the Company in writing. The Company will then be required to pay the 
relevant Executive Director a payment equal to the amount he would 
have received had his employment been terminated in accordance with 
the payment in lieu provision in his service agreement.
The service agreements are governed by English law and contain 
non-compete provisions which apply during employment and for 
12 months following termination.

The Chairman of the Integration Committee is a temporary appointment 
for a three-year period to 31 March 2014 and is a position held by 
Manfred Bodner. The role is important in overseeing that management 
implements an effective integration of the bwin and PartyGaming 
businesses and recognises many merging businesses fail to deliver the 
synergy savings and other benefits from a consolidation. In recognition 
of the importance and special duties of the role, the Chairman of the 
Integration Committee receives a higher fee than a Non-Executive 
Director performing normal duties. 
As part of the Chairman of the Integration Committee’s remuneration 
package, he also participates in the Value Creation Plan and Bonus 
Banking Plan. Under the Value Creation Plan, Manfred Bodner has been 
awarded 1,000,000 VCP points, representing an entitlement to 10% of 
any available VCP pool. As disclosed earlier in this report, no value was 
created under the Value Creation Plan in respect of 2011. Under the 
Bonus Banking Plan, Manfred Bodner is entitled to a maximum annual 
contribution of 300% of his annual fee (equivalent £1,395,000). The 
mechanics of the Bonus Banking Plan have been described earlier in this 
report and Manfred Bodner is subject to the same Clean EBITDA target 
and his personal objectives relate to the achievement of synergy cost 
realisations. The Board resolved that in respect of his performance in 
2011 he would receive a total contribution of £697,500 (equivalent to 
150% of his annual fee), payable £348,750 in cash and in 251,750 deferred 
bwin.party shares (this number calculated using the average share price 
for the 30-day measurement period to 31 December 2011, which was 
138.53 pence and has a value on the date of calculation of £348,750).
With the exception of the Chairman of the Integration Committee, the 
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in the Value Creation Plan 
and Bonus Banking Plan or any other incentive arrangements operated 
by the Company.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has been appointed under a letter 
of appointment. With the exception of the Chairman of Integration 
Committee, these agreements do not provide for a fixed term of 
service, but each Director stands for re-appointment by shareholders 
each year and the Nominations Committee and Board reviews matters 
of independence, commitment and performance before recommending 
a Director for re-appointment.

If the appointment of Manfred Bodner is terminated prior to 31 March 
2014 by the Company, by him not being re-elected by the shareholders 
in a general meeting, or by Manfred Bodner in certain prescribed 
circumstances under the Regulatory Process Agreement or on a change 
of control, in each case where there are no grounds for summary 
termination of the appointment by the Company, the Company will offer 
to engage him as a consultant until 31 March 2014 on terms which are no 
less favourable in terms of fees (including incentive arrangements) than 
the terms of his letter of appointment would have been had it continued 
until the third anniversary of his original appointment date.
No compensation will be payable upon expiry of the term on 31 March 
2014 unless the period of the consultancy agreement is less than 12 
months, in which case Manfred Bodner will receive an additional 
payment on the expiry of the consultancy agreement equal to the 
amount (if any) by which the aggregate of any termination payments 
under the appointment letter and payments under the consultancy 
agreement is less than the payment in lieu of notice which Manfred 
Bodner would have received under the appointment letter if the 
Company had chosen to exercise its right to terminate the appointment 
letter by making a payment in lieu of notice. If Manfred Bodner accepts 
the Company’s offer, he will have no right to claim compensation in 
respect of the termination of his appointment under the provisions 
described above.
Upon termination of the appointment of Manfred Bodner (except 
where terminated summarily or where the appointment is terminated 
in circumstances where the Company is required to offer him a 
consultancy agreement – as described above), the Company will offer 
him a new appointment letter on its standard terms then applicable 
to Non-Executive Directors.
If a change of control of the Company takes place, Manfred Bodner 
may, in the 12 months following the change of control, terminate his 
appointment if the Company makes a material adverse change to his 
title, responsibilities or status or changes his principal place of work 
to a place other than Gibraltar by giving three months’ notice to the 
Company in writing. The Company will then be required to pay him 
a payment equal to the amount he would have received had his 
appointment been terminated in accordance with the payment 
in lieu provision in his letter of appointment.
External appointments
Executive Directors are required to seek the consent of the Board before 
accepting external appointments as non-executive directors of other 
companies. None of the Executive Directors is a director of a company 
outside the Group for which they or the Company receives or received 
a fee during the year to 31 December 2011.

Performance graph
To assist shareholders in reviewing the appropriateness of bwin.party’s 
remuneration policies and practices, the Company is required by 
regulation to set out a graph in this report showing the total shareholder 
return (‘TSR’) of bwin.party’s shares against the TSR performance of a 
suitable index over a five-year period. The Remuneration Committee 
have chosen to use the FTSE250 Index as the comparator, because the 
Company has been a constituent of this index for the last five years. 
The following graph plots the value of £100 in bwin.party’s shares and 
in the FTSE250 Index from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2011. 
The change in value of the holdings in the FTSE250 Index reflects any 
changes in the constituent companies over the period. The value of 
dividend income is treated as reinvested in the period.

bwin.party maintains a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange. 
As securities issued by non-UK companies cannot be held or transferred 
through the CREST paperless settlement system, the Company has put 
in place arrangements for a depositary to hold bwin.party shares and 
issue dematerialised depositary interests representing the underlying 
shares which are held on trust for the holders of the depositary 
interests.
The rights attaching to the ordinary shares and depositary interests 
are contained in the bwin.party articles of association and deed poll 
respectively. Both these documents are available on the bwin.party 
corporate website, www.bwinparty.com. 
Further information regarding bwin.party’s shares and depositary 
interests are set out in the ‘Shareholder Information’ section on pages 
153 to 157 of the Annual report.
(iii)  Allotment authority
On 28 January 2011 shareholders authorised the Directors to allot up 
to 450 million new shares to bwin shareholders to effect the Merger. 
This authority was used to allot 439.21 million shares and lapsed at 
the 2011 AGM on 30 June 2011.
At the 2011 AGM the Directors were authorised to allot new shares up to 
an initial aggregate nominal amount of £42,643 (284 million shares), with 
a further authority to allot further new shares up to an aggregate of 
£42,643 to be used only for a fully pre-emptive rights issue. This 2011 AGM 
authority expires at the Company’s 2012 AGM (or, if earlier, at close of 
business on 30 September 2012).
The Directors were also empowered at the 2011 AGM, pursuant to the 
articles, to allot shares for cash, pursuant to the above 2011 AGM 
authority, as if pre-emption rights did not apply to the allotment, 
provided that such authority be limited to (i) the allotment of shares in 
connection with a rights issue, open offer or any other pre-emptive offer 
in favour of shareholders, but subject to such exclusions as may be 
necessary to deal with the fractional entitlements, or legal or practical 
problems under any laws, or requirements of any regulatory body in any 
jurisdiction; and (ii) the allotment (otherwise pursuant to (i) above) of 
shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of £6,396 (42 million 
shares). This authority also expires at the Company’s 2012 AGM (or, if 
earlier, at close of business on 30 September 2011). 
The 2011 AGM authorities have not been utilised to date. The Directors 
do, however, believe it is in the Company’s best interests to have the 
flexibility to issue new shares within these parameters and are seeking 
a renewal of these authorities at the 2012 AGM.
(iv) Share buyback authority
At the 2011 AGM shareholders granted the Board authority to purchase 
on behalf of the Company 85,286,000 bwin.party shares, representing 
at the time 10% of the Company’s issued share capital. bwin.party 
announced on 30 June 2011 a distribution policy which included a 
commitment to buyback up to €75 million of the Company’s issued 
share capital over the following twelve months. Information about the 
number of shares purchased is set out in the table above and is available 
on the bwin.party corporate website (www.bwinparty.com). As there is 
no facility to hold shares in treasury under Gibraltar company law, all 
purchased shares have been cancelled.
The Board will review in June 2012 bwin.party’s distribution policy and 
in particular future share buybacks. The Directors believe it is in the 
Company’s best interests to have the power to purchase a proportion 
of its share capital and therefore the Board is seeking a renewal of this 
authority at the 2012 AGM.  bwin.party

voting rights or issued share capital. The interests of the Directors in the Company’s issued share capital are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on page 96.
Emerald Bay Limited and Stinson Ridge Limited entered into a relationship agreement with the Company when it floated on the London Stock 
Exchange in 2005, governing their combined rights to nominate a representative for appointment to the Board and governing the process for 
them selling their shares. This agreement was superceded by a new relationship agreement which took effect on 29 January 2011. Under this new 
relationship agreement Emerald Bay Limited and Stinson Ridge Limited have the right whilst they both hold in aggregate 5% or more of the 
Company’s issued share capital, to nominate a suitable individual for appointment to the Board. Geoff Baldwin is their current nominee. 
This nomination right may be transferred to another party where Emerald Bay Limited and Stinson Ridge Limited transfer 6% or more of the 
Company’s share capital to that other party. Emerald Bay Limited and Stinson Ridge Limited are also required to give the Company not less than 
four days’ notice of any proposed sale. Emerald Bay Limited and Stinson Ridge Limited are subject to the Company’s share dealing code whilst they 
maintain a representative on the Board. The relationship agreement also contains restrictions limiting Emerald Bay Limited and Stinson Ridge 
Limited and their associates from investing in other online gaming businesses.
Androsch Foundation and New Media Gaming and Holding Limited, founder shareholders of bwin Interactive Entertainment AG, have also entered 
into a relationship agreement with the Company on the same terms as detailed above. This relationship agreement came into effect on 31 March 
2011. Their representative on the Board is Manfred Bodner.

Dividend
During the year ended 31 December 2011 bwin.party paid an interim 
dividend of 1.56 pence per share which was paid on 7 October 2011. 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.56 pence per share 
payable on 12 June 2012, with a record date of 11 May 2012. 
Customer and creditor payment policy
The Group is committed to prompt payment of customer cashout 
requests and maintains adequate cash reserves to cover customer 
withdrawals and balances. Normally payments will be made to 
customers within seven days of receiving a customer instruction. 
In the case of other creditors, it is the Group’s policy to agree terms at 
the outset of a transaction and ensure compliance with such agreed 
terms. In the event that an invoice is contested then the Group informs 
the supplier without delay and seeks to settle the dispute quickly.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
‘Overview’, ‘Strategy’ and ‘Review of 2011’ sections of the Annual report. 
The financial position of the Group, its cashflow, liquidity position and 
borrowings are set out in the aforementioned section. In addition, note 
28 to the financial statements on pages 142 to 146 includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives; details of financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a large 
number of players and long-term contracts with a number of corporate 
customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and 
industries. As a consequence, the Directors believe the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current 
challenging economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report.
Audit
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of the annual 
report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011, 
confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which bwin.party’s auditor is unaware; and each Director 
has taken all steps that they reasonably ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information. As recommended by the Audit Committee, a resolution 
for the re-appointment of BDO LLP and BDO Limited as joint auditors to 
bwin.party is being proposed at the 2012 AGM. bwin.party

General Meeting
2012 Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on Thursday 7 June 2012 
at 12.30 p.m. at The Caleta Hotel, Catalan Bay, Gibraltar. The AGM notice 
is set out on pages 158 to 161 of this document. The following is a 
summary of resolutions to be considered:
Resolution 1: To receive and consider the Company’s Annual report 
and accounts together with the Reports of the Directors and Auditor 
for the year ended 31 December 2011. 
The Directors present to the meeting bwin.party’s audited annual 
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2011 together with the 
Directors’ Report and Auditors’ Report. 
Resolution 2: To approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2011. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages 80 to 96 of this 
document. The vote will have an advisory status only and will be in 
respect of the remuneration policy and overall remuneration packages 
generally and will not be specific to individual levels of remuneration. 
Resolution 3: To re-appoint BDO LLP and BDO Limited as auditors 
of the Company with BDO Limited acting as auditor for the purposes 
of section 10 of the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999.
In accordance with section 180 of the Companies Act 1930 (as amended) 
the Company at each annual general meeting has to appoint an auditor 
to hold office until the next annual general meeting and BDO LLP and 
BDO Limited have expressed their willingness to be re-appointed as 
auditors. The Audit Committee recommends and the Board agrees with 
the re-appointment of BDO LLP and BDO Limited as auditors. 
Resolution 4: To authorise the Directors to set the auditors’ 
remuneration 
The resolution authorises the Directors to set the remuneration payable 
to the auditors, in accordance with best practice. The Audit Committee 
is tasked with reviewing the auditors’ remuneration and making a 
recommendation to the Board. 
Resolution 5: To declare a final dividend  
The Board is proposing a final dividend in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2011 of 1.56 pence per ordinary share. This is in line 
with bwin.party’s distribution policy announced on 30 June 2011, 
under which the Board proposed a progressive dividend policy. If 
approved by shareholders this final dividend will be payable on 12 June 
2012 to those shareholders on the register of members on 11 May 2012.
Resolutions 6 to 18: Director re-appointments 
The Company’s articles of association require any Director appointed by 
the Board to seek re-appointment at the following AGM. Geoff Baldwin 
was appointed a Director on 15 July 2011 and is therefore standing for 
re-appointment at the 2012 AGM. The articles also require one-third of 
all the other Directors to see re-appointment. However, in accordance 
with the recommendation of the Code, all the Directors are standing for 
re-appointment at the 2012 AGM. The biographies for each Director are 
set out on pages 68 to 69.
The Nominations Committee has reviewed these re-appointments 
and on the basis of experience, performance, skills and commitment 
demonstrated, has recommended to the Board that each Director  
be re-appointed. The Board has considered and agrees with this 
recommendation and is therefore advising shareholders to support 
the re-appointments of all the Directors. 
Resolution 6 – to re-appoint Per Afrell 
Resolution 7 – to re-appoint Joachim Baca
Resolution 8 – to re-appoint Manfred Bodner
Resolution 9 – to re-appoint Tim Bristow.
Resolution 10 – to re-appoint Simon Duffy
Resolution 11 – to re-appoint Helmut Kern
Resolution 12 – to re-appoint Lewis Moonie
Resolution 13 – to re-appoint Rod Perry
Resolution 14 – to re-appoint Georg Riedl
Resolution 15 – to re-appoint Jim Ryan
Resolution 16 –  to re-appoint Norbert Teufelberger
Resolution 17 – to re-appoint Martin Weigold
Resolution 18 – to re-appoint Geoff Baldwin
Resolution 19: Share allotment authority
The Board is proposing to update the Company’s authority to issue 
new share capital in accordance with UK corporate governance 
guidelines, specifically those of the Association of British Insurers. 
The Company is seeking authority to issue new shares up to an amount 
equal to one-third of the existing issued share capital. If these shares 
are issued and paid-up wholly or partly otherwise than for cash (for 
example, in connection with an acquisition by the Company using its 
shares for consideration), then pursuant to the provisions of the Articles, 
no pre-emption rights will apply to such an issue of shares.
In addition, the Company is seeking authority to issue further new 
shares in an amount up to a further one-third of the existing issued 
share capital. This further additional authority will only be used for 
a full-pre-emptive rights issue. 
This authority if granted will expire at the 2013 AGM or, if earlier, 
7 September 2013. Overview 02

Resolution 20: Disapplication of pre-emption rights 
The Articles require any new shares to normally be offered to the current 
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings to prevent their 
shareholdings being significantly diluted by the Company acting 
unilaterally. To give the Company a degree of flexibility in managing its 
share capital and raising new funds, the Board is seeking shareholder 
authority to issue up to 5% of the Company’s issued share capital for 
cash without pre-emption rights applying to such an allotment. It is 
normal practice for UK-listed companies to have this limited authority, 
which accords with UK corporate governance best practice guidelines. 
In accordance with the latter, the Board confirms its intention that no 
more than 7.5% of the issued share capital will be issued for cash on a 
non pre-emptive basis during any rolling three-year period. Resolution 
20 is subject to resolution 19 being passed. 
Resolution 21: Share buyback authority 
In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the Company to 
purchase its own shares and Resolution 21 seeks authority from the 
shareholders to do so. The resolution specifies the maximum number 
of shares that may be acquired (10% of the Company’s issued shares) 
and the maximum and minimum prices at which they may be bought. 
Any shares purchased in this way will be cancelled and the number 
of shares in issue will be reduced accordingly. The Directors will only 
purchase such shares after taking into account the effects on earnings 
per share and the benefit for shareholders. As disclosed previously, bwin.
party announced on 30 June 2011, as part of its distribution policy that 
for the following 12 months the Company would acquire up to 
€75 million of its shares and so the current purchase authority has been 
utilised. The current authority will lapse at the 2012 AGM. The proposed 
new authority will expire at the conclusion of the 2013 annual general 
meeting or, if earlier, 7 September 2013.

International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (‘IFRS’) and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation, and 
the FSA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules and Listing Rules.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Company’s financial 
statements in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 
1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as amended). The Directors 
have also chosen to prepare the Company’s financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities and for the preparation of a Directors’ Report which 
complies with the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 
1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar 
Companies Act 1930 (as amended), and a Directors’ Remuneration 
Report which complies with the requirements of the UK’s Large 
and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008, Schedule 8.
Financial statements are published on the Group’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary 
from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of 
the Group’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.
In accordance with International Accounting Standard 1 the Directors 
are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year that 
present fairly the financial position of the Group and the Company and 
the financial performance and cashflows of the Group and the Company 
for that period. This requires the faithful representation of the effects 
of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s

(ii) Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable

requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
Group’s financial position and financial performance
In accordance with DTR 4.1.12 of the FSA’s Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, the Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:

view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss

109 1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group and parent financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those International Financial Reporting Standards including 
International Accounting Standards (IASs) and interpretations, (collectively ‘IFRS’), published by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) 
which have been adopted by the European Commission and endorsed for use in the EU for the purposes of the Group’s full year financial statements.
The consolidated and company financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies 
(Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 (as amended).
Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2011 will be filed with Companies House Gibraltar following the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
Due to the Merger (which was treated as an acquisition by PartyGaming for accounting purposes), certain accounting policies that were not 
previously relevant for the Group, but relevant for bwin, have been adopted in these consolidated financial statements pages. All other material 
accounting policies and presentations of bwin have been aligned to those of the enlarged Group.
Functional currency of the parent company
Reflecting the fact that the Company has hedged its remaining US dollar exposure, the effect of the Merger, and that going forward most 
transactions will be in pound sterling but funded by excess euros generated by the rest of the Group, the Company has changed its functional 
currency from US dollars to euros.
In line with IAS 21 the change took effect from the date the Company determined that the characteristics required to identify the functional 
currency had changed. The Company determined this occurred during 2011 and for accounting purposes this is effective from 1 January 2011.
All financial data for the Company for prior periods has been converted using the exchange rate at 1 January 2011 of 1 euro = US dollar 1.3416.
Adoption of new and revised Standards and Interpretations
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’), are effective for 
the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no effect on its consolidated results or financial position:
IFRIC 14 (Amended) and 
IAS 19 (Amended)
Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction (effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2011).
The following relevant standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB or the IFRIC before the period end but are as yet not effective for 
the 2011 year end:
IAS 1 (Amended) Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012)
IAS 12 (Amended) Deferred tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012)
IAS 19 (Amended) Employee Benefits (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IAS 27 (Amended) Separate Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IAS 28 (Amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IAS 32 (Amended) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014)
IFRS 7 (Amended) Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011)
IFRS 7 (Amended) Disclosures – Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013)
IFRS 7 (Amended) Disclosures – Initial application of IFRS 9 (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015)
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015).
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
The Group is currently assessing the impact, if any, that these standards will have on the presentation of its consolidated results.

Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements 1. Accounting policies (continued)
Basis of accounting
The consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than for the valuation of certain 
financial instruments.
Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies 
and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates, judgements and assumptions which 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. These policies, 
together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, can be found as follows:
Functional currency note 1
Revenue recognition note 2
Intangible assets and impairment of goodwill note 10
Regulatory compliance, litigation and contingent liabilities note 23
Acquisition accounting and value of acquired assets and liabilities note 26
Provisions note 19
Tax including deferred tax note 7
Held for sale disposal groups note 8
Share-based payments note 29
Basis of consolidation
Under section 10(2) of the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own 
statement of comprehensive income.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting for the Company’s acquisition of the controlling interest in PartyGaming Holdings Limited
The Company’s controlling interest in its directly held, wholly-owned subsidiary, PartyGaming Holdings Limited (formerly Headwall Ventures 
Limited), was acquired through a transaction under common control, using a form of accounting that is similar to pooling of interests.
Accounting for subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled directly or indirectly by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On the date of acquisition the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries are measured at their fair values. The non-controlling interest is stated 
at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up 
to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their 
accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling 
interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholder’s share 
of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results 
in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are carried at cost less any impairment in value.

Financial statements 103 1. Accounting policies (continued)
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are 
recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders’ 
proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. The choice of measurement basis 
is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.
Investments
Investments include investments in associates, joint ventures and available-for-sale investments.
Available‑for‑sale investments
Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, 
associates or jointly controlled entities. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity. In accordance with 
IAS 39, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and 
settlement date being recognised in the available-for-sale reserve. On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that 
asset is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant 
influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for 
post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment. Losses of 
an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate are not recognised. Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, 
only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Investments in joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control; that 
is, when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in joint 
ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the 
net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Group’s interest in that 
investment are not recognised. Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal 
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.

financial statements 1. Accounting policies (continued)
Intangible assets
Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset 
will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Goodwill
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree and the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired 
in the subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
For acquisitions where the agreement date is on or after 31 March 2004, goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed. Goodwill 
arising on earlier acquisitions was being amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 
Business Combinations, the unamortised balance of goodwill at 31 December 2004 was frozen and reviewed for impairment and will be reviewed for 
impairment at least annually.
Externally acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separate from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual or legal 
rights. Identifiable assets are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic 
life of the assets.
Internally generated intangible assets – research and development expenditure
Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Group’s software development, is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead 
to new or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has 
sufficient resources to complete development. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, labour and an appropriate proportion 
of overheads. All other development expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the 
asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain the related intangible asset’s current level of performance, 
is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation of intangible assets
Amortisation is provided to write-off the cost of all intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, over the periods the Group expects to benefit 
from their use, and varies between:
Brand and domain names
– 5% to 20% per annum
Broadcast libraries
– 50% per annum
Capitalised development expenditure
– 20% to 33% per annum
Contractual relationships
– over the length of the contract
Customer lists and contracts
– 5% to 50% per annum
Intellectual property and gaming licences
– over the length of the licence
Software
– 20% to 33% per annum

Impairment of goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment
At the end of each reporting year, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cashflows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible 
asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cashflows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cashflows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset 
is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation 
increase. Impairments related to goodwill are not reversed.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of freehold land and buildings which are 
stated at cost and are not depreciated due to immateriality.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes directly attributable costs incurred in 
bringing the assets to working condition for their intended use, including professional fees. Depreciation commences when the assets are ready 
for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment with the exception of freehold 
land and buildings, evenly over their expected useful lives. It is calculated at the following rates:
Leasehold improvements – over length of lease
Plant, machinery, computer equipment – 33% per annum
Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment, vehicles – 20% per annum
Where an item of property, plant or equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items 
of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised where it is incurred to replace a component of an item of plant, property or equipment where that item 
is accounted for separately including major inspection and overhaul. All other subsequent expenditure is expensed as incurred, unless it increases 
the future economic benefits to be derived from that item of plant, property and equipment.

Segment information
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses. 
Each segment’s operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and 
assess its performance. The method for determining what information to report is based on the way management organises the operating 
segments within the Group for decision-making purposes and for the assessment of financial performance. The Group reviews financial statements 
presented by product type which are supplemented by some information about geographic regions for the purposes of making operating decisions 
and assessing financial performance. Therefore, the Group has determined that it is appropriate to report according to product segment.
Revenue
Revenue from online gaming, comprising sports betting, casino and games, poker, bingo, and network services (third-party entities that use the 
Group’s platform and certain services), as well as fees from broadcasting, hosting and subscriptions, is recognised in the accounting periods in which 
the gaming transactions occur.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is net of certain promotional bonuses and the value of loyalty 
points accrued.
Net revenue consists of net gaming revenue and revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals 
and account fees. Poker net revenue represents the commission charged or tournament entry fees where the player has concluded his or her 
participation in the tournament. Casino, bingo and sports betting net revenue represents net house win adjusted for the fair market value of gains 
and losses on open betting positions. Revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account 
fees is allocated to each reporting segment.
Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from network services, third-party payment services, sale of domain names, financial markets and fees 
from broadcasting, hosting and subscriptions. Revenue in respect of network service arrangements where the third-party owns the relationship 
with the customer is the net commission invoiced.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists primarily of betting and gaming taxes and broadcasting costs.
Broadcasting costs are expensed over the applicable life cycle of each programme based upon the ratio of the current year’s revenue to the 
estimated remaining total revenues.
Other operating income
Other operating income consists primarily of exchange gains.
Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses consist primarily of exchange losses and merger and acquisition expenses and are recognised on an accruals basis.

Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate (their 
‘functional currency’) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated 
at the rates ruling at the end of the reporting year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities 
are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a hedge 
of a net investment in a foreign operation, in which case exchange differences are recognised in a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into euros at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took 
place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate 
ruling at the end of the reporting year. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas 
operations at actual rate are recognised directly in equity (the ‘currency reserve’).
Exchange differences recognised in the statement of comprehensive income of Group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of 
long-term monetary items forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to the currency reserve 
on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation 
up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The financial statements were translated into euros at the following rates:

Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the Directors’ best estimate of taxation exposures and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the end of the reporting year.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences other than where IAS 12 Income Taxes contains specific exemptions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current assets against current tax liabilities and when 
they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable, management is committed to a sale plan, the 
asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. 
These assets are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less associated costs of sale.
Share‑ based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and based, for those share options which contain only non-market 
vesting conditions, on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of a suitable option pricing model. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of 
the liability. Up to the point at which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date of 
settlement, with changes being recorded in consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group records the expense based on the fair value 
of the share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. For cash payments made by parties related to Principal Shareholders, 
the charge is recorded when there is a commitment to make the payment.
Where equity instruments of the parent company or a subsidiary are transferred, or cash payments based on the Company’s (or a subsidiary’s) share 
price are made, by shareholder(s) or entities that are effectively controlled by one or more shareholder(s), the transaction is accounted for as a 
share-based payment, unless the transfer or payment is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the Group.
Where equity instruments are transferred by one or more shareholder(s), the amount recorded in reserves is included in the share-based payment 
reserve. Where a cash payment is made, this is recorded as a capital contribution.

Treasury shares
Treasury shares relate to shares gifted to the Employee Trust by the Company and to shares repurchased as part of the share buyback programme. 
The cost of treasury shares creates an own share reserve.
When options issued by the Employee Trust are exercised the own share reserve is reduced and a gain or loss is recognised in reserves based 
on proceeds less weighted-average cost of shares exercised.
Own shares repurchased for the share buyback programme are carried at cost.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
The Group recognises a provision in the consolidated statement of financial position when it has a legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where the Group has a possible obligation as a result of a past event that may, but probably will not, result in an outflow of economic benefits, 
no provision is made. Disclosures are made of the contingent liability including, where practicable, an estimate of the financial effect, uncertainties 
relating to the amount or timing of outflow of resources, and the possibility of any reimbursement.
Where time value is material, the amount of the related provision is calculated by discounting the cashflows at a pre-tax rate that reflects market 
assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the liability.
Leased assets
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of 
financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation 
so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage currency cashflows and to hedge foreign exchange risk on non-US dollar denominated 
financial assets and liabilities. The derivative instruments used by the Group consist mainly of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value calculated using either discounted cashflow 
techniques or by reference to market prices supplied by banks. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Financial assets
The Group’s financial assets which are financial instruments are categorised as loans, receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
These include restricted cash and unrestricted bank deposits with maturities of more than three months. Amounts held as security deposits are 
considered to be restricted cash. There are no financial assets that are classified as ‘held to maturity’. A category for ‘in the money’ derivative 
financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments held as at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010.
Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, 
associates or jointly controlled entities. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity. In accordance with 
IAS 39, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and 
settlement date being recognised in the available-for-sale reserve. On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that 
asset is removed from equity and recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Short-term investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market. They are 
initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue. They are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provisions for impairment.
Trade and other receivables represent short-term monetary assets which are recognised at fair value less impairment and other related provisions, 
which are recognised when there is objective evidence (primarily default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all 
of the amounts due. The amount of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected 
cashflows associated with the impaired receivable.
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with financial institutions. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash. They include unrestricted short-term bank deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months 
or less.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities are all categorised as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities include the following items:
• Client liabilities, including amounts due to progressive prize pools.
• Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance 
of the liability carried in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
• Loans and borrowings, comprising bank borrowings and overdrafts, which are initially recognised at fair value, net of any transaction costs 
directly attributable to the issue of the instrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability 
is outstanding.
• A category for ‘out of the money’ derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments 
as at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability. 
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared 
by the Directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

For management purposes and transacting with customers, the Group’s operations can be segmented into the following reporting segments:
• sports betting,
• casino & games,
• poker,
• bingo and
• unallocated corporate (including World Poker Tour, InterTrader.com and the payment services business).
These segments are the basis upon which the Group currently reports its segment information. Unallocated corporate expenses, assets and 
liabilities relate to the Group as a whole and are not allocated to individual segments. The measure of reporting segment performance is Clean 
EBITDA and the basis for arriving at this is the same as the Group accounts.
Following the acquisition of bwin a review is currently being undertaken of the need to change the Group’s reporting of results to the Chief Operating 
Decision Makers (‘CODMs’) which could have a consequential effect on the reporting of segmental information under IFRS 8. Any such changes would 
be reflected in the future once this exercise has been completed.

Factors affecting the tax charge for the period
The Group’s policy is to manage, control and operate Group companies only in the countries in which they are registered. At the period end there 
were Group companies registered in 24 countries including Gibraltar. However, the rules and practice governing the taxation of eCommerce activity 
are evolving in many countries. It is possible that the amount of tax that will eventually become payable may differ from the amount provided in the 
financial information.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
As the Group is involved in worldwide operations, future tax charges will be affected by the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions.
Future tax charges will be reduced by a deferred tax credit in respect of amortisation of certain acquired intangibles.

In previous periods the performance measure of EPS used internally by management to manage the operations of the business and remove the 
impact of one-off and certain non-cash items was Clean EPS, which was calculated before the provision for costs associated with the Group’s 
Non-Prosecution Agreement, reorganisation expenses, merger and acquisition expenses and share-based payments. Following the Merger, 
management have amended their performance measure to also add back exchange differences and amortisation and impairments on acquisitions, 
which they believe better reflects the underlying performance of the business and assists in providing a clearer view of the fundamental 
performance of the Group.

Financial statements 103 10. Intangible assets (continued)
Acquired intangible assets are those intangible assets purchased as part of an acquisition and primarily include customer lists, brands, software 
and broadcast libraries. The value of acquired intangibles is based on cashflow projections at the time of acquisition. Customer lists from existing 
customers take into account the expected impact of player attrition.
Other intangibles primarily include development expenditure, long-term gaming and intellectual property licences and purchased domain names. 
Development expenditure represents software infrastructure assets that have been developed and generated internally. Licences are amortised 
over the life of the licences and other intangibles are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three and five years.
During 2010, both contingent consideration, and consequently goodwill, were subsequently revised down by €3.7m based on Cashcade’s profit 
performance in 2010 which was in the middle of the target range for the earnout.
The €15.3m impairment of acquired intangibles in 2011 relates to software acquired as part of the Merger that will not be used for its normal 
economic life.
Goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the following cash-generating units (CGUs):

PartyPoker 7.0 6.4
Gamebookers 66.7 64.5

Impairment
In accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets. A detailed review was undertaken at 31 December 
2011 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value of future cashflows derived from those assets.
PartyPoker and Cashcade
In respect of the PartyPoker and Cashcade CGUs, the Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions 
which would cause the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles to exceed their value in use.
EOL/IOG
The recoverable amount of EOL/IOG has been determined with reference to the contribution the CGU makes towards the overall casino vertical. 
The Directors have concluded therefore that there are no reasons which would cause the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles to exceed 
their value in use.
Gamebookers
The recoverable amount of Gamebookers has been determined from value in use calculations based on cashflow projections covering the following 
ten year period. The Group believes that going beyond five years’ cashflows in the value in use calculations is appropriate given the Group is an 
established business and is a leader in a growth industry. The projections include the formally approved budget for 2012 and a detailed forecast 
for 2013.

bwin
Although the Merger was effectively a merger of equals with all consideration satisfied in shares, IFRS requires the Merger to be accounted for as if 
PartyGaming had acquired bwin. The accounting for this resulted in the recognition of goodwill at the time of the Merger measured as the difference 
in value between the consideration and the fair value of the separately identified assets and liabilities of bwin. The consideration was measured 
using the PartyGaming share price at the time of the Merger and before proposed regulatory changes were announced one week later, which resulted 
in a substantial reduction in the Company’s share price. Had the merger completed one week later, no such impairment would have been required.
The uncertainty created by the proposed regulatory changes in Europe, particularly those in Germany, have resulted in the Directors applying 
probability weighted forecasts to determine the cashflow projections for this CGU. This has had an adverse effect on the projected value in use 
of this operation and consequently resulted in an impairment to goodwill of €391.7m.
The recoverable amount of bwin has been determined from value in use calculations based on cashflow projections covering the following ten year 
period. The Group believes that going beyond five years’ cashflows in the value in use calculations is appropriate given the Group is an established 
business and is a leader in a growth industry.
Operating margins have been based on past experience and future expectations in light of anticipated economic and market conditions. Discount 
rates are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect management’s assessment of specific risks related to the CGU.

There is no unrecognised share of losses arising during the year.
The carrying value at the reporting period related to the investment in associate Betbull Holdings SE is reviewed for impairment by comparing 
it to the share of the market value of Betbull Holdings (based on the closing share price), which is listed on the Austrian Stock Exchange.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.
As a result of the Merger the group held a 45% holding in Sajoo S.A.S, a company incorporated in France. The assets and liabilities of Sajoo S.A.S were 
acquired by the Group on 30 September 2011 in a transaction that generated goodwill of €1.2m. The operation of Sajoo S.A.S was merged into BES 
S.A.S at that date. Following the restructuring, the Group’s share of BES S.A.S decreased from 75% to 71%.

Litigation refers to provisions made in respect of certain outstanding legal and regulatory disputes and are an estimate of what the Directors believe 
to be the fair value based on probability-weighted expected values. In the light of the uncertainty associated with legal and regulatory disputes, 
there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will be an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may or may 
not be incurred. No further details have been provided as the Directors consider that this would be prejudicial to the interests of the Group.
Onerous contracts relate to provisions made against the future costs of contracts where subsequent changes in legislation in certain countries 
have meant that the future economic benefits received by the Group are less than the costs involved with fulfilling the remaining terms and 
conditions of the contracts and is recognised at the Directors’ best estimate based on their knowledge of the markets of the countries involved.
The amounts due for provisions are recognised at fair value based on the above and carried at amortised cost using an effective interest rate of 8.7%.

From time to time the Group is subject to legal claims and actions against it. The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of such 
claims and actions.
As part of the Board’s ongoing regulatory compliance process, the Board continues to monitor legal and regulatory developments and their potential 
impact on the business and takes appropriate advice in respect of these developments.
Litigation
As a consequence of the as yet non-harmonised regulatory environment for online gaming in Europe, a number of civil and administrative 
proceedings are pending against the Group and/or its board members in several countries (including but not limited to Germany, Portugal, Slovenia 
and Spain) aimed at preventing bwin.party from offering its services in these countries. Further, there are criminal investigations pending against 
certain board members of the Group for the alleged violation of local gaming laws (such as in France and Austria).
In 2010, a former bwin subsidiary has been assessed by Austrian tax authorities to have value-added tax arrears of €6.4m for the years 2002 to 2004. 
The Company has appealed the assessments. Applying the same assessments to periods subsequent to 2004, although some circumstances have 
changed, the value of the worst case scenario amounts to €170.4m.
In 2006, the Portuguese monopoly operator Santa Casa de Misericórdia da Lisboa and the Portuguese Casino Association, in addition to a request 
for a cease and desist order, filed a suit for damages in the amount of approximately €27m for the alleged loss of profits due to bwin.party’s 
Portuguese online gaming offer. In September 2011, the Court of First Instance, amongst others, (i) declared the (already terminated) sponsorship 
agreement between the former bwin and the Portuguese Soccer League (LPFP) as well as bwin’s gaming offer and advertising measures as illegal 
in Portugal, and (ii) prohibited the offer of mutual bets and lottery games on bwin.com and future advertising activities for bwin. bwin.party filed an 
appeal against the Court’s decision. The Court did not yet decide on Santa Casa’s request for damages but reserved this for the further proceedings.
In 2010, the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet of the Commonwealth of Kentucky filed a civil suit against the Company and other defendants in 
Franklin Circuit Court, a state court in Kentucky in the US. The suit seeks a claim for damages of US$47m along with interest and costs in relation 
to the Company’s activities from 5 August 2005 until the Company’s termination of US-facing activities on 13 October 2006.
In 2011, Ante5 filed a complaint and a request for arbitration with Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service Inc. against the Company for the alleged 
breach of its obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement for the purchase of the World Poker Tour. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement Ante5 
is entitled to a 5% share of WPT’s revenues since the acquisition in 2009. Ante5 claims that the Company has not invested sufficient effort to market 
the WPT assets and has thus suffered loss in its revenue share. Ante5 seeks recovery of the revenue that it believes it would have received were the 
Company to have acted diligently in the promotion of the WPT assets. Ante 5 believes the sums due to it to be US$240m.
The Directors believe these suits to be without merit and intend to defend these matters vigorously and accordingly no provision has been made 
in the accounts other than that set out in note 19.
In respect of the above matters relating to former bwin companies, IFRS 3 requires that a probability-weighted estimate is used for fair-valuing 
acquired contingent liabilities and a provision made accordingly, even though had the same contingent liability arisen in a former PartyGaming 
company no provision would be made under IAS 37. Details of amounts provided for litigation and regulatory disputes can be found in note 19.

138 26. Acquisitions during the period
On 31 March 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity instruments of bwin Interactive Entertainment AG, an exclusively non-US facing 
business whose principal activities are the provision of online gaming, providing online sporting content such as live video streams, live scores, 
statistics and SMS services to its customers and a payment service provider. The main drivers for the Merger were the potential synergies that could 
be achieved. There was no cash consideration as the acquisition was made on the basis of issuing 12.23 PartyGaming Plc shares for each bwin share 
together with an equivalent multiple of PartyGaming options for unexercised bwin options at that date.
Details of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, purchase consideration and goodwill are as follows:

Financial statements 103 26. Acquisitions during the period (continued)
The fair value adjustments included in the above relate primarily to the attribution of fair values to brands, customer lists and software acquired 
as part of the acquisition, and the effect of deferred tax thereon. These intangible assets are being amortised over their estimated useful economic 
lives of up to 20 years. The amount included in provisions represents the Directors’ current best estimate of amounts payable based on 
probability-weighted expected values after the effects of discounting as required under IFRS 3.
The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill (none of which is deductible for tax purposes) are the growth and revenue synergies created 
by combining business activities, cost savings of the merged operations and expertise of the workforce.
Merger and acquisition costs in the period in respect of this can be found in note 4.
Had the Merger taken place at the beginning of the period, total revenue would have been €830.1m (of which €14.1m relates to discontinued 
operations) and loss after tax would have been €422.3m (of which €21.1m relates to discontinued operations).

Financial statements 103 28. Financial instruments and risk management
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect 
of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing 
these risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods, unless otherwise stated in this note.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
• investments;
• short-term investments;
• trade and other receivables;
• cash and cash equivalents;
• loans and borrowings;
• trade and other payables;
• client liabilities and progressive prize pools; and
• foreign exchange contracts
Foreign exchange contracts are regularly used in the normal course of business but none were outstanding as at 31 December 2011 or at the prior 
year end. The Group operates a sports betting business and always has open bets. As at 31 December 2011 and at the prior year end the fair market 
value of open bets was not material. Other financial derivative instruments are permitted to be used by the Group, but none were used in the 
period ended 31 December 2011 or in the prior year. 
Management controls and procedures
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining 
ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating the required processes that ensure the effective 
implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s treasury department under the auspices of the Group Treasury Committee (see below). 
As such, the Group’s funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the Group’s treasury 
department. The treasury department is mandated to execute conventional forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps in order to manage 
these underlying risks. No other derivatives may be executed without written authority from the Board at which point an explanation of the 
accounting implications would also be given.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis which 
are recommended and subsequently monitored by the Group Treasury Committee. The Group Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Finance 
Director. These polices include benchmark exposures and hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk. The Group risk management policies 
would also be reviewed by the Board following, for example, significant changes to the Group’s business. Exposures are monitored and reported 
to management on a monthly basis, together with required actions when tolerance limits are exceeded. The internal control procedures and risk 
management processes of the treasury department are also reviewed periodically by the internal audit function. The last internal control review 
was undertaken during 2011 and the procedures and processes were deemed satisfactory.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible, without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness 
and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:
Financials
Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements
bwin.party
Annual report & accounts 2011
142 28. Financial instruments and risk management (continued)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of its working capital as well as the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt 
instruments. In essence, it is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s treasury department ensures that the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, and amounts due from payment service providers (‘PSPs’) 
exceed its combined client liabilities at all times. This excess is defined as the Client Liability Cover. Client liabilities principally represent customer 
deposits and progressive prize pools.
The Group Treasury Committee is advised of cash balances, investments, foreign currency exposures, interest income, interest expense, amounts 
due from PSPs, Client Liability Cover and counterparty exposures on a monthly basis, or more frequently if required.
The Group imposes a maximum debt limit of €300m that may mature in any one year to ensure that there is no significant concentration 
of refinancing risk.
Management monitors liquidity to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to the Group. The Group’s principal financial assets are cash, 
bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
During 2009 the Group entered into £35m term loan as a means of managing liquidity risk. £33.2m was outstanding on the term loan at the end 
of December 2011 and it is fully repayable in December 2012.
Capital risk
In common with many internet companies that have few physical assets, the Group has no policy as to the level of equity capital and reserves other 
than to address statutory requirements. The primary capital risk to the Group is the level of debt relative to the Group’s net income. Accordingly, 
the Group’s policy is that gross debt should not exceed €500m and that the leverage ratio of gross debt/clean EBITDA should be less than 1.5x. 
An analysis of gross debt is as follows:
As at 31 December
2011
€million
2010
€million
Gross debt (€million) 33.2 40.0 
Clean EBITDA (€million) 155.2 94.0
Headroom (€million) 232.8 141.0 
Ratio 0.1 0.3
Details of the Group’s dividend policy is disclosed in the Chairman’s statement and also on pages 154 to 156 of this Annual report.
Credit risk
Operational: The Group’s operational credit risk is primarily attributable to receivables from PSPs and from customers who dispute their deposits 
made after playing on the Group’s websites. Prior to accepting new PSPs and wherever practicable, credit checks are performed using a reputable 
external source. Senior management monitors PSP balances on a weekly basis and promptly takes corrective action if pre-agreed limits are 
exceeded. For PSPs that do not have a formal credit rating, an internal rating system is used, based on such factors as industry knowledge, their 
statement of financial position, profitability, customer diversification, geographic diversification, long-term stability, management credibility, 
potential regulatory risk and historic payment track record.
These internal ratings are monitored and reviewed on a quarterly basis. An internal rating of one is assessed as very strong whilst a rating of five 
is assessed as weak.

As at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, there were no overdue amounts due from PSPs which had not been impaired, nor were there any 
partially impaired amounts. There is an inherent concentration of risk with PSPs, which are not investment grade banks, in that the majority derive 
most of their income from the online gaming sector. To this end, where practicable and economic, the Group seeks to substitute non-investment 
grade PSPs with investment grade, or, at least, better quality PSPs.
The table below sets out the movement in the impairment of amounts due from PSPs.

Cash investments: As a result of the deteriorating European financial situation, in October 2011 the Group decided to only invest cash with banks 
on an overnight basis with a small number of very strong German and British financial institutions. The Group also invests cash in instant access 
pooled money market funds with a minimum long-term credit rating of AAA on the principal, as defined by Moody’s rating agency. The Group can 
also purchase commercial paper provided the issuer is not a financial institution and has a one year credit default swap, as quoted by Bloomberg, 
of no more than 1%.
Investments are allowed only in highly liquid securities. The Group maintains monthly operational balances with strong local banks in Israel, 
Bulgaria, Austria, USA and India to meet local salaries, expenses and legal requirements. In Austria, cash balances are also maintained to process 
and receive customer and affiliate payments. In Italy and France the Group maintains domestic segregated player funds accounts as required by 
the respective regulatory authorities. Cash is also held as security in Austria, Italy and UK primarily to support bank guarantees and as reserves 
for credit and debit card chargebacks. Other than this, non-central cash balances are kept to a minimum.

• overnight cash deposits;
• pooled money market funds;
• certificates of deposit; and
• commercial paper
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position.
Market risk
Market risk arises from the Group’s use of interest-bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that the fair value of 
future cashflows on its long-term debt finance and cash investments through the use of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s current net cash position is maintained primarily on a floating basis. In the event of a strategic change in the debt position of the Group, 
the interest rate management policy would be reviewed.

Currency risk
Transaction and currency liability exposures: The Group’s policy is that all material transaction and currency liability exposures are economically 
and fully hedged using foreign exchange contracts and/or by holding cash in the relevant currency. Additionally, the Group has discretion to hedge 
some or all of its forecast sterling operational costs in Gibraltar and the UK for up to 12 months. No other forecast cashflows are hedged. The Group 
may also economically hedge material committed exposures such as capital expenditure unless the period between commitment and payment is 
short (less than one month). Currency exposures are monitored by the Group Treasury Committee on a monthly basis. A €5m currency tolerance limit 
between euros and any other currency is permitted in order to avoid executing low value and uneconomic foreign exchange contracts.
Net investment exposures: The Group has the flexibility to hold debt in currencies other than euros in order to hedge non-euro investments up to 
50% of the net investment value. In managing the mix of ongoing debt exposure the Group takes into account prevailing interest rates in particular 
currencies and the potential impact on Group earnings ratios.
Sensitivity analysis to currency and interest rate risk
The Group has adopted a sensitivity analysis that measures the change to the fair value of the Group’s financial instruments and any resultant 
impact on the Group’s earnings of either:
• an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% in market interest rates (including the annualised interest income impact of variable rate 
interest-bearing financial instruments), or
• a 10% strengthening or weakening in the reporting currency against all other currencies from the rates applicable at 31 December
The Group is exposed to interest rate movements since it holds significant amounts of cash at floating rates as well as cash equivalents to meet 
client liability obligations that are non-interest-bearing. The Group is exposed to currency movements in the euro, arising out of changes in the 
fair value of financial instruments which are held in non-euro currencies. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice, market rates 
rarely change in isolation.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the possible impact of market risk, assuming that specified changes occur. 
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to other developments in financial markets that may cause fluctuations 
in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered 
as a projection of likely future events and losses.
Prior to the current year both the reporting currency of the Group and functional currency of the majority of subsidiaries was US dollars and 
currency risk was managed on that basis. The sensitivity analysis below reflects that management.

The Group has adopted and granted awards as a reward and retention incentive for employees of the Group, including the Executive Directors. 
The Group has used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value these options unless the Monte Carlo option pricing model is deemed more 
appropriate. An appropriate discount has been applied to reflect the fact that dividends are not paid on options that have not vested or have vested 
and have not been exercised.

PSP Plan
These options were to vest subject to the achievement of a total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance target over the three-year period 
commencing on 1 January or 1 July of each year from 2007 compared to the median TSR of a comparator group. The threshold for vesting 
at which 25% will vest, would have been TSR equalling the median of the comparator group, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting 
if the Company’s TSR exceeded the median by 10% per annum calculated over the three-year period. It is estimated that outperformance 
of the median by 10% per annum over that period is performance in excess of the upper quartile.
As part of the Merger, the Remuneration Committee measured the TSR performance condition up to the date of the EGM and determined the 
number of shares capable of vesting. Vesting will still occur on the original vesting dates subject to continued employment. No new awards 
are to be granted under this plan.
Value creation plan(‘VCP’)
Participants are granted VCP points, being a right to receive shares (in the form of a nil-cost option or a conditional share award) with a value equal 
to their allocated percentage of the VCP pool. The size of the VCP pool will be linked to the value created for Shareholders, taking into account the 
increase in share price, dividends paid and share buy-backs, over three one year performance periods, in excess of a hurdle amount (10% annual 
growth). The VCP pool will be calculated as being equal to 4% of the increase in the Company’s share price during the relevant year. After each year 
end the VCP pool will be converted into awards over a specific number of shares using the market value of a share at the relevant measurement 
date and in accordance with the participant’s allocated share of the VCP pool. The awards will be structured as nil-cost share options, with half of 
the shares under each option vesting at the end of the third performance period and the remaining half vesting one year later. As nil-cost options, 
they will remain exercisable for ten years from the date of grant.
As at 31 December 2011 the liability associated with the VCP was €nil (2010: €nil).

Executive FMV Plan
These options vested subject to the growth in the Company’s Clean Earnings per share equalling or exceeding 15% per annum in the three-year 
period from 1 January of each year from 2007. The performance period for these options was shortened to the date of the Merger but the 
performance conditions were not satisfied as at that date and so all unexercised awards lapsed. No new awards are to be granted under this plan.
Bonus Banking Plan (‘BBP’)
The BBP plan covers a three-year period with annual performance targets set at the beginning of each year. Depending on the extent to which the 
performance targets have been met in any year, an amount may be credited (or debited) to the participant’s bonus account on the measurement 
date. 50% will be credited in the form of shares (through a nil-cost option) and 50% in cash. Shortly after each measurement date an amount equal 
to half of the balance of the bonus account will be paid in cash to the participant. After the initial three years half the nil-cost option vests, with the 
balance vesting in year four, together with the balance of any cash. If the performance in any year does not satisfy the performance target then 
a participant’s bonus account is debited 50% of its current value.
As at 31 December 2011 the liability associated with the share-based element of the BBP was €1.7m (2010: €nil).
Bonus and Share Plan (‘BSP’)
This plan has the same conditions as the BBP , except where the performance conditions are not met in a particular year then there is no deduction 
made to a participant’s bonus account.
As at 31 December 2011 the liability associated with the share-based element of the BSP was €2.6m (2010: €nil).

bwin.party Rollover Plan
These options were granted as a result of the Merger to replace the existing bwin options at the time using the same exchange ratio as for Shares. 
They are subject to the original vesting conditions and have no performance conditions. No new awards are to be granted under this plan.
Global Share Plan (‘GSP’)
Awards of free Shares worth up to a maximum of £25,000 (or equivalent) may be made to each eligible employee each year. The award may be 
subject to performance conditions. There is flexibility to grant different types of free share award including nil-cost options, conditional awards 
of Shares and restricted shares where the employee is the owner of the Shares from the date of award. At 31 December 2011, all Shares under this 
scheme are nil-cost options with no performance conditions.
Additionally, where employees buy Shares up to a maximum of £1,500 each, they may be awarded additional free shares on a matching basis, up 
to a maximum of two matching Shares for each purchased share. Purchased Shares must be held for a minimum of three years for the matching 
Shares to vest.
Directors are not eligible to receive any awards under this plan.
FMV Plan
Options granted under this plan during the period generally vest in instalments over a three year period. There are no performance conditions 
attached to options issued by the Group under the terms of the FMV Plan. Directors are not eligible to receive any awards under this plan. 
No new awards are to be granted under this plan.
Nil‑ cost Plan
These options are not generally subject to performance conditions as this is regarded as detracting from their attraction and retention 
capabilities and instead usually vest on a phased basis over a four- to five-year period. The main exception to this general policy is the award made 
to key employees in the bingo segment, which will only vest subject to the satisfaction of a stretching EBITDA target for that business unit for 2012. 
No new awards are to be granted under this plan.
Outstanding share options issued that are not nil-cost have been granted at exercise prices between 10.0p and 489.0p (2010: between 155.0p 
and 457.5p).
The weighted average share price (at the date of exercise) of options exercised during the year was 151.5p (2010: 288.0p).
30. Events after the reporting period
On 6 March 2012 the Company announced that it had agreed to sell Ongame, its business-to-business (‘B2B’) online poker network, 
to Shuffle Master, Inc (‘Shuffle Master’) for a total cash consideration of up to €29.5m. The agreement is consistent with the Group’s stated strategy 
and follows its announced intention to sell Ongame on 30 June 2011.
Contingent consideration will become payable by Shuffle Master in the event that online poker becomes regulated in the United States within five 
years of completion. The amount payable in these circumstances will depend upon the timing of the commencement of legalised online gaming 
in the US. The transaction is subject to the normal terms and conditions for a transaction of this type as well as certain regulatory approvals and 
is expected to complete during the summer of 2012 with a back-stop date of December 2012. The management of Ongame will transfer with the 
business and the net sale proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
Since the year end the Company had purchased for cancellation a further 15,501,381 Shares at a total cost, including commission of £25,096,824.56.
31. Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.56p per share which together with the interim dividend of 1.56 pence per share makes a total 
dividend of 3.12p per share for the year ended 31 December 2011 (2010: nil). The final dividend, if approved at the Annual General Meeting will be 
payable to Shareholders on the register of shareholder interests on 11 May 2012 (the ‘Record Date’). It is expected that dividends will be paid on 
12 June 2012. Shareholders wishing to receive dividends in euros rather than pound sterling will need to file a currency election and return it 
to the Group’s registrars on or before 25 May 2012. A separate announcement regarding the dividend payment has been issued today.
32. Proposed capital reduction
In order to ensure sufficient financial flexibility in future the Company intends to restructure its balance sheet by carrying out a reduction of share 
capital through the cancellation of the share premium account and then allocating the same amount to a distributable reserve in the Company’s 
accounts. The Company intends to do this at an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders to be held immediately after the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting of Shareholders. A further announcement will made in due course.

Share information Depositary interests
bwin.party has entered into depositary interest arrangements to enable investors to settle and pay for interests in the Company’s shares through 
the CREST system. CREST is a paperless settlement system allowing securities to be transferred from one person’s CREST account to another without 
the need to use share certificates or written instruments of transfer. Securities issued by non-UK companies, such as bwin.party, cannot be held or 
transferred in the CREST system. Under arrangements put in place by the Company, a depositary holds the shares and has issued dematerialised 
depositary interests representing the underlying shares which are held on trust for the holders of the depositary interests.
Capita IRG Trustees Limited (the ‘Depositary’), is part of the same group of companies as bwin.party’s registrars, Capita Registrars (Jersey) Limited 
(the ‘Registrar’), and has issued the dematerialised depositary interests. The depositary interests are independent securities constituted under 
English law which may be held and transferred through the CREST system.
The depositary interests have been created pursuant to and issued on the terms of a deed poll executed by the Depositary in favour of the holders 
of the depositary interests from time to time (the ‘Deed Poll’).
As at 31 December 2011, 719,068,913 Shares were held by the Depositary in respect of a total 719,068,913 depositary interests. There were 1,001 
depositary interest holders on the depositary interest register as at that date.
Each depositary interest is treated as one share. The Depositary will pass on to holders of depositary interests any stock or cash benefits received 
by it as the holder of shares on trust. Depositary interest holders will also be able to receive notices of shareholder meetings and other documents 
issued by bwin.party to shareholders.
The Depositary must pass on to depositary interest holders and, so far as they are reasonably able, exercise on behalf of depositary interest 
holders all rights and entitlements received, or to which they are entitled in respect of the underlying shares which are capable of being passed 
on or exercised. Rights and entitlements to cash distributions, to information, to make choices and elections and to call for, attend and vote 
at meetings shall, subject to the Deed Poll, be passed on in the form in which they are received together with amendments and additional 
documentation necessary to effect such passing-on, or, as the case may be, exercised in accordance with the Deed Poll. The depositary 
interests have the same ISIN and SEDOL numbers as the underlying shares and do not have a separate listing on the Official List.

Dividends
Following the announcement on 30 June 2011 in respect of the Company’s distribution policy and the disclosure in the Company’s half-year results, 
the Board declared an interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2011 for an amount of €15m which was distributed to shareholders on 
7 October 2011. The Company intends paying a final dividend of €15m, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 7 June 2012. The final dividend 
of 1.56p per share will be paid to Shareholders and depositary interest holders on 12 June 2012. The record date for the final dividend is 11 May 2012 
and the Shares start trading ex-dividend on 9 May 2012.
In order to assist shareholders and depositary interest holders, the cash dividend may be paid either in Pounds Sterling or Euros and should you wish 
to receive the dividend, and all future dividends, in Euros you can elect to do so by following the instructions below. Dividends paid in Euros will be 
paid at the Euro to Pounds Sterling exchange rate prevailing shortly prior to payment, subject to receipt of a currency election card or electronic 
notification via CREST. If you make no election you will continue to receive your dividend in Pounds Sterling.

(i) Dividend Election Reference – you must indicate here a reference for the dividend election which is unique to your CREST participant I.D.;
(ii) Account I.D. – If you have more than one member account, you must indicate the member account I.D. to which the election relates: the relevant 
account must be enabled (a) at the time your Dividend Election Input Message is entered into CREST, and (b) on the relevant dividend payment 
date:
(iii) ISIN – This is GI000A0MV757
(iv) Evergreen – This field must be entered with its flag set to ‘yes’. This requests the Company to apply your election to the current dividend and to 
all future dividends in respect of your entire depositary interest holding in CREST at each relevant record date until (a) you delete your Dividend 
Election Input Message and that deletion is accepted in accordance with the CREST procedures on behalf of the Company, (b) you transfer your 
depositary interest holding in CREST, or (c) the facility is withdrawn by the Directors;
(v) Corporate Action Number – This is not to be input;
(vi) Distribution type – You must enter ‘currency’ here;
(vii) Currency code – This is GBP;
(viii) Number of shares – This field should be left blank. If this field is completed, the message will be rejected;
(ix) Contact details – this field is optional, although you are asked to include details of whom to contact in the event of a query relating to your election.
A valid election made by means of Dividend Election Input Message will, to the extent it relates to shares held in depositary interests at the relevant 
record date, supersede all previous written elections made in respect of holdings in the same member account.
You may only revoke an election which has been made by Dividend Election Input Message by utilising the CREST procedures for deletions described 
in the CREST manual. The deletion will be valid in relation to the then current dividend only if the deletion is accepted, in accordance with the CREST 
procedures, by or on behalf of the Company prior to close of business on the Euro election deadline (25 May 2012 for the final dividend payable on 
12 June 2012). With respect to subsequent dividend payments, the valid revocation must be received by the record date for the relevant dividend 
payment. It is recommended that you input any deletion message 48 hours in advance of this deadline (25 May 2012) to give the Company or its 
agent sufficient time to accept the deletion.
There is no facility to amend an election which has been made by Dividend Election Input Message. If you wish to change your election details, 
you must first delete the existing election as described above and then input a Dividend Election Input Message with the required new details.
Any attempts to send a new Dividend Election Input Message, where an existing Dividend Election Message is present and has not been deleted, 
will be rejected.
Dividend payments will be paid electronically into CREST accounts where possible. Otherwise where not paid electronically into CREST they 
will be paid by cheque, if dividend payments are being paid in Pounds Sterling the enclosed bank mandate form will need to be completed.
If you have any problems making an election through CREST then file a bwin.party currency election card and send it back to Capita Registrars, 
to be received no later than 25 May 2012.
These documents are also posted on bwin.party’s corporate website, www.bwinparty.com.

Shareholders wishing to make a Euro election should complete and submit a currency election card to the Registrar no later than 25 May 2012.
(iii) General notes
Shareholders or depositary interest holders who submit their currency elections after the deadline (25 May 2012) for submission will receive their 
dividends in Pounds Sterling.
Incorrectly completed currency election cards will be rejected.
Elections may not be split in respect of one share or depositary interest holding and elections are enduring for future dividends unless a subsequent 
election is submitted to the Registrar or Depositary.
Depositary interest holders who hold their depositary interests through CREST will receive their dividend payments through CREST irrespective 
of whether they elect to have the dividend paid in Euros.
Shareholders receiving the dividend in Pounds Sterling are advised to complete a BACS instruction so that their dividend can be paid electronically 
directly into their bank account. For the final dividend payable on 12 June 2012 a BACS instruction form should be submitted to the Registrar no later 
than 15 May 2012. If a BACS instruction is not validly submitted then dividends will be paid by cheque.

Share information Receiving Company documents electronically
All shareholder documents can be found on the Company’s website, www.bwinparty.com, together with previous announcements to the London 
Stock Exchange, share price information and general information about bwin.party and its business.
bwin.party’s articles of association allow the Company to provide all shareholder and depositary interest holder documents via its website, except 
where shareholders and depositary interest holders have requested to receive a hard copy of such documents. This allows bwin.party to limit the 
environmental impact of our business and to manage our costs more effectively.
If you are currently receiving hard copies of bwin.party’s documents through the post and would like to be kinder to the environment and help 
reduce bwin.party’s costs, you are encouraged to register to receive Company documents via the Company’s website. You can do this by going 
to the registrar’s website, www.capitaregistrars.com and registering for electronic communications. You will be notified that Company documents 
are on the corporate website by written notification which will be mailed to you unless when registering to receive documents electronically you 
request to be notified by email rather than post.
Company announcements
Copies of announcements made by the Company are available on the Company’s website, www.bwinparty.com.
Taxation
The following statements are intended to apply only as a general guide to current tax law for an individual shareholder who holds shares as an 
investment and who is the beneficial owner of the shares. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisers in connection with their potential 
liability to pay tax in the country of their nationality or the country where they live on disposal, gift or bequest of their shares or on the receipt 
of dividends.
(i) Taxation of capital gains
There is no capital gains tax in Gibraltar on a disposal of shares, but shareholders may be liable to pay tax in the country of their nationality or the 
country where they live.
(ii) Stamp duty
No stamp duty is chargeable in Gibraltar on the transfer of shares and there is no stamp duty reserve tax in Gibraltar.
Provided that bwin.party’s shares are not registered in any register kept in the UK by or on behalf of the Company, an agreement to transfer the 
shares would not be expected to be subject to UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. The bwin.party share register is not kept in the UK and it 
is not intended that any such register will be kept in the UK. A transfer on sale of bwin.party shares would not be expected to be subject to UK stamp 
duty or stamp duty reserve tax provided that the instrument of transfer is not executed in the UK and does not relate to any property situated or 
to any matter or thing to be done in the UK.
No UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is expected to be payable on an agreement to transfer bwin.party depositary interests within CREST 
provided that relevant conditions are met including in particular that (a) no register of shares is kept in the UK by or on behalf of the Company; and 
(b) the central management and control of the Company is not exercised in the UK. It is intended that these conditions will be met. It is not expected 
that an instrument subject to UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax would be created in respect of such a transfer.

3. Voting
3.1 Shareholders
Shareholders may attend the AGM in person and vote on a show of hands or on a poll. A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may also 
appoint a proxy to attend and, on a poll, vote in his/her place. A proxy need not be a shareholder. A proxy may demand or join in demanding a poll 
and has the right to speak at the meeting.
A proxy form may be submitted in hard copy form by post or courier or electronically via the www.bwinparty-registrar.com website.
Hard copy proxy forms must be completed by or on behalf of the Shareholder. If the Shareholder is a corporation then the proxy form must be 
executed by a duly authorised person or under its common seal or in a manner authorised by its constitution. A proxy form is enclosed with this 
Notice of AGM. To be valid, completed proxy forms must be returned to Capita Registrars, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU 
to be received no later than 12.30 p.m. (11.30 a.m. BST) on 5 June 2012.

Annual General Meeting 
General Notes 3.2 Depositary interest holders
Depositary interest holders may attend in person and vote on a show of hands or on a poll if the Depositary has appointed them a corporate 
representative (see section 2.2 above). Depositary interest holders not wishing to attend the AGM but wishing to vote in respect of the resolutions 
to be considered at the AGM can do so by instructing the Depositary. This may be done in one of two ways:
(i) Depositary interest holders who are CREST members may give such an instruction utilising the CREST electronic voting service in accordance 
with the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal depositary interest holders or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider, should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider, who will be able 
to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for an instruction made by CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (‘a CREST proxy instruction’) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s requirements and must contain information required for such instructions, as described in 
the CREST Manual. The message, in order to be valid, must be transmitted so as to be received by the Depositary’s agent, ID RA10 by 12.30 p.m. 
(11.30 a.m. BST) on 4 June 2012. The time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by 
the CREST applications host) from which the Depositary’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed 
by CREST. The Depositary may treat as invalid a CREST voting instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers, should note that CRESTCo does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input 
of CREST proxy instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or 
voting service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by 
any particular time. Please refer to the CREST Manual for further guidance.
(ii) Depositary interest holders who cannot give voting instructions via CREST should complete the enclosed form of direction and submit it to the 
depositary. If the depositary interest holder is a corporation then the form of direction must be executed by a duly authorised person or under 
its common seal or in a manner authorised by its constitution. To be valid, forms of direction must be received by the Depositary no later than 
12.30 p.m. (11.30 a.m. BST) on 4 June 2012.
(iii) Depositary interest holders who cannot give voting instructions via CREST can also submit a form of direction electronically by visiting  
www.bwinparty-registrar.com website and selecting the Annual General Meeting tab on the left hand side of the page. To be valid, the 
electronic form of direction must be received by the Depositary no later than 12.30 p.m. (11.30 a.m. BST) on 4 June 2011.
4. bwin.party employees
bwin.party employees who have exercised their bwin.party share awards and have retained all/some of the resultant bwin.party Shares and hold 
these Shares through the bwin.party nominee account service, Capita IRG Trustees (Nominees) Limited and wish to attend the AGM, should request 
Capita IRG Trustees (Nominees) Limited to appoint them as a corporate representative. This is done by completing the nominee account instruction 
form enclosed with this AGM notice. Irrespective of whether an eligible employee wishes to attend the AGM or not, they are recommended to 
complete the nominee account instruction form and send it to Capita Registrars, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU, 
United Kingdom, to be received no later than 12.30 p.m. (11.30 a.m. BST) on 4 June 2012.
5. Documents for inspection
Copies of the following documents are available for inspection during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office at 711 Europort,

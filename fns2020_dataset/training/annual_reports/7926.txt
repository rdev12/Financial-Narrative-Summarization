CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Derek Bonham
Chairman
With another strong financial
and operational performance
in 2005, I am delighted that
our strategy for growth has
continued to deliver value
for our shareholders.
Our strategy is clear. It is to create sustainable shareholder
value by growing our business both organically and through
acquisitions. Our focus on this strategy has transformed
Imperial Tobacco over the past nine years into the
international company it is today.
In the past five years total shareholder return was 265 per
cent and we have outperformed the FTSE All-Share Index
by 245 per cent. Contributing to that track record, in 2005
total shareholder return was 40 per cent.
EARNINGS AND DIVIDEND
During the year we delivered some pleasing market and
brand performances which, combined with our continuing
focus on costs and effective cash management, grew
adjusted earnings per share by 11 per cent to 112.8 pence.
Basic earnings per share was 79.0 pence (2004: 61.4 pence).
As a result of this successful performance, the Board is
recommending a final dividend of 39.5
1
pence per share,
bringing the total dividend for the year to 56.0 pence, up
12 per cent on 2004 (2004: 50.0 pence). Since 2001 we
have grown our dividend by 18 per cent compound.
This financial performance reflected a number of operational
highlights that clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our
strategy.
PERFORMANCE
Our core markets of the UK and Germany delivered
significant improvements in profits, against a background of
market declines, an excellent achievement. Elsewhere, we
grew our cigarette shares in a number of markets across the
world with some strong brand performances from Davidoff
and West.
Our drive for efficiencies and further cost savings across
the Group has continued. The ongoing focus on enhancing
productivity and improving operational efficiencies within
our manufacturing operations has resulted in the closure
of three manufacturing sites in the past year, with further
rationalisation announced in September.
Building on our strengths…
1
The dividend will be paid on 17 February 2006 to those shareholders on
the register at the close of business on 20 January 2006.
  IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005
07
We are a highly cash generative tobacco company and
we have ensured that shareholders continue to benefit from
our effective cash management by initiating a rolling share
buyback programme in February 2005. We see this as an
efficient use of cash whilst we continue to pursue value
creating acquisition opportunities.
BOARD CHANGES
The Board continues to ensure high standards of corporate
governance across every aspect of the business. Each
year we conduct a review of Board membership to ensure
that an appropriate level of independent Non-Executive
Directors is maintained through orderly succession, without
compromising the effectiveness of the Board and mindful
of the independence requirements of the Combined Code.
Simon Duffy and Sipko Huismans will step down as Non-
Executive Directors at our AGM in January 2006 having
served nine years on the Board. In addition, David Thursfield
resigned as a Non-Executive Director in October 2005, due
to his increasing level of external commitments. I would like
to thank Simon and Sipko for their valuable contributions to
the business since 1996 and David for his contribution since
2003. At our AGM in 2006, Iain Napier, who was appointed
as Joint Vice Chairman in December 2004, will take on the
role of Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
I have been delighted to welcome both Susan Murray and
Colin Day as Non-Executive Directors during the year. Both
bring a wealth of experience to the business; Susan has
held a number of high-profile marketing and management
roles and Colin is an experienced international executive
with a strong track record in the consumer sector.
Bruce Davidson, Sales and Marketing Director, resigned
from the Board in February. Graham Blashill, formerly
Regional Director Western Europe, has extended his
responsibilities to cover all of the Group’s global sales and
marketing operations and I was delighted to welcome him
to the Board as Group Sales and Marketing Director in
October 2005.
OUTLOOK
Our balance, both geographically and in the breadth of the
products and brands we offer consumers, together with our
ingrained focus on costs, leave us well placed to continue to
grow the business.
This, combined with our effective use of cash for value
creating acquisitions, further organic investments and share
buybacks, should ensure that we continue to deliver
sustainable growth for our shareholders.
I am grateful to my colleagues on the Board, our senior
management team and to our employees worldwide for their
impressive contributions and continued commitment to
Imperial Tobacco’s success; my sincere thanks to them all.
Derek Bonham
Chairman
In conclusion, I am confident
that our strategy will continue
to deliver good results, with
our strong management team
ensuring excellence in its
execution. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

brand and market share
across product categories.
Multi-Product Advantage

and a top three position in over
20 markets we have a strong global footprint.

OPERATING AND 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The fundamental strength of our core business was
demonstrated by the improved profits we have delivered
in the mature markets of the UK and Germany.
Across Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East
and Asia we increased our cigarette shares in many markets
due to the strength of our brand portfolio and our focus on
trade marketing and sales excellence. This cigarette share
growth reflected strong performances from our international
strategic brands Davidoff and West, particularly in the Rest
of Western Europe, where volumes grew by 11 per cent and
31 per cent respectively.
Despite a significant cigarette market size reduction in one of
our core markets, Germany, we have been very encouraged
by the positive trend in our overall cigarette volumes in the
second half of the year, reversing the decline of the first half,
with annual volumes up 1.5 per cent year on year.
In manufacturing, we continued to focus on the simplification
and standardisation of processes, products and packaging.
We have delivered an excellent improvement in productivity,
up by 15 per cent in 2005. This is due to the closure of a
number of factories since May 2004, together with the
benefits of machinery redeployment and underlying
efficiency gains. As part of our ongoing manufacturing
review, in September 2005 we announced a restructuring of
our European cigarette operations and the consolidation of
our rolling papers production into Belgium, which will result
in the closure of our rolling papers factory in South Wales.
We continually review our cost base to ensure that we are
structured efficiently and effectively in manufacturing, sales
and marketing and our central support functions.
We are proud of the hallmarks of our business: our strong
financial performance, our profitable core markets of the UK
and Germany, our international reach, our brand equity, our
multi-product portfolio, our cost focus and our track record
of successful acquisitions.
A fundamental element of our strong financial performance
is our ability to turn our profits into cash and ensure its
effective utilisation. A rolling share buyback programme
was initiated in February 2005 on which we spent around
£200 million during the remainder of the financial year.
Another year of great results…
Gareth Davis
Chief Executive
Our focus on a clear and consistent strategy has again
produced great results in 2005 with double digit earnings
per share growth, building on our outstanding track record. In the past five years total shareholder return was 265 per cent and we have outperformed the
FTSE All-Share Index by 245 per cent.
The fundamental strength of our core business was demonstrated by the improved profits we
have delivered in the mature markets of the UK and Germany.
Across Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia we increased our cigarette
shares in many markets due to the strength of our brand portfolio and our focus on trade
marketing and sales excellence.
We continued to invest for sustainable organic growth. With our Turkish factory opening in
April, we initially launched Davidoff and Maxim cigarettes with encouraging early results and
we added to the portfolio with the introduction of West in September 2005. In China, we built
on our already strong relationship with the Yuxi Hongta Group.  We enhanced our position in
the Scandinavian market through our investment in Swedish snus manufacturer Skruf.
We have delivered an excellent improvement in productivity up by 15 per cent in 2005.
We support sensible and fair regulation that recognises us as a legitimate business producing
a legal product and we continue to engage with the relevant authorities constructively.

2005 has been a great year
for Imperial Tobacco. Looking
ahead, I believe that we will
continue to build on our
successes.
We continued to invest for sustainable organic growth.
With our Turkish factory opening in April, we initially launched
Davidoff and Maxim cigarettes with encouraging early results
and we added to the portfolio with the introduction of West
in September 2005. We increased our direct sales force in
Italy and are improving our route to market capabilities in a
number of markets, including Russia. In China, we built on
our already strong relationship with the Yuxi Hongta Group.
We enhanced our position in the Scandinavian market
through our investment in Swedish snus manufacturer Skruf,
giving us a foothold in snus and also allowing us to
distribute our other products through their established
selling operation.
Our success is not just about our operational performance.
It is also about the Group’s responsible behaviour towards
a large number of business partners. These partners accept
our contribution to the economic growth of many countries
and recognise the engagement of Imperial Tobacco in areas
of mutual interest. Our progress in this area is demonstrated
further in our annual Corporate Responsibility Review, which
will be updated in December 2005 and will be available on
our website www.imperial-tobacco.com.
Whilst regulation has increased significantly over the past
five years, we are experienced in developing our business
successfully in this environment as demonstrated by our
consistent results. We support sensible and fair regulation
that recognises we are a legitimate business, producing a
legal product. We continue our approach of constructive
engagement with the authorities in the markets in which we
operate. We believe that sensible regulation combined with
well thought out voluntary agreements is the most effective
way forward.
From a litigation perspective, we were pleased with the
judge’s decision in May to dismiss on all counts the McTear
claim against Imperial Tobacco in Scotland. We have never
lost or settled any tobacco litigation and will continue to
defend ourselves robustly against any further speculative
claims.
Identifying and developing tomorrow’s leaders is a key
activity for all businesses. Several new initiatives were
introduced in the year to develop our management team,
with the aim of further improving performance and instilling
the essence of what makes Imperial Tobacco successful.
Our people are dedicated. They are sales and cost focused
and have a tremendous track record. They are not only
good at what they do, they are also committed to
shareholder value creation and I join the Chairman in
thanking our employees worldwide for what they have
achieved this year on behalf of our shareholders.
Our unswerving focus on our strategy, to create sustainable
shareholder value by growing our operations both organically
and through acquisitions, continues to place the Group in a
strong position. IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005

GROUP OPERATING PERFORMANCE
In 2005, adjusted operating profit before amortisation and
exceptional items grew 7 per cent to £1,307 million. This
growth was driven by our continuing focus on profitable
volume development, capitalising on our broad product
portfolio and underpinned by effective cost management.
Reported operating profit, after amortisation and exceptional
items, was up 18 per cent to £1,044 million including
a reduction in exceptional items to £57 million (2004:
£129 million).
Turnover including duty was £11,255 million compared to
£11,005 million in the financial year ending 2004. Turnover
excluding duty was up 4 per cent to £3,149 million
(2004: £3,032 million), with the Group’s adjusted operating
margin up to 41.5 per cent (2004: 40.2 per cent).

  Effective Cash Management
Our five year track record of cash conversion is strong with our operating cash flow after net
capital expenditure averaging 92 per cent of adjusted operating profit.
Strong cash generation is a key hallmark of our business and the effective application of our
cash is essential in continuing to deliver growth in shareholder value.
Our primary aim is to continue to develop the business through investment in organic growth
and by pursuing value creating acquisitions. In order to keep our balance sheet efficient while
we are looking for value creating opportunities we commenced a share buyback programme
in February.

Comparing the cash flow generated after net

amortisation and exceptionals, before restructuring
payments of £46 million in 2005. Share Buybacks
In the year ended 30 September 2005 we spent around £200 million on 13.5 million shares.
The average share price paid was 1475 pence, excluding transaction costs.
Shares were purchased on market on the London Stock Exchange and are held as treasury
shares on the balance sheet. We have, and intend to renew at the 2006 AGM, shareholder
approval to buy back up to 10 per cent of our issued share capital. The Directors choose to
exercise this power only when, in light of market conditions prevailing at the time, they believe
that the effect of such purchases will be to increase earnings per share and is in the best
interest of shareholders generally.
The share buyback programme is ongoing, and in the absence of value creating acquisitions,
we intend to spend up to our annual free cash flow.
The impact of the share buyback programme for the financial year ended September 2005
was to increase adjusted earnings per share by 0.4 pence and basic earnings per share by
0.2 pence, after taking into account an increase in the net interest charge of £3 million and
a decrease in the tax charge of £1 million. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

Results before amortisation and exceptional items
In the UK, turnover excluding duty was up 2 per cent
to £812 million, with adjusted operating profit up 5 per
cent to £477 million. Cigarette volumes were down to
23.9 billion mainly as a result of market volume declines.
The profit improvement reflected the benefits of price
increases, growth in fine cut tobacco and reduced costs,
which more than offset cigarette volume declines and the
impact of downtrading.
In Germany, turnover excluding duty increased 7 per cent
to £630 million, with adjusted operating profit up 24 per
cent to £295 million. This performance was despite a
significant decline in the cigarette market size following
successive duty rises. Our volumes were more resilient
than the market, down 13 per cent to 20.9 billion, reflecting
cigarette share growth. Price increases, growth in volumes
of other tobacco products and cost efficiencies, both in
manufacturing and trading operations, more than
compensated for the cigarette volume declines and the
impact of downtrading.
In the Rest of Western Europe, turnover excluding duty
was up 2 per cent to £644 million. Adjusted operating
profit was slightly down at £326 million. The increase in
turnover was driven by cigarette volumes, up 7 per cent
to 17.7 billion, as market share growth more than
compensated for market declines. Our fine cut tobacco
volumes were affected by increased downtrading across
the region. These volume performances, combined with a
movement in the geographic sales mix towards southern
Europe, resulted in a slight decrease in profits and margins.
In the Rest of the World, turnover excluding duty was
up 5 per cent to £1,063 million with adjusted operating
profit up 6 per cent to £209 million. Our cigarette volumes
were up 5 per cent to 112.7 billion and fine cut tobacco
volumes were stable at 1,800 tonnes. Profits and margins
increased, benefiting from volume growth, pricing
improvements and operating cost reductions, more than
offsetting regional mix effects and market investments.

TAXATION
The tax charge for the year was £286 million (2004: £238
million), representing an effective tax rate of 27.0 per cent
on profit before amortisation. The tax rate on reported profit
before tax was 33.2 per cent. The Group continues to
benefit from lower tax rates applied to a number of overseas
subsidiaries.
EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 11 per cent
to 112.8 pence (2004: 101.6 pence) and basic earnings
per share increased by 29 per cent to 79.0 pence
(2004: 61.4 pence).
We have proposed a final dividend for the year of 39.5 pence,
such that the total dividend for the year is 56.0 pence, an
increase of 12 per cent broadly in line with our adjusted
earnings growth. This dividend will be paid on 17 February
2006 to those shareholders on the register at the close
of business on 20 January 2006. Our dividend policy is
progressive, growing dividends broadly in line with adjusted
earnings, with around a 50 per cent payout ratio.
The interim dividend of 16.5 pence was paid on 5 August
2005.
FINANCING AND LIQUIDITY
At the year end, our net debt had decreased to £3.3 billion
(2004: £3.6 billion) of which 21 per cent was denominated
in sterling, 77 per cent in euros and the balance in other
currencies. In February we refinanced our core bank facility
with a new €2.25 billion, 5 year facility on improved terms.
At the year end 55 per cent of gross debt was fixed by
interest rate derivatives (2004: 60.2 per cent).
CASH MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
We have a strong track record of cash conversion averaging
92 per cent over the last five years and this trend continued
in 2005 with operating cash flow after net capital expenditure
representing 104 per cent of adjusted operating profit.
Gross capital expenditure was £90 million (2004: £103 million),
reflecting a maintenance level of capital expenditure plus
investment in our factory in Turkey.
Our net capital expenditure was £63 million (2004: £48 million)
including proceeds on disposal of fixed assets of £27 million
(2004: £55 million).
OPERATING AND 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
INTEREST
The net interest charge for the year decreased to £184 million
(2004: £204 million) reflecting reduced debt levels and a lower
average all-in cost of debt of 5.3 per cent (2004: 5.6 per cent).
This was mainly due to higher levels of floating rate debt,
the refinancing of our bank facility at improved margins and
maturing capital market debt being replaced with lower cost
bank financing. Interest cover before amortisation and
exceptional items was 7.1 times (2004: 6.0 times).
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Group adjusted profit before tax rose 11 per cent to
£1,123 million (2004: £1,014 million). After amortisation
and exceptional items, reported profit before tax increased
by 25 per cent to £862 million (2004: £688 million).
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Reported profit before tax was impacted by exceptional
items of £57 million (2004: £129 million) and profit on the
sale of fixed assets of £2 million (2004: £7 million). The 2005
exceptional costs related to a number of restructuring
initiatives including the closure of our Montreal, Plattsburgh
and Dublin factories, and the announced restructuring of our
European cigarette operations and the closure of our South
Wales factory. These initiatives are anticipated to generate
the following annual savings: Dublin £4 million for year
ending 30 September 2006; Berlin £10 million and Treforest
£3 million both for the year ending 30 September 2007.
ACQUISITIONS
In September, we acquired a 43 per cent stake of the
Swedish snus company, Skruf. The consideration of £6 million
was satisfied in cash with a commitment to purchase the
balance of shares by mid 2009. The acquisition will be
accounted for as a 100 per cent owned subsidiary to reflect
the substance of the transaction.
The total amortisation charge for the Group for the year was
£206 million (2004: £204 million). IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005

SHARE BUYBACKS
We commenced a share buyback programme in February
2005. By 30 September 2005 we had spent around £200
million buying back 13.5 million shares, representing 1.9 per
cent of issued share capital, all of which are held as treasury
shares. The average share price paid was 1475 pence,
excluding transaction costs.
The impact of the share buyback programme for the
financial year ended September 2005 was to increase
adjusted earnings per share by 0.4 pence and basic
earnings per share by 0.2 pence, after taking into account
an increase in the net interest charge of £3 million and a
decrease in the tax charge of £1 million.
ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS
The financial statements for the year ended 30 September
2005 have been prepared in accordance with UK accounting
standards (UK GAAP). For the year ending 30 September
2006, we will report under International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS).
We communicated our assessment of the key changes that
implementing IFRS would have had on our results for 2004,
in March 2005 and the related presentation is available on
our website. Excluding the impact of IAS39 on derivatives,
our adjusted results under IFRS for 2004 would have been
marginally different due to pensions accounting, with all
other impacts currently assessed as being immaterial.
The major impacts on net assets amounted to an uplift
of around half a billion pounds at 1 October 2004.
We are preparing a reconciliation of our 2005 UK GAAP
primary financial statements to IFRS which we will release
on 24 November 2005. It will be posted to shareholders
along with the Annual Report and Accounts and will be
available on our website, www.imperial-tobacco.com.

MARKET DYNAMICS
We estimate that the UK cigarette market was down by around 4 per cent to 51 billion cigarettes. Consumer
downtrading continued with growth in both the ultra low price cigarette and fine cut tobacco sectors. We estimate
the fine cut tobacco market grew to 3,000 tonnes (2004: 2,900 tonnes).
We operate in a highly regulated environment in which new point of sale advertising restrictions were introduced in
December 2004. The UK Government’s Health Bill was published on 27 October 2005, and states that from the
summer of 2007, smoking will be banned in all enclosed public places in England and Wales, apart from private
members’ clubs and licensed premises that do not serve or prepare food.
We anticipate that in Scotland and Northern Ireland a ban on smoking in public places will be implemented on
26 March 2006 and by April 2007 respectively.
OUR PERFORMANCE
We delivered a strong improvement in operating profits, up 5 per cent to £477 million as a result of price increases,
growth in fine cut tobacco volumes and cost reductions.
Our results reflect the strength of our brand portfolio, which includes the UK’s two best selling cigarette brand
families, Lambert & Butler and Richmond. Lambert & Butler performed well, maintaining 16.0 per cent of the market,
whilst Richmond had an excellent year, growing its share by 1.5 percentage points to 14.7 per cent. The combined
brand families accounted for over 30 per cent of the UK market in 2005.
Reflecting market dynamics, our market shares of Regal, Embassy and Superkings declined slightly such that our
total UK cigarette market share remained broadly stable at 44.5 per cent.
We increased our fine cut tobacco share to 66.3 per cent, with strong growth from Golden Virginia, the UK market leader.
Our excellent performance in this highly regulated environment reflects our continued investment in our skilled
salesforce and supporting technology.
Our UK co-marketing and logistics agreement with Philip Morris was renegotiated for an additional five years.
OUTLOOK
The UK market continues to make a major contribution to the Group’s overall performance. In the context of
moderate market declines and current market sector trends, our strong brand portfolio means we are well placed
to build on our market leadership positions in cigarette and fine cut tobacco and to further develop our profits.

GROUP PLC / 2005
23
Germany
Our focus on the profitable development of our
German operations has delivered significantly
improved results, demonstrating our flexibility
to adapt to market conditions.
MARKET DYNAMICS
Successive tax increases over the past few years continue to impact the overall market size in Germany and
we estimate that the total tobacco market in 2005 was down by 4 per cent to 144 billion cigarette equivalents
(2004: 150 billion). The cigarette market decreased by 15 per cent to 101 billion cigarettes partially offset by strong
growth in other tobacco products, up by 39 per cent, as consumers sought value brands and products. Reflecting
this trend, the low price branded cigarette sector continued to grow and accounted for 7.5 per cent of cigarette
sales in September 2005.
The third and final stage of the current round of tobacco tax increases was introduced in September 2005, following
those in March and December 2004. We passed on this tax increase to consumers which, for the majority of our
cigarette portfolio, entailed reducing pack sizes from 19 to 17 cigarettes and lowering prices by 20 euro cents.
In the case between the German Government and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) regarding the taxation of the
Singles make your own product category, the Advocate General published his opinion in July stating that the Singles
category should no longer be taxed as fine cut tobacco but at the same higher rate as cigarettes. The ruling of the
ECJ is expected on 10 November 2005.
OUR PERFORMANCE
Despite a challenging trading environment, operating profit rose by 24 per cent to £295 million, due to growth in our
cigarette share, increased other tobacco product volumes, price increases and the benefits of cost efficiencies in
both manufacturing and trading.
We were pleased with the growth in our cigarette share up to 19.4 per cent (2004: 18.9 per cent). The market share
development of JPS was particularly impressive with the brand capturing 1.7 per cent of the cigarette market in the
18 months since its launch, finishing the year at 2.8 per cent. Davidoff, Peter Stuyvesant and R1 all continued to
perform well in the premium sector and West remained the second largest cigarette brand in Germany with market
share of 8.5 per cent.
Within other tobacco products our volumes have grown strongly, largely driven by the growth in Singles, up by
36 per cent, although our annual market share in this sector declined to 24.2 per cent as a result of increased
competitor activity. In the second half our share stabilised reflecting good performances from JPS and the recently
launched Fairwind.
OUTLOOK
The German market will continue to be challenging and particularly if the awaited ECJ ruling is adverse, but we have
prepared a variety of portfolio responses depending on the outcome. Our flexible approach has ensured the improving
profitability of our operations in Germany and we believe that this flexibility, combined with our broad product portfolio
and our strength in value cigarettes and other tobacco products, will continue to mean we are well positioned.

REGIONAL DYNAMICS
We estimate the annual regional cigarette market was down by 3 per cent, but the rate of decline slowed in the second
half of the year. The regional fine cut tobacco market declined by 2 per cent due to increased prices. Consumers
continued to economise, stimulating growth in the value segments of both cigarette and fine cut tobacco.
The debate on smoking in public places has intensified across the region this year most notably in Italy where further
restrictions were introduced. Our experience in Ireland bears out our view that there would be an initial market
decline with the impact diminishing over time.
OUR PERFORMANCE
The growth in our cigarette shares more than offset the market volume decline. However operating profit was slightly
down at £326 million reflecting the change in sales mix and downtrading within fine cut tobacco.
In the Netherlands, our cigarette market share grew to 4.9 per cent due to the strong performance of West and we
introduced JPS Red and JPS Silver in June in the value segment to capitalise on the continued downtrading dynamic.
Our fine cut tobacco market share was impacted by downtrading; however, we have seen encouraging progress since
we launched the value brands Zilver and Evergreen during the year.
Our domestic cigarette market share in Belgium improved in the second half of the year with an encouraging
performance from Route 66.
In Ireland we grew cigarette market share to 25.0 per cent with growth in Superkings.
Although our overall cigarette share declined slightly in France to 3.3 per cent, we have strengthened our value
offering by extending the JPS family. We maintained our market leading position in the fine cut tobacco sector with
our share at 29 per cent supported by a good performance by Interval.
In Greece, despite downtrading, Davidoff continued to perform strongly in the premium sector with 16 per cent volume
growth and with the repositioning of West and the launch of Maxim Slims our market share rose to 7.0 per cent.
In Spain our market share grew to 5.1 per cent, mainly due to the success of the JPS brand family. We are market
leaders in the growing fine cut tobacco market and delivered a strong performance with Golden Virginia.
The benefits of investment in a new salesforce in Italy were reflected in our cigarette share which reached 1.6 per cent
with growth from Peter Stuyvesant, Route 66 and West.
OUTLOOK
Given the current regional dynamics, we believe the breadth of our product portfolio provides us with opportunities for
future growth as we continue to strengthen our position in this region.

REGIONAL DYNAMICS
This region consists of both mature and developing markets including the key growth regions of Asia, Eastern Europe,
Africa and the Middle East. Many of these markets are highly regulated and we are seeing an increasing level of
regulatory debate and activity across the world, in part influenced by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
OUR PERFORMANCE
Operating profit in this region grew by 6 per cent to £209 million with our performances across Asia, Eastern Europe,
Africa and the Middle East more than offsetting the impact of challenging trading conditions in Central Europe and
Duty Free.
In Asia, we increased our market share in Taiwan to 11.4 per cent with a good performance from Boss, benefiting
from the introduction of Boss Blue in July. In both Vietnam and Laos we grew our volumes and share, with a strong
performance from Bastos. In China, the co-operation with the Yuxi Hongta Group continued to develop with a
number of collaborative workshops and the extension of the West brand distribution to Beijing.
In Australia, profits grew despite market declines. Our cigarette share remained stable at 17.7 per cent with good
performances from Peter Stuyvesant and Superkings.
In Central Europe, we continued to develop our business in the region despite increasing competitor activity in the
ultra low price segment. In Poland, we regained market share momentum following the repositioning of Route 66
and the introduction of Paramount. Conditions remain challenging across the region and we continue to focus on
balancing profit and volume, with some encouraging recent brand launches of Paramount, Golden Gate and Moon.
In Eastern Europe, our volumes grew. Highlights include our Russian market share, up to 5.3 per cent with growth in
Maxim, our improved portfolio in the Ukraine with the newly introduced Classic and in the Caucasus, volumes rose
by over 70 per cent.
Following the completion of our new cigarette factory in Turkey and our subsequent brand launches into the market
in April and September, early progress is encouraging.
In Africa, our profits grew with positive market share developments in Central and Western Africa, and in the Middle
East, Davidoff continued to extend our regional presence with volumes up 27 per cent.
OUTLOOK
There are encouraging opportunities for the Group in this region, given the broad spread of markets it encompasses.
It is through this very diversity that we are able to manage our regional performance effectively and we continue to
focus on profitable volume development while investing for future growth.

OUR PERFORMANCE
Productivity was up by an excellent 15 per cent with increases
in all regions. Cigarette unit costs were down by 6 per cent.
We further simplified our product portfolio reducing our
blends, materials, ingredients and Stock Keeping Units.
Blends were down by 10 per cent during the year, bringing
the total reduction to 41 per cent in the past three years.
We continue to manage our Stock Keeping Units reducing
the opening position by some 9 per cent.
Reflecting our ongoing commitment to address our surplus
production capacity, we closed our factories in Dublin,
Plattsburgh and Montreal enhancing our productivity and
improving operational efficiencies. In September, we
announced the closure of the UK rolling papers factory in
Treforest, South Wales, and the transfer and consolidation
of production to our larger papers plant in Wilrijk, Belgium.
We also announced plans to restructure our European
cigarette operations, including the relocation of approximately
10 billion cigarettes for the Central and Eastern Europe
markets from Germany to Poland.
Standardising our systems is key to our operational efficiency.
A consistent product quality rating system, a time to market
system, standard factory data collection and control
systems and ISO standards for quality and environment all
contributed to reduced waste, lower write-off costs, lower
energy usage and improved factory performance. We have
driven a number of improvements in the year, reflected in
our key performance indicators, for example, four sites
gained ISO accreditation.
The use of key performance indicators has also helped
us in improving our supply chain, which moves more than
700,000 tonnes of products per year. We are implementing
an integrated IT system to improve our performance,
in the areas of stock visibility, sales forecasting and
production planning.
OUTLOOK
We will continue to drive for improvements throughout our
manufacturing and supply chain activities as we have done
over the last 20 years, focusing on business simplification
in all areas, delivering both improvements in product quality
and cost savings, while remaining flexible and responsive
to market dynamics.

Operating Environment
SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES
In a number of the markets and regions in which we operate
the debate on the introduction of restrictions or outright bans
on smoking in public places and in the workplace has
intensified. As stated previously, we support sensible
regulation but believe that outright bans are unnecessary and
disproportionate. Our experience in Ireland confirms our view
on the impact of restrictions on smoking in public places.
It is clear that smokers will continue to smoke; there may be
an initial dip in consumption but this diminishes over time.
FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON TOBACCO CONTROL
(FCTC)
Adopted in May 2003, the World Health Organisation’s
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is the first global
tobacco treaty that seeks to regulate tobacco products in
a number of areas including tobacco advertising, labelling,
product testing and submission of ingredient information, as
well as product traceability. The Convention also addresses
tobacco taxation and calls for tightened legislation to clamp
down on smuggling and illicit products. The number of
ratifications required for the FCTC to take effect was
achieved in November 2004.
We support strong measures to tackle illicit trade and to
prevent youth smoking, but we believe that some areas
covered by the Convention are more appropriately left to
national authorities.
EUROPEAN UNION TOBACCO PRODUCT DIRECTIVE
(EUTPD)
The European Commission published its first report on the
application of the EUTPD in July 2005. The report does not
call for immediate changes to the Directive.
PICTORIAL HEALTH WARNINGS
Following the European Council’s decision in 2003
concerning the use of pictorial health warnings on packs,
the European Commission published an image library in
May 2005. The use of pictorial health warnings is a
Recommendation and is not compulsory.
Thailand introduced pictorial health warnings in March 2005
and the Australian Government will require warnings from
March 2006. It is our view that the use of pictorial health
warnings is unnecessary. They provide no additional
information to the public about the health risks associated
with smoking and are designed solely to vilify, stigmatise
and shock.
We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that pictorial
health warnings have had any impact on consumers’
smoking behaviour in countries where they have already
been introduced, such as Canada and Brazil. However,
we will comply with all legislation that requires us to display
them on our products. We shall continue to raise our
concerns with the relevant authorities.
The erosion of our intellectual property rights through ever
more intrusive health warnings and other information that
we are required to print on packs is a cause for concern
and we continue to raise this issue with governments and
regulatory bodies accordingly.
ADVERTISING RESTRICTIONS
The European Union Advertising Directive came into effect on
31 July 2005, banning the advertising of tobacco products
in the print media, on radio broadcasts and through tobacco
related sponsorship for events such as Formula One motor
racing and the World Snooker Championship. In 2003, the
German Government took legal action against parts of the
Directive, arguing that the regulation of tobacco advertising
should be a national responsibility. We understand that a
ruling is expected in 2006.
The operating environment is challenging. We are experienced
in managing the issues faced by the industry worldwide and we
continue to engage constructively with governments and regulatory
authorities at both national and international levels.
OPERATING AND 
FINANCIAL REVIEW IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005
29
In the UK, the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion (Point
of Sale) Regulations 2004 took effect in December 2004
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, limiting advertising
inside tobacco retailers to a total surface area equivalent to
one A5 sheet of paper (including text health warning and
quit line telephone number). Scotland has introduced almost
identical legislation.
In March 2004 the Irish Government passed the Public
Health Tobacco Act, which bans product displays and
in-store advertising whilst conferring major search and seize
powers on the Office of Tobacco Control. The Act is being
challenged in court by a number of tobacco companies
including ourselves.
We have stringent, self-imposed policies and standards in
place that cover our advertising and promotional activities
worldwide, and we do not believe that advertising bans
are necessary. Our International Code of Practice for the
Marketing of Tobacco Products is available on our website
www.imperial-tobacco.com.
In the context of increasing regulation and a challenging
global environment we continue to build constructive
relationships with governments and regulatory bodies
worldwide. Our objective remains to ensure that regulation
of tobacco products is sound, proportionate and workable.
We do not accept without challenge, regulation that is
flawed, unreasonable or disproportionate; nor do we engage
lightly in legal challenges. However, we will do so where we
believe it is necessary to protect our business interests.
TOBACCO DUTY
Significant duty increases took place this year in several
Western Europe countries, most notably in Germany and in
the Member States that joined the EU in May 2004. We
remain concerned that substantial duty increases encourage
the growth of smuggling, illegal cross-border trading and
counterfeiting and we are totally opposed to such activities.
We continue to work with Customs Authorities in a number
of countries to counter this illegal trade. We have signed
Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) in seven countries to
date. Discussions are progressing in a further twelve
countries. The recent signing of the updated MoU in China
between local authorities and a coalition of tobacco
companies (including Imperial) is the result of continuing
activities to tackle counterfeit products.
TOBACCO-RELATED LITIGATION
In Scotland, on 31 May 2005 we received a favourable
judgment in the case of McTear v. Imperial Tobacco Limited.
The judgment found in favour of the Company on all counts
and has not been appealed. Abandonment has been agreed
in respect of ten other cases brought against us in Scotland
in which individual claimants were seeking damages for
alleged smoking-related effects. The one remaining case
against us in Scotland is inactive.
In the Republic of Ireland, the number of claims against the
Company has fallen from 307 in 1997, to 13 (two of which
have been dismissed subject to appeals and one whose
statement of claim was served out of time and has been
returned); 294 cases have been dismissed, discontinued or
are not proceeding. No case has gone beyond service of a
statement of claim and replies to notices of particulars.
In Poland, an individual claimant has served proceedings on
us. There have been several preliminary hearings and we
anticipate judgment in late 2005/early 2006. During 2005,
a further individual filed a claim against us which the court
rejected on the basis that it failed to comply with legal
formalities. On 4 February 2005 a Health Association filed
proceedings against us and other tobacco companies.
These proceedings have not been formally served on
Imperial Tobacco or any of the other tobacco companies.
In the Netherlands, we have received claim letters on behalf
of 44 individuals, although 15 of those individuals have now
withdrawn. Testimony has been taken from the majority of
the remaining potential claimants at preliminary hearings.
No proceedings have been commenced.
In Australia, an individual claimant has served proceedings
on seven tobacco companies, including our Company.
A statement of claim has been served.
To date, no judgment has been entered against Imperial
Tobacco and no action has been settled in favour of a
claimant in any tobacco-related litigation involving Imperial
Tobacco or any of its subsidiaries. Imperial Tobacco has
been advised by its lawyers that it has meritorious defences
to the legal proceedings in which damages are sought for
alleged smoking-related health effects and to threatened
actions of a similar nature. We will continue to contest all
such speculative litigation against the Group.
Note: This is not an operating and financial review pursuant to Section 234AA of the Companies Act 1985. Our success in 2005 was as much about our people
as our products and markets. We aim to provide
an environment where our employees can maximise
their potential.

FIDISON ANDRIAMIHAJA
Factory Manager SOCIGA
Libreville Gabon
Managing a factory in Africa presents
me with opportunities and challenges
as my responsibilities not only include
production but also the maintenance
and logistics which ensure the smooth
running of the factory. The challenge
was made even more exciting for me
by breaking up borders: that’s how
someone born in Madagascar, who
grew up in Europe, can today be in
charge of a factory in Central Africa.
Who knows what’s next…
ANTJE SCHLICHTING
Group Corporate Intelligence Manager
Bristol
I joined Imperial Tobacco from
Reemtsma, working in Industry
Affairs since 2000. As Head of the
Intelligence Team I work on a wide
range of regulatory issues, developing
the forecasting of long-term trends in
the external environment. I enjoy
contributing to projects that are not
directly linked to my area of work, as
well as working and communicating
with colleagues worldwide.
THOMAS VEIT
Marketing Manager
Germany/Austria
I head up the Marketing function for
Imperial Tobacco in Germany/Austria.
Together with my team, we are
responsible for strategy and programme
development in consumer and trade
marketing, as well as the hospitality
sector. My job is a challenging but an
exciting mix of people management
and issues solving, both strategic and
operational, in an ever-changing
political and cultural environment.
JACQUELINE OKSAS
Operator
Berlin Factory
I have worked in our Berlin factory for
16 years as an operator in the Secondary
Department. I survey the production
machines, specifically packing machines,
along with the quality control of our
products. Working at high-speed
machines requires concentration and
technical understanding. Efficiency as
well as compliance of international
regulations is key. It is a demanding
role but I enjoy being presented with
a challenge. We continue to strengthen and develop our employment
practices to reflect the international nature of our business.
We have revised and applied a continuous improvement
methodology to our integrated performance management
system, providing a route to highlight the development and
communication of the behaviours, which drive personal
performance in the business.
The promotion of good working relations with employees
through trade unions, works councils and other organisations
continued throughout the year. Where reorganisation has
impacted on employment, we have ensured that affected
employees are treated fairly and responsibly.
What is it like to work for Imperial Tobacco…

My role allows me to create extensive
networks throughout the Group, both
hierarchically and geographically. This
relationship building is not only critical
to achieving my objectives within the
Corporate Responsibility department,
such as management of the Group
Policy process, but is also one of the
most enjoyable aspects of my job. It
also gives me a good overview of the
business as a whole and keeps my
role extremely varied and interesting.
BRENDA CHU

I became HR Manager, responsible
for our Taiwan office, in 2003. During
this time our office has grown more
than two-fold, with employees being

The last two years have been fun and
challenging. I have enjoyed the sense
of achievement which has made the
effort worthwhile.

We recognise that in the ever-changing and competitive
market place Corporate Responsibility has an increasingly
strategic role and as such are pleased with the advances
we have made during the year.
We have now achieved over 75 per cent of the two-year
objectives we set in our first Corporate Responsibility Review
in 2003. We have incorporated the remainder which remain
relevant into a new set of two-year objectives, which will be
published in our 2005 Review in December.
We believe there is a real need for informed debate on
significant issues of public interest and so in our 2005
Corporate Responsibility Review we will provide more
information on issues such as product stewardship, social
performance, occupational health and safety and
environmental management.
We have increased our interaction and engagement with
stakeholders and a number of regional employee workshops
have focused on enhancing our expertise in effective
stakeholder relationships.
Over the last year we have reviewed and revised our Group
policies, which guide and direct how we do business
throughout the world, together with our more detailed Group
standards which amplify and quantify our performance
requirements world-wide. Additionally, we have updated our
Corporate Manual for Directors.
PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP AND HEALTH
This year we have made submissions to 39 competent
authorities on our product ingredients, for example as
required under the EU Tobacco Product Directive, and
included data concerning our knowledge of their toxicology.
We continued to consult medical and scientific experts who
inform us of their views on scientific developments related
to our products. Our own views are based on their advice.
Our laboratories continue the routine testing of product
ingredients as well as finished products, using internationally
standardised tests whenever possible. We continued to
commission academic research and further experimental
work at accredited contract laboratories using cell-based
systems. The scientific difficulty of obtaining meaningful
results in this area has been highlighted by three scientific
advisory committees to the UK government. We will discuss
their findings and our own approach to product stewardship
and health in our 2005 Corporate Responsibility Review.
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND THE
ENVIRONMENT
We have continued our successful record of achieving
ISO certification in our manufacturing facilities worldwide,
with four more attaining ISO 14001 certification this year.
This brings our total of certified manufacturing facilities to 17
– including our first in both Eastern Europe and Africa.
We have carried out an extensive analysis of our direct and
indirect carbon emissions as part of our climate change
strategy. This has led to the reframing of our energy
reduction targets in terms of carbon dioxide emissions and
a greater focus on the management options which may
deliver significant reductions and energy savings. In this
regard, we continue our successful collaboration with the
UK Carbon Trust and the Carbon Disclosure Project.
We continue to improve our occupational health and safety,
fire and security risk control processes by providing
professional support and management at both a Group
and functional level. No fatal injuries occurred throughout
our global workforce and our accidents rates were stable.
We are increasing our focus on improving our safety
performance concentrating on the underlying causes of
lost-time accidents.
Frank Rogerson, our Corporate Affairs Director, is the
nominated member of the Board with responsibility for
Occupational Health, Safety and the Environment.
Our objective is to operate a sustainable and profitable business
whilst behaving as a good corporate citizen, integrating Corporate
Responsibility into every aspect of the Group.

SOCIAL PERFORMANCE
Our human rights policy requires that we have rigorous
and systematic practices in place. We are setting up audit
mechanisms for our compliance with the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) core conventions to which we
are committed. As part of a rolling four-year programme,
we have now completed 13 audits of facilities using SA 8000
as guidance.
Our self assessment programme for our suppliers of
tobacco materials has again shown improvements in
social and environmental performance. The equivalent
programme for non-tobacco suppliers shows generally
high levels of performance. These programmes have
created a platform for further constructive dialogue
with suppliers.
We are committed to behaving as a responsible corporate
citizen in the communities in which we work and in society
as a whole. To this end, we have continued to expand our
community investment activities, committing a total of
£1.26m. We are now partnering a number of non-
governmental organisations (NGOs) in projects such
as providing clean water sources in Madagascar and
reforestation and deforestation mitigation programmes in
Malawi, Madagascar and Mozambique. We are also Board
members of the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco
Foundation, www.eclt.org, which runs many successful
projects internationally.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
The Board of Directors (the “Board”) remains committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance, which it sees as a cornerstone
in managing the business affairs of the Group and a fundamental part of discharging its stewardship responsibilities.
Applicable Corporate Governance Provisions
Throughout the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report, the Group has complied with the governance rules and
best practice provisions applying to UK listed companies as contained in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the “Code”)
which was introduced in 1998 and further revised during 2003.
Since Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has securities registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Group also
complies with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which are applicable to foreign issuers. In the light of this ongoing obligation,
a programme of activity is currently in place to enable the Group to meet the further requirements with regard to section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, which will be applicable for our financial year ending 30 September 2006.
Corporate Governance Compliance
The Board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders for the Group’s standard of governance and this report, together with the
Remuneration Report, seeks to demonstrate how the principles of good governance, advocated by the Code, have been and continue to be
applied in practice within the Group.
During the course of the financial year there has been continued rationalisation in the way the Group manages its activities. Notwithstanding the
ongoing organisational changes resulting from this activity and the challenges arising from investing in developing markets, the Board and its Audit
Committee have continued to keep under review the Group’s entire system of internal control, encompassing both financial and operational
controls, as well as compliance and risk management. Based on these reviews the Board is satisfied that an appropriate internal control
framework is in place across the whole Group.
Throughout the Group, formal procedures, including well established and embedded internal controls, have been and continue to be maintained,
reflecting current best practice requirements under the Code in the UK. Such procedures, together with continued regular formal reporting to the
Audit Committee, have ensured the maintenance of a strong procedural framework for the ongoing identification, evaluation and management of
the significant areas of risk to achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives.
As previously reported, certain investigations were initiated by German authorities in January 2003 into alleged foreign trading and related violations
by Reemtsma employees during a period prior to its acquisition by the Group, which resulted in a number of such Reemtsma employees being
named in search orders. Elements of these investigations are continuing. In May 2005, parts of the investigations into certain of the former
Reemtsma employees were terminated by the authorities on terms agreed by the individuals with the authorities, and settlement of any duty payable
as a result of certain of the activities being investigated was made at no cost to Reemtsma. The Group confirms that no criminal charges have been
brought against such individuals or Reemtsma in relation to the continuing investigations, which could take several years to be concluded.
A Board Committee, under the Chairmanship of Mr A G L Alexander, established in 2003, continues to monitor the progress and conduct of the
investigations on a regular basis and the Group’s responses on behalf of the Board. The German authorities’ investigations are based on alleged
activities prior to the Group’s acquisition of Reemtsma and the Committee remains satisfied that, since the acquisition, the Group has not been
involved in any activities of a nature similar to those alleged by the German authorities.
As previously reported, information was supplied by Imperial Tobacco and a number of other companies to the UK Office of Fair Trading (the “OFT”)
in October 2003 in relation to an enquiry into the operations of the UK tobacco supply chain. Further information was supplied in April 2005 but
to date no response to any of the information submitted has been received from the OFT.
During the course of the year business reviews of the Group’s operations, performed as part of the Group Compliance Function’s programme of
activity, have also highlighted a number of minor weaknesses and failures in systems of control at the business operations level. From the resulting
investigations into these issues and from reports to the Group Compliance Function by the business operations of any potential instances of fraud
or accounting irregularity that may have occurred during the financial year, the Audit Committee concluded that neither individually nor collectively
did they have a material impact on the results or performance of the Group for the financial year. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Board and Board Committees
Board Structure
The Board of Directors, which meets at least five times a year, currently comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, seven other independent Non-
Executive Directors and five Executive Directors. There is a clear separation of the roles of Chairman, Mr D C Bonham, and Chief Executive,
Mr G Davis, to ensure an appropriate balance of power and authority. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the whole Board with the
Chief Executive, in conjunction with the Chief Executive’s Committee, responsible for managing the Group and implementing the strategy and
policies which have been set by the Board.
Mr A G L Alexander is Joint Vice Chairman (alongside Mr I J G Napier) and the recognised senior independent Non-Executive Director to whom
any concerns can be conveyed by shareholders. As further explained below, all of the Non-Executive Directors are, in the opinion of the Board,
independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent
judgement. Following disclosure of their other commitments and the results of the Board performance evaluation, the Board is satisfied that all
of the current Non-Executive Directors have sufficient time available to contribute effectively to the Board and demonstrate ongoing commitment
to their roles.
The Directors’ biographies, appearing on pages 35 and 36, demonstrate a detailed knowledge of the tobacco industry together with a range of
business and financial experience which is vital to the management of an expanding international company. The biographies also include details
of their other major directorships.
Board Changes
The composition and balance of the Board is subject to continuing review. This process takes account not only of the overall balance of skills,
knowledge and experience on the Board but also of the wider provisions of the Code and the results of the annual evaluation of the performance
of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors.
Ms S E Murray and Mr C R Day joined the Board on 8 December 2004 and 25 July 2005 respectively as Non-Executive Directors. Both were
identified as suitable candidates for appointment by an external search consultancy based on role profiles provided by the Nominations
committee. Mr I J G Napier was also appointed Joint Vice Chairman in December 2004 alongside Mr A G L Alexander.
On 9 February 2005 Mr B C Davidson resigned from the Board as Sales and Marketing Director. His responsibilities for the Group’s global sales
and marketing activities have been transferred to Mr G L Blashill who was appointed to the Board on 28 October 2005.
Excluding the Chairman, three of the Non-Executive Directors have now served slightly in excess of nine years, having been appointed to the
Board on de-merger in August 1996. Whilst length of tenure is one of the factors to be taken into consideration when considering director
independence under the Code, the Board concluded at its meeting in September 2005 that Messrs S P Duffy, S Huismans and A G L Alexander
continue to contribute effectively and constructively to Board debate, to challenge and question management objectively and robustly and at all
times to have the best interests of the Group in mind. Furthermore the Board concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that length of
tenure was having an adverse impact on their independence. The Board therefore considers that, taking account of these issues together with
the other relevant factors contained in the Code and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all seven Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) are
independent for the purposes of the Code and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
However, as already announced, Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans will be retiring from the Board at the Annual General Meeting (the “AGM”) in
January 2006. It is proposed that Mr A G L Alexander will remain on the Board beyond the AGM in 2006 in order to facilitate a smooth transition
at senior Board level. It is also proposed that Mr I J G Napier will become the recognised senior independent Non-Executive Director with effect
from the AGM in 2006.
The Chairman and Mr A G L Alexander, both having served in excess of nine years, will offer themselves for re-election annually at the
Company’s AGM.
Following the disclosure of individual Directors’ external commitments, as part of the Board performance evaluation conducted during the year,
the Board accepted that Mr D W Thursfield’s increasing level of external commitments was likely to have an adverse impact on his availability
for Board and committee matters. As a consequence the Board accepted Mr D W Thursfield’s resignation with effect from 28 October 2005.
Over the coming months the Board will be seeking to appoint one or more additional Non-Executive Directors to ensure that the Board and its
committees continue to remain suitably balanced. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Performance Evaluation
During the year, in accordance with the Code and with the assistance of an external consultant, the Board formally reviewed and evaluated its
performance, together with the performance of its Committees and individual Directors. These reviews were conducted by way of separate
detailed questionnaires, completed by the Directors and, in relation to certain matters, by the external Auditors. A report on the performance of
the Board as a whole and of the Board Committees was made to the Board at its meeting in September 2005. Feedback on the performance of
the Board Committees was shared with the relevant Committee chairman, whilst feedback on individual directors was discussed with the
Chairman. This in turn was followed by private feedback meetings between the Chairman and each of the Directors.
In addition, an opportunity was taken at the Board meeting in September 2005 for Mr A G L Alexander, the senior independent Non-Executive
Director, to meet with the Non-Executive Directors as a group, without the Chairman present, to consider the performance of the Chairman. After
also taking account of the views of the Executive Directors and the results of the Chairman’s formal performance evaluation, Mr A G L Alexander
held a private feedback meeting with the Chairman.
During the course of the year the Chairman additionally held meetings exclusively with the Non-Executive Directors to consider the performance
of the Executive Directors in the discharge of their duties.
Following these reviews the Board and its Committees are satisfied that they are operating and performing effectively, that there are no
fundamental issues or training needs that require addressing and that each of the current Directors has sufficient time and commitment to
contribute effectively to the Board and its Committees. Accordingly, the Board is satisfied that Messrs D C Bonham, A G L Alexander, C R Day,
G L Blashill, together with Dr P H Jungels should stand for re-election at the 2006 AGM. The two key themes which emerged from the review
related to succession planning and the make up of the Board in light of the ever increasing international nature of the business. The Board will be
implementing, during the course of the next financial year, a number of actions that have been identified in response to the points made during
the reviews.
The Board plans to conduct evaluations on an annual basis and may employ alternative formats and approaches in future years.
Board Operations
The Board is the principal decision making forum of the Group and manages overall control of the Group’s affairs by the schedule of matters
reserved for its decision contained in the Group’s Corporate Manual. These include responsibility for the Group’s commercial strategy, the approval
of financial statements and corporate plans, the overall corporate governance framework, acquisitions and disposals, treasury, tax and risk
management policies and appointment and removal of Directors and the Company Secretary.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters and for ensuring Board
procedures are followed and applicable rules and regulations complied with.
All Directors are equally accountable by law for the proper stewardship of the Group’s affairs, with the Non-Executive Directors having a particular
responsibility for ensuring that strategies proposed for the development of the business are critically reviewed. This ensures that they act in the
best long term interest of shareholders, take account of the wider community of interest represented by employees, customers and suppliers and
that social, environmental and ethical issues are fully integrated into the Group’s risk assessment processes. In April 2005, the Board approved
a key performance indicator framework of non-financial issues which might be material to the Group in any particular year. The aim of this
framework is to provide operational management and the Board with an important means of tracking and managing non-financial risk.
The Board regularly reviews the strategy and operating results of the business, as well as approving annual and medium-term plans. Actual results
of the Group are reviewed at each Board meeting, with monthly reports, including detailed commentary and analysis, being provided in the
intervening periods. This ensures that the Board is supplied with information on the progress of the business in a timely manner and that the
Directors are properly briefed on issues arising at Board Meetings.
The Non-Executive Directors also play a leading role in corporate accountability and governance through their membership of the Remuneration
Committee, the Nominations Committee and the Audit Committee. The membership and remit of each Committee is considered below, together
with a record of Directors’ attendance at Board and Board Committee meetings during the year. The terms of reference for each of these
Committees are available from the Company Secretary and are also published on the Imperial Tobacco website. www.imperial-tobacco.com. The
terms of reference for each of the Committees were comprehensively reviewed in June 2005.
The Group has procedures in place to allow Directors to seek both independent professional advice, at the Group’s expense, and the advice and
services of the Company Secretary in order to fulfil their duties. The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of Directors and
Officers’ liabilities. IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005

Chief Executive’s Committee
Over the financial year, the Chief Executive’s Committee, comprising the Executive Directors, the Director of Finance and Planning, the Group
Sales and Marketing Director, the Group Human Resources Director and the Company Secretary, continued to meet on a regular basis to ensure
appropriate control and management of day-to-day business matters. Within the framework of the Chief Executive’s Committee, the Board
delegates day-to-day and business control matters to the Chief Executive and Chief Executive’s Committee who, are responsible for implementing
Group policy and monitoring the detailed performance of all aspects of the business. They have full power to act subject to the reserved powers
and sanctioning limits laid down by the Board and the Group’s policy guidelines.
Between formal Board and Committee meetings, the Chairman and chairmen of the Board Committees communicate regularly with the Chief
Executive and other members of the Chief Executive’s Committee.

strategy and policy, details of the Committee’s activities over the financial year and contains full details of Directors’ emoluments.
Nominations Committee
Membership
The Nominations Committee, comprising all the Non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive (who will be stepping down from the Committee
with effect from the AGM), with Mr D C Bonham as Chairman, met twice during the year. Mr M R Phillips the Company Secretary acts as secretary
to the Committee.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
  IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Committee include the evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board, the development
of role specifications, the formulation of succession plans and the making of recommendations to the Board with regard to the appointment of
Directors.
During the year, based on the results of a skills matrix questionnaire, the Committee formulated a profile of the competencies, experience and
time commitment required of potential new Non-Executive Directors. This profile has been used as the basis of instructions to external search
consultancies to identify suitable candidates for appointment to the Board.
New Directors appointed by the Board must submit themselves for re-election by shareholders at the AGM following their appointment. Thereafter
all Directors, in accordance with the Code, are subject to re-election at least every three years. Furthermore, it is the Company’s practice that any
Non-Executive Director having been in post for nine years or more is subject to annual re-election. The Committee considers the performance of
each Director before recommending such re-appointment.
Induction and Training
Detailed training and briefing is provided to all Directors on appointment to the Board, taking into account their individual qualifications and
experience. This includes an induction programme provided by the Group’s external lawyers, meetings with the Group’s Auditors and with key
Group personnel and site visits. An element of the induction focuses on relevant corporate responsibility and corporate affairs issues. Issues
addressed include legal matters, product stewardship, occupational health and safety, environmental management, social impact, scientific and
regulatory affairs and commercial risk management. The opportunity exists for major shareholders to meet with new and existing Directors.
Directors also make themselves available to meet shareholders after the formal business of the AGM has been completed.
Where appropriate, ongoing training is made available to all Directors to meet their individual needs. Regular briefings are also provided to
Directors on relevant issues such as legislation and regulation changes and corporate governance developments.
Audit Committee
Membership
The Audit Committee, consisting exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors, Mr A G L Alexander (who will be stepping down from the
Committee with effect from the AGM), Mr I J G Napier and Dr P H Jungels, with Mr S P Duffy (who is retiring at the AGM) as Chairman, met four
times during the year. All its members, with the exception of Dr P H Jungels, are qualified accountants or have held senior finance positions in
PLC’s and are therefore appropriately qualified to discharge the responsibilities that Audit Committee membership entails and are regarded as
financial experts for the purposes of both the Code and section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Following the retirement of Mr S P Duffy at the AGM, it is proposed that Mr C R Day will become a member of and assume the chairmanship of
the Audit Committee. It is also proposed that following the AGM Ms S E Murray will become a member of the Audit Committee.
Mr M R Phillips the Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
Responsibilities
The Committee’s terms of reference cover the matters recommended by the Code. During the year and up to the date of approval of the Annual
Report the Committee worked with a structured agenda of matters focused to coincide with key events of the annual financial reporting cycle,
together with standing items that the Committee is required to consider at each meeting. These duties included monitoring internal control
throughout the Group, approving the Group’s accounting policies and reviewing the interim and annual financial statements, together with the US
filing on Form 20-F, prior to submission to the Board
The Committee regularly monitors and reviews the programme of activity currently in place to enable the Group to meet the requirements with
regard to section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, applicable to the Group for the financial year ending 30 September 2006.
The Committee reviews and approves, on an annual basis, the scope and content of the risk assessment and compliance programme implemented
by the Group Compliance Function and monitors and critically reviews the authority, effectiveness and level of resource allocated to the activity. The
Finance Director, the Director of Finance and Planning, the Group’s General Manager – Compliance and other financial management attend each
meeting of the Committee by invitation and a standing item on each agenda allows for the General Manager – Compliance to meet formally with
the Committee, without any Executive Director or other manager being present, in line with the Code’s requirements.
In addition, the Group’ s Auditors attend each meeting and, as a further standing item on each agenda, also meet with the Committee members without
the presence of any Executive Director or manager, providing a direct line of communication between the Auditors and Non-Executive Directors.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Auditor Independence Policy
The Group has always maintained and continues to maintain a policy of strict separation between the auditing and consultancy functions of its
external Auditors. The Group regularly reviews its Auditor Independence Policy document, which provides clear definitions of services that the
external Auditors can and cannot provide such that their independence and objectivity are not impaired. The policy also establishes a formal
authorisation process, including the tendering and pre-approval by the Audit Committee for allowable non-audit work that they may perform and
establishes guidelines for the recruitment of employees or former employees of the external Auditors. This policy is published on the Group’s
website (www.imperial-tobacco.com).
In accordance with best practice guidelines the rotation of the lead Audit Partner within PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) took place at the
beginning of the financial year.
The Audit Committee also carried out bi-annual reviews of the remuneration received by PwC for audit services, audit related services and non-
audit work with the aim of seeking to balance objectivity, value for money and compliance with this policy. The outcome of these reviews was not
only that performance of the relevant non-audit work by PwC was the most cost-effective way of conducting the Group’s business but also that
no conflict of interest existed between such audit and non-audit work. The fees for such non-audit work within the financial year were principally
related to due diligence activity, tax advisory work associated with the reorganisation of legal entities within the Group, assistance with regard to
the activity relating to Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance and assistance in preparing the Group for compliance with International Financial
Reporting Standards, which become effective for the financial year ending 30 September 2006. In other situations, proposed assignments were
subject to independent tendering with decisions taken on the basis of competence and cost-effectiveness.
Following a review during the year by the Audit Committee of the scope, efficiency and effectiveness of the audits performed by PwC it was agreed
that the Group continues to receive an efficient, effective and independent audit service.
Internal control
The Board acknowledges responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control. The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviews the
effectiveness of the system in accordance with the guidance set out in “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code” (the
Turnbull guidance) from information and regular reports provided by management, the internally independent Group Compliance Function and
external Auditors. However, given the size and complexity of the Group’s operations, such a system can provide only reasonable and not absolute
assurance of meeting internal control objectives by managing rather than eliminating risk.
The Board, either directly, or through the Audit Committee which reports its findings for consideration by the Board, regularly reviewed the
effectiveness of the key procedures which have been established to provide internal control and confirms that an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks operated throughout the year and up to the date of the approval of the Annual Report.
Whilst the Group has established control processes and procedures, primarily to ensure compliance with the best practice governance provisions
as advocated by the Turnbull Guidance, it is recognised that there is also a requirement to comply with any relevant US governance and control
provisions. The provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require US listed companies to adopt a generally accepted framework of control, advocating
the ‘Internal Control-Integrated Framework’ issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) as
appropriate. The Group considers its approach, methodology and actions in support of maintaining high standards of corporate governance
satisfies the requirements of both Turnbull and COSO.
The following key features have operated to provide reassurance of both the reliability of information and the safeguarding of assets:
Risk assessment:
• The Group clearly sets out its strategic objectives as part of its medium-term planning process. These objectives are then incorporated as
part of the annual planning cycle and are supported by the use of both financial and non-financial key performance indicators.
• A detailed assessment of strategic risks is undertaken by the Executive Directors as part of the medium-term planning and annual and
monthly forecasting reporting cycles.
• All areas of the business are required to undertake risk-profiling exercises to formally review their principal areas of risk so that all major risks
are reviewed at all levels across the Group. This formal system is based on the annual submission of risk assessment summaries from each
of the business operations identifying their major areas of business risk, together with the controls embedded in the business processes to
mitigate such risks. This review is ongoing throughout all business operations of the Group to ensure that there continues to be clear and
consistent procedures for monitoring, updating and implementing appropriate controls to minimise the risk exposure so identified.
• The Audit Committee has delegated responsibility for considering Group-wide operational, financial and compliance risks on a regular basis.
Formal reporting by the Group Compliance Function at each Audit Committee meeting on the outcome of its ongoing activities, including its
programme of business reviews, supports the Audit Committee and the Board in assessing the effectiveness of internal controls within the
business operations. In this way, the Audit Committee seeks to satisfy itself that the Group’s exposure to major business risks is minimised
such that the levels of retained risk are acceptable to the Group. IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Internal control (continued)
Control environment and control activities:
• The Group is organised on a functional basis with manufacturing, sales and marketing and central support functions each having their own
management and control structures which satisfy the Group’s controls, accounting policies and regulatory responsibilities.
• The Board continues to review the Group’s organisational structure to ensure that clearly defined lines of responsibility with appropriate
delegation of authority and segregation of duties exist, with personnel of the necessary calibre in place to fulfil their roles. Such delegated
authority ensures that decisions, significant either because of their value or impact on other parts of the Group, are taken at an appropriate level.
• The Board has formally adopted, and recently reviewed, a schedule of matters of a strategic, financial, operational or compliance nature,
which are required to be brought to it for decision.
• The Group has an established framework of policies and procedures laid down by the Board to which personnel are expected to comply.
These cover key issues such as authorisation levels, segregation of duties, ethical compliance matters and legislation, physical and data
security as well as regulatory, governance, and health, safety and environmental issues. This framework of policies and procedures, which
has been developed and issued,with consistent communication throughout the Group, is reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to ensure
it continues to provide the requisite control guidance and remains pertinent to the Group’s business activities.
• A formal policy and arrangements for dealing in confidence with issues of genuine and significant concern raised by employees or others
relating to perceived malpractice, improper business practices, management impropriety or other similar matters, whether financial or non-
financial (commonly referred to as ‘whistleblowing’ arrangements) operates throughout the Group.
• The Group has an established and consistent methodology for ranking the level of risk from each of its business operations and identifying
significant risk issues associated therewith. Appropriate strategies have been implemented to deal with each significant risk that has been
identified, including not only internal controls but also other external measures such as insurance and dual sourcing of supplies. This
approach was reviewed by the Audit Committee in June 2005 to ensure that it continued to accurately reflect the relevant risks and took into
account necessary movements in the Group’s risk profile consequent upon changes in business operations.
• There are well-defined procedures for appraisal, approval, control and review of capital and strategic expenditure including acquisitions.
• The Group’s treasury function operates within a well defined policy designed to control the Group’s financing arrangements and to minimise
its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks through treasury instruments.
Information and communication:
• Each area of the business is required to produce detailed financial plans prior to the start of each financial year, which are reviewed for
robustness and realism.
• A comprehensive system of controls, including regular periodic performance reviews for each area of the business, is in place to ensure that
major variances against plan are promptly and thoroughly investigated. These reviews are conducted at a detailed level within each function
and at a high level by the Chief Executive’s Committee.
• The achievement of business objectives, both financial and non-financial, is assessed on a regular basis using a range of key performance
indicators. These indicators are reviewed to ensure that they remain relevant and reliable.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Internal control (continued)
Monitoring:
• A range of procedures is used to review the risk profile and monitor the effective application of internal controls across the Group. These
include independent reviews by the Group Compliance Function, together with self-assessment of risks and relevant controls. Furthermore
both the senior operational and financial managers of each business and function annually certify that effective systems of internal control,
in accordance with the Group’s policies and covering all business activities (both financial and non-financial), have been maintained within
their area of responsibility.
• The Group Compliance Function’s responsibilities include reporting at each Audit Committee Meeting on the effectiveness of internal control
systems, focusing on those areas of greatest perceived risk to the Group.
• Follow-up procedures ensure that there is an appropriate response to recommendations for any enhancement to risk controls as identified
by the independent reviews of the Group Compliance Function.
• As a consequence of its US Listing, the Group is required to comply with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that apply to foreign
issuers. The Group continues to monitor its legal and regulatory obligations arising from this act and has taken actions to ensure compliance
with those requirements that have already become effective. Furthermore through a programme of activity, project managed by the Group
Compliance Function, the Group is further enhancing its control documentation and testing its internal controls over financial reporting in
order to fully satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, applicable for the Group for the financial year ending
30 September 2006.
The Audit Committee confirms it has reviewed and reported to the Board on the system of internal control for the financial year ended
30 September 2005 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. Through the procedural and reporting framework for monitoring business
risks and controls, as set out above, and review of the Group’s financial statements, it is satisfied there is sufficient information to enable it to
review the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control.
Disclosure Committee:
In line with recommendations issued by the US Securities & Exchange Commission and to meet developing corporate governance best practice
in the UK, the Group also has a Disclosure Committee comprising appropriate senior executives:–
• The Company Secretary – Chairman
• General Manager – Compliance – Co-ordinator
• Senior Legal Counsel
• Head of Management Accounting
The External Auditors together with other senior management attend by invitation.
In the context of the Group’s disclosure obligations, the Committee, in accordance with its terms of reference, considers the significance of
relevant information identified and reports on its evaluation to the Chief Executive, Finance Director and, as appropriate, the Audit Committee, in
order to assist them in their evaluation of material issues for the purposes of any disclosure that may be required.
The terms of reference of the Disclosure Committee are reviewed on a regular basis and were comprehensively reviewed during the financial year.
Going concern
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to meet its operational needs for the foreseeable future and accordingly they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Pension fund
The Group’s main pension fund, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, is not controlled by the Board but by Trustees, consisting of five nominees
from the Company, one member chosen by employees and two by current and deferred pensioners. The Trustees look after the assets of the
pension fund, which are held separately from those of the Group and are managed by independent fund managers. The pension fund assets can
only be used in accordance with its rules and for no other purpose. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Requirements
As a listed non-US issuer, the Group is required to comply with some of the New York Stock Exchange’s (“NYSE”) listing standards relating to the
corporate governance practices of listed companies, being exempt from others.
However there is an obligation to disclose any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US
companies under the NYSE listing standards. At this time, the Group believes that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with the relevant
NYSE listing standards. However, in respect of the NYSE standards relating to the composition of a Nomination/Corporate Governance
Committee, it is currently the Group’s practice to include the Chief Executive, in addition to all of the Non-Executive Directors, on the Nominations
Committee. However he will step down from the Committee with effect from the forthcoming AGM.
Furthermore it is the Board, not this Committee, that develops, recommends and adopts the corporate governance principles to be applied
throughout the Group. It should also be noted that the role of an internal audit department is incorporated within the general remit of the internally
independent Group Compliance Function.
Communication with shareholders
Communication with all shareholders is given a high priority and a number of methods are used to promote greater understanding and dialogue
with investment audiences. The Chairman and Chief Executive ensure that the views expressed at any meetings with major shareholders are
effectively communicated to the Board as a whole so that any issues or concerns are fully understood.
The Group’s Annual Review, a summary financial statement, provides shareholders with the material information concerning Imperial Tobacco
Group in a form more readily assimilated than the full Annual Report and Accounts. Shareholders can also request the full Annual Report and
Form 20-F. At the half year an Interim Report was published. All of these documents are available online through the Imperial Tobacco website
(www.imperial-tobacco.com), together with all announcements, investor presentations and share price information.
During the year shareholders were kept informed of the progress of the Group through trading statements and other announcements of significant
developments through regulatory releases, which were also made available on other news services and on the Group’s website. There was regular
dialogue with institutional shareholders and participation in sector conferences. This has been extended to ensure that major shareholders are
given the opportunity to meet Non-Executive Directors, on appointment, and that the senior independent Non-Executive Director attends
meetings with major investors, if so requested.
The Group regularly liaises with its major shareholders and their representative bodies on significant issues. For example, as an integral part of
the executive remuneration review undertaken in 2004, a consultation exercise with major shareholders was undertaken and the Company
amended its initial proposals to take account of the feedback received. The Group also met with Corporate Governance representatives of
investors when requested.
The Board receives regular feedback from Executive Directors and external agents in respect of results presentations and other meetings with
shareholders and analysts.
Additionally, there is an opportunity at the AGM for individual shareholders to receive presentations from the Chairman and Chief Executive on the
Group’s performance and current business activities and to question the Chairman and the chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations
Committees and other Directors. It is the Group’s practice to make arrangements to send the Annual Report and Accounts to shareholders at
least 20 working days prior to the AGM.
All shareholders are offered the choice of submitting proxy votes either electronically or in paper format, including the ability to abstain if desired.
Historically the Group has indicated the level of proxy votes lodged in respect of each resolution proposed at its AGMs, together with the number
of votes for and against each such resolution including details of abstentions, following each vote on a show of hands. Subsequently the results

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company and the Group at the balance sheet date and of the profit or loss and the cash flows of the Group for that period.
The Directors consider that suitable accounting policies have been used. These have been applied consistently. They also confirm that reasonable
judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements for the financial year ended 30 September 2005 and that
applicable Accounting Standards have been followed.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any given time the financial position
of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Information published on the internet is accessible in
many countries with different legal requirements. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of Auditors’ responsibilities
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC’s Registered Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are responsible for forming an independent opinion on the
financial statements of the Group as presented by the Directors, on other elements of the Annual Report and Accounts as required by legislation
or regulation and for reporting their opinion to shareholders. Their report is set out on page 65.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee, in accordance with schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and to meet the
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. In particular, it describes how the Board has applied the principles of good
governance relating to Directors’ remuneration set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the “Code”).
The Companies Act 1985 requires the Auditors to report to the Company’s shareholders on the “audited information” within the Directors’
Remuneration Report (the “Report”) and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the Report have been prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. The Auditors’ opinion is set out on page 65 and those aspects of the Report which have been subject to audit have been
clearly marked.
The Remuneration Committee, which met four times during the year and operates under clear written terms of reference (available on the Company’s
website www.imperial-tobacco.com), confirms formally that it has been in compliance with the governance rules and best practice provisions relating
to remuneration as set out in Section 1 of the Code throughout the year.
Remuneration Committee
Membership
The Remuneration Committee is comprised exclusively of Non-Executive Directors who have no personal financial interest, other than as
shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
The members of the Committee during the year were:–
• Mr I J G Napier (Chairman);
• Mr D C Bonham (who will be stepping down from the Committee at the Annual General Meeting (the “AGM”));
• Mr S Huismans (who is retiring from the Board at the AGM);
• Dr P H Jungels; and
• Mr D W Thursfield (resigned 28/10/05)
Mr G Davis, Chief Executive, attends by invitation to respond to questions raised by the Committee; however he is specifically excluded from any
matter concerning the details of his own remuneration. Mr M R Phillips, Company Secretary, also attends meetings as secretary to the Committee.
It is proposed that following the AGM Ms S E Murray will become a member of the Committee.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee sets the remuneration package for each Executive Director and member of the Chief Executive’s Committee after taking advice
principally from external sources, including remuneration consultants Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited and Towers Perrin, both of whom are
engaged by the Committee as required. Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited also review the Group’s remuneration principles and practices against
corporate governance best practice. Neither provide any other services for the Group.
Executive remuneration data provided by KPMG (engaged by the Committee as required and having provided tax and other consultancy services
to the Group) and Towers Perrin has also been used to assist in benchmarking processes ensuring the consistent application of the executive
remuneration policy.
Ms K A Brown, Group Human Resources Director, Mr M R Phillips, Company Secretary and Mr D P Cuthbert, Group Compensation and Benefits
Manager, also provide internal support and advice to the Committee.
Solicitors Allen & Overy LLP and Ashurst have also been retained by the Company to provide legal advice in respect of the Group’s share schemes
and to provide services to the Committee as and when required. Both firms also provide other legal services to the Group as a whole.
The Company has appointed Alithos Limited to undertake Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) calculations and provide advice on all TSR related
matters. Alithos Limited provides no other services for the Group. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

Responsibilities
The Board is ultimately responsible for the framework and cost of executive remuneration but has delegated to the Remuneration Committee
responsibility for the following activities:–
• Determining the remuneration levels and conditions of service for Executive Directors and members of the Chief Executive’s Committee;
• Overseeing the overall policy for senior management remuneration; and
• Overseeing the Group’s employee share or cash based incentive schemes including approval of minor rule amendments, invitations and
awards and the allocation or issue of shares or payments under any such schemes.
The Committee’s approach is fully consistent with the Group’s overall remuneration strategy and philosophy that all employees should be
competitively rewarded to attract and retain their valued skills in the business, as well as supporting corporate strategy, by directly aligning
executive management with the Group’s strategic business goals.
Remuneration strategy
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC operates in an increasingly competitive, international environment. For the Group to continue to compete
successfully it is essential that the level of remuneration and benefits offered achieves the objectives of attracting, developing, retaining and
motivating the necessary high quality pool of talented employees, at all levels, across the Group. The Group therefore sets out to provide
competitive remuneration to all its employees, appropriate to the business environment in those countries in which it operates.
As the Group develops internationally and integrates acquisitions, it continues to need to relocate employees from country to country as the
requirements of the business dictate and has developed its remuneration arrangements accordingly. The remuneration strategy is therefore
designed not only to align with the Group’s fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and equity but also to support the Group’s corporate
strategy, as a significant contributor to its competitive advantage. A cohesive reward structure across the Group is seen as critical in ensuring that
all employees can associate with and strive for the Group’s strategic goals. This structure is consistently applied to all employees and well
communicated to ensure each element of the package is understood and the links to corporate performance recognised. To assist in this
communication senior employees are issued with total reward statements.
The Group also seeks to align the interests of shareholders and employees at all levels by giving employees opportunities and encouragement to
build a shareholding in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC. Through a series of share plan initiatives, Sharesave arrangements and Share Matching
Schemes, the vast majority of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries have been offered participation in one or more equity-based plans
with in excess of 40 per cent of the eligible population taking advantage of those invitations.
Executive remuneration policy
The remuneration package for Executive Directors and members of the Chief Executive’s Committee, as determined by the Remuneration
Committee, is designed to attract and retain high quality executives, induce loyalty and motivate them to achieve a high level of corporate
performance in line with the best interests of shareholders, while not being excessive. The package is also in line with the Group’s overall strategy,
as detailed above, on pay and benefits and, as the Group extends its business internationally, it takes account of market practices outside the
UK where the scope of a particular executive’s role warrants this approach.
The executive remuneration policy combines short term and long term rewards, focusing on performance-related elements that take into account
individual, functional and corporate performance. The main components are base salary, annual cash bonus, share matching scheme (“SMS”),
long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) and pension benefits, with an increased weighting towards performance-related variable reward elements. In the
financial year to September 2005, base salary typically represented around 26 per cent of total remuneration for the Chief Executive and Finance
Director and around 35 per cent of total remuneration for the other Executive Directors with annual bonus and awards vesting under SMS and
LTIP schemes making up the balance. Following approval of the revised share plans by shareholders at the 2005 AGM, for the financial year to
September 2006 base pay will represent around 20 per cent of Executive Directors’ potential remuneration. The executive remuneration policy is
set to provide base salary at around the median level of its comparator group while providing the Executive Directors and Chief Executive’s
Committee members with the capacity to earn upper quartile total compensation on achievement of superior business performance.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Percentage of Total Remuneration
for the financial year to 30 September 2005
From the financial year to September 2004, more stringent performance criteria have been and continue to be applied to the performance-related
elements as detailed in the annual cash bonus and LTIP sections below and on page 55 both of which form part of this policy statement.
In August 2005 the Remuneration Committee reviewed its executive remuneration policy, including reward policies, performance criteria, relevant
comparator groups and vesting schedules and is satisfied that these remain appropriate and support the strategy and objectives of the Group,
including the creation of shareholder value.
Base salary
Base salary is reviewed annually and is determined by the Remuneration Committee following detailed consideration of a number of factors
including individual responsibilities, performance and external market data. It is set within a range around the market median of the comparator
group to reflect the experience, responsibility, effectiveness and market value of the relevant executive. The comparator group of companies
chosen remains the FTSE 50 excluding companies in the Financial and Pharmaceutical sectors. Base salary is the only element of the package
used to determine pensionable earnings.
Annual cash bonus
During the period under review, bonus targets related principally to the achievement of Group profit objectives set at the beginning of the financial
year. However, the specific targets are not disclosed since they are considered to be commercially confidential.
For the financial year ended 30 September 2005 the potential maximum bonus was 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and
Finance Director and 75 per cent for other Executive Directors. For all Executive Directors potential bonus representing 66
2
⁄3 per cent of base
salary related to achievement of profit based performance criteria. The attainment of bonus in excess of this level was subject to achievement of
additional stretching and incremental performance criteria.
Performance in the financial year has resulted in bonuses, as detailed in the table on page 54, being awarded to Executive Directors. These
payments represented 76.6 per cent of base salary in respect of the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 69.6 per cent in respect of the
other Executive Directors. Cash bonuses were also earned by other senior executives for achieving performance targets for the financial year to
30 September 2005.
For the financial year ended 30 September 2006 the Remuneration Committee has determined that the potential maximum bonus is 100 per cent
of base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 75 per cent per cent for other Executive Directors. For all Executive Directors
potential bonus representing 66
2
⁄3 per cent of base salary is related to achievement of profit based performance criteria. The attainment of bonus
in excess of this level is subject to achievement of additional stretching and incremental performance criteria.
No element of the bonus is guaranteed.
The Executive Directors may elect to invest some or all of their gross bonus in the SMS as detailed on page 58.

3 Mr B C Davidson’s shareholding has been amended to reflect an overstatement of 6,373 shares.
There have been no changes in any Directors’ holdings since 30 September 2005.
Executive share retention
To ensure the interests of management remain aligned with those of shareholders, Executive Directors and senior executives are required to meet
minimum shareholding guidelines, by building, over a period of five years from appointment, a holding in the Group’s shares to a current minimum
value broadly equivalent to three times base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and twice their base salary in respect of the other
Executive Directors. Other executives are expected to invest at a level equivalent to between once and twice their base salary, dependent upon
grade. Failure to meet the minimum shareholding is a factor taken into account when determining eligibility for future LTIP awards. All Executive
Directors currently exceed their required shareholding.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
Each year since demerger in 1996, annual awards worth 75 per cent of basic salary have been made to Executive Directors under the LTIP and
awards at a lower level have been made to other senior executives. The awards, which vest three years after grant, are subject to the satisfaction
of an applicable performance criterion, as set out below, over a three-year performance period. All grants are at the absolute discretion of the
Remuneration Committee and no employee has a right to receive any such grant.
For the December 2000 to November 2004 awards, the Committee replaced total shareholder return (“TSR”) with earnings per share (“EPS”)
growth as the performance criterion. This was seen as enhancing the incentive effect of the LTIP by focusing on the financial performance of the
business, over which Directors and executives have power to influence. The LTIP Rules give the Committee absolute discretion to ensure that the
EPS performance criterion fully reflects the underlying performance of the Group before any awards vest, including maintenance of long-term
return on capital employed. This discretion gives the Committee the power to reduce, but not increase, the extent to which the award vests.
Outstanding awards vest on a sliding scale depending on average growth in basic EPS adjusted for amortisation, based on an agreed protocol
to allow appropriate adjustments for exceptional and extraordinary items. The adjustments are confirmed by the Auditors after adjusting for
inflation over the period of the award. No vesting occurs unless the Company’s average real EPS growth is positive. Full vesting occurs if average
real EPS growth is equal to or exceeds 10 per cent per annum. Between these two points the award vests on a straight-line basis. In order to
ensure that the performance criterion remained challenging the lower threshold was raised in 2003. Therefore, for the 2003 and 2004 awards,
vesting will only occur if average real EPS growth exceeds three per cent per annum. The upper threshold of 10 per cent per annum real average
EPS growth remained unchanged.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
  IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) (continued)
On vesting, a participant is granted a “nil cost” option to acquire the relevant number of shares. The option may be exercised at any time up to
the seventh anniversary of its date of grant.
There is no opportunity to re-test if the performance criterion is not achieved.
Under the LTIP rules, should Imperial Tobacco Group PLC be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criteria.
Performance criteria will be adjusted to ensure consistent measurement during the transition to IFRS.
Following the remuneration review in 2004, and subsequent approval by shareholders at the 2005 AGM, the Remuneration Committee has
determined that annual awards equivalent to twice salary in respect of the Chief Executive, one and a half times salary for the Finance Director
and once salary for other Executive Directors will be made in November 2005, with the performance criteria split into three elements as follows:
First element
50 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on EPS as described above, with 12.5 per cent of this element vesting if average
real annual EPS growth equals three per cent and 100 per cent of this element vesting if average real annual EPS growth equals or exceeds
10 per cent. Between these two points awards vest on a straight-line basis.
Second element
25 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on TSR relative to the FTSE 100 Index as described below.
The performance criterion for the second element will be based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the period of the award. No
vesting of this element will occur unless the Company’s total shareholder return ranks it in the top 50 of the companies constituting the FTSE 100
Index. At this performance threshold 30 per cent of this element will vest. If the return ranks the Company in the top 25 of the Index, this element
will vest in full. Between these thresholds the award will vest on a straight-line basis.
Third element
25 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on TSR relative to a bespoke comparator group also described below.
The performance criterion for the third element will also be based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the period of the award.
No vesting of this element will occur unless the Company’s TSR exceeds that of the bottom six companies constituting a bespoke comparator
group comprising of 12 tobacco and alcohol companies as detailed in the table below. At this performance threshold, 30 per cent of the third
element will vest. If the return ranks the Company in the top three of the comparator group, this element will vest in full. Between these thresholds
the award will vest on a straight-line basis.
Altadis S A Altria Group Inc British American Tobacco PLC Carlsberg A/S
Diageo PLC Gallaher Group PLC Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Interbrew SA
Pernod Ricard SA Reynolds American Inc SABMiller PLC Scottish & Newcastle PLC
If one of the comparator group companies is acquired prior to the granting of an award, a suitable replacement will be made. Allied Domecq PLC,
a company included in the comparator group approved at the 2005 AGM, has been acquired by Pernod Ricard SA who replace them in the
comparator group. For any corporate actions affecting a comparator company during an award period the current intention would be to mirror
the actions of a passive investor, e.g. for an equity bid the new shares offered in exchange for the original company would be held for the
remainder of the award period.
The TSR calculations will use share prices averaged over a period of three months to determine both the initial and closing prices rather than
those ruling on a single day.
It is assumed that the cash flow of dividend payments is recognised on the date the shares are declared “ex dividend”. This method is considered
to give a fairer and less volatile result since improved performance has to be sustained for several weeks before it effectively impacts on the TSR
calculations. All share prices and dividend flows will be converted to sterling on the applicable date to ensure that the calculations reflect the return
achievable by a UK based investor.
The TSR calculations themselves will be performed independently by Alithos Limited and approval sought from the Remuneration Committee prior
to the TSR elements vesting.
There will be no opportunity to re-test if any of the performance criteria are not achieved. Each element will operate independently and will be
capable of vesting regardless of the Company’s performance in respect of the other elements. However, the Remuneration Committee may vary,
but not increase, the extent to which the award vests to ensure that it only vests, and at an appropriate level, if there has been an improvement
in the underlying financial performance of the Company, including the maintenance of long-term return on capital employed.
  IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005

In setting three elements to the performance criteria for LTIP awards, the Remuneration Committee decided that these were the most important
measures that drive or measure sustainable improvement in shareholder value. The TSR criteria reflect comparative performance against the
appropriate FTSE sector and a bespoke comparator group of companies. The EPS criterion reflects a key part of the Group’s strategy to create
sustainable shareholder value.
Under the LTIP rules, should Imperial Tobacco be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the date of acquisition. Any
outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criteria.
On vesting, a participant is granted a “nil cost” option to acquire the relevant number of shares. The option may be exercised at any time up to
the seventh anniversary of its date of grant.
It is anticipated that the first awards on the basis set out above will be made during November 2005.
An amendment to the LTIP Rules will be proposed at the 2006 AGM to remove the current rule that no award can be granted within three years
of the Plan retirement date (currently age 65) and replace this with a rule that no awards can be made within six months of expected retirement.
Further details of the proposed amendment are contained in the accompanying notice of the 2006 AGM.

During the year, the November 2001 – November 2004 award vested in full. Annual growth in EPS over the period averaged 21.77 per cent
exceeding the average of 10 per cent, the threshold at which the award maximises. There have been no changes in any Directors’ awards since

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Executive Directors’ conditional share awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (continued)
In respect of the November 2002 – November 2005 award, based on EPS to the end of the financial year, 100 per cent of the award will vest on
25 November 2005. For illustrative purposes only, the share price on 28 October 2005, being the latest practicable date prior to publication, was
£15.91 valuing the awards as follows:–
Award vesting Award vesting
Award lapsing no. of shares over illustrative value
no. of shares which options granted £’000
G Davis – 46,923 747
R Dyrbus – 29,718 473
D Cresswell – 9,906 158
F A Rogerson – 10,427 166
The value of any awards vesting could vary significantly from the above due to share price movements.
The Remuneration Committee regards the November 2003 – November 2006 and the November 2004 – November 2007 awards to be too distant
from maturity to be included in the value projected above. However, in respect of these awards, the adjusted average EPS has grown by more than
10 per cent per annum in real terms in the performance period to the end of September 2005 and, therefore, if this performance were maintained
over the relevant performance periods both awards would vest in full, their illustrative values based on the above share price are as follows.

Evidence of the Group’s sustained performance on a TSR basis when compared with the FTSE 100 Index is set out below.
The FTSE 100 Index is seen to provide the most appropriate and most widely recognised index for benchmarking the corporate performance of
the Company which is a constituent of that index and reflects one of the benchmark indices to be used as an LTIP performance measure.
Share Matching Scheme (“SMS”)
Annual Scheme
Under the SMS, the Remuneration Committee, at its absolute discretion, invites Executive Directors and most of the Group’s management to
invest any proportion, up to a maximum of 100 per cent, of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares to be held by a
nominee controlled by the Employee Benefit Trust. Provided that the shares lodged are left with the nominee for three years, they will be matched
on a one for one basis.
However, in respect of investments made by Executive Directors under the SMS from their bonus paid in December 2003, and for future years, a
performance criterion will be applied to the matched shares such that matching will only occur if the Group has achieved in excess of an average
three per cent real increase in EPS per annum over the three year retention period, being an indicator of sustained ongoing profit delivery. Achievement
measurement is based on the same protocol as that applying to the LTIP . There is no opportunity to re-test if this performance criterion is not met. In
setting the performance criterion for SMS awards, the Remuneration Committee decided that EPS reflects a key part of the Group’s strategy to create
sustainable shareholder value. Under the scheme rules, should Imperial Tobacco be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the
date of acquisition. Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of any applicable performance criterion.
The performance criterion will be adjusted to ensure consistent measurement during the transition to IFRS.

Centenary Scheme
To encourage employees to acquire and retain a shareholding, and to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company (of
Great Britain and Ireland) Limited, all employees of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the date of
the centenary, were invited to purchase up to £3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares and lodge them with the Employee
Benefit Trust. Provided these shares are left in the Trust, the lodged shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20 per cent for one year’s
retention to a maximum of 100 per cent if they are retained for the full five years to August 2007.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Executive Directors’ contingent rights to shares under the Share Matching Scheme (continued)
During the year, annual bonuses earned in 2000/2001 and lodged under the SMS for a three-year period matured in January 2005, providing
matched shares for participants on a 1:1 basis.
In respect of annual bonuses earned in 2003/2004, the Executive Directors elected to invest their entire bonus in January 2005 in the form of
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares under the SMS. These will be matched with additional shares, equal in number to the original
shares, provided they are both left in the SMS for three years and if the Company has achieved in excess of an average of three per cent real
increase in EPS per annum over the retention period. These additional shares are shown within contingent rights above.
It is anticipated that the Executive Directors will again invest their entire bonus in February 2006 in the form of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC
Ordinary Shares under the SMS.
Share options
The Company does not operate an executive share option scheme. However, Executive Directors are eligible (along with all employees of the
Company and any participating subsidiary of the Group) to participate in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC’s savings-related Sharesave Plan. Under
this Plan options are granted, at a discount of up to 20 per cent to the closing mid-market price on the day prior to invitation, to participants who
have contracted to save up to £250 per month over a period of three or five years.

Employee Benefit Trust
The Imperial Tobacco Group Employee and Executive Benefit Trust (the “Executive Trust”) and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee
Benefit Trust (the “2001 Trust”) have been established to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, from funds
provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the SMS and LTIP awards. As
potential beneficiaries of the Executive Trust, each of the Executive Directors is deemed to have a contingent interest in the 929,837 Ordinary
Shares of the Company held by that Trust at 30 September 2005.
Details of the shareholdings by the Employee Benefit Trusts are as follows:

1 As at 30 September 2005, the Company also held 13,515,000 shares in Treasury which could be used to satisfy awards under the share plans.
Share Plan Flow Rates
The Company’s policy has always been to satisfy all awards under its share schemes from market purchased shares through the Trusts. The Trust
Deeds and the Rules of all schemes contain provisions limiting awards to five per cent in five years and 10 per cent in 10 years for all employee
schemes with an additional restriction to five per cent in 10 years for executive schemes. Currently an aggregate total of only 0.9 per cent of the
Company’s issued share capital is subject to awards under all the Group’s executive and all employee share schemes. In future the Trust may
also be provided with shares held by the Company in Treasury in order to satisfy vesting awards.
Since demerger in 1996 the cumulative awards under all of the Company’s share plans totals under 2.7 per cent of its issued share capital.
Following initial grants on demerger, subsequent annual grants have averaged 0.3 per cent of issued share capital.
Executive Directors’ Pensions
The Executive Directors are all members of the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, the principal defined benefit scheme operated by the Group. For
members who joined prior to 1 April 2002 the fund is non-contributory with a normal retirement age of 60. The fund allows members to achieve
the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary at normal retirement age after 32 years’ service. Pension commutation to enable participants
to receive a lump sum on retirement is permitted within Inland Revenue limits.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable together with a spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the member’s
expected pension at retirement. For death in retirement, a spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the member’s pre-commutation pension is payable.
Dependant children will also receive allowances.
Pensions increase by the lesser of 10 per cent and the increase in Retail Price Index, together with an option under the rules to surrender part of
a pension for pension increases in line with the general index of retail prices of up to 15 per cent.
All Executive Directors earn benefits on the standard scale with a normal retirement age of 60.
The Remuneration Committee is reviewing its policy for current Executive Directors’ pensions in light of proposed UK legislation due to be
published in November 2005. Once this legislation has been finalised the Remuneration Committee intends to conclude its review.
Simultaneously the Remuneration Committee will be reviewing its policy for future Executive Directors in light of the final legislation, market
competitiveness and its overall remuneration policy.
The following table provides the information required by both the Listing Rules and schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and gives details for
each Director of:
• the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as if he had left service at the year end;
• the increase in accrued pension during the year, excluding any increases for inflation in respect of the disclosure required under the Listing
Rules; and
• the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension calculated in accordance with the actuarial guidance note GN11.
None of the Directors has made additional voluntary contributions.

The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director. Instead they represent a potential liability

Benefits
The principal taxable benefits for Executive Directors are the provision of cars and health insurance.
Remuneration from other Non-Executive Directorships
The Company recognises that external non-executive directorships are beneficial for both the Executive Director concerned and the Company.
Executive Directors are permitted, at the discretion of the Board, to retain fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorship. Each
serving Executive Director is restricted to one external non-executive directorship and may not serve as chairman of a FTSE 100 company.
Mr G Davis serves on the Board of Wolseley PLC and currently receives fees of £58,000 per annum.
Executive Directors’ Service Agreements
It is the Group’s policy to appoint Executive Directors under service agreements terminable by either party giving 52 weeks’ notice, as shown in
the table below. The service agreement of Mr G L Blashill, who was appointed to the Board on 28 October 2005, is terminable by either party
giving a maximum of 52 weeks’ notice.
There are no predetermined provisions for compensation on termination within Executive Directors’ service agreements. However, the Group is
unequivocally against rewards for failure. The circumstances of the termination and an individual’s duty and opportunity to mitigate loss are taken
into account in every case. The Group’s policy is to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former Directors to the extent that they receive
remuneration from other employment during the compensation period.
Under the rules of the LTIP and SMS, outstanding awards vest on termination for certain reasons, such as death, retirement, redundancy or on
a change of control, on a time-related pro-rata basis subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria. If, however, the termination of
employment is for a reason other than one of those specified in the rules an individual’s full award lapses. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole with regard to market practice and within the restrictions contained in
the Company’s Articles of Association. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee. The Non-Executive
Directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration. They receive no other material pay or benefits (with the exception of
reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with their directorship of the Company and provision of administrative support including the
use of Company offices by the Chairman Mr D C Bonham and Joint Vice Chairman Mr A G L Alexander), do not participate in the Company’s
share schemes, bonus schemes or incentive plans and are not eligible for pension scheme membership.
To align further the interest of the Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders, it was agreed that a proportion of their fees be applied,
after tax, to purchase shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC. These shares are to be held by a nominee during the term of each Non-Executive
Directorship. Exceptionally in respect of Mr D C Bonham and Mr A G L Alexander, this requirement has been waived due to their continued level
of investment, as detailed above. Furthermore given the impending retirement, at the forthcoming AGM, of Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans this
requirement has also been waived in respect of their emoluments paid during the financial year commencing 1 October 2005.
Mr S Huismans is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which he received additional remuneration for fulfilling
such non-executive roles.
Non-Executive Directors’ Letters of Appointment
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements with the Company.
The terms of their appointments are reviewed annually and upon them reaching 65 years of age. These terms were reviewed for all Non-Executive
Directors and confirmed on 1 February 2005. The letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office during normal
business hours and prior to and at the AGM. Under the terms of the Articles of Association of the Company, Non-Executive Directors stand for
reappointment at the first Annual General Meeting following appointment, are subject to triennial reappointment by shareholders and retire (subject
to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985) at the Annual General Meeting following their reaching 70 years of age. There are no provisions in
their letters of appointment regarding notice periods or compensation on early termination. The letters of appointment detail the time commitment
expected of each Non-Executive Director.
Although there is no current maximum term of appointment for Non-Executive Directors, the Board is supportive of the best practice provisions
contained in the Code. Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans will be retiring from the Board at the AGM in February 2006, having both been on the
Board since demerger in August 1996. However where the Board considers a Non-Executive Director is making a particularly valuable contribution
they may be invited to remain on the Board in excess of nine years. In such instances the length of tenure of the Non-Executive Director would
be relevant to the Company’s deliberations as to the independence of the Non-Executive Director and he/she would also be subject to annual re-
election at the AGM. Such re-elections will be subject to the overall independence of the Board not being compromised. It is proposed that Messrs
D C Bonham and A G L Alexander, who have also been on the Board since demerger in August 1996, will continue to serve on the Board and
will therefore offer themselves for re-election annually.

Remuneration Arrangements for Former Directors
Mr S T Painter
Following his retirement in May 2000, Mr S T Painter entered into a consultancy agreement with Imperial Tobacco Limited, the Group’s principal
operating company.
The agreement, as amended in October 2001 and May 2004, runs to March 2007. Under the terms of the agreement he provides consultancy
services as required and receives fees at a day rate of £1,000 with a minimum fee based on 100 days service for each 12 month period ending
on 30 June, and 67 days for the period 1 July 2006 to 6 March 2007. The agreement is terminable by either party giving 12 months’ notice. He
is also entitled to reimbursement for the use of his car.
Mr Painter is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which he receives additional remuneration, for fulfilling such
non-executive roles.
Mr M A Häussler
In respect of Mr M A Häussler, subsequent to his resignation as a Director of the Company with effect from 9 July 2003, he remained as an
employee receiving his full contractual remuneration until his resignation from the Company on 30 April 2005. His base salary included the
payment of a pension allowance of £5,980 which was neither eligible for bonus nor share schemes and was not pensionable.
Mr Häussler is currently in receipt of an annual retirement pension, that has been reduced because it has been taken before he reached his normal
retirement age. His service agreement with the Group provided that he would receive similar overall pension benefits to those that he would have
received had he remained in the Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH pension arrangement. This was, broadly, a pension for life equivalent to 42
per cent of his fixed annual salary at age 63. For death in retirement, a spouse’s pension for life of 60 per cent of that amount would be payable.
The pension is made up of three parts: one part of the pension is payable from the unfunded pension arrangement of Reemtsma

We have audited the financial statements which comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, consolidated statement of total recognised
gains and losses, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated cash flow statement, accounting policies, notes to the accounts and the Imperial
Tobacco Group PLC balance sheet and related notes. We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies
Act 1985 contained in the Directors’ remuneration report (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities. The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Directors’
remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion,
has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no
other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable
part of the Directors’ remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you if, in our opinion, the Report of the Directors is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman and Chief Executive’s
statement, operating and financial review, the corporate governance report and the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report.
We review whether the corporate governance report reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s or
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the United Kingdom Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of the
Directors’ remuneration report. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 30 September 2005 and
of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985,
and those parts of the Directors’ remuneration report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Accounting Policies
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Accounting Standards currently applicable in the United
Kingdom. The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are set out below.
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts incorporate the audited accounts of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC and its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiary
undertakings are all entities over which the Group has the power to control the entity’s financial and operating policies. There are no
unconsolidated subsidiary undertakings.
The results of businesses are included from the effective date of acquisition and businesses sold are included up to the date of disposal.
The principal operating subsidiary undertakings are listed on pages 110 and 111.
US filing and corresponding amounts
The financial statements incorporate additional financial information which will be incorporated in the Company’s US Form 20-F filing requirements.
The information disclosed in these financial statements includes three year profit and loss account and cash flow statement information.
Intangible fixed assets – goodwill
Businesses acquired have been dealt with in the consolidated accounts using acquisition accounting. Upon the acquisition of a business, fair
values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired that reflect the condition at the date of acquisition and any required
adjustments made to bring the accounting policies of the businesses acquired into alignment with those of the Group. Where the consideration
paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made on or after 27 September 1998 is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic
life, a period not exceeding 20 years. Previously all goodwill was written off against reserves in the period of acquisition. On the subsequent
disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable amount of
purchased goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Intangible fixed assets – trade marks and licences
Trade marks and licences are included at cost and amortised in annual equal instalments over a period which does not exceed 20 years.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are shown at cost less depreciation. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Depreciation of other fixed assets is
calculated to write off their cost less residual values over their expected useful lives as follows:
Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 years (straight line)
Plant and equipment 2 to 20 years (straight line/reducing balance)
Fixtures and motor vehicles 2 to 14 years (straight line)
Impairment of fixed assets
Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount
is the higher of an asset’s fair value (less costs to sell) and value in use. Value in use is based on the present value of the future cash flows relating
to the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash
flows (income generating units).
Impairment losses relating to tangible fixed assets are reversed where the recoverable amount increases because of a change in economic
conditions or in the expected use of the asset.
Impairment losses in respect of intangible fixed assets are reversed where subsequent external events clearly and demonstrably reverse the
effects of the event giving rise to the impairment in a way that was not foreseen in the original impairment calculation or where the intangible asset
has a readily ascertainable market value and the market value has increased to an amount higher than the impaired carrying value.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Cost includes all direct
expenditure and an allocation of production overheads based on the normal level of activity.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005
70
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more
likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been discounted.
Turnover
Turnover represents the amount charged to customers in respect of goods sold, services supplied and licence fees, exclusive of applicable sales
taxes or equivalents, but inclusive of excise duty.
Sales of goods are recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer and when collectibility of the related receivables
is reasonably assured.
Sales of services which includes fees for distributing third party products are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are
rendered. Licence fees are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction, or where forward foreign exchange
contracts have been arranged, at the contracted rates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, where a contracted rate
does not apply, are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date and any exchange differences are taken to the profit and
loss account.
The profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange ruling during the year. The balance sheets
of the overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Differences between the profit
and loss accounts translated at average rates and at balance sheet rates are shown as a movement in reserves and in the statement of total
recognised gains and losses.
The Group’s significant overseas equity investments are hedged by borrowings in the currencies in which those assets are denominated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the overseas net investments, including goodwill, less exchange differences on the
borrowings, to the extent that they finance those investments, are taken to reserves through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Other exchange gains and losses are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Interest
Interest payable and receivable is recognised in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure of foreign exchange and interest rate risks and are not used for trading purposes.
Instruments qualify for hedge accounting where the underlying asset or liability has characteristics which can be directly related to the instrument
transacted.
Interest differentials arising under interest rate swaps are taken to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis and included within interest
payable or receivable. Any premiums or discounts received or paid are amortised over the lives of the instruments.
The principal amounts due to be exchanged at maturity under cross currency swaps are revalued at the exchange rates ruling at the balance
sheet date and included within borrowings.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge future transactions, gains and losses are not recognised until the transactions occur.
The Group excludes all short-term debtors and creditors from its derivatives and financial instrument disclosures, other than those on currency
risks relating to monetary assets and liabilities.
Pension costs
The cost of providing pensions is charged to the profit and loss account over employees’ service lives. Variances arising from actuarial valuations
are charged or credited to profit over the estimated remaining service lives of the employees to the extent that any resulting credit does not exceed
the regular cost. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

3 Exceptional items (continued)
In 2004 exceptional operating costs of £129m related to the further restructuring of the business following the Reemtsma acquisition in 2002.
These initiatives included the closure of certain factories in Central Europe, announced in January 2004, and salesforce reorganisations in
Germany and Central Europe. In addition, exceptional costs included the agreed renegotiation of the Formula One contract due to legislative
constraints. These costs related to employment (£51m), fixed asset write-offs and impairment (£27m) and other operating charges (£51m).
In 2003 exceptional operating costs of £51m comprised £42m in respect of the reorganisation of the Group, announced in September 2002,
to integrate Reemtsma with the Group’s existing businesses, £5m in respect of the closure of the Meppel factory in the Netherlands and a
further £4m to finalise the streamlining of the Group’s operations announced in October 2001. These costs related primarily to termination
of employment.

The tax charge includes tax relief on exceptional items of £15m (2004: £33m; 2003: £11m).
Factors affecting the current tax charge for the year
Pre-amortisation, the tax assessed for the year at 27.0% is lower than the standard higher rate of corporation tax in the UK (30.0%). Post-
amortisation, the effective tax rate exceeded 30.0%. A reconciliation between the current tax charge at the standard UK rate and the actual
current tax charge is shown below:

Total current tax 306 239 236
Factors that may affect future tax charges
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains rolled over into replacement assets. Such tax would become payable only if the assets
were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief. The total amount unprovided is £6m and it is not envisaged that this tax will become
payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, as no dividends have been
declared. The Group currently has no plans to remit dividends which would result in a material tax effect. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

Adjusted earnings per share are calculated before tax-effected exceptional items of £40m (2004: £89m; 2003: £28m) (notes 3 and 6), tax-
effected amortisation of intangibles of £6m (2004: £6m; 2003: nil), and goodwill amortisation of £198m (2004: £196m; 2003: £203m), since
the Directors consider that this provides a better comparison of underlying business performance.
There would be no significant dilution of earnings if the outstanding share options referred to in note 18 were exercised.

15 Borrowings and financial instruments
The Group operates a centralised treasury function that is responsible for the management of the financial risks of the Group, together with
its financing and liquidity requirements. It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions, and is subject
to policies and procedures approved by the Board. On a frequent basis, the Group Treasurer discusses matters with a treasury sub-
committee, consisting of senior executives, including the Finance Director and Director of Finance and Planning. The Group Treasurer reports
on a regular basis to the Board, including provision of monthly treasury summaries and an annual review of strategy.
The following table analyses the Group’s financial liabilities at the balance sheet date:
(In £’s million) 2005 2004

Bank loans and overdrafts 25 97
Other loans 682 622

Other loans – after five years 575 579
2,832 3,208
Total borrowings 3,539 3,927
The Group has loans amounting to £1m (2004: £8m) which are secured by charges, mortgages or liens on certain fixed assets.
The loans maturing after five years are the £200m sterling bond (which matures in December 2018), and the £350m sterling bond (which
matures in June 2012).
(i) Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings and surplus cash. In order to manage interest rate risk, the Group
maintains both fixed and floating rate debt and uses derivatives, including interest rate and cross-currency swaps, to vary the mix.
The following table analyses the currency and interest composition of the Group’s financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.

The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings and capital market issuance (post-derivatives). The majority of bank
borrowings bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods of one month by reference to LIBOR in the case of sterling and three
months in the case of Australian dollar borrowings and EURIBOR (in the case of euro borrowings). The capital market issuance in place
at the year end bears interest (post-interest and currency swaps) at rates fixed in advance for six months by reference to LIBOR (in the
case of the US dollar bond) and for three months by reference to EURIBOR (in the case of the sterling and euro bonds).
The figures shown in the tables above take into account various interest rate and currency swaps. Hence the US dollar denominated
bond issued in 1999 is shown within the sterling balance, and the sterling bonds issued in 2002 and 2003 are shown in the euro
balance. The fixed rate financial liabilities do not take into account forward start swaps, which may become effective after the balance
sheet date.
(ii) Currency risk disclosure
The Group is exposed to the translation of the results of overseas subsidiaries into sterling, as well as the impact of transactions
in foreign currencies. On significant acquisitions of overseas companies, borrowings are raised in the local currency to minimise
the translation risk. For transaction risk, where necessary, forward foreign exchange deals are entered into to hedge a proportion
of the forecast foreign currency cash flows. At the year end, £36.1m notional of forward foreign exchange deals were outstanding
(2004: £33.0m).
The tables below show the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local
currency, at the balance sheet date:

The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it. The undrawn committed facilities which are all available at a floating rate, as
at 30 September 2005 in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met at that date, were as follows:

The reorganisation and rationalisation provision relates to the factory closures announced during the year, ongoing capacity reviews, and
other restructurings. The additional amounts provided in the year relate primarily to termination of employment. The provision will unwind over
several years as termination payments are made over extended periods in a number of EU countries.
Unfunded pension obligations relate to pension schemes in Germany. The Group’s main pension schemes are held in separately administered
funds and are described in note 23.
The amounts provided for deferred taxation and the amounts unprovided were as follows:

International Sharesave Plan
Under the Plan the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares (ADSs) in the Company to non-UK
employees who enter into a savings contract. The price at which options may be offered varies depending on local laws, but for ordinary
shares will not be less than 80% of the mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC share on the London Stock Exchange on the
day prior to invitation. In respect of ADSs the price will not be less than 80% of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the
same day. Options may normally be exercised during the six months after expiry of the savings contract, three years after entering the Plan.
Under the UK Sharesave Scheme, which is part of the International Plan, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company
to UK employees who enter into an H M Revenue and Customs approved Save as You Earn (SAYE) savings contract. The options may normally
be exercised during the period of six months after the expiry of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the Scheme.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
In respect of the November 2001 – November 2004 award, based on earnings per share, 100% of the award vested in full on 26 November 2004.
In respect of the November 2002 – November 2005 award, based on earnings per share to the end of the financial year, 100% of the award
will vest on 25 November 2005.
Share Matching Scheme
The Share Matching Scheme is designed to encourage employees to acquire and retain Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares.
There was an initiative in 2002 to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company (of Great Britain and Ireland)
Limited. All employees of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the date of the centenary, were
invited to purchase up to £3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares and lodge them with the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided these shares are left in the Trusts, the lodged shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20% for one year’s retention to a
maximum of 100% if they are retained for five years.
For Executive Directors and most of the Group’s management, individuals may elect to invest any proportion up to a maximum of 100% of
their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trusts. Provided that the shares elected
for are left in the Trusts for three years, and the individual remains in employment with the Group, the participant would receive the original
shares plus additional shares. The matching ratio for bonuses is 1:1 to encourage Directors and managers to build a meaningful shareholding
in the Group.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts (ESOTs)
The Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Employee and Executive Benefit Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust
have been established to acquire ordinary shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the
Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the share matching and performance-related
share awards. At 30 September 2005, the Trusts held 3.0m (2004: 4.1m) ordinary shares, with a nominal value of £302,654, all acquired in
the open market at a cost of £31.3m (2004: £37.2m). These were financed by a gift of £1.7m and an interest free loan of £29.6m. None of
the ESOT shares have been allocated to employees or Directors as at 30 September 2005. All finance costs and administration expenses
connected with the ESOTs are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue. The Trusts have waived their rights to dividends and
the shares held by the Trusts are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share.

The cumulative amount of goodwill written off against the Group’s reserves, net of goodwill relating to undertakings disposed of, is £2,415m
(2004: £2,420m).
Included in other net exchange movements are exchange gains of £22m (2004: £83m) arising on borrowings denominated in foreign
currencies designated as hedges of foreign net investments.
Own shares
Included in the profit and loss account reserve are investments in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC own shares held by the Imperial Tobacco
Group PLC Employee Benefit Trusts (note 18). The book value and market value of the shares at 30 September 2005 was £24m (2004:
£32m) and £49m (2004: £49m).
During the year the Company initiated a share buyback programme purchasing 13,515,000 ordinary shares of 10 pence each in Imperial
Tobacco Group PLC for a cost of £201m including expenses. The shares, representing 1.9% of issued share capital and having an aggregate
nominal value of £1,351,500, have not been cancelled but are held in a treasury shares reserve within the profit and loss account reserve
and represent a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds.
20 Acquisitions
During the year the Group acquired interests in a number of small businesses, including on 14 September 2005 a 43% interest in Skruf Snus AB.
The fair and book value of the net liabilities acquired were £4m, giving rise to goodwill of £18m.
The acquisition price, including costs, estimated at £14m, was satisfied by cash consideration in the year of £6m with deferred consideration
of £8m. The deferred consideration may increase depending on the performance of the company.
The acquisition agreement relating to the 43% interest in Skruf Snus AB includes a commitment to acquire the remaining shares by mid 2009
and provides the Group with control of the operating and financial policies of Skruf Snus AB (including its dividend policy). Accordingly the
acquisition has been accounted for as a 100% owned subsidiary to reflect the substance of the transaction.
The contribution to the Group’s performance in the year ended 30 September 2005 was not material.
2004 acquisition – CTC Tube Company of Canada. During 2004 the Group acquired interests in a number of small businesses, including
the business and assets of CTC Tube Company of Canada, together with the purchase of minority interests in some existing subsidiary
companies.
The fair and book value of the net assets acquired were £6m, giving rise to goodwill of £23m. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

20 Acquisitions (continued)
2002 acquisition – Reemtsma. During 2002 the Group acquired a 90.01% interest in Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and entered into
an Option Agreement enabling the acquisition of the outstanding 9.99%. The Group also entered into a Profit Pooling Agreement whereby the
holders of the outstanding 9.99% surrendered their interests in the equity and results of Reemtsma in exchange for a fixed return. As a result
the Group consolidated 100% of the results and net assets of Reemtsma and reflected a liability to the holders of the 9.99%.
During 2004 deferred consideration of £418m (€607m) was paid relating to the purchase of the remaining 9.99%.

22 Legal proceedings
The Group is currently involved in a number of legal cases in which claimants are seeking damages for alleged smoking-related health effects.
In the opinion of the Group’s lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a
material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.
23 Pensions
The Group operates pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally those operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited, John Player & Sons
Limited, Reemtsma Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and Badische Tabakmanufaktur Roth-Händle GmbH
(BTM). The main schemes are of the defined benefit type and the assets are held in trustee administered funds, apart from the German
schemes which are unfunded.
The main UK Group scheme, is the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund (‘the Scheme’). An actuarial valuation of the Scheme was made at
31 March 2004. The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the Scheme’s liabilities were those relating to the rate
of investment return earned on the Scheme’s existing assets, the rates of increase in pay and pensions and estimated mortality rates. On
the basis that the Scheme is continuing it was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date
would be 5.85% per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 4.5% and 2.75% per annum respectively. The assets were
brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2004 the market value of the assets of the Scheme was £2,248m. The total assets were sufficient to cover 108% of the benefits
that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases. However the assets were not sufficient to
cover future service benefits for current members and, as a result of this deficiency, Imperial recommenced payment of Company
contributions during the year at the level of £10m per year as set by the Scheme Actuary. The financial position of the Scheme and the level
of Company contributions to be paid will be reviewed at the next actuarial valuation, expected to be carried out at 31 March 2007.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
23 Pensions (continued)
The pension cost in respect of the Scheme, for the year ended 30 September 2005, was £5m (2004: nil). The regular cost of £24m has been
offset by £19m in respect of the amortisation of the experience surpluses that are being recognised over ten years, the average remaining
service lives of members. In prior years, the level of surplus in the Scheme has been sufficient to cover the regular cost. The pension cost
has been assessed in accordance with the advice of Watson Wyatt Limited, actuaries and consultants, using the projected unit method.
Prepaid contributions of £5m are included in debtors at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial valuations of the pension liabilities of Reemtsma Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and BTM pension
schemes were undertaken at 30 September 2004 and 30 September 2005. These quantified unfunded past service liabilities of £324m at
30 September 2004 and £376m at 30 September 2005, which have been recognised in the accounts, together with the other German
unfunded schemes. The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the Scheme’s liabilities were those relating to the
rates of increase in pay and pensions. These were 2.85% for the increase in pay and 1.60% for the increase in pensions.
The pension cost relating to other overseas schemes is calculated in accordance with local accounting principles. The pension cost for non-
UK schemes in the year was £28m (2004: £32m).
FRS 17 disclosures for the year to 30 September 2005
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24. Full implementation of FRS 17 “Retirement benefits”, which
was to be mandatory for the Group for the year ended September 2003, has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board until
accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005. However, the following transitional disclosures are still required.
The results of the most recent available actuarial valuations for the principal Group schemes have been updated to 30 September 2005 by
Watson Wyatt Limited, actuaries and consultants.

of the payment was to replace the deferred consideration with bank borrowings. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005

29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) (continued)
(i) Pensions
Under UK GAAP , pension costs are accounted for under the rules set out in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. 24 (SSAP
24). Its objectives and principles are broadly in line with those set out in the US accounting standard for pensions, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (SFAS 87). However, SSAP 24 is less prescriptive in the application
of the actuarial method and assumptions to be applied in the calculation of pension costs.
Under US GAAP , the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period as determined in accordance
with SFAS 87. Under SFAS 87, a pension asset representing the excess of Scheme assets over benefit obligations has been recognised
in the balance sheet.
(ii) Business combinations
Both UK and US GAAP require purchase consideration relating to a business combination to be allocated to the net assets acquired at
their fair value on the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets
Under UK GAAP fair values are assigned to identifiable intangible assets only if the identifiable intangibles are capable of being disposed
of or settled separately, without disposing of a business of the entity.
Under US GAAP, identifiable assets are separately valued and amortised over their useful lives. The separately identifiable intangible
assets included in the US GAAP balance sheet are principally comprised of brand rights, which are being amortised over periods
between 25 to 30 years.
Goodwill amortisation
Under UK GAAP , goodwill arising and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets acquired on acquisitions made on or after
27 September 1998 are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, not exceeding a period of 20 years. Prior to 27 September 1998,
all goodwill and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets were written off to reserves on acquisition.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142) with effect from 1 July 2001 and accordingly
goodwill arising on acquisitions after this date are not amortised. For purchase transactions prior to 1 July 2001, goodwill was
capitalised and amortised over its useful life. From 29 September 2002, in accordance with SFAS 142, the Company no longer
amortises goodwill but rather tests such assets for impairment on an annual basis or where there is an indicator of impairment.
The Company completed an annual impairment review under SFAS 142 at 30 September 2005 and no impairment of goodwill was
indicated. For the purposes of the annual impairment review, goodwill has been allocated to the following reporting units of the Group:
Manufacturing, UK Sales and Marketing and International Sales and Marketing.

29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) (continued)
(iii) Deferred taxation
Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised where their
recovery is considered more likely than not.
US GAAP requires deferred taxation to be provided in full, using the liability method. In addition, US GAAP requires the recognition of the
deferred tax consequences of differences between the assigned values and the tax bases of the identifiable intangible assets, with the
exception of non tax-deductible goodwill, in a purchase business combination. Consequently, the deferred tax liability attributable to
identifiable intangible assets has been recognised and is being amortised over the useful economic lives of the underlying intangible assets.
(iv) Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into certain swap transactions with contractual maturities exceeding those of the underlying debt being hedged,
in anticipation of there being additional floating rate debt when the existing debt matures. Under UK GAAP, derivative financial
instruments that reduce exposures on anticipated future transactions may be accounted for using hedge accounting.
US GAAP requires the Group to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The Group has decided not to satisfy the SFAS
No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133) requirements to achieve hedge accounting for its
derivatives, where permitted, and accordingly movements in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the profit and loss account.
(v) Proposed dividends
Under UK GAAP , dividends paid and proposed are shown on the face of the profit and loss account as an appropriation of the current
year’s earnings. Proposed dividends are provided on the basis of recommendation by the Directors and are subject to subsequent
approval by shareholders.
Under US GAAP , dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders.
(vi) Employee share schemes
Under UK GAAP , the cost of employee share schemes is charged to the profit and loss account using the quoted market price of shares
at the date of grant less the exercise price of the share options granted. The charge is accrued over the vesting period of the shares.
SAYE type schemes are exempt from the requirement to recognise a charge to the profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, the compensation cost is recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and
the quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
For option plans which contain performance criteria, compensation cost is remeasured at each period end until all performance criteria
have been met. The SAYE Scheme is regarded as compensatory and the discount is accrued over the vesting period of the grant.

(ix) Cash flow statements
The consolidated cash flow statements have been prepared under UK GAAP in accordance with FRS 1 (revised) and present
substantially the same information as required under SFAS 95. There are certain differences between FRS 1 (revised) and SFAS 95 with
regard to classification of items within the cash flow statement.
In accordance with FRS 1 (revised), cash flows are prepared separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of
finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid
resources and financing. Under SFAS 95, cash flows are classified under operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Under FRS 1 (revised), cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand. Under
SFAS 95, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
A summary of the Group’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities classified in accordance with SFAS 95 is
presented below. For the purposes of this summary, the Group considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months
or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) (continued)
(x) Impact of new accounting standards
In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs” to clarify that abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognised as current period charges.
In addition, SFAS 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory values be based on the normal capacity of
the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for costs incurred in respect of inventories for reporting periods beginning after 15 June
2005. The adoption of SFAS 151 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the Group.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123) and supersedes APB Opinion No.25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”. Generally the valuation methods contained in SFAS 123(R) are similar to those in SFAS 123, but SFAS 123(R) requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee share options, to be charged to the statement of income. Pro forma
disclosure is no longer an alternative. With limited exceptions, the amount charged to the statement of income for share options will be
measured based on the grant date fair value of the option amortised over the period to the date of vesting of the award. SFAS 123(R)
is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2005. In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB 107, which offers guidance
on SFAS 123 (R). SAB 107 was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS 123 (R) while
enhancing the information that investors receive. SAB 107 creates a framework that is premised on two overarching themes: (a)
considerable judgement will be required by preparers to successfully implement SFAS 123 (R), specifically when valuing employee stock
options; and (b) reasonable individuals, acting in good faith, may conclude differently on the fair value of employee stock options. Key
topics covered by SAB 107 include valuation models, expected volatility and expected term. The Company will apply the principles of
SAB 107 in conjunction with its adoption of SFAS 123 (R). The adoption of SFAS 123(R) is likely to reduce the annual US GAAP charge
to income before taxation by approximately £5m, based on the current structure of the awards.
In May 2005, the FSAB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”, which is effective for periods beginning
after 15 December 2005. This statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” (APB 20) and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements”. APB 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle
be recognised by including, in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle.
SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is
impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. The adoption of SFAS 154 is not
expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the Group.
(xi) Current asset classification
As disclosed in note 13, £53m and £2m of debtors included within current assets in the UK GAAP balance sheet as at 30 September 2005
and 2004 respectively are due after more than 12 months and would be classified as long term assets in the US GAAP balance sheet. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

As permitted by section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented. The profit
attributable to shareholders, dealt with in the accounts of the Company, is £299m (2004: £1,095m).
Own shares
During the year the Company initiated a share buyback programme purchasing 13,515,000 ordinary shares of 10p each in Imperial Tobacco
Group PLC for a cost of £201m including expenses. The shares, representing 1.9% of issued share capital and having an aggregate nominal
value of £1,351,500, have not been cancelled but are held in a treasury shares reserve within the profit and loss account reserve and
represent a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds.
(vi) Contingent liabilities
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has guaranteed various borrowings and liabilities of certain UK and overseas subsidiary undertakings, including
its Dutch and Irish subsidiaries. At 30 September 2005, the contingent liability totalled £3,783m (2004: £4,053m).
The guarantees include the Dutch subsidiaries which, in accordance with Book 2, Article 403 of The Netherlands Civil Code, do not file
separate accounts with the Chamber of Commerce. Under the same article, Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has issued declarations to assume
any and all liability for any and all debts of the Dutch subsidiaries.
The guarantees also cover the Irish subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 September 2005. The
Irish companies, namely John Player & Sons Limited, John Player Distributors Limited and Imperial Tobacco Mullingar have therefore availed
themselves of the exemption provided by section 17 of the Irish Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 in respect of documents required to be
attached to the annual returns for such companies.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Derek Bonham
Chairman
With another strong financial
and operational performance
in 2005, I am delighted that
our strategy for growth has
continued to deliver value
for our shareholders.
Our strategy is clear. It is to create sustainable shareholder
value by growing our business both organically and through
acquisitions. Our focus on this strategy has transformed
Imperial Tobacco over the past nine years into the
international company it is today.
In the past five years total shareholder return was 265 per
cent and we have outperformed the FTSE All-Share Index
by 245 per cent. Contributing to that track record, in 2005
total shareholder return was 40 per cent.
EARNINGS AND DIVIDEND
During the year we delivered some pleasing market and
brand performances which, combined with our continuing
focus on costs and effective cash management, grew
adjusted earnings per share by 11 per cent to 112.8 pence.
Basic earnings per share was 79.0 pence (2004: 61.4 pence).
As a result of this successful performance, the Board is
recommending a final dividend of 39.5
1
pence per share,
bringing the total dividend for the year to 56.0 pence, up
12 per cent on 2004 (2004: 50.0 pence). Since 2001 we
have grown our dividend by 18 per cent compound.
This financial performance reflected a number of operational
highlights that clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our
strategy.
PERFORMANCE
Our core markets of the UK and Germany delivered
significant improvements in profits, against a background of
market declines, an excellent achievement. Elsewhere, we
grew our cigarette shares in a number of markets across the
world with some strong brand performances from Davidoff
and West.
Our drive for efficiencies and further cost savings across
the Group has continued. The ongoing focus on enhancing
productivity and improving operational efficiencies within
our manufacturing operations has resulted in the closure
of three manufacturing sites in the past year, with further
rationalisation announced in September.
Building on our strengths…
1
The dividend will be paid on 17 February 2006 to those shareholders on
the register at the close of business on 20 January 2006.
  IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005
07
We are a highly cash generative tobacco company and
we have ensured that shareholders continue to benefit from
our effective cash management by initiating a rolling share
buyback programme in February 2005. We see this as an
efficient use of cash whilst we continue to pursue value
creating acquisition opportunities.
BOARD CHANGES
The Board continues to ensure high standards of corporate
governance across every aspect of the business. Each
year we conduct a review of Board membership to ensure
that an appropriate level of independent Non-Executive
Directors is maintained through orderly succession, without
compromising the effectiveness of the Board and mindful
of the independence requirements of the Combined Code.
Simon Duffy and Sipko Huismans will step down as Non-
Executive Directors at our AGM in January 2006 having
served nine years on the Board. In addition, David Thursfield
resigned as a Non-Executive Director in October 2005, due
to his increasing level of external commitments. I would like
to thank Simon and Sipko for their valuable contributions to
the business since 1996 and David for his contribution since
2003. At our AGM in 2006, Iain Napier, who was appointed
as Joint Vice Chairman in December 2004, will take on the
role of Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
I have been delighted to welcome both Susan Murray and
Colin Day as Non-Executive Directors during the year. Both
bring a wealth of experience to the business; Susan has
held a number of high-profile marketing and management
roles and Colin is an experienced international executive
with a strong track record in the consumer sector.
Bruce Davidson, Sales and Marketing Director, resigned
from the Board in February. Graham Blashill, formerly
Regional Director Western Europe, has extended his
responsibilities to cover all of the Group’s global sales and
marketing operations and I was delighted to welcome him
to the Board as Group Sales and Marketing Director in
October 2005.
OUTLOOK
Our balance, both geographically and in the breadth of the
products and brands we offer consumers, together with our
ingrained focus on costs, leave us well placed to continue to
grow the business.
This, combined with our effective use of cash for value
creating acquisitions, further organic investments and share
buybacks, should ensure that we continue to deliver
sustainable growth for our shareholders.
I am grateful to my colleagues on the Board, our senior
management team and to our employees worldwide for their
impressive contributions and continued commitment to
Imperial Tobacco’s success; my sincere thanks to them all.
Derek Bonham
Chairman
In conclusion, I am confident
that our strategy will continue
to deliver good results, with
our strong management team
ensuring excellence in its
execution. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

OPERATING AND 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The fundamental strength of our core business was
demonstrated by the improved profits we have delivered
in the mature markets of the UK and Germany.
Across Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East
and Asia we increased our cigarette shares in many markets
due to the strength of our brand portfolio and our focus on
trade marketing and sales excellence. This cigarette share
growth reflected strong performances from our international
strategic brands Davidoff and West, particularly in the Rest
of Western Europe, where volumes grew by 11 per cent and
31 per cent respectively.
Despite a significant cigarette market size reduction in one of
our core markets, Germany, we have been very encouraged
by the positive trend in our overall cigarette volumes in the
second half of the year, reversing the decline of the first half,
with annual volumes up 1.5 per cent year on year.
In manufacturing, we continued to focus on the simplification
and standardisation of processes, products and packaging.
We have delivered an excellent improvement in productivity,
up by 15 per cent in 2005. This is due to the closure of a
number of factories since May 2004, together with the
benefits of machinery redeployment and underlying
efficiency gains. As part of our ongoing manufacturing
review, in September 2005 we announced a restructuring of
our European cigarette operations and the consolidation of
our rolling papers production into Belgium, which will result
in the closure of our rolling papers factory in South Wales.
We continually review our cost base to ensure that we are
structured efficiently and effectively in manufacturing, sales
and marketing and our central support functions.
We are proud of the hallmarks of our business: our strong
financial performance, our profitable core markets of the UK
and Germany, our international reach, our brand equity, our
multi-product portfolio, our cost focus and our track record
of successful acquisitions.
A fundamental element of our strong financial performance
is our ability to turn our profits into cash and ensure its
effective utilisation. A rolling share buyback programme
was initiated in February 2005 on which we spent around
£200 million during the remainder of the financial year.
Another year of great results…
Gareth Davis
Chief Executive
Our focus on a clear and consistent strategy has again
produced great results in 2005 with double digit earnings
per share growth, building on our outstanding track record. In the past five years total shareholder return was 265 per cent and we have outperformed the
FTSE All-Share Index by 245 per cent.
The fundamental strength of our core business was demonstrated by the improved profits we
have delivered in the mature markets of the UK and Germany.
Across Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia we increased our cigarette
shares in many markets due to the strength of our brand portfolio and our focus on trade
marketing and sales excellence.
We continued to invest for sustainable organic growth. With our Turkish factory opening in
April, we initially launched Davidoff and Maxim cigarettes with encouraging early results and
we added to the portfolio with the introduction of West in September 2005. In China, we built
on our already strong relationship with the Yuxi Hongta Group.  We enhanced our position in
the Scandinavian market through our investment in Swedish snus manufacturer Skruf.
We have delivered an excellent improvement in productivity up by 15 per cent in 2005.
We support sensible and fair regulation that recognises us as a legitimate business producing
a legal product and we continue to engage with the relevant authorities constructively.

GROUP PLC / 2005
17
2005 has been a great year
for Imperial Tobacco. Looking
ahead, I believe that we will
continue to build on our
successes.
We continued to invest for sustainable organic growth.
With our Turkish factory opening in April, we initially launched
Davidoff and Maxim cigarettes with encouraging early results
and we added to the portfolio with the introduction of West
in September 2005. We increased our direct sales force in
Italy and are improving our route to market capabilities in a
number of markets, including Russia. In China, we built on
our already strong relationship with the Yuxi Hongta Group.
We enhanced our position in the Scandinavian market
through our investment in Swedish snus manufacturer Skruf,
giving us a foothold in snus and also allowing us to
distribute our other products through their established
selling operation.
Our success is not just about our operational performance.
It is also about the Group’s responsible behaviour towards
a large number of business partners. These partners accept
our contribution to the economic growth of many countries
and recognise the engagement of Imperial Tobacco in areas
of mutual interest. Our progress in this area is demonstrated
further in our annual Corporate Responsibility Review, which
will be updated in December 2005 and will be available on
our website www.imperial-tobacco.com.
Whilst regulation has increased significantly over the past
five years, we are experienced in developing our business
successfully in this environment as demonstrated by our
consistent results. We support sensible and fair regulation
that recognises we are a legitimate business, producing a
legal product. We continue our approach of constructive
engagement with the authorities in the markets in which we
operate. We believe that sensible regulation combined with
well thought out voluntary agreements is the most effective
way forward.
From a litigation perspective, we were pleased with the
judge’s decision in May to dismiss on all counts the McTear
claim against Imperial Tobacco in Scotland. We have never
lost or settled any tobacco litigation and will continue to
defend ourselves robustly against any further speculative
claims.
Identifying and developing tomorrow’s leaders is a key
activity for all businesses. Several new initiatives were
introduced in the year to develop our management team,
with the aim of further improving performance and instilling
the essence of what makes Imperial Tobacco successful.
Our people are dedicated. They are sales and cost focused
and have a tremendous track record. They are not only
good at what they do, they are also committed to
shareholder value creation and I join the Chairman in
thanking our employees worldwide for what they have
achieved this year on behalf of our shareholders.
Our unswerving focus on our strategy, to create sustainable
shareholder value by growing our operations both organically
and through acquisitions, continues to place the Group in a
strong position. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

GROUP OPERATING PERFORMANCE
In 2005, adjusted operating profit before amortisation and
exceptional items grew 7 per cent to £1,307 million. This
growth was driven by our continuing focus on profitable
volume development, capitalising on our broad product
portfolio and underpinned by effective cost management.
Reported operating profit, after amortisation and exceptional
items, was up 18 per cent to £1,044 million including
a reduction in exceptional items to £57 million (2004:
£129 million).
Turnover including duty was £11,255 million compared to
£11,005 million in the financial year ending 2004. Turnover
excluding duty was up 4 per cent to £3,149 million
(2004: £3,032 million), with the Group’s adjusted operating
margin up to 41.5 per cent (2004: 40.2 per cent).

  Effective Cash Management
Our five year track record of cash conversion is strong with our operating cash flow after net
capital expenditure averaging 92 per cent of adjusted operating profit.
Strong cash generation is a key hallmark of our business and the effective application of our
cash is essential in continuing to deliver growth in shareholder value.
Our primary aim is to continue to develop the business through investment in organic growth
and by pursuing value creating acquisitions. In order to keep our balance sheet efficient while
we are looking for value creating opportunities we commenced a share buyback programme
in February.

Comparing the cash flow generated after net

payments of £46 million in 2005. Share Buybacks
In the year ended 30 September 2005 we spent around £200 million on 13.5 million shares.
The average share price paid was 1475 pence, excluding transaction costs.
Shares were purchased on market on the London Stock Exchange and are held as treasury
shares on the balance sheet. We have, and intend to renew at the 2006 AGM, shareholder
approval to buy back up to 10 per cent of our issued share capital. The Directors choose to
exercise this power only when, in light of market conditions prevailing at the time, they believe
that the effect of such purchases will be to increase earnings per share and is in the best
interest of shareholders generally.
The share buyback programme is ongoing, and in the absence of value creating acquisitions,
we intend to spend up to our annual free cash flow.
The impact of the share buyback programme for the financial year ended September 2005
was to increase adjusted earnings per share by 0.4 pence and basic earnings per share by
0.2 pence, after taking into account an increase in the net interest charge of £3 million and
a decrease in the tax charge of £1 million. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

Results before amortisation and exceptional items
In the UK, turnover excluding duty was up 2 per cent
to £812 million, with adjusted operating profit up 5 per
cent to £477 million. Cigarette volumes were down to
23.9 billion mainly as a result of market volume declines.
The profit improvement reflected the benefits of price
increases, growth in fine cut tobacco and reduced costs,
which more than offset cigarette volume declines and the
impact of downtrading.
In Germany, turnover excluding duty increased 7 per cent
to £630 million, with adjusted operating profit up 24 per
cent to £295 million. This performance was despite a
significant decline in the cigarette market size following
successive duty rises. Our volumes were more resilient
than the market, down 13 per cent to 20.9 billion, reflecting
cigarette share growth. Price increases, growth in volumes
of other tobacco products and cost efficiencies, both in
manufacturing and trading operations, more than
compensated for the cigarette volume declines and the
impact of downtrading.
In the Rest of Western Europe, turnover excluding duty
was up 2 per cent to £644 million. Adjusted operating
profit was slightly down at £326 million. The increase in
turnover was driven by cigarette volumes, up 7 per cent
to 17.7 billion, as market share growth more than
compensated for market declines. Our fine cut tobacco
volumes were affected by increased downtrading across
the region. These volume performances, combined with a
movement in the geographic sales mix towards southern
Europe, resulted in a slight decrease in profits and margins.
In the Rest of the World, turnover excluding duty was
up 5 per cent to £1,063 million with adjusted operating
profit up 6 per cent to £209 million. Our cigarette volumes
were up 5 per cent to 112.7 billion and fine cut tobacco
volumes were stable at 1,800 tonnes. Profits and margins
increased, benefiting from volume growth, pricing
improvements and operating cost reductions, more than
offsetting regional mix effects and market investments.

TAXATION
The tax charge for the year was £286 million (2004: £238
million), representing an effective tax rate of 27.0 per cent
on profit before amortisation. The tax rate on reported profit
before tax was 33.2 per cent. The Group continues to
benefit from lower tax rates applied to a number of overseas
subsidiaries.
EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 11 per cent
to 112.8 pence (2004: 101.6 pence) and basic earnings
per share increased by 29 per cent to 79.0 pence
(2004: 61.4 pence).
We have proposed a final dividend for the year of 39.5 pence,
such that the total dividend for the year is 56.0 pence, an
increase of 12 per cent broadly in line with our adjusted
earnings growth. This dividend will be paid on 17 February
2006 to those shareholders on the register at the close
of business on 20 January 2006. Our dividend policy is
progressive, growing dividends broadly in line with adjusted
earnings, with around a 50 per cent payout ratio.
The interim dividend of 16.5 pence was paid on 5 August
2005.
FINANCING AND LIQUIDITY
At the year end, our net debt had decreased to £3.3 billion
(2004: £3.6 billion) of which 21 per cent was denominated
in sterling, 77 per cent in euros and the balance in other
currencies. In February we refinanced our core bank facility
with a new €2.25 billion, 5 year facility on improved terms.
At the year end 55 per cent of gross debt was fixed by
interest rate derivatives (2004: 60.2 per cent).
CASH MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
We have a strong track record of cash conversion averaging
92 per cent over the last five years and this trend continued
in 2005 with operating cash flow after net capital expenditure
representing 104 per cent of adjusted operating profit.
Gross capital expenditure was £90 million (2004: £103 million),
reflecting a maintenance level of capital expenditure plus
investment in our factory in Turkey.
Our net capital expenditure was £63 million (2004: £48 million)
including proceeds on disposal of fixed assets of £27 million
(2004: £55 million).
OPERATING AND 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
INTEREST
The net interest charge for the year decreased to £184 million
(2004: £204 million) reflecting reduced debt levels and a lower
average all-in cost of debt of 5.3 per cent (2004: 5.6 per cent).
This was mainly due to higher levels of floating rate debt,
the refinancing of our bank facility at improved margins and
maturing capital market debt being replaced with lower cost
bank financing. Interest cover before amortisation and
exceptional items was 7.1 times (2004: 6.0 times).
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Group adjusted profit before tax rose 11 per cent to
£1,123 million (2004: £1,014 million). After amortisation
and exceptional items, reported profit before tax increased
by 25 per cent to £862 million (2004: £688 million).
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Reported profit before tax was impacted by exceptional
items of £57 million (2004: £129 million) and profit on the
sale of fixed assets of £2 million (2004: £7 million). The 2005
exceptional costs related to a number of restructuring
initiatives including the closure of our Montreal, Plattsburgh
and Dublin factories, and the announced restructuring of our
European cigarette operations and the closure of our South
Wales factory. These initiatives are anticipated to generate
the following annual savings: Dublin £4 million for year
ending 30 September 2006; Berlin £10 million and Treforest
£3 million both for the year ending 30 September 2007.
ACQUISITIONS
In September, we acquired a 43 per cent stake of the
Swedish snus company, Skruf. The consideration of £6 million
was satisfied in cash with a commitment to purchase the
balance of shares by mid 2009. The acquisition will be
accounted for as a 100 per cent owned subsidiary to reflect
the substance of the transaction.
The total amortisation charge for the Group for the year was
£206 million (2004: £204 million). IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005
21
SHARE BUYBACKS
We commenced a share buyback programme in February
2005. By 30 September 2005 we had spent around £200
million buying back 13.5 million shares, representing 1.9 per
cent of issued share capital, all of which are held as treasury
shares. The average share price paid was 1475 pence,
excluding transaction costs.
The impact of the share buyback programme for the
financial year ended September 2005 was to increase
adjusted earnings per share by 0.4 pence and basic
earnings per share by 0.2 pence, after taking into account
an increase in the net interest charge of £3 million and a
decrease in the tax charge of £1 million.
ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS
The financial statements for the year ended 30 September
2005 have been prepared in accordance with UK accounting
standards (UK GAAP). For the year ending 30 September
2006, we will report under International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS).
We communicated our assessment of the key changes that
implementing IFRS would have had on our results for 2004,
in March 2005 and the related presentation is available on
our website. Excluding the impact of IAS39 on derivatives,
our adjusted results under IFRS for 2004 would have been
marginally different due to pensions accounting, with all
other impacts currently assessed as being immaterial.
The major impacts on net assets amounted to an uplift
of around half a billion pounds at 1 October 2004.
We are preparing a reconciliation of our 2005 UK GAAP
primary financial statements to IFRS which we will release
on 24 November 2005. It will be posted to shareholders
along with the Annual Report and Accounts and will be
available on our website, www.imperial-tobacco.com.

MARKET DYNAMICS
We estimate that the UK cigarette market was down by around 4 per cent to 51 billion cigarettes. Consumer
downtrading continued with growth in both the ultra low price cigarette and fine cut tobacco sectors. We estimate
the fine cut tobacco market grew to 3,000 tonnes (2004: 2,900 tonnes).
We operate in a highly regulated environment in which new point of sale advertising restrictions were introduced in
December 2004. The UK Government’s Health Bill was published on 27 October 2005, and states that from the
summer of 2007, smoking will be banned in all enclosed public places in England and Wales, apart from private
members’ clubs and licensed premises that do not serve or prepare food.
We anticipate that in Scotland and Northern Ireland a ban on smoking in public places will be implemented on
26 March 2006 and by April 2007 respectively.
OUR PERFORMANCE
We delivered a strong improvement in operating profits, up 5 per cent to £477 million as a result of price increases,
growth in fine cut tobacco volumes and cost reductions.
Our results reflect the strength of our brand portfolio, which includes the UK’s two best selling cigarette brand
families, Lambert & Butler and Richmond. Lambert & Butler performed well, maintaining 16.0 per cent of the market,
whilst Richmond had an excellent year, growing its share by 1.5 percentage points to 14.7 per cent. The combined
brand families accounted for over 30 per cent of the UK market in 2005.
Reflecting market dynamics, our market shares of Regal, Embassy and Superkings declined slightly such that our
total UK cigarette market share remained broadly stable at 44.5 per cent.
We increased our fine cut tobacco share to 66.3 per cent, with strong growth from Golden Virginia, the UK market leader.
Our excellent performance in this highly regulated environment reflects our continued investment in our skilled
salesforce and supporting technology.
Our UK co-marketing and logistics agreement with Philip Morris was renegotiated for an additional five years.
OUTLOOK
The UK market continues to make a major contribution to the Group’s overall performance. In the context of
moderate market declines and current market sector trends, our strong brand portfolio means we are well placed
to build on our market leadership positions in cigarette and fine cut tobacco and to further develop our profits.

23
Germany
Our focus on the profitable development of our
German operations has delivered significantly
improved results, demonstrating our flexibility
to adapt to market conditions.
MARKET DYNAMICS
Successive tax increases over the past few years continue to impact the overall market size in Germany and
we estimate that the total tobacco market in 2005 was down by 4 per cent to 144 billion cigarette equivalents
(2004: 150 billion). The cigarette market decreased by 15 per cent to 101 billion cigarettes partially offset by strong
growth in other tobacco products, up by 39 per cent, as consumers sought value brands and products. Reflecting
this trend, the low price branded cigarette sector continued to grow and accounted for 7.5 per cent of cigarette
sales in September 2005.
The third and final stage of the current round of tobacco tax increases was introduced in September 2005, following
those in March and December 2004. We passed on this tax increase to consumers which, for the majority of our
cigarette portfolio, entailed reducing pack sizes from 19 to 17 cigarettes and lowering prices by 20 euro cents.
In the case between the German Government and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) regarding the taxation of the
Singles make your own product category, the Advocate General published his opinion in July stating that the Singles
category should no longer be taxed as fine cut tobacco but at the same higher rate as cigarettes. The ruling of the
ECJ is expected on 10 November 2005.
OUR PERFORMANCE
Despite a challenging trading environment, operating profit rose by 24 per cent to £295 million, due to growth in our
cigarette share, increased other tobacco product volumes, price increases and the benefits of cost efficiencies in
both manufacturing and trading.
We were pleased with the growth in our cigarette share up to 19.4 per cent (2004: 18.9 per cent). The market share
development of JPS was particularly impressive with the brand capturing 1.7 per cent of the cigarette market in the
18 months since its launch, finishing the year at 2.8 per cent. Davidoff, Peter Stuyvesant and R1 all continued to
perform well in the premium sector and West remained the second largest cigarette brand in Germany with market
share of 8.5 per cent.
Within other tobacco products our volumes have grown strongly, largely driven by the growth in Singles, up by
36 per cent, although our annual market share in this sector declined to 24.2 per cent as a result of increased
competitor activity. In the second half our share stabilised reflecting good performances from JPS and the recently
launched Fairwind.
OUTLOOK
The German market will continue to be challenging and particularly if the awaited ECJ ruling is adverse, but we have
prepared a variety of portfolio responses depending on the outcome. Our flexible approach has ensured the improving
profitability of our operations in Germany and we believe that this flexibility, combined with our broad product portfolio
and our strength in value cigarettes and other tobacco products, will continue to mean we are well positioned.

REGIONAL DYNAMICS
We estimate the annual regional cigarette market was down by 3 per cent, but the rate of decline slowed in the second
half of the year. The regional fine cut tobacco market declined by 2 per cent due to increased prices. Consumers
continued to economise, stimulating growth in the value segments of both cigarette and fine cut tobacco.
The debate on smoking in public places has intensified across the region this year most notably in Italy where further
restrictions were introduced. Our experience in Ireland bears out our view that there would be an initial market
decline with the impact diminishing over time.
OUR PERFORMANCE
The growth in our cigarette shares more than offset the market volume decline. However operating profit was slightly
down at £326 million reflecting the change in sales mix and downtrading within fine cut tobacco.
In the Netherlands, our cigarette market share grew to 4.9 per cent due to the strong performance of West and we
introduced JPS Red and JPS Silver in June in the value segment to capitalise on the continued downtrading dynamic.
Our fine cut tobacco market share was impacted by downtrading; however, we have seen encouraging progress since
we launched the value brands Zilver and Evergreen during the year.
Our domestic cigarette market share in Belgium improved in the second half of the year with an encouraging
performance from Route 66.
In Ireland we grew cigarette market share to 25.0 per cent with growth in Superkings.
Although our overall cigarette share declined slightly in France to 3.3 per cent, we have strengthened our value
offering by extending the JPS family. We maintained our market leading position in the fine cut tobacco sector with
our share at 29 per cent supported by a good performance by Interval.
In Greece, despite downtrading, Davidoff continued to perform strongly in the premium sector with 16 per cent volume
growth and with the repositioning of West and the launch of Maxim Slims our market share rose to 7.0 per cent.
In Spain our market share grew to 5.1 per cent, mainly due to the success of the JPS brand family. We are market
leaders in the growing fine cut tobacco market and delivered a strong performance with Golden Virginia.
The benefits of investment in a new salesforce in Italy were reflected in our cigarette share which reached 1.6 per cent
with growth from Peter Stuyvesant, Route 66 and West.
OUTLOOK
Given the current regional dynamics, we believe the breadth of our product portfolio provides us with opportunities for
future growth as we continue to strengthen our position in this region.

REGIONAL DYNAMICS
This region consists of both mature and developing markets including the key growth regions of Asia, Eastern Europe,
Africa and the Middle East. Many of these markets are highly regulated and we are seeing an increasing level of
regulatory debate and activity across the world, in part influenced by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
OUR PERFORMANCE
Operating profit in this region grew by 6 per cent to £209 million with our performances across Asia, Eastern Europe,
Africa and the Middle East more than offsetting the impact of challenging trading conditions in Central Europe and
Duty Free.
In Asia, we increased our market share in Taiwan to 11.4 per cent with a good performance from Boss, benefiting
from the introduction of Boss Blue in July. In both Vietnam and Laos we grew our volumes and share, with a strong
performance from Bastos. In China, the co-operation with the Yuxi Hongta Group continued to develop with a
number of collaborative workshops and the extension of the West brand distribution to Beijing.
In Australia, profits grew despite market declines. Our cigarette share remained stable at 17.7 per cent with good
performances from Peter Stuyvesant and Superkings.
In Central Europe, we continued to develop our business in the region despite increasing competitor activity in the
ultra low price segment. In Poland, we regained market share momentum following the repositioning of Route 66
and the introduction of Paramount. Conditions remain challenging across the region and we continue to focus on
balancing profit and volume, with some encouraging recent brand launches of Paramount, Golden Gate and Moon.
In Eastern Europe, our volumes grew. Highlights include our Russian market share, up to 5.3 per cent with growth in
Maxim, our improved portfolio in the Ukraine with the newly introduced Classic and in the Caucasus, volumes rose
by over 70 per cent.
Following the completion of our new cigarette factory in Turkey and our subsequent brand launches into the market
in April and September, early progress is encouraging.
In Africa, our profits grew with positive market share developments in Central and Western Africa, and in the Middle
East, Davidoff continued to extend our regional presence with volumes up 27 per cent.
OUTLOOK

OUR PERFORMANCE
Productivity was up by an excellent 15 per cent with increases
in all regions. Cigarette unit costs were down by 6 per cent.
We further simplified our product portfolio reducing our
blends, materials, ingredients and Stock Keeping Units.
Blends were down by 10 per cent during the year, bringing
the total reduction to 41 per cent in the past three years.
We continue to manage our Stock Keeping Units reducing
the opening position by some 9 per cent.
Reflecting our ongoing commitment to address our surplus
production capacity, we closed our factories in Dublin,
Plattsburgh and Montreal enhancing our productivity and
improving operational efficiencies. In September, we
announced the closure of the UK rolling papers factory in
Treforest, South Wales, and the transfer and consolidation
of production to our larger papers plant in Wilrijk, Belgium.
We also announced plans to restructure our European
cigarette operations, including the relocation of approximately
10 billion cigarettes for the Central and Eastern Europe
markets from Germany to Poland.
Standardising our systems is key to our operational efficiency.
A consistent product quality rating system, a time to market
system, standard factory data collection and control
systems and ISO standards for quality and environment all
contributed to reduced waste, lower write-off costs, lower
energy usage and improved factory performance. We have
driven a number of improvements in the year, reflected in
our key performance indicators, for example, four sites
gained ISO accreditation.
The use of key performance indicators has also helped
us in improving our supply chain, which moves more than
700,000 tonnes of products per year. We are implementing
an integrated IT system to improve our performance,
in the areas of stock visibility, sales forecasting and
production planning.
OUTLOOK
We will continue to drive for improvements throughout our
manufacturing and supply chain activities as we have done
over the last 20 years, focusing on business simplification
in all areas, delivering both improvements in product quality
and cost savings, while remaining flexible and responsive
to market dynamics.

Operating Environment
SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES
In a number of the markets and regions in which we operate
the debate on the introduction of restrictions or outright bans
on smoking in public places and in the workplace has
intensified. As stated previously, we support sensible
regulation but believe that outright bans are unnecessary and
disproportionate. Our experience in Ireland confirms our view
on the impact of restrictions on smoking in public places.
It is clear that smokers will continue to smoke; there may be
an initial dip in consumption but this diminishes over time.
FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON TOBACCO CONTROL
(FCTC)
Adopted in May 2003, the World Health Organisation’s
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is the first global
tobacco treaty that seeks to regulate tobacco products in
a number of areas including tobacco advertising, labelling,
product testing and submission of ingredient information, as
well as product traceability. The Convention also addresses
tobacco taxation and calls for tightened legislation to clamp
down on smuggling and illicit products. The number of
ratifications required for the FCTC to take effect was
achieved in November 2004.
We support strong measures to tackle illicit trade and to
prevent youth smoking, but we believe that some areas
covered by the Convention are more appropriately left to
national authorities.
EUROPEAN UNION TOBACCO PRODUCT DIRECTIVE
(EUTPD)
The European Commission published its first report on the
application of the EUTPD in July 2005. The report does not
call for immediate changes to the Directive.
PICTORIAL HEALTH WARNINGS
Following the European Council’s decision in 2003
concerning the use of pictorial health warnings on packs,
the European Commission published an image library in
May 2005. The use of pictorial health warnings is a
Recommendation and is not compulsory.
Thailand introduced pictorial health warnings in March 2005
and the Australian Government will require warnings from
March 2006. It is our view that the use of pictorial health
warnings is unnecessary. They provide no additional
information to the public about the health risks associated
with smoking and are designed solely to vilify, stigmatise
and shock.
We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that pictorial
health warnings have had any impact on consumers’
smoking behaviour in countries where they have already
been introduced, such as Canada and Brazil. However,
we will comply with all legislation that requires us to display
them on our products. We shall continue to raise our
concerns with the relevant authorities.
The erosion of our intellectual property rights through ever
more intrusive health warnings and other information that
we are required to print on packs is a cause for concern
and we continue to raise this issue with governments and
regulatory bodies accordingly.
ADVERTISING RESTRICTIONS
The European Union Advertising Directive came into effect on
31 July 2005, banning the advertising of tobacco products
in the print media, on radio broadcasts and through tobacco
related sponsorship for events such as Formula One motor
racing and the World Snooker Championship. In 2003, the
German Government took legal action against parts of the
Directive, arguing that the regulation of tobacco advertising
should be a national responsibility. We understand that a
ruling is expected in 2006.
The operating environment is challenging. We are experienced
in managing the issues faced by the industry worldwide and we
continue to engage constructively with governments and regulatory
authorities at both national and international levels.
OPERATING AND 
FINANCIAL REVIEW IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005
29
In the UK, the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion (Point
of Sale) Regulations 2004 took effect in December 2004
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, limiting advertising
inside tobacco retailers to a total surface area equivalent to
one A5 sheet of paper (including text health warning and
quit line telephone number). Scotland has introduced almost
identical legislation.
In March 2004 the Irish Government passed the Public
Health Tobacco Act, which bans product displays and
in-store advertising whilst conferring major search and seize
powers on the Office of Tobacco Control. The Act is being
challenged in court by a number of tobacco companies
including ourselves.
We have stringent, self-imposed policies and standards in
place that cover our advertising and promotional activities
worldwide, and we do not believe that advertising bans
are necessary. Our International Code of Practice for the
Marketing of Tobacco Products is available on our website
www.imperial-tobacco.com.
In the context of increasing regulation and a challenging
global environment we continue to build constructive
relationships with governments and regulatory bodies
worldwide. Our objective remains to ensure that regulation
of tobacco products is sound, proportionate and workable.
We do not accept without challenge, regulation that is
flawed, unreasonable or disproportionate; nor do we engage
lightly in legal challenges. However, we will do so where we
believe it is necessary to protect our business interests.
TOBACCO DUTY
Significant duty increases took place this year in several
Western Europe countries, most notably in Germany and in
the Member States that joined the EU in May 2004. We
remain concerned that substantial duty increases encourage
the growth of smuggling, illegal cross-border trading and
counterfeiting and we are totally opposed to such activities.
We continue to work with Customs Authorities in a number
of countries to counter this illegal trade. We have signed
Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) in seven countries to
date. Discussions are progressing in a further twelve
countries. The recent signing of the updated MoU in China
between local authorities and a coalition of tobacco
companies (including Imperial) is the result of continuing
activities to tackle counterfeit products.
TOBACCO-RELATED LITIGATION
In Scotland, on 31 May 2005 we received a favourable
judgment in the case of McTear v. Imperial Tobacco Limited.
The judgment found in favour of the Company on all counts
and has not been appealed. Abandonment has been agreed
in respect of ten other cases brought against us in Scotland
in which individual claimants were seeking damages for
alleged smoking-related effects. The one remaining case
against us in Scotland is inactive.
In the Republic of Ireland, the number of claims against the
Company has fallen from 307 in 1997, to 13 (two of which
have been dismissed subject to appeals and one whose
statement of claim was served out of time and has been
returned); 294 cases have been dismissed, discontinued or
are not proceeding. No case has gone beyond service of a
statement of claim and replies to notices of particulars.
In Poland, an individual claimant has served proceedings on
us. There have been several preliminary hearings and we
anticipate judgment in late 2005/early 2006. During 2005,
a further individual filed a claim against us which the court
rejected on the basis that it failed to comply with legal
formalities. On 4 February 2005 a Health Association filed
proceedings against us and other tobacco companies.
These proceedings have not been formally served on
Imperial Tobacco or any of the other tobacco companies.
In the Netherlands, we have received claim letters on behalf
of 44 individuals, although 15 of those individuals have now
withdrawn. Testimony has been taken from the majority of
the remaining potential claimants at preliminary hearings.
No proceedings have been commenced.
In Australia, an individual claimant has served proceedings
on seven tobacco companies, including our Company.
A statement of claim has been served.
To date, no judgment has been entered against Imperial
Tobacco and no action has been settled in favour of a
claimant in any tobacco-related litigation involving Imperial
Tobacco or any of its subsidiaries. Imperial Tobacco has
been advised by its lawyers that it has meritorious defences
to the legal proceedings in which damages are sought for
alleged smoking-related health effects and to threatened
actions of a similar nature. We will continue to contest all
such speculative litigation against the Group.
Note: This is not an operating and financial review pursuant to Section 234AA of the Companies Act 1985. Our success in 2005 was as much about our people
as our products and markets. We aim to provide
an environment where our employees can maximise
their potential.

technical understanding. Efficiency as
well as compliance of international
regulations is key. It is a demanding
role but I enjoy being presented with
a challenge. We continue to strengthen and develop our employment
practices to reflect the international nature of our business.
We have revised and applied a continuous improvement
methodology to our integrated performance management
system, providing a route to highlight the development and
communication of the behaviours, which drive personal
performance in the business.
The promotion of good working relations with employees
through trade unions, works councils and other organisations
continued throughout the year. Where reorganisation has
impacted on employment, we have ensured that affected
employees are treated fairly and responsibly.

We recognise that in the ever-changing and competitive
market place Corporate Responsibility has an increasingly
strategic role and as such are pleased with the advances
we have made during the year.
We have now achieved over 75 per cent of the two-year
objectives we set in our first Corporate Responsibility Review
in 2003. We have incorporated the remainder which remain
relevant into a new set of two-year objectives, which will be
published in our 2005 Review in December.
We believe there is a real need for informed debate on
significant issues of public interest and so in our 2005
Corporate Responsibility Review we will provide more
information on issues such as product stewardship, social
performance, occupational health and safety and
environmental management.
We have increased our interaction and engagement with
stakeholders and a number of regional employee workshops
have focused on enhancing our expertise in effective
stakeholder relationships.
Over the last year we have reviewed and revised our Group
policies, which guide and direct how we do business
throughout the world, together with our more detailed Group
standards which amplify and quantify our performance
requirements world-wide. Additionally, we have updated our
Corporate Manual for Directors.
PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP AND HEALTH
This year we have made submissions to 39 competent
authorities on our product ingredients, for example as
required under the EU Tobacco Product Directive, and
included data concerning our knowledge of their toxicology.
We continued to consult medical and scientific experts who
inform us of their views on scientific developments related
to our products. Our own views are based on their advice.
Our laboratories continue the routine testing of product
ingredients as well as finished products, using internationally
standardised tests whenever possible. We continued to
commission academic research and further experimental
work at accredited contract laboratories using cell-based
systems. The scientific difficulty of obtaining meaningful
results in this area has been highlighted by three scientific
advisory committees to the UK government. We will discuss
their findings and our own approach to product stewardship
and health in our 2005 Corporate Responsibility Review.
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND THE
ENVIRONMENT
We have continued our successful record of achieving
ISO certification in our manufacturing facilities worldwide,
with four more attaining ISO 14001 certification this year.
This brings our total of certified manufacturing facilities to 17
– including our first in both Eastern Europe and Africa.
We have carried out an extensive analysis of our direct and
indirect carbon emissions as part of our climate change
strategy. This has led to the reframing of our energy
reduction targets in terms of carbon dioxide emissions and
a greater focus on the management options which may
deliver significant reductions and energy savings. In this
regard, we continue our successful collaboration with the
UK Carbon Trust and the Carbon Disclosure Project.
We continue to improve our occupational health and safety,
fire and security risk control processes by providing
professional support and management at both a Group
and functional level. No fatal injuries occurred throughout
our global workforce and our accidents rates were stable.
We are increasing our focus on improving our safety
performance concentrating on the underlying causes of
lost-time accidents.
Frank Rogerson, our Corporate Affairs Director, is the
nominated member of the Board with responsibility for
Occupational Health, Safety and the Environment.
Our objective is to operate a sustainable and profitable business
whilst behaving as a good corporate citizen, integrating Corporate
Responsibility into every aspect of the Group.

SOCIAL PERFORMANCE
Our human rights policy requires that we have rigorous
and systematic practices in place. We are setting up audit
mechanisms for our compliance with the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) core conventions to which we
are committed. As part of a rolling four-year programme,
we have now completed 13 audits of facilities using SA 8000
as guidance.
Our self assessment programme for our suppliers of
tobacco materials has again shown improvements in
social and environmental performance. The equivalent
programme for non-tobacco suppliers shows generally
high levels of performance. These programmes have
created a platform for further constructive dialogue
with suppliers.
We are committed to behaving as a responsible corporate
citizen in the communities in which we work and in society
as a whole. To this end, we have continued to expand our
community investment activities, committing a total of
£1.26m. We are now partnering a number of non-
governmental organisations (NGOs) in projects such
as providing clean water sources in Madagascar and
reforestation and deforestation mitigation programmes in
Malawi, Madagascar and Mozambique. We are also Board
members of the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco
Foundation, www.eclt.org, which runs many successful
projects internationally.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
The Board of Directors (the “Board”) remains committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance, which it sees as a cornerstone
in managing the business affairs of the Group and a fundamental part of discharging its stewardship responsibilities.
Throughout the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report the Group has complied with the governance rules and
best practice provisions applying to UK listed companies as set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the “Code”).
Since Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has securities registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Group also
complies with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which are applicable to foreign issuers. In the light of this ongoing obligation,
a programme of activity is currently in place to enable the Group to meet the further requirements with regard to section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, which will be applicable for our financial year ending 30 September 2006.
Corporate Governance Compliance
The Board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders for the Group’s standard of governance and seeks to maintain high standards in the
management of the affairs of the Group, seeing it as a fundamental part of discharging its stewardship responsibilities. Accordingly both the Board
and the Audit Committee have continued to keep under review the Group’s entire system of internal control, encompassing both financial and
operational controls as well as compliance and risk management. Based on these reviews the Board is satisfied that an appropriate internal control
framework is in place across the whole Group.
As previously reported, certain investigations were initiated by German authorities in January 2003 into alleged foreign trading and related
violations by Reemtsma employees during a period prior to its acquisition by the Group, which resulted in a number of such Reemtsma employees
being named in search orders. Elements of these investigations are continuing. In May 2005, parts of the investigations into certain of the former
Reemtsma employees were terminated by the authorities on terms agreed by the individuals with the authorities, and settlement of any duty
payable as a result of certain of the activities being investigated was made at no cost to Reemtsma. The Group confirms that no criminal charges
have been brought against such individuals or Reemtsma in relation to the continuing investigations, which could take several years to be
concluded.
A Board Committee, under the Chairmanship of Mr A G L Alexander, established in 2003, continues to monitor the progress and conduct of the
investigations on a regular basis and the Group’s responses on behalf of the Board. The German authorities’ investigations are based on alleged
activities prior to the Group’s acquisition of Reemtsma and the Committee remains satisfied that, since the acquisition, the Group has not been
involved in any activities of a nature similar to those alleged by the German authorities.
As previously reported, information was supplied by Imperial Tobacco and a number of other companies to the UK Office of Fair Trading (the “OFT”)
in October 2003 in relation to an enquiry into the operations of the UK tobacco supply chain. Further information was supplied in April 2005 but
to date no response to the information submitted has been received from the OFT.
Board and Board Committees
The Board of Directors, which meets at least five times a year, currently comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, seven other independent Non-
Executive Directors and five Executive Directors, with a clear separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive to ensure an appropriate
balance of power and authority.
Ms S E Murray and Mr C R Day joined the Board on 8 December 2004 and 25 July 2005 respectively as Non-Executive Directors, having been
identified as suitable candidates for appointment by an external search consultancy.
On 9 February 2005 Mr B C Davidson resigned from the Board as Sales and Marketing Director. His responsibilities for the Group’s global sales
and marketing activities have been transferred to Mr G L Blashill who was appointed to the Board on 28 October 2005.
As already announced Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans will be retiring from the Board at the Annual General Meeting (the “AGM”) in January 2006.
It is proposed that Mr A G L Alexander will remain on the Board beyond the AGM in 2006 in order to facilitate a smooth transition at senior Board
level. It is also proposed that Mr I J G Napier (who was appointed Joint Vice Chairman in December 2004) will become the senior independent
Non-Executive Director with effect from the AGM in 2006.
The Board considers that all seven Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) are independent for the purposes of the Code and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
During the year, in accordance with the Code and with the assistance of an external consultant, the Board formally reviewed and evaluated its
performance, together with the performance of its committees and individual directors. In addition Mr A G L Alexander met with the Non-Executive
Directors as a group, without the Chairman present, to consider the performance of the Chairman. The Chairman additionally held meetings
exclusively with the Non-Executive Directors to consider the performance of the Executive Directors.

GROUP PLC / 2005

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Board and Board Committees (continued)
Following the disclosure of individual Directors’ external commitments, as part of the Board performance evaluation conducted during the year,
the Board accepted that Mr D W Thursfield’s increasing level of external commitments was likely to have an adverse impact on his availability
for Board and committee matters. As a consequence the Board accepted Mr D W Thursfield’s resignation with effect from 28 October 2005.
Over the coming months the Board will be seeking to appoint one or more additional Non-Executive Directors to ensure that the Board and its
committees continue to remain suitably balanced.
Remuneration Committee
The membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report which appears on
page 43. Such report, which has been approved by the Board and signed by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, outlines
remuneration strategy and policy, details of the Committee’s activities over the financial year and contains full details of Directors’ emoluments.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee, comprising all the Non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive (who will be stepping down from the Committee
following the AGM), with Mr D C Bonham as Chairman, met twice during the year. Mr M R Phillips the Company Secretary acts as secretary to
the Committee.
The Responsibilities of the Committee include the evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board, the development
of role specifications, the formulation of succession plans and the making of recommendations to the Board with regard to the appointment of
Directors. New Directors appointed by the Board must submit themselves for re-election by shareholders at the AGM following their appointment.
Thereafter all Directors, in accordance with the Code, are subject to re-election at least every three years. Any Director serving in excess of nine
years is subject to annual re-election. The training needs in respect of new appointments to the Board are assessed and, as appropriate, induction
arrangements put in place. Existing Directors are encouraged to undertake such professional development as considered necessary to assist
them in carrying out their duties as directors.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, consisting exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors, Mr A G L Alexander (who will be stepping down from the
Committee with effect from the AGM), Mr I J G Napier, Dr P H Jungels, with Mr S P Duffy (who is retiring at the AGM) as Chairman, met four times
during the year. All its members, with the exception of Dr P H Jungels, are qualified accountants or have held senior finance positions in PLC’s
and are therefore well qualified to discharge the responsibilities that Audit Committee membership entails and are regarded as financial experts
for the purposes of both the Code and section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Following the retirement of Mr S P Duffy at the AGM it is proposed that Mr C R Day will become a member of and assume the chairmanship of
the Audit Committee. It is also proposed that following the AGM Ms S E Murray will become a member of the Audit Committee.
Mr M R Phillips the Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee’s terms of reference cover the matters recommended by the Code. Its duties included monitoring internal control throughout the
Group, approving the Group’s accounting policies and reviewing the interim and annual financial statements together with the US filing on Form 20F,
before submission to the full Board.
The Committee reviews and approves, on an annual basis, the scope and content of the risk assessment and compliance programme
implemented by the Group Compliance Function and monitors and critically reviews the authority, effectiveness and level of resource allocated to
the activity. The Finance Director, the Director of Finance and Planning, the Group’s General Manager – Compliance and other financial
management attend each meeting of the Committee by invitation. The Group’s Auditors also attend each meeting. Standing items on each
agenda allow for the General Manager – Compliance and then the Auditors to meet formally with the Committee without any Executive Director
or other manager being present.
The Group has maintained and regularly reviews its Auditor Independence Policy document, which provides clear definitions of services that the
external Auditors can and cannot provide such that their independence and objectivity are not impaired.
  IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005

Internal control
The Board acknowledges responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control. The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviews the
effectiveness of the system in accordance with the guidance set out in “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code” (the
Turnbull guidance) from information and regular reports provided by management, the internally independent Group Compliance Function and
external Auditors. However, given the size and complexity of the Group’s operations, such a system can provide only reasonable and not absolute
assurance of meeting internal control objectives by managing rather than eliminating risk.
The Board, either directly or through the Audit Committee which reports its findings for consideration by the Board, regularly reviews the
effectiveness of the key procedures which have been established to provide internal control and confirms that an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks operated throughout the year and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report.
The following key features have operated to provide reassurance of both the reliability of information and the safeguarding of assets:
Risk assessment
A detailed assessment of strategic risks is undertaken by the Executive Directors as part of the medium-term planning and annual and monthly
forecasting reporting cycles. The Audit Committee has delegated responsibility for considering Group-wide operational, financial and compliance
risks on a regular basis. All areas of the business are required to undertake risk-profiling exercises to formally review their principal areas of risk
so that all major risks are reviewed at all levels across the Group. This formal system is based on the annual submission of risk assessment
summaries from each of the business operations identifying their major areas of business risk together with the controls embedded in the business
processes to mitigate such risks.
Control environment and control activities
The Group is organised on a functional basis with manufacturing, sales and marketing and central support functions each having their own
management and control structures which satisfy the Group’s controls, accounting policies and regulatory responsibilities. Clearly defined lines
of responsibility with appropriate delegations of authority and segregation of duties exist, with personnel of the necessary calibre in place to fulfil
their roles.
The Board has formally adopted and recently reviewed a schedule of matters of a strategic, financial, operational and compliance nature, which are
required to be brought to it for decision and has established a framework of policies and procedures to which personnel are expected to comply.
A formal policy and arrangements for dealing in confidence with issues of genuine and significant concern raised by employees or others relating
to perceived malpractice, improper business practices, management impropriety or other similar matters, whether financial or non-financial
(commonly referred to as ‘whistleblowing’ arrangements) operates throughout the Group.
Information and communication
Each area of the business is required to produce detailed financial plans prior to the start of each financial year, which are reviewed for robustness
and realism. Major variances against these plans are promptly and thoroughly investigated and the achievement of business objectives, both
financial and non-financial, is also assessed on a regular basis.
Monitoring
A range of procedures is used to review the risk profile and monitor the effective application of internal controls across the Group. These include
independent reviews by the Group Compliance Function together with self-assessment of risks and relevant controls. Furthermore both the senior
operational and financial managers of each business and function annually certify that effective systems of internal control have been maintained
within their area of responsibility.
In line with recommendations issued by the US SEC and to meet developing corporate governance best practice in the UK, the Group has also
established a Disclosure Committee comprising appropriate senior executives to assist the Chief Executive, Finance Director and, as appropriate,
the Audit Committee, in their evaluation of material issues for the purposes of the Group’s disclosure obligations.
The Audit Committee confirms it has reviewed and reported to the Board on the system of internal control for the financial year ended
30 September 2005 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. This was achieved through the procedural and reporting framework for
monitoring business risks and controls, as outlined out above, and review of the Group’s financial statements.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Going concern
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to meet its operational needs for the foreseeable future.
Pension fund
The Group’s main pension fund, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, is not controlled by the Board but by Trustees, consisting of five nominees
from the Company, one member chosen by employees and two by current and deferred pensioners. The Trustees look after the assets of the
pension fund, which are held separately from those of the Group and are managed by independent fund managers. The pension fund assets can
only be used in accordance with its Rules and for no other purpose.
New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements
As a listed non-US issuer, the Group is required to comply with some of the New York Stock Exchange’s (“NYSE”) listing standards relating to the
corporate governance practices of listed companies, being exempt from others.
However there is an obligation to disclose any significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US
companies under the NYSE listing standards. At this time, the Group believes that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with the relevant
NYSE listing standards. However, in respect of the NYSE standards relating to the composition of a Nomination/Corporate Governance
Committee, it is currently the Group’s practice to include the Chief Executive, in addition to all of the Non-Executive Directors, on the Nominations
Committee. However he will step down from the Committee with effect from the forthcoming AGM.
Furthermore it is the Board, not this Committee, that develops, recommends and adopts the corporate governance principles to be applied
throughout the Group. It should also be noted that the role of an internal audit department is incorporated within the general remit of the internally
independent Group Compliance Function.
Communication with shareholders
Communication with all shareholders is given a high priority and a number of methods are used to promote greater understanding and dialogue
with investment audiences. All material documents (including the Annual Report and Form 20F) together with announcements, investor
presentations and share price information are available online through the Imperial Tobacco website (www.imperial-tobacco.com).
Additionally, there is an opportunity at the Annual General Meeting for individual shareholders to question the Chairman and the chairmen of the
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees. Historically the Group has indicated the level of proxy votes lodged in respect of each resolution
proposed at its AGM’s, together with the number of votes for and against each such resolution including details of abstentions, following each vote
on a show of hands. Subsequently the results were also published on the Company’s website.
For the 2006 AGM onwards all resolutions at the AGM will be put to a poll, the result of which will be announced after the conclusion of the
meeting through a Regulatory Information Service release and on the Company’s website.

This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee, in accordance with schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and to meet the
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. In particular, it describes how the Board has applied the principles of good
governance relating to Directors’ remuneration set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the “Code”).
The Remuneration Committee, which met four times during the year and operates under clear written terms of reference (available on the Company’s
website www.imperial-tobacco.com), confirms formally that it has been in compliance with the governance rules and best practice provisions relating
to remuneration as set out in Section 1 of the Code throughout the year.
Remuneration Committee
Membership
The Remuneration Committee is comprised exclusively of Non-Executive Directors who have no personal financial interest, other than as
shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
The members of the Committee during the year were:–
• Mr I J G Napier (Chairman);
• Mr D C Bonham (who will be stepping down from the Committee at the Annual General Meeting (the “AGM”));
• Mr S Huismans (who is retiring from the Board at the AGM);
• Dr P H Jungels; and
• Mr D W Thursfield (resigned 28/10/05)
Mr G Davis, Chief Executive, attends by invitation to respond to questions raised by the Committee; however he is specifically excluded from any
matter concerning the details of his own remuneration. Mr M R Phillips, Company Secretary, also attends meetings as secretary to the Committee.
It is proposed that following the AGM Ms S E Murray will become a member of the Committee.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee sets the remuneration package for each Executive Director and member of the Chief Executive’s Committee after taking advice
principally from external sources, including remuneration consultants Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited and Towers Perrin, both of whom are
engaged by the Committee as required. Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited also review the Group’s remuneration principles and practices against
corporate governance best practice. Neither provide any other services for the Group.
Executive remuneration data provided by KPMG (engaged by the Committee as required and having provided tax and other consultancy services
to the Group) and Towers Perrin has also been used to assist in benchmarking processes ensuring the consistent application of the executive
remuneration policy.
Ms K A Brown, Group Human Resources Director, Mr M R Phillips, Company Secretary and Mr D P Cuthbert, Group Compensation and Benefits
Manager, also provide internal support and advice to the Committee.
Solicitors Allen & Overy LLP and Ashurst have also been retained by the Company to provide legal advice in respect of the Group’s share schemes
and to provide services to the Committee as and when required. Both firms also provide other legal services to the Group as a whole.
The Company has appointed Alithos Limited to undertake Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) calculations and provide advice on all TSR related
matters. Alithos Limited provides no other services for the Group.

GROUP PLC / 2005

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Responsibilities
The Board is ultimately responsible for the framework and cost of executive remuneration but has delegated to the Remuneration Committee
responsibility for the following activities:–
• Determining the remuneration levels and conditions of service for Executive Directors and members of the Chief Executive’s Committee;
• Overseeing the overall policy for senior management remuneration; and
• Overseeing the Group’s employee share or cash based incentive schemes including approval of minor rule amendments, invitations and
awards and the allocation or issue of shares or payments under any such schemes.
The Committee’s approach is fully consistent with the Group’s overall remuneration strategy and philosophy that all employees should be
competitively rewarded to attract and retain their valued skills in the business, as well as supporting corporate strategy, by directly aligning
executive management with the Group’s strategic business goals.
Remuneration strategy
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC operates in an increasingly competitive, international environment. For the Group to continue to compete
successfully it is essential that the level of remuneration and benefits offered achieves the objectives of attracting, developing, retaining and
motivating the necessary high quality pool of talented employees, at all levels, across the Group. The Group therefore sets out to provide
competitive remuneration to all its employees, appropriate to the business environment in those countries in which it operates.
As the Group develops internationally and integrates acquisitions, it continues to need to relocate employees from country to country as the
requirements of the business dictate and has developed its remuneration arrangements accordingly. The remuneration strategy is therefore
designed not only to align with the Group’s fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and equity but also to support the Group’s corporate
strategy, as a significant contributor to its competitive advantage. A cohesive reward structure across the Group is seen as critical in ensuring that
all employees can associate with and strive for the Group’s strategic goals. This structure is consistently applied to all employees and well
communicated to ensure each element of the package is understood and the links to corporate performance recognised. To assist in this
communication senior employees are issued with total reward statements.
The Group also seeks to align the interests of shareholders and employees at all levels by giving employees opportunities and encouragement to
build a shareholding in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC. Through a series of share plan initiatives, Sharesave arrangements and Share Matching
Schemes, the vast majority of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries have been offered participation in one or more equity-based plans
with in excess of 40 per cent of the eligible population taking advantage of those invitations.
Executive remuneration policy
The remuneration package for Executive Directors and members of the Chief Executive’s Committee, as determined by the Remuneration
Committee, is designed to attract and retain high quality executives, induce loyalty and motivate them to achieve a high level of corporate
performance in line with the best interests of shareholders, while not being excessive. The package is also in line with the Group’s overall strategy,
as detailed above, on pay and benefits and, as the Group extends its business internationally, it takes account of market practices outside the
UK where the scope of a particular executive’s role warrants this approach.
The executive remuneration policy combines short term and long term rewards, focusing on performance-related elements that take into account
individual, functional and corporate performance. The main components are base salary, annual cash bonus, share matching scheme (“SMS”),
long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) and pension benefits, with an increased weighting towards performance-related variable reward elements. In the
financial year to September 2005, base salary typically represented around 26 per cent of total remuneration for the Chief Executive and Finance
Director and around 35 per cent of total remuneration for the other Executive Directors with annual bonus and awards vesting under SMS and
LTIP schemes making up the balance. Following approval of the revised share plans by shareholders at the 2005 AGM, for the financial year to
September 2006 base pay will represent around 20 per cent of Executive Directors’ potential remuneration. The executive remuneration policy is
set to provide base salary at around the median level of its comparator group while providing the Executive Directors and Chief Executive’s
Committee members with the capacity to earn upper quartile total compensation on achievement of superior business performance.
  IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005

Percentage of Total Remuneration
for the financial year to 30 September 2005
From the financial year to September 2004, more stringent performance criteria have been and continue to be applied to the performance-related
elements as detailed in the annual cash bonus and LTIP sections below and on page 48 both of which form part of this policy statement.
In August 2005 the Remuneration Committee reviewed its executive remuneration policy, including reward policies, performance criteria, relevant
comparator groups and vesting schedules and is satisfied that these remain appropriate and support the strategy and objectives of the Group,
including the creation of shareholder value.
Base salary
Base salary is reviewed annually and is determined by the Remuneration Committee following detailed consideration of a number of factors
including individual responsibilities, performance and external market data. It is set within a range around the market median of the comparator
group to reflect the experience, responsibility, effectiveness and market value of the relevant executive. The comparator group of companies
chosen remains the FTSE 50 excluding companies in the Financial and Pharmaceutical sectors. Base salary is the only element of the package
used to determine pensionable earnings.
Annual cash bonus
During the period under review, bonus targets related principally to the achievement of Group profit objectives set at the beginning of the financial
year. However, the specific targets are not disclosed since they are considered to be commercially confidential.
For the financial year ended 30 September 2005 the potential maximum bonus was 100 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and
Finance Director and 75 per cent for other Executive Directors. For all Executive Directors potential bonus representing 66
2
⁄3 per cent of base
salary related to achievement of profit based performance criteria. The attainment of bonus in excess of this level was subject to achievement of
additional stretching and incremental performance criteria.
Performance in the financial year has resulted in bonuses, as detailed in the table on page 47, being awarded to Executive Directors. These
payments represented 76.6 per cent of base salary in respect of the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 69.6 per cent in respect of the
other Executive Directors. Cash bonuses were also earned by other senior executives for achieving performance targets for the financial year to
30 September 2005.
For the financial year ended 30 September 2006 the Remuneration Committee has determined that the potential maximum bonus is 100 per cent
of base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 75 per cent per cent for other Executive Directors. For all Executive Directors
potential bonus representing 66
2
⁄3 per cent of base salary is related to achievement of profit based performance criteria. The attainment of bonus
in excess of this level is subject to achievement of additional stretching and incremental performance criteria.
No element of the bonus is guaranteed.
The Executive Directors may elect to invest some or all of their gross bonus in the SMS as detailed on page 51.

Notes
1 Or date of appointment if later.
2 Or date of resignation from the Board if earlier.
3 Mr B C Davidson’s shareholding has been amended to reflect an overstatement of 6,373 shares.
There have been no changes in any Directors’ holdings since 30 September 2005.
Executive share retention
To ensure the interests of management remain aligned with those of shareholders, Executive Directors and senior executives are required to meet
minimum shareholding guidelines, by building, over a period of five years from appointment, a holding in the Group’s shares to a current minimum
value broadly equivalent to three times base salary for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and twice their base salary in respect of the other
Executive Directors. Other executives are expected to invest at a level equivalent to between once and twice their base salary, dependent upon
grade. Failure to meet the minimum shareholding is a factor taken into account when determining eligibility for future LTIP awards. All Executive
Directors currently exceed their required shareholding.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Each year since demerger in 1996, annual awards worth 75 per cent of basic salary have been made to Executive Directors under the LTIP and
awards at a lower level have been made to other senior executives. The awards, which vest three years after grant, are subject to the satisfaction
of an applicable performance criterion, as set out below, over a three-year performance period. All grants are at the absolute discretion of the
Remuneration Committee and no employee has a right to receive any such grant.
For the December 2000 to November 2004 awards, the Committee replaced total shareholder return (TSR) with earnings per share (EPS) growth
as the performance criterion. This was seen as enhancing the incentive effect of the LTIP by focusing on the financial performance of the business,
over which Directors and executives have power to influence. The LTIP Rules give the Committee absolute discretion to ensure that the EPS
performance criterion fully reflects the underlying performance of the Group before any awards vest, including maintenance of long-term return
on capital employed. This discretion gives the Committee the power to reduce, but not increase, the extent to which the award vests.
Outstanding awards vest on a sliding scale depending on average growth in basic EPS adjusted for amortisation, based on an agreed protocol
to allow appropriate adjustments for exceptional and extraordinary items. The adjustments are confirmed by the Auditors after adjusting for
inflation over the period of the award. No vesting occurs unless the Company’s average real EPS growth is positive. Full vesting occurs if average
real EPS growth is equal to or exceeds 10 per cent per annum. Between these two points the award vests on a straight-line basis. In order to
ensure that the performance criterion remained challenging the lower threshold was raised in 2003. Therefore, for the 2003 and 2004 awards,
vesting will only occur if average real EPS growth exceeds three per cent per annum. The upper threshold of 10 per cent per annum real average
EPS growth remained unchanged.
  IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005
49
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) (continued)
On vesting, a participant is granted a “nil cost” option to acquire the relevant number of shares. The option may be exercised at any time up to
the seventh anniversary of its date of grant.
There is no opportunity to re-test if the performance criterion is not achieved.
Under the LTIP rules, should Imperial Tobacco Group PLC be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criteria.
Performance criteria will be adjusted to ensure consistent measurement during the transition to IFRS.
Following the remuneration review in 2004, and subsequent approval by shareholders at the 2005 AGM, the Remuneration Committee has
determined that annual awards equivalent to twice salary in respect of the Chief Executive, one and a half times salary for the Finance Director
and once salary for other Executive Directors will be made in November 2005, with the performance criteria split into three elements as follows:
First element
50 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on EPS as described above, with 12.5 per cent of this element vesting if average
real annual EPS growth equals three per cent and 100 per cent of this element vesting if average real annual EPS growth equals or exceeds
10 per cent. Between these two points awards vest on a straight-line basis.
Second element
25 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on TSR relative to the FTSE 100 Index as described below.
The performance criterion for the second element will be based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the period of the award. No
vesting of this element will occur unless the Company’s total shareholder return ranks it in the top 50 of the companies constituting the FTSE 100
Index. At this performance threshold 30 per cent of this element will vest. If the return ranks the Company in the top 25 of the Index, this element
will vest in full. Between these thresholds the award will vest on a straight-line basis.
Third element
25 per cent of the award with a performance criterion based on TSR relative to a bespoke comparator group also described below.
The performance criterion for the third element will also be based on a sliding scale depending on TSR achieved over the period of the award.
No vesting of this element will occur unless the Company’s TSR exceeds that of the bottom six companies constituting a bespoke comparator
group comprising of 12 tobacco and alcohol companies as detailed in the table below. At this performance threshold, 30 per cent of the third
element will vest. If the return ranks the Company in the top three of the comparator group, this element will vest in full. Between these thresholds
the award will vest on a straight-line basis.
Altadis S A Altria Group Inc British American Tobacco PLC Carlsberg A/S
Diageo PLC Gallaher Group PLC Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Interbrew SA
Pernod Ricard SA Reynolds American Inc SABMiller PLC Scottish & Newcastle PLC
If one of the comparator group companies is acquired prior to the granting of an award, a suitable replacement will be made. Allied Domecq PLC,
a company included in the comparator group approved at the 2005 AGM, has been acquired by Pernod Ricard SA who replace them in the
comparator group. For any corporate actions affecting a comparator company during an award period the current intention would be to mirror
the actions of a passive investor, e.g. for an equity bid the new shares offered in exchange for the original company would be held for the
remainder of the award period.
The TSR calculations will use share prices averaged over a period of three months to determine both the initial and closing prices rather than
those ruling on a single day.
It is assumed that the cash flow of dividend payments is recognised on the date the shares are declared “ex dividend”. This method is considered
to give a fairer and less volatile result since improved performance has to be sustained for several weeks before it effectively impacts on the TSR
calculations. All share prices and dividend flows will be converted to sterling on the applicable date to ensure that the calculations reflect the return
achievable by a UK based investor.
The TSR calculations themselves will be performed independently by Alithos Limited and approval sought from the Remuneration Committee prior
to the TRS elements vesting.
There will be no opportunity to re-test if any of the performance criteria are not achieved. Each element will operate independently and will be
capable of vesting regardless of the Company’s performance in respect of the other elements. However, the Remuneration Committee may vary,
but not increase, the extent to which the award vests to ensure that it only vests, and at an appropriate level, if there has been an improvement
in the underlying financial performance of the Company, including the maintenance of long-term return on capital employed.

GROUP PLC / 2005

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
In setting three elements to the performance criteria for LTIP awards, the Remuneration Committee decided that these were the most important
measures that drive or measure sustainable improvement in shareholder value. The TSR criteria reflect comparative performance against the
appropriate FTSE sector and a bespoke comparator group of companies. The EPS criterion reflects a key part of the Group’s strategy to create
sustainable shareholder value.
Under the LTIP rules, should Imperial Tobacco be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the date of acquisition. Any
outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criteria.
On vesting, a participant is granted a “nil cost” option to acquire the relevant number of shares. The option may be exercised at any time up to
the seventh anniversary of its date of grant.
It is anticipated that the first awards on the basis set out above will be made during November 2005.
An amendment to the LTIP Rules will be proposed at the 2006 AGM to remove the current rule that no award can be granted within three years
of the Plan retirement date (currently age 65) and replace this with a rule that no awards can be made within six months of expected retirement.
Further details of the proposed amendment are contained in the accompanying notice of the 2006 AGM.

During the year, the November 2001 – November 2004 award vested in full. Annual growth in EPS over the period averaged 21.77 per cent
exceeding the average of 10 per cent, the threshold at which the award maximises. There have been no changes in any Directors’ awards since

Executive Directors’ conditional share awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (continued)
In respect of the November 2002 – November 2005 award, based on EPS to the end of the financial year, 100 per cent of the award will vest on
25 November 2005. For illustrative purposes only, the share price on 28 October 2005, being the latest practicable date prior to publication, was
£15.91 valuing the awards as follows:–
Award vesting Award vesting

R Dyrbus – 29,718 473
D Cresswell – 9,906 158
F A Rogerson – 10,427 166
The value of any awards vesting could vary significantly from the above due to share price movements.
The Remuneration Committee regards the November 2003 – November 2006 and the November 2004 – November 2007 awards to be too distant
from maturity to be included in the value projected above. However, in respect of these awards, the adjusted average EPS has grown by more than
10 per cent per annum in real terms in the performance period to the end of September 2005 and, therefore, if this performance were maintained
over the relevant performance periods both awards would vest in full, their illustrative values based on the above share price are as follows.

Evidence of the Group’s sustained performance on a TSR basis when compared with the FTSE 100 Index is set out below.
The FTSE 100 Index is seen to provide the most appropriate and most widely recognised index for benchmarking the corporate performance of
the Company which is a constituent of that index and reflects one of the benchmark indices to be used as an LTIP performance measure.
Share Matching Scheme (“SMS”)
Annual Scheme
Under the SMS, the Remuneration Committee, at its absolute discretion, invites Executive Directors and most of the Group’s management to
invest any proportion, up to a maximum of 100 per cent, of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares to be held by a
nominee controlled by the Employee Benefit Trust. Provided that the shares lodged are left with the nominee for three years, they will be matched
on a one for one basis.
However, in respect of investments made by Executive Directors under the SMS from their bonus paid in December 2003, and for future years, a
performance criterion will be applied to the matched shares such that matching will only occur if the Group has achieved in excess of an average
three per cent real increase in EPS per annum over the three year retention period, being an indicator of sustained ongoing profit delivery. Achievement
measurement is based on the same protocol as that applying to the LTIP . There is no opportunity to re-test if this performance criterion is not met. In
setting the performance criterion for SMS awards, the Remuneration Committee decided that EPS reflects a key part of the Group’ s strategy to create
sustainable shareholder value. Under the scheme rules, should Imperial Tobacco be acquired, the performance period would come to an end on the
date of acquisition. Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro-rata basis, subject to the achievement of any applicable performance criterion.
The performance criterion will be adjusted to ensure consistent measurement during the transition to IFRS.

To encourage employees to acquire and retain a shareholding, and to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company (of
Great Britain and Ireland) Limited, all employees of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the date of
the centenary, were invited to purchase up to £3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares and lodge them with the Employee
Benefit Trust. Provided these shares are left in the Trust, the lodged shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20 per cent for one year’s
retention to a maximum of 100 per cent if they are retained for the full five years to August 2007.

Executive Directors’ contingent rights to shares under the Share Matching Scheme (continued)
During the year, annual bonuses earned in 2000/2001 and lodged under the SMS for a three-year period matured in January 2005, providing
matched shares for participants on a 1:1 basis.
In respect of annual bonuses earned in 2003/2004, the Executive Directors elected to invest their entire bonus in January 2005 in the form of
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Ordinary Shares under the SMS. These will be matched with additional shares, equal in number to the original
shares, provided they are both left in the SMS for three years and if the Company has achieved in excess of an average of three per cent real
increase in EPS per annum over the retention period. These additional shares are shown within contingent rights above.
It is anticipated that the Executive Directors will again invest their entire bonus in February 2006 in the form of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC
Ordinary Shares under the SMS.
Share options
The Company does not operate an executive share option scheme. However, Executive Directors are eligible (along with all employees of the
Company and any participating subsidiary of the Group) to participate in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC’s savings-related Sharesave Plan. Under
this Plan options are granted, at a discount of up to 20 per cent to the closing mid-market price on the day prior to invitation, to participants who
have contracted to save up to £250 per month over a period of three or five years.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Employee Benefit Trust
The Imperial Tobacco Group Employee and Executive Benefit Trust (the “Executive Trust”) and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee
Benefit Trust (the “2001 Trust”) have been established to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, from funds
provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the SMS and LTIP awards. As
potential beneficiaries of the Executive Trust, each of the Executive Directors is deemed to have a contingent interest in the 929,837 Ordinary
Shares of the Company held by that Trust at 30 September 2005.
Details of the shareholdings by the Employee Benefit Trusts are as follows:
Balance Purchased Distributed Balance Shares under
at during during at Award at Surplus

1 As at 30 September 2005, the Company also held 13,515,000 shares in Treasury which could be used to satisfy awards under the share plans.
Share Plan Flow Rates
The Company’s policy has always been to satisfy all awards under its share schemes from market purchased shares through the Trusts. The Trust
Deeds and the Rules of all schemes contain provisions limiting awards to five per cent in five years and 10 per cent in 10 years for all employee
schemes with an additional restriction to five per cent in 10 years for executive schemes. Currently an aggregate total of only 0.9 per cent of the
Company’s issued share capital is subject to awards under all the Group’s executive and all employee share schemes. In future the Trust may
also be provided with shares held by the Company in Treasury in order to satisfy vesting awards.
Since demerger in 1996 the cumulative awards under all of the Company’s share plans totals under 2.7 per cent of its issued share capital.
Following initial grants on demerger, subsequent annual grants have averaged 0.3 per cent of issued share capital.
Executive Directors’ Pensions
The Executive Directors are all members of the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, the principal defined benefit scheme operated by the Group. For
members who joined prior to 1 April 2002 the fund is non-contributory with a normal retirement age of 60. The fund allows members to achieve
the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary at normal retirement age after 32 years’ service. Pension commutation to enable participants
to receive a lump sum on retirement is permitted within Inland Revenue limits.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable together with a spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the member’s
expected pension at retirement. For death in retirement, a spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the member’s pre-commutation pension is payable.
Dependant children will also receive allowances.
Pensions increase by the lesser of 10 per cent and the increase in Retail Price Index, together with an option under the rules to surrender part of
a pension for pension increases in line with the general index of retail prices of up to 15 per cent.
All Executive Directors earn benefits on the standard scale with a normal retirement age of 60.
The Remuneration Committee is reviewing its policy for current Executive Directors’ pensions in light of proposed UK legislation due to be
published in November 2005. Once this legislation has been finalised the Remuneration Committee intends to conclude its review.
Simultaneously the Remuneration Committee will be reviewing its policy for future Executive Directors in light of the final legislation, market
competitiveness and its overall remuneration policy.
The following table provides the information required by both the Listing Rules and schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and gives details for
each Director of:
• the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as if he had left service at the year end;
• the increase in accrued pension during the year, excluding any increases for inflation in respect of the disclosure required under the Listing
Rules; and
• the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension calculated in accordance with the actuarial guidance note GN11.
None of the Directors has made additional voluntary contributions.

2005** and the date he subsequently left the Company, 30 April 2005*.
2 In respect of Mr G Davis and Dr F A Rogerson, their accrued pension and transfer values of accrued pension at 1 October 2004 included a small historic pensionable
car allowance which was waived, without compensation, by them during the year.
3 Restated to reflect recalculation of transfer values at 1 October 2004.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director. Instead they represent a potential liability
of the pension scheme.
Benefits
The principal taxable benefits for Executive Directors are the provision of cars and health insurance.
Remuneration from other Non-Executive Directorships
The Company recognises that external non-executive directorships are beneficial for both the Executive Director concerned and the Company.
Executive Directors are permitted, at the discretion of the Board, to retain fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorship. Each
serving Executive Director is restricted to one external non-executive directorship and may not serve as chairman of a FTSE 100 company.
Mr G Davis serves on the Board of Wolseley PLC and currently receives fees of £58,000 per annum.
Executive Directors’ Service Agreements
It is the Group’s policy to appoint Executive Directors under service agreements terminable by either party giving 52 weeks’ notice, as shown in
the table below. The service agreement of Mr G L Blashill, who was appointed to the Board on 28 October 2005, is terminable by either party
giving a maximum of 52 weeks’ notice.
There are no predetermined provisions for compensation on termination within Executive Directors’ service agreements. However, the Group is
unequivocally against rewards for failure. The circumstances of the termination and an individual’s duty and opportunity to mitigate loss are taken
into account in every case. The Group’s policy is to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former Directors to the extent that they receive
remuneration from other employment during the compensation period.
Under the rules of the LTIP and SMS, outstanding awards vest on termination for certain reasons, such as death, retirement, redundancy or on
a change of control, on a time-related pro-rata basis subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria. If, however, the termination of
employment is for a reason other than one of those specified in the rules an individual’s full award lapses. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole with regard to market practice and within the restrictions contained in
the Company’s Articles of Association. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee. The Non-Executive
Directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration. They receive no other material pay or benefits (with the exception of
reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with their directorship of the Company and provision of administrative support including the
use of Company offices by the Chairman Mr D C Bonham and Joint Vice Chairman Mr A G L Alexander), do not participate in the Company’s
share schemes, bonus schemes or incentive plans and are not eligible for pension scheme membership.
To align further the interest of the Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders, it was agreed that a proportion of their fees be applied,
after tax, to purchase shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC. These shares are to be held by a nominee during the term of each Non-Executive
Directorship. Exceptionally in respect of Mr D C Bonham and Mr A G L Alexander, this requirement has been waived due to their continued level
of investment, as detailed above. Furthermore given the impending retirement, at the forthcoming AGM, of Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans this
requirement has also been waived in respect of their emoluments paid during the financial year commencing 1 October 2005.
Mr S Huismans is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which he received additional remuneration for fulfilling
such non-executive roles.
Non-Executive Directors’ Letters of Appointment
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements with the Company.
The terms of their appointments are reviewed annually and upon them reaching 65 years of age. These terms were reviewed for all Non-Executive
Directors and confirmed on 1 February 2005. The letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office during normal
business hours and prior to and at the AGM. Under the terms of the Articles of Association of the Company, Non-Executive Directors stand for
reappointment at the first Annual General Meeting following appointment, are subject to triennial reappointment by shareholders and retire (subject
to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985) at the Annual General Meeting following their reaching 70 years of age. There are no provisions in
their letters of appointment regarding notice periods or compensation on early termination. The letters of appointment detail the time commitment
expected of each Non-Executive Director.
Although there is no current maximum term of appointment for Non-Executive Directors, the Board is supportive of the best practice provisions
contained in the Code. Messrs S P Duffy and S Huismans will be retiring from the Board at the AGM in February 2006, having both been on the
Board since demerger in August 1996. However where the Board considers a Non-Executive Director is making a particularly valuable contribution
they may be invited to remain on the Board in excess of nine years. In such instances the length of tenure of the Non-Executive Director would
be relevant to the Company’s deliberations as to the independence of the Non-Executive Director and he/she would also be subject to annual re-
election at the AGM. Such re-elections will be subject to the overall independence of the Board not being compromised. It is proposed that Messrs
D C Bonham and A G L Alexander, who have also been on the Board since demerger in August 1996, will continue to serve on the Board and
will therefore offer themselves for re-election annually.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Remuneration Arrangements for Former Directors
Mr S T Painter
Following his retirement in May 2000, Mr S T Painter entered into a consultancy agreement with Imperial Tobacco Limited, the Group’s principal
operating company.
The agreement, as amended in October 2001 and May 2004, runs to March 2007. Under the terms of the agreement he provides consultancy
services as required and receives fees at a day rate of £1,000 with a minimum fee based on 100 days service for each 12 month period ending
on 30 June, and 67 days for the period 1 July 2006 to 6 March 2007. The agreement is terminable by either party giving 12 months’ notice. He
is also entitled to reimbursement for the use of his car.
Mr Painter is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which he receives additional remuneration for fulfilling such
non-executive roles.
Mr M A Häussler
In respect of Mr M A Häussler, subsequent to his resignation as a Director of the Company with effect from 9 July 2003, he remained as an
employee receiving his full contractual remuneration until his resignation from the Company on 30 April 2005. His base salary included the
payment of a pension allowance of £5,980 which was neither eligible for bonus nor share schemes and was not pensionable.
Mr Häussler is currently in receipt of an annual retirement pension, that has been reduced because it has been taken before he reached his normal
retirement age. His service agreement with the Group provided that he would receive similar overall pension benefits to those that he would have
received had he remained in the Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH pension arrangement. This was, broadly, a pension for life equivalent to 42
per cent of his fixed annual salary at age 63. For death in retirement, a spouse’s pension for life of 60 per cent of that amount would be payable.
The pension is made up of three parts: one part of the pension is payable from the unfunded pension arrangement of Reemtsma
Cigarettenfabriken GmbH, another part is payable from the separately funded Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund and the difference, which is not
separately pre-funded, is paid by the Company. The pension payable under the Reemtsma arrangement and from the Imperial Tobacco Pension
Fund may be increased annually in accordance with the rules of those arrangements or as is required by law.
Mr B C Davidson
In respect of Mr B C Davidson, subsequent to his resignation as a Director of the Company on 9 February 2005, he remained an employee
receiving his full contractual remuneration until he left the Company on 30 April 2005.

(i) Pensions
Under UK GAAP , pension costs are accounted for under the rules set out in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. 24 (SSAP 24).
Its objectives and principles are broadly in line with those set out in the US accounting standard for pensions, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (SFAS 87). However, SSAP 24 is less prescriptive in the application of
the actuarial method and assumptions to be applied in the calculation of pension costs.
Under US GAAP , the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period as determined in accordance with
SFAS 87. Under SFAS 87, a pension asset representing the excess of Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund assets over benefit obligations has
been recognised in the balance sheet.
(ii) Business combinations
Both UK and US GAAP require purchase consideration relating to a business combination to be allocated to the net assets acquired at their
fair value on the date of acquisition
Intangible assets
Under UK GAAP fair values are assigned to identifiable intangible assets only if the identifiable intangibles are capable of being disposed of
or settled separately, without disposing of a business of the entity.
Under US GAAP, identifiable assets are separately valued and amortised over their useful lives. The separately identifiable intangible
assets included in the US GAAP balance sheet are principally comprised of brand rights, which are being amortised over periods between
25 to 30 years.
Goodwill amortisation
Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets acquired on acquisitions made on or after
27 September 1998 are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, not exceeding a period of 20 years. Prior to 27 September 1998, all
goodwill and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets were written off to reserves on acquisition.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142) with effect from 1 July 2001 and accordingly
goodwill arising on acquisitions after this date are not amortised. For purchase transactions prior to 1 July 2001, goodwill was capitalised
and amortised over its useful life. From 29 September 2002, in accordance with SFAS 142, the Company no longer amortises goodwill but
rather tests such assets for impairment on an annual basis or where there is an indicator of impairment.
The Company completed an annual impairment review under SFAS 142 at 30 September 2005 and no impairment of goodwill was indicated.
For the purposes of the annual impairment review, goodwill has been allocated to the following reporting units of the Group: Manufacturing,
UK Sales and Marketing and International Sales and Marketing.
(iii) Deferred taxation
Under UK GAAP , deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery
is considered more likely than not.
US GAAP requires deferred taxation to be provided in full, using the liability method. In addition, US GAAP requires the recognition of the
deferred tax consequences of differences between the assigned values and the tax bases of the identifiable intangible assets, with the
exception of non tax-deductible goodwill, in a purchase business combination. Consequently, the deferred tax liability attributable to
identifiable intangible assets has been recognised and is being amortised over the useful economic lives of the underlying intangible assets.
SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UK AND US GENERALLY
ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (“GAAP”) IMPERIAL TOBACCO
GROUP PLC / 2005
66
SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UK AND US GENERALLY
ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (“GAAP”)
(iv) Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into certain swap transactions with contractual maturities exceeding those of the underlying debt being hedged,
in anticipation of there being additional floating rate debt when the existing debt matures. Under UK GAAP, derivative financial instruments
that reduce exposures on anticipated future transactions may be accounted for using hedge accounting.
US GAAP requires the Group to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The Group has decided not to satisfy the SFAS No. 133
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133) requirements to achieve hedge accounting for its derivatives,
where permitted, and accordingly movements in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the profit and loss account.
(v) Proposed dividends
Under UK GAAP , dividends paid and proposed are shown on the face of the profit and loss account as an appropriation of the current year’s
earnings. Proposed dividends are provided on the basis of recommendation by the Directors and are subject to subsequent approval by
shareholders.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders.
(vi) Employee share schemes
Under UK GAAP , the cost of employee share schemes is charged to the profit and loss account using the quoted market price of shares at
the date of grant less the exercise price of the share options granted. The charge is accrued over the vesting period of the shares. SAYE
type schemes are exempt from the requirement to recognise a charge to the profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, the compensation cost is recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the
quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options. For option
plans which contain performance criteria, compensation cost is remeasured at each period end until all performance criteria have been met.
The SAYE scheme is regarded as compensatory and the discount is accrued over the vesting period of the grant.
(vii) Net income per share
Basic net income per ordinary share has been computed using US GAAP net income and weighted average ordinary shares. Diluted net
income per ordinary share has been calculated by taking into account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued on
conversion into ordinary shares of options held under employee share schemes. There would be no significant dilution of earnings if
outstanding share options were exercised.
Each American Depositary Share (ADS) represents two Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares. IMPERIAL TOBACCO

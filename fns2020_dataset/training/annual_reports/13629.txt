business model
T o maintain a market-leading position, we aim to provide high

superior level of service that supports our customers’ activities around 
the world.
Business model
Our global network of ofﬁces and manufacturing sites expands each year to ensure that 
support is local to the customer. The same Rotork culture is found at all of our sites and it 
is something we strive to bring to new ofﬁces and acquired businesses so that customers 
get consistently high-quality service throughout the world. We operate an asset-light 
business model, with most of our manufacturing sites purchasing components in a 
ﬁnished form and then assembling to order.  Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

Competitive strengths
  Technological leadership – Understanding our customers 
and the markets we serve allows us to continue to develop 
new products and lead the evolution of actuator and ﬂow 
control products.
  Global footprint – Our ofﬁces around the world allow us 
to manage the complex global projects which account for 
the majority of sales and to support our customers in the 
ﬁeld. Rotork Site Services work with our customers by 
installing and commissioning our actuators and by meeting 
their service requirements.
  Diverse end market exposure – Wherever liquids, gases 
or powders are being moved and the process needs 
to be automated or contain failsafe controls, actuators and 
ﬂow control products are required. We highlight the oil & 
gas, power and water markets because they use actuators 
most intensively but we sell to many other markets. Some  
of these markets span many applications and our broad 
product portfolio enables us to address them.
  Asset-light business model – Over 90% of our products 
are built using an outsourced manufacturing model, with our 
workforce assembling components and conﬁguring products 
to match customer orders. We have developed and call upon a 
global network of suppliers who manufacture the components 
for our products to our designs and who use our tooling.
  Quality – Our products are used in demanding environments 
where consistency of performance is often critical to a 
process. Customers expect Rotork products to be reliable  
and our quality control procedures, which extend to cover  
our supply chain, are central to delivering this.
Market drivers
Many of the markets we serve are recognised as structural 
growth markets. The growth may be driven by investment in 
new infrastructure to support urbanisation or industrialisation, 
automation or refurbishment of existing plants. Population 
growth, the exploitation of new technologies and the desire to 
extract natural resources from ever more challenging locations 
are also drivers in some of our markets.

strategy
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES ACHIEvEMENTS 2012 OBjECTIvES 2013
Sales growth – Grow our markets by 
increasing our international coverage, 
broadening our end-market exposure and 
continuing to integrate our new 
acquisitions.
Opened new sales offices in Brazil, Russia, 
Korea and Japan, restructured the UK sales 
operation and expanded service 
capabilities in other offices.
Open two new regional offices in Australia 
and larger premises in Mexico and Spain in 
response to particularly active markets in 
these areas. Continue to build knowledge 
of a number of less well developed 
end-markets and consider these 
opportunities.
Product development – Introduce and 
develop new products in each of the 
divisions. 
There were a number of product launches 
during the year in all divisions, with IQ3 in 
the Controls division being the most 
significant. 
A number of product launches are 
scheduled this year in line with the product 
roadmap established for each division. 
Development continues in other areas, 
including nuclear and within the recently 
acquired businesses.
Acquisitions – These are a core part of 
our growth strategy. Our criteria for 
acquisitions are that they bring Rotork a 
new product, a new geographical market 
or a new market sector. Often the target 
will satisfy two or even three of these 
criteria. We retain a rigorous and 
disciplined approach to acquisition pricing.
Acquired Soldo in November. Acquired Schischek in January. We will 
continue to seek further suitable 
opportunities in 2013.
Rotork’s vision is to be the leader in our targeted segments of the global flow 
control market. The targeted segments comprise of the traditional electric, fluid 
power and manual actuators used to control the flow of liquids, gases or 
powders. These markets are addressed by our Controls, Fluid Systems and Gears 
divisions. In addition, the broader instrumentation, diagnostics and feedback 
devices used in pressure control and measurement or flow control and 
measurement, form the targeted segments for Rotork’s new Instruments division. 
We seek to deliver a high return on capital, strong and sustainable margins and consistent 
year on year growth in revenues and profit which, combined with the asset-light model, 
deliver strong cash generation. This cash is used to fund the growth of the business, both 
organic and through targeted acquisitions, and to fund sustainable and consistent growth 
in our core dividend.
To provide short term focus, we agree an annual set of key objectives. At the start of 2012 
our objectives included two other items; the establishment of the Instruments division and 
expanding our nuclear product offering, which are no longer listed specifically below. The 
Instruments division is now established and its strategy understood and the acquisition of 
Soldo during the year was another step in its growth. We have continued to invest in 
development of the nuclear product range and certification of these products. In future, 
rather than consider this a separate objective, it has been included within the broader 
product development objective. The other achievements for 2012 and headline objectives 
for 2013 are shown below: Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES ACHIEvEMENTS 2012 OBjECTIvES 2013
Manufacturing and facilities – Rotork 
has invested in a number of factories and 
sales offices to develop world-class 
facilities from which to work.
Completed the new Chennai factory which 
opened in June and opened five new sales 
and service offices.
Complete the fit-out and move into the 
new facilities in Bath and Leeds.
Procurement – Rotork’s outsourced 
manufacturing model means that material 
costs are the most significant component 
of direct costs. We have always sought to 
control these costs and wherever possible 
leverage our global presence to source 
materials.
We continued to expand our sourcing 
team and as a result managed to mitigate 
inflationary price pressures through 
negotiation and finding new suppliers. 
Commodity costs were broadly neutral 
over the year.
Continue to look for opportunities to take 
costs out of all our products through 
sourcing or product development, 
including a focus on recently-acquired 
businesses. Our proven sourcing 
capabilities will be supported with 
increased resources.
Rotork Site Services (RSS) – We continue 
to invest in more service engineers and 
facilities to ensure we provide the level of 
local support our customers have come to 
expect from us.
Increased the number of service engineers 
by 8%, new RSS Director recruited and we 
invested in the service workshops in four 
locations.
Continue to expand the service team and 
establish new workshops where there is 
customer demand.
IT – Rollout our global system for the sales  
and service offices.
The new system is now operational at two  
sites. Development of the rollout template  
and additional functionality continued during 
the year.
Continue the rollout through the sales and 
service offices and start to consider 
development for smaller manufacturing sites. 
Staff development – Highly trained and 
motivated people are key to delivering our 
strategy. We will invest in our people and 
encourage internal development to support 
our future growth plans. This will include 
recruiting increasing numbers of apprentices 
and graduates around the world and 
identifying training needs for all employees 
through their annual appraisal as well as 
developing talented individuals.
Increasing the Global HR team to improve 
consistency of approach across locations.  
The appointment of a Group Training  
Manager during the year, a new role, will 
facilitate a more coordinated global 
approach to training and the most effective 
use of existing resources.
The creation of training plans for each 
location and online training programmes 
covering a variety of areas are the first areas 
being developed.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) –  
Our objectives for CSR are monitored by 
four separate committees covering health & 
safety, environment, ethics and social issues 
which report to the CSR Committee chaired 
by the Chief Executive. Our approach in 
these areas is to communicate best practice 
throughout the Group, training those 
responsible and, where appropriate, 
verifying adoption in each subsidiary.
Health and safety audit scores improved 
slightly in the year and the associated KPI 
(Accident Frequency Rate) was slightly 
higher than the previous year. Our 
environmental KPI, waste recycling, 
showed a modest improvement in the year. 
The ethics committee continued to 
communicate the provisions of the UK 
Bribery Act to directors and managers 
worldwide and provide further training 
where required. Our employees gave their 
time and energy to support a wide variety 
of good causes around the world.
Continue to communicate best practice to 
all locations and provide the necessary 
training to support local teams. Focus on 
carbon emissions and our targeted 1% 
reduction in CO
2 per £ of revenue in 2013. 
Encourage our employees to continue in 
their efforts for our global charities, 
WaterAid and Send a Cow, as well as other 
local charities in 18 countries benefiting 
over 150 charities. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

I am pleased to report 
another year of record order 
intake, revenue and profit. 
Our strategy remains to grow 
both organically and through 
acquisitions and again this 
year we have extended our 
geographic reach.
Roger Lockwood
Chairman
chairman’s statement
The six acquisitions we completed in 2011 
were successfully integrated and have all 
made positive contributions during the year. 
Rotork Instruments, the division we created 
in 2011 to address the wider flow control 
market, performed well and will benefit from 
the addition of Soldo which we acquired in 
November 2012. Following the year end, in 
January 2013, we acquired the Schischek 
group of companies which will form part of 
the Controls division and provides us a 
presence in a new market, heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC).
Rotork has a reputation for innovation and 
during the year we maintained our focus on 
bringing new products to market which 
incorporate additional features and provide 
new benefits to our customers. 2012 saw the 
launch of IQ3, the latest generation of our 
flagship electric actuator range, as well as 
new products in each of the other divisions.
Financial Highlights
Revenue grew 14% to £512m despite a 3% 
currency headwind. The currency impact 
was more than offset by the benefit of a full 
year contribution from the six businesses 
acquired in 2011, meaning growth on an 
organic constant currency basis was 12%. 
Adjusted operating profit* increased by 
14% to £132m, resulting in a broadly similar 
operating margin of 25.8% compared with 
25.9% the prior year. The rapid growth of 
Fluid Systems had a dilutive effect on Group 
margins even though this division generated 
adjusted operating margins in excess of its 
15% target at 15.3% for the full year. 
Earnings per share increased 11% to 103.1 
pence, or based on adjusted profit*, 
14% to 109.3 pence. Net cash balances 
grew £11m in the year to end at £60m.
Board Composition
In May 2012 we welcomed Sally James as  
a non-executive director, broadening the 
range of skills and experience within the 
Board. Sally currently holds a number of 
other non-executive positions and 
previously held senior legal roles in 
investment banks in London and Chicago. 
Following Sally’s appointment the Company 
is now compliant with the Corporate 
Governance Code in that half the Board, 
excluding myself as Chairman, are 
independent non-executives. We have  
also met our stated aim that 25% of  
our independent non-executives will be 
women by the end of 2012.
Board Performance
Once again this year we used external 
consultants to conduct an independent 
appraisal of Board effectiveness. The results 
of the review were positive and Directors 
were unanimously of the view that the 
Board operates effectively as a unit. It is 
clear that the breadth of experience and 
skills represented on the Board is a key 
factor in this. During the review it was 
noted that a number of improvements had 
been made following last year’s review 
including the appointment of a new 
non-executive director and a strengthening 
of the approach to risk management and to 
acquisitions within the broader flow control 
strategy. The review recognised that many 
of the challenges facing the Board relate to 
managing the continued growth of the 
Group whilst preserving the strengths of   Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

the composition of the Board enables it to 
fulﬁl its expected role.
Corporate Governance
As a Board, we are responsible to the 
Company’s shareholders for increasing 
shareholder value over the long term 
through effective management and good 
governance. The Board considers all the 
aspects of the business necessary to provide 
good governance including strategy, 
acquisitions, current performance, risk 
management and the internal control 
framework. Discussions include the Rotork 
Management Board on occasions and at 
least once a year the Board meeting takes 
place at one of the subsidiary sites. I am 
pleased to be able to conﬁrm that Rotork 
now complies with all aspects of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Dividend
The Board recommends a ﬁnal dividend of 
26.6p per share which, taken together with 
the 2012 interim dividend, gives a payment 
of 43.0p per share (2011 core dividend: 
37.25p), representing a 15% increase in core 
dividends. This dividend will be payable on 
21 May 2013 to shareholders on the register 
on 12 April 2013.
Outlook
The strong results across the Group reﬂect 
the progress we have made in executing our 
strategy, with each division achieving record 
results in terms of order intake, revenue and 
proﬁt.
Our expanded product portfolio and 
extensive international reach position us for 
further growth. We will continue to invest in 
infrastructure, product development and 
sales channels both organically and by 
acquisition to strengthen our presence in 
the wider ﬂow control market.
The markets that we serve remain active 
and whilst we recognise that we are likely  
to see weakness within some regions due  
to economic conditions, the Board remains 
conﬁdent of achieving further progress in 
the coming year.

2012 was a year of good 
progress. We delivered 
strong organic growth and 
successfully integrated the 
acquisitions made during 
2011. The investments in our 
international sales channels 
and the expansion of our 
product portfolio helped each 
of the divisions achieve record 
results.
Peter France
Chief Executive
chief executive’s review
We continue to expand our international 
presence and currently have 22 
manufacturing sites, 61 offices and a further 
63 regional locations in 33 countries 
meaning we now have sales channels in 94 
countries in total. Our customers continue 
to demand operational and product 
excellence. We provide this through focused 
attention on customer satisfaction and 
investment in our people and facilities.
I am pleased to report that our strategy for 
growth has delivered record results. Order 
intake for the year was £539.3m, up 16.8% 
on the previous year. On an organic 
constant currency basis order intake was 
14.4% ahead of 2011.
Revenue was again weighted to the fourth 
quarter and we enjoyed a particularly strong 
end to the year. Revenue for the full year 
was £511.7m, 14.3% up on the prior year. 
Adjusted* operating profit margin was 
25.8%, slightly lower than the 25.9% 
achieved last year but, excluding the impact 
of acquisitions and currency, the adjusted 
margin was 26.0%.
The Company benefits from a diverse 
product portfolio and an extensive 
geographical reach. The industries that we 
serve often have high barriers to entry: for 
example, actuators usually require 
certification and approvals before they can 
be used. They are also mission critical to the 
operations of our customers and, as such, 
investment in the quality and reliability of 
equipment and service is an area of acute 
focus for them.
In 2012 we have seen an increase in orders 
in the oil & gas market, which has been 
driven in part by activity related to shale  
gas discoveries and the subsequent 
investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
projects. The power market has been 
impacted by a slowdown in China and a 
lack of spend in India, although the long 
term need for power generation in these 
countries remains. The water market 
showed signs of growth, such that, even  
in countries such as China, which saw a 
decline in the power market in 2012, Rotork 
was still able to record year-on-year growth.
Through the establishment of Rotork 
Instruments, we have increasingly been 
addressing industry sectors outside of oil & 
gas, power and water. The acquisitions of 
Fairchild in 2011 and Soldo, a switch box 
manufacturer based in Italy, in November 
2012, provide the division with a solid 
platform to build on and we look forward 
to growing the division over time.
We have continued to invest in the 
infrastructure of the business. During 2012 
we opened our new Chennai factory in 
India and in Russia we expanded our facility 
in Moscow and opened a new office in  
St Petersburg. We also opened new facilities 
in São Paulo, Brazil, Jebel Ali, UAE and 
Edmonton, Canada amongst others. We 
have acquired another site in Bath to 
accommodate the growth of the Controls 
division and we will be moving to a new 
facility in Leeds which will house Rotork 
Gears and Rotork UK. Both sites will be  
fully operational by the end of 2013. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

Research and Development
All divisions launched new products during 
2012. We introduced the third generation  
of our ﬂagship IQ range to build on Rotork’s 
position as the premium brand in our 
market by providing our customers with the 
very latest technology. In Controls we also 
launched the complementary Compact 
Modulating Actuator (CMA), which has 
strengthened the Rotork Process Control 
portfolio of electric actuators.
In Rotork Fluid Systems, the investments we 
have made in recent years have resulted in 
the introduction of a number of new 
products, including the latest Gas-over-Oil 
actuator range.
Our spend on R&D increased once again 
this year, up 27% to £7.4m. We continue  
to increase our engineering resources and to 
work on other initiatives which will support 
product launches in 2013 and beyond.
Rotork Site Services (RSS)
Rotork Site Services operates mainly within 
the Rotork Controls and Rotork Fluid 
Systems divisions and focuses mostly on 
preventative maintenance contracts, onsite 
and workshop service and retroﬁt solutions. 
This business continues to grow and 
provides us with the ability to work closely 
with our existing customer base and 
develop relationships which enhance the 
sales opportunities for the full range of 
Rotork products.
We measure RSS’s performance against a 
number of key metrics and the number of 
service engineers is one of these. In the year 
we have increased the number of service 
engineers by 8% and we now have over 
320 service personnel globally. Our products 
are often used in environmentally 
challenging locations and the need for 
certainty of operation means that the 
customer is looking for local service and, 
increasingly, preventative maintenance 
contracts. Rotork now has close to 100,000 
actuators under some form of maintenance 
contract, an increase of 6% over last year.
Our people
One of our aims is for the Company to be 
a great place to work. At the end of 
November we conducted our annual 
Employee Satisfaction Survey and saw the 
response rate increase from 73% to 77%. 
The overall satisfaction score also improved 
to 3.6 from 3.5. All individual questions 
showed an improvement over the prior year, 
reﬂecting the continued effort being made 
throughout the organisation.
2012 was another year of strong growth 
and we welcomed 228 people into the 
Rotork family, 29 joining with the Soldo 
acquisition. With the acquisition of 
Schischek in January we have added a 
further 100 employees and this means that 
we now have approximately 2,800 staff in 
33 countries.
In January 2013 Alan Paine was appointed 
as the ﬁrst Divisional Managing Director of 
Rotork Instruments and we also welcomed 
him to the Rotork Management Board.
Rotork’s success is due to the dedication 
and hard work of our staff. I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank them for 
making Rotork the world-class business  
that it is.
Corporate Social Responsibility
The Rotork Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) framework is embedded in many 
aspects of the way we do business,  
the way we interact with our people and 
the communities in which we are based  
and it is an integral part of our culture.  
The four Sub-Committees of the CSR 
Committee provide the necessary focus on 
the key areas of environment, health and 
safety, ethics and social issues and recognise 
the different disciplines best placed to  
drive these different aspects of CSR. The 
Sub-Committees communicate to teams 
throughout the Group and monitor progress 
against their respective objectives. More 
information regarding the CSR Committee 
and its work is set out on pages 32 to 39.

related duties associated with 
the import, export and 
storage of a varied range of

controls
The launch of the third generation of our 
ﬂagship IQ actuator was the key event of 
2012 for the Controls division. The advances 
in diagnostics and asset management and 
improved local access to that information in 
this latest generation of products keeps the 
IQ range at the forefront of the industry. 
We also launched the Compact Modulating 
Actuator (CMA), a new process control 
actuator range, and a larger size CVA, both 
of which expand our already market leading 
product portfolio.
Revenue grew by 5.5% in the year to 
£293.3m and, with order intake growth  
of 8.7%, the year end order book grew by 
12.8%. Removing the contribution from 
acquisitions and restating 2012 at 2011 
exchange rates, revenue growth was 6.8% 
and order intake growth was 9.3%.  
A 7% weaker euro is the main factor behind 
the currency adjustment with the US dollar 
rate against sterling being similar for both 
years. Adjusted operating proﬁt of £94.8m 
was 2.9% higher than 2011 and the 
resulting margin of 32.3% compares with 
the 33.1% in the prior year. On an organic 
constant currency basis, the increase in 
adjusted operating proﬁt would have been 
5.0% and the margin 32.6%. Whilst 
material costs reduced slightly as a 
proportion of revenue due to our focus on 
sourcing, labour and overhead cost 
increases were ahead of the rate of revenue 
increase. Some of the increased costs were 
directly related to product launches but 
others were due to investment in facilities 
and people to support growth.
2012 saw contrasting activity levels in our 
end-markets. Whilst oil & gas generally has 
been active and we have seen growth, the 
power market was slower. This slowdown  
in power has been most noticeable in India 
and China, where it is our biggest sector, 
and has been inﬂuenced by raw material 
supply and governmental factors. We 
anticipate this to be a relatively short term 
effect as the longer term demand in both 
these countries continues to outstrip current 
supply levels. Despite the softer power 
market, both India and China delivered 
growth as our sales forces focused on other 
end-market opportunities. In oil & gas, 
growth came through a range of countries 
and in different applications: for example, 
the offshore sector in Norway; transmission 
and storage in Russia; and unconventional 
gas ﬁelds in Australia. The Australian 
projects represent a milestone for our 
CVA range. The product’s low power 
requirements, fail-to-position capability  
and accuracy have ensured that they are 
speciﬁed on these remote installations.  
The increase in order book through the year 
was also partially driven by these Australian 
projects as the deliveries are phased over 
many months. In the Americas, our growth 
has been broad-based and we beneﬁted 
from a number of projects in Latin America, 
an active valvemaker base in the US Gulf 
Coast region which is predominantly serving 
export markets, and some activity in US 
water and oil & gas projects. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

  Expansion of footprint
  Integration of Schischek
  New product introductions
Proximity to our customers is important to Rotork’s business model 
and we continue to look for locations where we can increase our 
presence. This proximity ensures that we are able to work more 
closely with customers as they develop their investment plans and 
provide them with better after-sales service and support. During  
the year we opened ﬁve new sales ofﬁces and expanded our ofﬁces 
and workshop facilities in seven others. We also opened our new 
factory in Chennai, India, having completely rebuilt the facility to 
provide a modern factory capable of supporting our growth in this 
important market for many years to come. Many of our production 
facilities serve more than one division, with sales forces often 
cross-selling products from all divisions. We plan to open a number 
of new ofﬁces in 2013, including a presence in north east Australia 
where the market is very active.
The launch of any new product range requires signiﬁcant work not 
only in designing it but also then sourcing the new components. 
Typically there are costs associated with introducing new products 
and at the point of product launch the components are also at their 
most expensive. We continually review our supply base, and as 
volumes grow and the product matures, we have historically been 
able to deliver savings through improvements in sourcing.
The IQ3 has been positively received by our customers. Initially we 
are manufacturing the product in Bath and we will systematically 
rollout production to our other electric actuator manufacturing sites 
during 2013. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

Alex Busby MD Rotork Fluid Systems
ﬂuid systems
Rotork Fluid Systems (RFS) was our fastest 
growing division in 2012. The division 
exceeded our medium term target of 
achieving an adjusted operating margin 
of 15% and our objective is now to sustain 
that performance in future years. RFS 
manufactures a wide range of pneumatic 
and hydraulic emergency shutdown 
actuators mainly for the oil & gas market. 
Oil & gas covers a wide variety of 
applications and RFS beneﬁted from strong 
demand from LNG, gas and liquids pipelines, 
gas storage and offshore projects during the 
year. The integration and development of 
recent acquisitions also played a part in this 
growth – notably in Mexico, where we 
began to deliver actuators on the large 
pipeline project won at the end of 2011,  
and where we also won some signiﬁcant 
service contracts during the year.
Revenue grew 21.4% to a record £160.9m, 
with the second half contribution of £89.5m 
being 12.5% higher than the second half  
of 2011, which had been a record. Revenue 
was less second half weighted this year, 
representing 56% of the annual total 
compared with 60% in 2011. Removing the 
incremental beneﬁt of acquisitions and 
restating revenue at 2011 exchange rates, 
revenue growth would have been 22.6% 
higher. With two key factories based in the 
eurozone and euro weakness being the 
most signiﬁcant driver behind the currency 
headwind in 2012, RFS is the division most 
affected by the currency restatement this 
year in percentage terms. Order intake 
increased by 22.4%, 22.9% on an organic 
constant currency basis, and the order book 
rose 16.5% to £66.5m. 
Adjusted operating proﬁt was a record at 
£24.6m, 44.2% higher than the prior year, 
and would have been £25.8m at 2011 
exchange rates and without the 
contribution from acquisitions. Adjusted 
operating margins were 15.3% and would 
have been 15.9% on an organic constant 
currency basis.
Our target margin was achieved through 
growth in revenue, which has been driven 
by our recent investment in infrastructure. 
This investment has enabled us to ensure 
that as volumes increased, we maintained 
our quality and met our customers’ delivery 
expectations. Our factories in Leeds, UK, 
and Rochester, USA, recorded a strong 
performance, supported by growth of our 
electro-hydraulic products. Our factories in 
Melle, Germany – which mainly supplies the 
German and Russian markets – Lucca, Italy, 
and Flowquip, based in Tulsa, USA, all 
achieved record results. Flowquip serves the 
liquids pipeline market, as well as operating 
as a Centre of Excellence (CoE) for that 
region in the USA. Our CoEs buy actuators 
from our factories and add control systems 
in their local workshops, and these also 
performed well. Our subsidiaries in Australia 
and Russia made the greatest progress in 
the year, with the Middle East, Norway and 
Mexico also growing strongly, albeit from a 
lower base. During the year we opened 
CoEs in Brazil and the Middle East and 
expanded our site in Edmonton, Canada.  Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

In 2013 we plan to extend four facilities and open three new ones, 
including a new ofﬁce in north east Australia, from where we will

base of electro-hydraulic actuators.
We introduced a number of new products during 2012, the most 
signiﬁcant of which was the launch of an updated Gas-over-Oil 
product range that offers a more compact design than its 
predecessor. The R&D team was restructured during the year to 
ensure that dedicated resource is allocated to new product 
development and kept separate from day-to-day applications 
engineering. Both parts of the team are supported by RIDEC (Rotork 
Innovation Design and Engineering Centre) in Chennai, India, which 
works closely with the R&D teams in our factories around the world.
Managing the cost of components, both through engineering 
change and sourcing initiatives, is a continual drive and we were 
successful in generating savings through this process during the 
year. Using our factories in lower cost areas as a base for sourcing 
local expertise has proved beneﬁcial and we will extend this 
initiative to additional product ranges in 2013.

David Littlejohns MD Rotork Gears
gears
Rotork Gears manufactures and sells manual 
and motorised gearboxes and accessories. 
The gearboxes can be used in conjunction 
with actuators and we sell to both the 
Controls and Fluid Systems divisions, as well 
as selling directly to third parties. We have 
been working to increase the level of our 
third-party sales and in 2012 we have made 
further progress in this regard, with around 
three quarters of revenue now generated 
from sales to third-party valve manufacturers. 
Whilst the sales to Rotork offices are often 
driven by project activity, the sales to 
valvemakers are very different in nature.  
The gearbox is effectively a component of 
the valve and, with the majority of valves 
still being manually operated, most require 
a gearbox to provide the necessary 
mechanical advantage to operate the valve. 
All valvemakers therefore need a supply of 
gearboxes and although some make their 
own, our sales proposition is very attractive. 
We provide high quality, reliable gearboxes 
and, by virtue of our scale and buying 
power through our global supply chain, we 
can provide the valve industry with an 
outsourced solution.
Revenue grew 13.5% in the year to £52.9m 
whilst order intake increased 18.9%, 
resulting in a 25.2% increase in order book 
to £9.9m. Each of these is a record for 
Gears. The Prokits acquisition in December 
2011 made a full contribution in the year, 
nearly offsetting the currency headwind for 
the division, with revenue growth on an 
organic constant currency basis of 13.6%. 
Adjusted operating profit for the year was 
£12.1m, 17.0% higher than the prior year, 
delivering an operating margin of 22.9% 
compared with 22.2% last year. Restating 
adjusted operating profit at last year’s 
exchange rates and removing the effect of 
the acquisition increases the operating 
profit to £12.5m and the margin to 23.7%. 
The margin increase derives mainly from 
higher volumes, successful sourcing 
initiatives and a beneficial product mix.
We saw fastest growth in the Chinese and 
US markets, the two territories in which we 
have focused our investment in recent years. 
In China we continued to grow our business 
with existing customers and win new 
accounts so that our Shanghai factory is 
now the largest within the division. The 
increase in Chinese output has helped to 
improve the efficiency of our facility and has 
also increased our buying power with our 
supply base in China. In Houston, USA, our 
customisation centre started to gain traction 
and towards the end of the year we leased 
additional space in the facility. The workshop 
area, shared with Controls and Fluid 
Systems, has been doubled to provide a 
platform for further growth. We also 
increased our sales of subsea gearboxes, 
with our plant in Italy the driving force 
behind this particular market. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

 Relocation of Leeds factory
 New product ranges
 Rotork Valvekits
Amongst our other locations, development of the local supply chain 
in India has proved slower than hoped, which meant that, whilst 
revenue grew strongly, albeit from a low base, it was not at the 
margins anticipated. Work on indigenisation of the supply base is an 
important step for the Indian factory and will also provide a source 
of components to export to other Gears factories. In Russia and 
Japan we have begun to consolidate our relationships with local 
valvemakers and we are now adopting a similar approach in Spain, 
where we continue to make progress. In the UK, our main Gears 
factory will relocate to a larger facility in Leeds during 2013 which 
will be far better suited to its requirements.
The pace of product development has accelerated and is one of the 
reasons behind our creation of a dedicated new product introduction 
team. We launched two completely new manual gearbox ranges and 
expect further new ranges to be introduced during 2013. The Prokits 
acquisition has provided fresh impetus to our UK valve adaption 
business and delivered good growth in the year. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

Alan Paine MD Rotork Instruments
instruments
Rotork Instruments was formed in November 
2011 with the purchase of Fairchild Industrial 
Products and will ultimately contain a number 
of businesses targeted at the wider ﬂow 
control market. The division will be built, at 
least initially, via acquisitions as we look for 
businesses which have products that measure 
and control ﬂow and pressure. These devices 
may work in conjunction with actuators, be 
sold into the same end-markets as actuators, 
or utilise some of the same technology as 
actuators but they will also take us into new 
end-markets. As with our approach in 
actuators, we intend to focus on the high 
quality, high speciﬁcation part of the 
instruments market where certiﬁcation is often 
required and margins are generally higher.
Fairchild is headquartered in Winston-Salem, 
USA, has sales ofﬁces in China, India, Brazil 
and Mexico and sells precision pneumatic 
and electro-pneumatic control products. 
A network of distributors is supported from 
each of these ofﬁces, although there are a 
number of different routes to market and 
a broad range of end-markets. In 2012 the 
Gulf Coast area of the USA performed 
particularly well, supported by an active oil 
& gas sector, which is the division’s largest 
end-market. Despite an unfavourable 
economic backdrop, India and Europe 
were also strong.
In November 2012, we acquired Soldo, 
an Italian based switchbox manufacturer, 
adding a second high quality business to the 
Instruments division. Soldo’s switchboxes 
are used to indicate valve positions, 
sometimes in conjunction with a pneumatic 
or hydraulic actuator, often in hazardous 
environments. They are highly engineered 
products which require certiﬁcation for 
many of the applications and end-markets 
in which they are used.
This was Fairchild’s ﬁrst full year as part of 
Rotork and, as such, we focused heavily on 
integration at all levels. During the year we 
combined the Rotork and Fairchild ofﬁces in 
Chengdu, China, and although now sharing 
a common location, they will continue to be 
run as separate businesses. We also plan to 
relocate Soldo’s USA operation into the 
Winston-Salem facilities during 2013. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

Revenue in the year was £16.4m, including a small contribution 
from Soldo, compared with £1.4m in the prior year, which 
represented only six weeks of Fairchild’s results. The adjusted 
operating margins were 31.1% for the year in total, with both 
businesses generating similar returns. These businesses operate 
on much shorter lead times than the other Rotork divisions and

financial review
2012 set new records in 
order intake, revenue and 
profit, with revenue growth 
of 14.3% which was broadly 
in line with the 14.4% 
compound annual growth 
rate of the last ten years. 
jonathan Davis
Finance Director
The revenue of £511.7m was reduced by  
a £13.4m currency headwind and on a 
constant currency basis revenue would  
have been £525.1m. This includes a £0.7m 
contribution from Soldo, purchased in 
November this year, and a full year from  
the six acquisitions we made in 2011. 
Revenue on an organic constant currency 
basis would have been £503.0m, a 12.3% 
increase compared with 2011.
Adjusted operating profit (stated before the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles) grew 
13.8% to £131.9m, an adjusted operating 
margin of 25.8% compared with the 25.9%  
in 2011. Removing the impact of currency and 
acquisitions only has a small net impact, giving 
adjusted operating profit of £131.0m and a 
margin of 26.0%, the same as the prior year.
Financial items have reversed from a net 
income of £0.6m last year to a net expense 
of £0.3m this year. The most significant 
element of this change is the £0.7m 
reduction in the expected return on the 
assets of the defined benefit pension 
schemes. Adjusted return on sales, which  
is based on profit before tax, has therefore 
reduced from 26.0% to 25.7% but on an 
organic constant currency basis would be 
the same as last year.
One of the key influences on the Group 
margins was the growth of Rotork Fluid 
Systems (RFS). Notwithstanding its 
improvement in margins this year, RFS still 
reports the lowest margins and as the fastest 
growing division this resulted in a change in 
the divisional mix which had a negative 
impact on Group margins. Had the Group’s 
revenue been in the same divisional 
proportions as 2011, Group operating margins 
would have been 50 basis points higher.
Acquisitions
Our screening criteria for an acquisition are 
that it must bring to Rotork a product we do 
not have, improve our access to a geographic 
or end-user market or ideally a combination 
of these. Soldo, now part of our Instruments 
division, was purchased in the year for total 
consideration of £23.1m, of which £9.7m has 
been attributed to intangible assets and 
£14.0m is goodwill. Subsequent to the year 
end, we announced the acquisition of the 
Schischek group of companies for £34.3m. 
Headquartered in Germany, Schischek 
manufactures explosion-proof actuators for 
the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning 
market, where Rotork has historically had 
few direct sales.
As a result of the higher number and value 
of acquisitions this year and last, the 
amortisation charge related to acquired 
intangible assets rose from £3.9m last year 
to £7.4m this year. With the acquisitions 
taking place throughout last year and Soldo 
acquired in November 2012, in order to 
adjust the income statement to show a 
like-for-like period for each acquisition,  
2012 revenue has to be reduced by £22.1m 
and operating profit by £5.1m. Acquisitions 
have been only slightly dilutive in the year 
with an aggregate adjusted operating 
margin of 23.1%. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

* Adjusted is before the amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
Currency
Currency was a stronger headwind in 2012 
and reduced revenue by £13.4m, with the 
weaker euro being the most significant 
element. Whilst the average euro rate was 
7% weaker than the comparative period, 
the US dollar average rate was almost 
identical to 2011. The other currencies 
which affect the Group were also marginally 
weaker. The currency impact is a mix of 
translation and transaction and the £4.2m 
reduction in operating profit is net of any 
benefits gained from the sourcing of 
components from within the eurozone. 
Whilst we manufacture and sell from offices 
based in 33 countries, with 19 different 
currencies, and source components from a 
wide geographic footprint, the Group is still 
a net seller of euros and US dollars. It is the 
net sale of these currencies which we 
principally address through our hedging 
policy, covering up to 75% of trading 
transactions in the next 12 months and  
up to 50% between 12 and 24 months.  
In order to estimate the impact of currency, 
at the current exchange rates we consider 
the effect of a 1 cent movement versus 
sterling. For both euro and US dollar a 1 
cent movement now results in a £350,000 
adjustment to profit.
Return on capital employed (ROCE)
Whilst ROCE remains high due to our 
asset-light business model and high profit 
margins, it has reduced from 74.1% in 2011 
to 62.0% in 2012. The calculation is based 
on the average balance sheet position, 
taking the opening and closing balance 
sheet, so the impact of the acquisition of 
Fairchild and the five other companies in 
2011 is only now fully reflected in the 
capital employed. The intangible assets 
capitalised in accounting for these 
acquisitions, together with the Soldo 
acquisition in 2012, has led to an increase  
in average capital employed from £156.5m 
in 2011 to £212.8m this year end.
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate fell from 
28.6% to 28.1%. This is a blended rate from 
the 25 countries in which we currently pay 
tax and is affected by the mix of where our 
taxable profits are generated, as well as 
changes to the tax rates within those 
jurisdictions. 2011 was the last year to 
benefit from a favourable tax agreement for 
our factory in China but the increase in tax 
there was more than offset by reductions 
elsewhere. The general rate of corporation 
tax in a number of jurisdictions where we 
operate, including the UK, has continued to 
decline. Our philosophy with tax continues to 
be to operate on the basis of full disclosure 
and co-operation with all tax authorities and, 
where possible, mitigate the burden of tax 
within the local legislation.

Cash generation
At the end of the year, net cash was £59.9m, 
an increase of £11.3m during the year. The 
largest cash outflow this year was the 
£37.6m of tax. Whilst the effective tax rate  
in the income statement may be lower, the 
higher profits in 2011 and then again in 
2012, combined with a change in the phasing 
of payments, led to the higher rate of 
increase in tax paid. No additional dividends 
were paid this year so total dividends paid  
in the year are lower than 2011 at £33.9m 
compared with £49.5m, which included 
£19.9m of additional dividends. Acquisition 
spend of £20.9m was predominantly the 
Soldo purchase in November but also 
includes deferred consideration on some  
of the 2011 acquisitions.
Our cash generation KPI improved from 
89.6% last year to 95.4%. Management of 
working capital has the greatest influence 
on this KPI and in 2012 it improved. 
Working capital as a function of revenue 
was 25.5% compared with 27.0% in 2011. 
Inventory and trade receivables both 
increased at a slower rate than revenue and 
debtor days reduced by one to 56 days’ 
sales outstanding.
Credit management
The Group’s credit risk is primarily 
attributable to trade receivables, with the 
risk spread over a large number of countries 
and customers, and no significant 
concentration of risk. Credit worthiness 
checks are undertaken before entering into 
contracts or commencing trade with new 
customers. The majority of our trade 
receivables are insured, so the authorisation 
process operates in conjunction with the 
insurer, taking advantage of their market 
intelligence. Where appropriate, we will use 
trade finance instruments such as letters of 
credit to mitigate any identified risk.
Treasury
The Group operates a centralised treasury 
function managed by a Treasury Committee 
comprising the Chief Executive, Finance 
Director, Group Legal Director, Group 
Financial Controller and Group Treasurer. 
The Committee meets regularly to consider 
foreign currency exposure, control over 
deposits and cash management. The Group 
Treasurer monitors compliance with the 
treasury policies and is responsible for 
overseeing all the Group’s banking 
relationships. A Subsidiary Treasury Policy 
restricts the actions subsidiaries can take 
and the Group Treasury Policy and Terms of 
Reference define the responsibilities of the 
Group Treasurer and Treasury Committee. 
The Group uses financial instruments where 
appropriate to hedge significant currency 
transactions, principally forward exchange 
contracts and swaps. These financial 
instruments are used to reduce volatility which 
might affect the Group’s cash or income 
statement. In assessing the level of cash flows 
to hedge with forward exchange contracts, 
the maximum cover taken is 75% of forecast 
flows. The Board receives monthly treasury 
reports which summarise the Group’s foreign 
currency hedging position, distribution of cash 
balances and significant changes to any 
banking relationships.
In January 2013 we established a £15m 
one year committed facility in order to 
part-finance the acquisition of Schischek. 
Whilst the Group as a whole will remain  
in a net cash position, this facility provides 
flexibility regarding the location of cash 
deposits and timing of receipts, and is in 
addition to uncommitted overdraft facilities 
the Group has in a number of countries.
Dividends
The directors are proposing a 16.9% increase 
in the final dividend to 26.6p per share. 
When taken together with the 16.4p interim 
dividend paid in September, this represents  
a 15.4% increase in core dividends over the 
prior year. This gives core dividend cover of 
2.4 times (2011: 2.5 times). Our dividend 
policy is to grow the core dividends generally 
inline with earnings and supplement core 
dividends with additional dividends when  
the Board consider it appropriate to do so. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

Retirement benefits
The Group accounts for post-retirement 
benefits in accordance with IAS19, 
Employee Benefits. The balance sheet 
reflects the net deficit on these schemes  
at 31 December based on the market value 
of the assets at that date, and the valuation 
of liabilities using year end AA corporate 
bond yields. We have closed both the main 
defined benefit pension schemes to new 
entrants; the UK scheme in 2003 and the 
US one in 2009, in order to reduce the risk 
of volatility of the Group’s liabilities.
Following agreement of the March 2010 
actuarial valuation for the UK scheme, a 
deficit funding plan was agreed which 
would eliminate the shortfall by March 
2015. This plan included the payment of 
£3.3m of past deficit contributions during 
2011, £7.3m in 2012 and £1.7m in 2013. 
The next triennial actuarial valuation is due 
in March 2013. Despite these higher UK 
contributions, the funding level of the 
schemes remained at 81% at the year end, 
the same as it had been at December 2011 
which now equates to a £28.7m shortfall. 
Whilst the return on assets exceeded 
expectations, discount rates have reduced 
once again, driving up the current value of 
future liabilities. The mortality assumptions 
were updated in 2010 to reflect the latest 
data from occupational pension schemes 
and these tables are again applied this year.
The amendment to IAS19 Employee benefits 
will impact the Group’s 2013 financial 
statements. The principal change relates to 
the requirement to use the schemes’ 
discount rate to calculate the return on 
assets rather than using a rate of return 
appropriate to the various asset classes.  
This change is expected to reduce the 
income generated by the schemes’ assets  
by around £0.8m in 2013.

Financial KPIs
Growth of the business, quality of earnings and efﬁcient use of resources are crucial 
target areas for Rotork and we have a number of measures of performance used 
throughout Rotork aimed at monitoring this. The KPIs used to monitor the ﬁnancial 
performance of the business are set out below.
key performance indicators
Reasons for choice
This is reported in detail for 
operating segments and is a key 
driver in the business.  
This measure enables us to track 
our overall success in speciﬁc 
project activity and our progress 
in increasing our market share 
by products and region.
Reasons for choice
This measure brings together 
the combined effects of 
procurement costs and pricing 
as well as the leverage of our 
operating assets. It is also a 
check on the quality of revenue 
growth but is heavily inﬂuenced 
by divisional mix.
Reasons for choice
This is used as a measure of 
performance where a target of 
85% is regarded as a base level 
of achievement.  
Cash generation is also one of 
the constituent parts of the 
senior management reward 
system.
Reasons for choice
Rotork has an asset-light 
business model by design and 
reporting this ratio internally 
helps management at Group 
level monitor our adherence to 
this philosophy.
Reasons for choice
The measurement of earnings 
per share (EPS) reﬂects all 
aspects of the income 
statement including 
management of the Group’s 
tax rate.
Reasons for choice
The Accident Frequency Rate 
(AFR) is used as one measure of 
the effectiveness of our health 
and safety procedures.
Reasons for choice
This KPI measures the 
proportion of total waste 
produced which is recycled.
Reasons for choice
The survey as a whole enabled 
the Group to get feedback from 
across the businesses on how 
we relate to our staff and what 
we can do better.
How we calculate
Increase in sales revenue year on 
year divided by the earlier year 
sales revenue.
How we calculate
Adjusted proﬁt before tax* 
(after ﬁnancing and interest) 
shown as a percentage of sales 
revenue.
How we calculate
Cash ﬂow from operating 
activities before tax outﬂows 
and the pension charge to cash 
adjustment as a percentage of 
adjusted operating proﬁt*.
How we calculate
Adjusted operating proﬁt* as a 
percentage of average capital 
employed. Capital employed is 
deﬁned as shareholders’ funds 
less net cash held, with the 
pension fund deﬁcit net of 
related deferred tax asset added 
back. The calculation is shown 
on page 105.
How we calculate
Increase in adjusted basic EPS 
(based on adjusted proﬁt after 
tax*) year on year divided by the 
earlier year adjusted basic EPS.
How we calculate
The formula we have used for 
calculating our AFR is the 
number of reportable injuries 
divided by the number of hours 
worked multiplied by 100,000.
How we calculate
This information is collected 
through regular submissions 
into our main UK site in Bath.
How we calculate
Employees scored their 
responses directly into a 
prepared survey with 1 being 
very dissatisﬁed and 5 being 
very satisﬁed.
Comments on results
We grew revenue by 14.3% 
despite some markets and some 
important geographies growing 
at a slower rate. The positive 
impact of acquisitions was 
partially offset by a currency 
headwind, organic constant 
currency growth being 12.3%.
Comments on results
The reduction is a result of 
lower returns on pension 
scheme assets and the faster 
growth in the divisions with 
lower return on sales being 
offset by the improvements 
made in the Fluid System and 
Gears divisions return on sales.
Comments on results
Cash generation remains above 
target and working capital as a 
function of sales has reduced 
during the year from 27.0% to 
25.5%.
Comments on results
Average capital employed has 
risen by 36% because the 2011 
acquisitions are now reﬂected in 
both the opening and closing 
balance sheets. This KPI remains 
at sector leading levels.
Comments on results
Adjusted basic EPS has 
increased ahead of proﬁt before 
tax due to a reduced effective 
tax rate arising from a lower tax 
rate in the UK and the 
international mix of where our 
proﬁts were generated.
Comments on results
The investment in training to 
create a number of specialists 
and the improvements arising 
through the audit process have 
helped raise awareness of safe 
working practices. Training will 
continue as we aim to reduce 
this KPI further.
Comments on results
Further improvements are 
becoming harder to achieve but 
the results this year are just 
ahead of the previous year. 
Focus remains on those 
locations where recycling is yet 
to be as fully adopted.
Comments on results
We had a record number of 
respondents this year and the 
response rate rose to 77%. The 
scores relating to satisfaction 
with the bonus scheme, 
effective supervision and 
feedback and that Rotork values 
its employees showed the 
greatest improvement.

Non-ﬁnancial KPIs
We monitor non-ﬁnancial areas in our businesses particularly in the environmental, 
health and safety and quality control areas and put strong emphasis within our 
organisation on improving our performance here.
key performance indicators
Reasons for choice
This is reported in detail for 
operating segments and is a key 
driver in the business.  
This measure enables us to track 
our overall success in speciﬁc 
project activity and our progress 
in increasing our market share 
by products and region.
Reasons for choice
This measure brings together 
the combined effects of 
procurement costs and pricing 
as well as the leverage of our 
operating assets. It is also a 
check on the quality of revenue 
growth but is heavily inﬂuenced 
by divisional mix.
Reasons for choice
This is used as a measure of 
performance where a target of 
85% is regarded as a base level 
of achievement.  
Cash generation is also one of 
the constituent parts of the 
senior management reward 
system.
Reasons for choice
Rotork has an asset-light 
business model by design and 
reporting this ratio internally 
helps management at Group 
level monitor our adherence to 
this philosophy.
Reasons for choice
The measurement of earnings 
per share (EPS) reﬂects all 
aspects of the income 
statement including 
management of the Group’s 
tax rate.
Reasons for choice
The Accident Frequency Rate 
(AFR) is used as one measure of 
the effectiveness of our health 
and safety procedures.
Reasons for choice
This KPI measures the 
proportion of total waste 
produced which is recycled.
Reasons for choice
The survey as a whole enabled 
the Group to get feedback from 
across the businesses on how 
we relate to our staff and what 
we can do better.
How we calculate
Increase in sales revenue year on 
year divided by the earlier year 
sales revenue.
How we calculate
Adjusted proﬁt before tax* 
(after ﬁnancing and interest) 
shown as a percentage of sales 
revenue.
How we calculate
Cash ﬂow from operating 
activities before tax outﬂows 
and the pension charge to cash 
adjustment as a percentage of 
adjusted operating proﬁt*.
How we calculate
Adjusted operating proﬁt* as a 
percentage of average capital 
employed. Capital employed is 
deﬁned as shareholders’ funds 
less net cash held, with the 
pension fund deﬁcit net of 
related deferred tax asset added 
back. The calculation is shown 
on page 105.
How we calculate
Increase in adjusted basic EPS 
(based on adjusted proﬁt after 
tax*) year on year divided by the 
earlier year adjusted basic EPS.
How we calculate
The formula we have used for 
calculating our AFR is the 
number of reportable injuries 
divided by the number of hours 
worked multiplied by 100,000.
How we calculate
This information is collected 
through regular submissions 
into our main UK site in Bath.
How we calculate
Employees scored their 
responses directly into a 
prepared survey with 1 being 
very dissatisﬁed and 5 being 
very satisﬁed.
Comments on results
We grew revenue by 14.3% 
despite some markets and some 
important geographies growing 
at a slower rate. The positive 
impact of acquisitions was 
partially offset by a currency 
headwind, organic constant 
currency growth being 12.3%.
Comments on results
The reduction is a result of 
lower returns on pension 
scheme assets and the faster 
growth in the divisions with 
lower return on sales being 
offset by the improvements 
made in the Fluid System and 
Gears divisions return on sales.
Comments on results
Cash generation remains above 
target and working capital as a 
function of sales has reduced 
during the year from 27.0% to 
25.5%.
Comments on results
Average capital employed has 
risen by 36% because the 2011 
acquisitions are now reﬂected in 
both the opening and closing 
balance sheets. This KPI remains 
at sector leading levels.
Comments on results
Adjusted basic EPS has 
increased ahead of proﬁt before 
tax due to a reduced effective 
tax rate arising from a lower tax 
rate in the UK and the 
international mix of where our 
proﬁts were generated.
Comments on results
The investment in training to 
create a number of specialists 
and the improvements arising 
through the audit process have 
helped raise awareness of safe 
working practices. Training will 
continue as we aim to reduce 
this KPI further.
Comments on results
Further improvements are 
becoming harder to achieve but 
the results this year are just 
ahead of the previous year. 
Focus remains on those 
locations where recycling is yet 
to be as fully adopted.
Comments on results
We had a record number of 
respondents this year and the 
response rate rose to 77%. The 
scores relating to satisfaction 
with the bonus scheme, 
effective supervision and 
feedback and that Rotork values 
its employees showed the 
greatest improvement. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

statement of principal risks 
and uncertainties
The assessment and management of risk is the responsibility of the 
Board, and the development and execution of a comprehensive and 
robust system of risk management is a high priority in Rotork. This 
is based on an established process for the identification and 
management of risk, first at divisional board level, and then for the 
Group as a whole. Rotork works within the governance framework 
set out in our corporate governance statement, see page 46.
The Board’s role in risk management involves promoting a culture 
that emphasises integrity at all levels of business operations. This 
includes ensuring that risk management is embedded within the core 
processes of the Group, determining the principle risks, (and ensuring 
that these are communicated effectively across the businesses) and 
setting the overall policies for risk management and control.
The Group Finance Director is responsible for risk management within 
the Group and leads the development of the risk management 
process and the tools used. The Board approves appetite for risk at 
both Group and divisional level and the consequential actions in 
terms of mitigation where possible and appropriate.
The processes of risk management within the businesses involve:
•	 Identification and regular assessment of individual risks at both 
subsidiary and divisional level;
•	 Reviewing previously identified risks and the effectiveness of 
mitigation where appropriate;
•	 Design of controls to mitigate identified risks; 
•	 Testing the controls through management review and internal 
audit; and
•	 Forming a conclusion on the effectiveness of the control 
environment in place.
The major risks affecting the Group are first identified and considered 
by the divisional boards during their regular meetings. Once a risk has 
been identified, it is allocated to one of the directors to ensure the 
risk is appropriately considered and the risk is managed. Risks are 
categorised by likelihood and potential impact on the business, and 
once the assessment matrix is completed by each division, the risks 
are then aggregated and re-evaluated in relation to the Group as a 
whole. Identified risks are discussed and the progress reviewed at 
both Rotork Management Board and divisional board meetings 
during the year. Senior management, in association with the full 
Board of Directors, meets twice a year to consider the Group risk 
matrix and progress with mitigating actions. The external Auditor is 
invited to attend one of the meetings each year.
This is an ongoing process involving regular assessment of the risks, 
with clear and consistent procedures for monitoring, updating and 
implementing appropriate controls to manage the identified risks. 
We are therefore confident that we have a methodology for 
ensuring that the Group’s approach to dealing with individual risks 
is robust and timely. 
We identify three main risk areas: 
Strategic – Risks that potentially could affect the strategic aims of 
the business, or those issues that could affect the strategic 
objectives that the Group is addressing;
Operational – Risks arising out of the operational activities of the 
Group relating to areas such as logistics, procurement, product 
development and interaction with commercial partners; and
Financial – Issues that could affect the finances of the business 
both externally from matters initially outside of our control, and 
from the perspective of internal controls and processes.
The risks considered during the process cover all aspects of the 
Group’s activities and include environmental and ethical risks as 
well as product, competitor, reputational or financial risks but not 
all of these areas are represented in the top 10 risks which are listed 
opposite. These are categorised by the three main risk areas 
identified above. Mitigation, where possible, is shown for each risk 
area identified. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

STRATEGIC RISKS
Description Potential Impact Mitigation
Competition on price as a 
result of an existing competitor 
moving to manufacture in a 
lower cost area of the world.
Where a competitor decides to use cost savings to reduce 
their selling prices, this could lead to a reduction in the 
general market price. Rotork might need to respond to a 
change in market price levels whilst still maintaining the 
price premium currently enjoyed for some products.
Rotork already has a direct presence, in terms of 
production, sales and service support, in the major low 
cost locations. There is a constant drive to maintain 
differentiation from the competition both in terms of the 
quality of our products and of the service we provide.
Not having the appropriate 
products, either in terms of 
features or costs.
In order to be able to compete on a project, our products 
must meet both the necessary specification and pricing 
level. A failure on either count could harm our competitive 
position.
Development of products to meet required specifications 
is an ongoing activity as is the drive to take cost out of our 
products to meet target pricing levels.
Lower investment in Rotork’s 
traditional market sectors.
A reduction in capital or maintenance expenditure in one 
of Rotork’s key market sectors would result in a smaller 
addressable market, which in turn could lead to a 
reduction in revenue from that sector.
Identification of new markets takes place in each location 
and is coordinated at divisional level. This is supported by 
product development and innovation to address new 
markets and new applications in existing markets. At a 
Group level our geographic and end-market diversification 
provides resilience to a reduction in any one area or market.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
Description Potential Impact Mitigation
Major in field product failure 
arising from a component 
defect or warranty issue which 
might require a product recall.
Replacement of defective components or complete units 
would give rise to a direct financial cost but there would 
also be a reputational risk. 
A comprehensive set of quality control procedures 
operates over suppliers. These include supplier visits, 
audits and a scorecard system to measure their 
performance. In some markets legislation determines that 
this risk is entirely passed to the end-user.
Failure of a key supplier or a 
tooling failure at a supplier 
causing disruption to planned 
manufacturing.
Where customer delivery expectations are not met, this 
could lead to financial penalties and damage customer 
relationships.
Dual sourcing for key components wherever possible with 
regular monitoring and replacement of tooling at all 
suppliers. Maintaining inventory levels sufficient to protect 
against short term disruption.
Failure of an acquisition to 
deliver the growth or synergies 
anticipated, due to incorrect 
assumptions or changing 
market conditions, or failure to 
integrate an acquisition to 
ensure compliance with 
Rotork’s policies and 
procedures.
Whilst growth opportunities, cost savings and synergies 
are identified prior to completion, these may not always 
be delivered at the levels anticipated or to the timetable 
expected.
During the due diligence process and preparation of the 
100 day plan, consideration is given to the composition 
and skills of the management team. Training and support 
is provided by a variety of Rotork personnel to ensure 
effective integration and communication of Rotork’s 
policies and procedures, whilst monitoring delivery of the 
financial plan.
Failure of the centralised IT 
environment, or other loss or 
theft of data.
Commercially sensitive data is stored and transmitted 
electronically. The Group is therefore exposed to the risk 
of data loss, either maliciously or unintentionally.
The Group has one centrally hosted Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) system covering the manufacturing sites and 
is in the process of rolling out a new ERP system which will 
ultimately be used worldwide.
A wide range of security, back up and contingency 
measures are in place to protect against these risks. With 
the increased centralisation of IT, a more robust disaster 
recovery environment is under development and will be in 
place before a material number of companies utilise the 
new ERP system.
FINANCIAL RISKS
Description Potential Impact Mitigation
Volatility of exchange rates. Significant fluctuations in exchange rates could have an 
adverse impact on Rotork’s reported results.
A clear treasury hedging policy addresses short term risk 
and this works together with the natural hedging 
provided by the geographical spread of operations, 
sourcing and customers.
Political instability in a key
end-market.
Disruption of normal business activity would impact our 
sales in that country and might ultimately leads to loss of 
any assets located in that country as well.
The wide geographic spread of Rotork’s operations and 
customers diminishes the impact of any one market. 
Defined benefit pension 
scheme deficit.
The amount of the deficit may be adversely affected by a 
number of factors including investment returns, long term 
interest rates, price inflation and members’ longevity. This 
in turn might lead to a requirement for the Company to 
increase cash contributions to the schemes.
Both defined benefit schemes are closed to new 
members, with the UK scheme closed in January 2003. 
The Group and Trustees monitor the performance of the 
scheme regularly, taking actuarial and investment advice 
as appropriate. The results of these reviews are discussed 
by the Board. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

The Group believes that responsible business is the best 
business. It can benefit our operational effectiveness, 
develop our industry leading products, grow our business 
and build on the trust of our stakeholders.
WHY DOES CORPORATE SOCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY MATTER TO ROTORK?
Sustainability lies at the heart of the Group’s 
commitment to corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) and it represents a valuable opportunity 
to ensure that the Group continues to be 
successful in the long term. For these reasons, 
the Group endeavours to entrench CSR across 
all its processes and ways of working.
The Group’s approach to CSR is focused 
around four main themes:
The Environment
The environmental programme, described in 
more detail on pages 32 to 35, benefits the 
Group in a number of ways including 
ensuring compliance with legal requirements 
in all territories in which the Group operates, 
achieving cost savings by reducing waste and 
resource consumption, and reducing 
emissions which contributes to sustaining the 
environments in which the Group operates.
Ethics and values
The Group looks to conduct business in an 
honest and ethical manner at all times. High 
standards of ethics and values are important 
to the Group because they help to foster an 
open and honest culture which contributes to 
the effectiveness of our people, allowing us to 
attract, motivate and retain talent, build on 
the trust of our stakeholders and to enhance 
and protect our reputation. Furthermore, 
behaving ethically and honestly, for example 
by taking a zero tolerance approach to bribery 
and corruption, contributes to improving 
standards in markets around the world which 
will help nurture and grow these markets. 
More details of the Group’s ethics and values 
can be found on pages 35 to 37.
Health and Safety
The Group’s employees are essential to the 
success of its business. Providing a safe 
working environment is paramount and by 
ensuring our people are safe we enhance 
the effectiveness of our workforce by 
mitigating the risk of injury and reducing 
costs associated with employee illness or 
injury. The Group’s approach to health and 
safety can be found on pages 37 to 38.
Community Involvement
The Group’s asset-light, assembly only 
manufacturing model means that we do not 
significantly disrupt local communities where 
we are based. Nevertheless, we recognise 
that we operate in a wide number of 
territories around the world and that our 
operations have some impact on the 
communities within these territories. 
Furthermore, the Group’s employees, 
customers and suppliers are often members 
of these communities and often these 
businesses are run by local people. An 
outcome of this engagement is to ensure 
that the Group continues to be welcomed  
in the communities it works in and this 
contributes to the sustainability of its 
operations. Local causes are supported 
through each location having its own charity 
committee focused on its local community. 
More details on community involvement can 
be found on pages 38 to 39.
The Group recognises that shareholders are 
becoming increasingly focused on CSR 
issues and take into account the Guidelines 
on Social Responsibility issued by the 
Association of British Insurers. The Group 
has been a member of the UN Global 
Compact since 2003 and continues to be 
included in the FTSE4Good index where we 
maintain an above average score in the 
global rankings, UK rankings and industry 
sector rankings.
The Group believes that the approach it 
takes to CSR, as set out in this report,  
helps to meet the expectations of our 
stakeholders and contributes to the success 
of our corporate strategy by promoting an 
effective and sustainable business.
The Chief Executive reports to the Board on 
CSR progress. The Chief Executive chairs the 
CSR Committee, a management committee, 
which has four sub-committees with each 
representing one of the aspects of CSR 
described above. Presentations are given by 
the Chairmen of the four sub-committees 
to the Board on activity and progress in 
their areas of CSR during the year.

The Group considers climate change and 
other environmental risks but given the 
Group’s business model, it considers the 
overall risk to the environment from the 
Group’s activities to be relatively low. The 
Group notes the following operational risks:
•	 EU Registration, Evaluation and 
Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) 
legislation. As a downstream user the 
Group relies on the manufacturers of 
chemicals and preparations for the 
continuing availability of its products. 
We continuously monitor the chemicals 
and preparations used; and
•	 EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances 
in Electrical and Electronic Equipment 
Directive (RoHS 2). The Group’s 
electronic products will need to comply 
with RoHS 2 by 2017. We are evaluating 
our products, systems and procedures in 
light of RoHS 2 and taking action as 
necessary to ensure compliance.
The Group’s environmental legal compliance 
activities include:
•	 Waste Packaging (Producers Obligation) 
Regulations 2007 – Rotork is a member 
of the Clarity compliance scheme;
•	 Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment Regulations 2006 (WEEE) – 
Rotork is a member of the Clarity-WEEE 
compliance scheme;
•	 Waste Battery and Accumulator 
Regulations 2009 – Rotork is registered 
as a small battery producer; and
•	 Where regulated use of licensed waste 
carriers for the removal of all types of 
waste from Rotork facilities – our waste 
goes to licensed treatment facilities.
Group Environmental Policy  
and Procedures
The Group’s environmental policy applies 
to the Company and all its subsidiaries 
worldwide. The policy includes 
commitments to the prevention of 
pollution, compliance with all relevant legal 
and regulatory requirements and to the 
continuous improvement of environmental 
performance. The policy was revised in 
September 2012. The Group’s 
environmental policy can be found at  
www.rotork.com in the investors section 
under Corporate Social Responsibility - 
Environment.
Separate policies define the Company’s 
expectations on a number of environmental 
issues such as recycling and water use. 
Some Rotork businesses, which operate in 
regions that have fewer environmental 
facilities available (for example, recycling 
facilities), can present challenges but it is 
Rotork’s expectation that our environmental 
policies are implemented consistently across 
the Group.
Operational control procedures are in place 
to manage a range of environmental 
activities such as the generation and 
disposal of hazardous waste, storage and 
use of oil and volatile organic compounds 
(VOC), and the maintenance of air 
conditioning equipment. Where 
appropriate, emergency plans are produced 
and communicated effectively to manage 
and control potential incidents which may 
pollute, such as oil spills.
Systems are in place to monitor environmental 
performance across the Group. This report 
sets out performance summaries of:
•	 Energy consumption;
•	 Waste generation and recycling 
(including hazardous waste); and
•	 Water consumption.
Data on VOC and refrigerants (HFC) is also 
recorded and reported in the Environmental 
Report, available from the investors section 
of the Rotork website under Corporate 
Social Responsibility - Environment. A full 
brief of Group environmental performance 
is given at quarterly CSR Committee 
meetings where actions are documented 
and progress reviewed at the next meeting.
This year’s report encompasses more data 
than before as more locations, including 
recent acquisitions, report their 
environmental performance.
A more detailed report of environmental 
performance for the year ending 31 
December 2012 will be given in the 
Environmental Report, to be published on 
the Rotork website in April 2013. A copy 
of our Environmental Report containing 
2011 performance data can be found at 
www.rotork.com in the investors section 
under Corporate Social Responsibility - 
Environment.
Progress
Energy Consumption
Rotork operates an assembly only philosophy 
in all but four of our business units and we 
rely on specialist suppliers for most of our 
manufactured components and assemblies. 
In all facilities energy is used for IT systems, 
lighting, heating and cooling. Exceptions 
are the Group’s operations in Losser, 
Netherlands, Falun, Sweden, Mansfield, 
UK and Winston-Salem, USA where some 
machine processes are in operation. In other 
locations test equipment is used to ensure 
the product meets customer operational 
requirements which can consume large 
amounts of energy for short periods of time 
when in use. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

Consumption of electricity, gas and steam is 
calculated using utility invoices. Liquified 
petroleum gas (LPG) and oil is calculated 
using sales invoices.
2012 Energy Consumption Performance 
Summary and 2013 Targets
•	 On a like for like basis, energy 
consumption increased 10% compared 
with 2011, slightly below the rate of 
organic revenue increase. With the 
inclusion of new reporting companies 
this year, the overall increase was 24%;
•	 The expansion of the Group’s facility in 
Shanghai, China and the new plant in 
Chennai, India contributed significantly to 
the increase in business activity with small 
fluctuations in climate conditions at some 
facilities also contributing to the increase.
Waste Generation and Recycling
Waste generation includes packaging waste 
(card, wood and plastic), metal waste 
(ferrous and non-ferrous), hazardous 
materials (paint waste, oils and adhesives), 
batteries and waste electrical electronic 
equipment.
The Group’s policy is to recycle wherever 
possible. We have installed recycling 
equipment (such as balers and wood 
crushers) at a number of our high volume 
locations. To ensure suppliers also play their 
part we have introduced our own minimum 
packaging standards for suppliers.
As the number of reporting locations 
increases, the amount of waste recycled 
continues to rise.
2012 Waste Generation and Recycling 
Performance Summary 
•	 Waste generation increased by 12% to 
2,572 tonnes;
•	 Recycling increased by 13% to 1,981 tonnes;
•	 Waste recycling KPI (the percentage of 
recycled waste against total waste) was 
77%, exceeding the 2012 target of 76%.
The 2012 Recycling & Waste Generation 
Performance figures include data from 
locations which operate in regions where 
recycling facilities are in their infancy or not 
available.
Waste recycling has been one of the 
Group’s published KPIs since they were 
introduced in 2008. We have made 
considerable progress over this time and 
whilst the drive to maintain these high levels 
of recycling will continue and will be 
reported in the Environmental Report, this 
KPI will be replaced by a carbon emissions 
KPI in the Group KPIs for 2013.
Water Consumption
Water consumption is measured across the 
Group. For the majority of Rotork locations 
water consumption derives from normal 
operation and sanitary use. The exception 
to this is Winston-Salem, USA, where 
processes involving higher volumes of water 
are in operation.
2012 Water Consumption Performance 
Summary
•	 Water consumption in 2012 increased by 
55% against 2011 results;
•	 The Winston-Salem site in the USA, a 
recent acquisition, accounts for 61% of 
the increase; 
•	 Chennai, India, where the Group has 
opened a new manufacturing and research 
facility, accounts for 20% of the increase;
•	 Bath, UK, where there has been an 
increase in product testing, accounts for 
8% of the increase; 
•	 Lucca, Italy, where there has been an 
increase in product testing, accounts for 
6% of the increase.
The balance of the increase is a result of 
fluctuations in normal usage and the 
inclusion of performance data from new 
acquisitions. Water consumption in 
Winston-Salem is under review and the 
results of that review will be published in 
the 2012 Environmental Report.

facilities to reduce business travel.
Business travel data for 2011 was incomplete 
as systems were being established to capture 
the data in some locations. Therefore the 
2012 data will be used as the baseline year 
for business travel data. More detailed 
information on business travel will be 
published in the Group’s 2012 Environmental 
Report which will be available to download 
from the Rotork website.
Carbon Emissions
The Group measures and calculates Scope 
1, 2 and 3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) 
and publishes the results through the 
Carbon Disclosure Project and in the 
Environmental Report.
•	 The Group’s Scope 1 GHG emissions 
derive from the consumption of gas, 
liquified petroleum gas, oil and through 
business travel and the transport of 
goods via Rotork owned vehicles; 
•	 The Group’s Scope 2 GHG emissions 
derive from the consumption of 
electricity and steam;
•	 The Group’s Scope 3 GHG emissions 
derive from the materials used in: the 
product; supply chain emissions; travel 
between the supply chain and Rotork;  
and other business travel not included in  
Scope 1 emissions. The project to calculate 
‘cradle to gate’ emissions, that is emissions 
from the extraction of minerals in the 
ground (cradle) to when the products leave 
the Group’s manufacturing facilities (gate), 
for all current products is 80% complete. 
However, further work on electronic 
components across all products is needed 
before the publication of any results.
Three teams from Rotork climbed the Pen-y-Fan 
Horseshoe in the Brecon Beacons for WaterAid.
Tom Whittingham from Rotork Bath, UK, took 
part in the Cardiff half marathon and raised over 
£1,300 for ME Research with a further £250 
from Rotork’s Charity Committee.
The Group calculates GHG emissions in 
accordance with the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol (GHG Protocol) developed jointly 
by the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development and the World 
Resource Institute.
Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions are 
calculated in accordance with the GHG 
Protocol using conversion factors published 
by the US Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA), The Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the 
International Energy Agency (IEA).
All Scope 2 GHG emissions have been 
calculated using the relevant conversion factor 
for the territory where energy was used or 
consumed based on the mix of coal, oil, gas, 
hydroelectric or nuclear generation.
All Scope 3 GHG emissions relating to travel 
are calculated using conversion factors 
published by DEFRA in August 2011.
2012 Carbon Emissions Performance 
Summary and 2013 Targets
The following summary excludes supply 
chain emissions.
•	 Operational emissions for 2012 increased 
by 16% on a like for like basis or 29% in 
total when acquisitions are included:
•	 Scope 1 emissions increased by 14%; 
•	 Scope 2 emissions increased by 37%.
New acquisitions accounted for 46% of the 
increase in emissions with the balance of 
the increase resulting from increased 
business activity.
Energy efficiency is an area in which the 
Group intends to focus greater attention. 
For 2013, the Group will introduce a new 
carbon emissions KPI as one of the Group’s 
reported non-financial KPIs. Our target is to 
reduce our carbon emissions as a function 
of revenue by 10% between now and 2017. 
Work will start this year and include 
completing studies at our larger sites and 
whilst the measured progress may be 
modest in 2013, momentum will build over 
the five year time period.
ETHICS AND vALUES
Overview
Ethics and values are central to the way we 
do business. The Group’s Ethics and Values 
Statement can be viewed on our website in a 
number of languages. Ethics and values can 
be split into four strands:
•	 Human rights and ethical business:
The Group is fully committed to respecting 
internationally proclaimed human rights as 
defined in the International Declaration of 
Human Rights and the International 
Labour Organisation’s standards. The 
Group does not accept any form of child 
or forced labour and embracing the UN 
Global Compact principles throughout the 
business is a demonstration of this 
commitment.
The Group recognises that an open and 
honest culture is key to understanding 
concerns within the business and to 
uncover and investigate any potential 
wrongdoing. In 2012, the Group 
substantively approved a refreshed and 
updated whistleblowing policy and an 
independent external whistleblowing 
hotline, both of which will be introduced 
in 2013.
•	 Employees:
We have a firm commitment to all our 
employees regarding safety and 
development. Rotork has an objective and 
fair recruitment process, which promotes 
equal opportunities across the Group 
inline with the global ‘Respect at Work 
and Equality of Opportunity’ policy. The 
Group’s offices in Bath, UK, and 
Parabiago, Italy, have employee forums 
where employees can raise issues to be 
dealt with by management. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

schemes for young men and women 
which help to increase access into all 
aspects of the Group’s business.

ethicsvalues)
•	 Bribery and corruption:
The Group has a zero tolerance policy on 
bribery and corruption worldwide, 
irrespective of country or business 
culture. The Group’s Ethics and Values 
statement states that our employees will 
never offer, pay or solicit bribes in any 
form and is published on the Group’s 
website in a number of languages: 
The Group does not make political 
contributions in cash or kind anywhere 
in the world. 
The Group’s whistleblowing policy gives 
whistleblowers a platform to alert senior 
management to any suspected bribery or 
corruption, which is available to 
download from the Rotork website.
The Group also makes use of detailed 
background checks provided by specialist 
bribery and corruption due diligence 
consultants before it deals with 
unknown third parties (including agents, 
prospective acquisitions and suppliers) 
which are operating in higher risk 
jurisdictions or market sectors. The 
Group makes use of objective guidance 
on country risk, such as the Corruption 
Perception Index by Transparency 
International, to help assess potential 
risks in this area. When working with the 
unknown third party, and after the initial 
detailed background checks, the Group 
also continually screens these third 
parties against a large number of 
international sources which could detect 
unethical behaviour including watchlists, 
sanctions lists and the media using its 
due diligence consultants’ proprietary 
database. This database is also used in 
situations where enhanced due diligence 
would be disproportionate, such as 
where the third party is known to the 
Group and located in a low risk 
jurisdiction and market sector. These 
third parties are also subject to continual 
screening.
During 2012, an exercise was undertaken 
to send new agency agreements to all of 
the Group’s agents. These agreements 
incorporate the Group’s Ethics and 
Values Statement and oblige the agent 
to read, understand and comply with the 
same ethical standards as the Group’s 
employees, including an absolute 
prohibition on bribery and corruption. 
The new agency agreements all contain 
a consistent contractual limit on the 
maximum commission payable and how 
it can be earned, inline with the Group 
policy on commission.
•	 Suppliers:
The Group has continued to invest in its 
outsourcing model, selecting suppliers 
with sound reputations in the 
marketplace. Many of the suppliers have 
a long term working relationship with 
the Company, ensuring ingrained 
product knowledge within the supply 
chain. Suppliers are also subject to 
continuous automated online monitoring 
as described above and the Company is 
alerted where any derogatory 
information is uncovered.
In the past year, the supplier assessment 
programme has been extended to 
include more detailed CSR themed 
questions. Questions associated with 
equal rights and equal pay, anti-bribery 
and corruption policies, charitable giving, 
environmental impact and anti 
compulsory labour or child labour 
practices have been included in these 
surveys. Current and established 
suppliers have been considered under 
corporate social responsibility

this re-evaluation. These assessments are 
discussed directly with the suppliers. Any 
corrective action plan is agreed between 
Rotork and the supplier. A programme is 
in place to continue these assessments 
throughout 2013, looking at both 
existing and potentially new suppliers.
The Group’s UK trading companies, 
Rotork Controls Limited and Rotork UK 
Limited, are both signatories to the 
Prompt Payment Code which ensures 
that suppliers are paid according to the 
terms agreed and encourages good 
practice be passed down supply chains. 
Progress
•	 An updated and refreshed Group 
whistleblowing policy was substantively 
approved which incorporates the use of 
an independent external whistleblowing 
hotline as an alternative method to 
raising whistleblowing concerns 
internally;
•	 Following on from a revision of the supplier 
audit questionnaire in 2011 to include 
questions centred around CSR, 25 of the 
top 50 suppliers and all new suppliers to 
Rotork’s Bath, UK, manufacturing plant 
were retrospectively audited and no 
remedial action was required;
•	 A FTSE4Good score of 3.8 was 
maintained. This is in excess of UK, 
global and industry averages;
•	 An employee satisfaction survey score of 
3.6 was achieved, a small increase on the 
previous year with record numbers of 
employees participating;
•	 Regular communications sent from the 
Group Legal Department to General 
Managers and International Sales 
Managers regarding relevant bribery and 
corruption related events in the business 
environment and the whistleblowing 
policy was communicated to all 
employees in every edition of the 
company newsletter;
•	 Ongoing automatic bribery and 
corruption screening introduced.
2013 Targets
•	 Use improved ethical supplier auditing to 
retrospectively audit a further 20 major 
suppliers;
•	 Deliver bribery and corruption training to 
relevant non-managerial employees;
•	 Continue to reference anti-bribery and 
corruption in each company newsletter;
•	 Rollout the updated whistleblowing 
policy and independent external 
whistleblowing hotline to the Group.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Overview
The safety of Group employees, customers 
and visitors is of paramount importance to 
the Group. It is our policy to provide a safe 
working environment for all employees and 
visitors to any of the Group’s sites and 
ensure employees work safely. For these 
reasons, policies and procedures are in 
place and help to eliminate, reduce or 
control our operational risks and ensure 
compliance with health and safety 
legislation.
The Group undertakes health and safety 
audits at all of its locations. A schedule of 
audits is established and approved by the 
CSR Committee. Each Rotork location is 
audited against a checklist which has been 
developed to ensure each location meets 
the Group’s standards for health and safety. 
Each item on the checklist is assessed 
against pre-determined criteria and scored. 
A calculation of the overall score gives the 
location a rating and any location not 
achieving the baseline rating is given limited 
time to improve.
All audits are reviewed by the Group’s Health 
and Safety Officer and all actions resulting 
from audits are recorded and monitored for 
correct and timely rectification.
A full report of our Group health and safety 
performance is given at quarterly CSR 
Committee meetings and all actions are 
recorded and progress reviewed at the next 
meeting. The results of audits, the rating of 
locations and the status of audit actions are 
reviewed by the Health and Safety Committee 
and any actions identified are acted upon.
Training is provided to enable employees to 
carry out their duties without risk to 
themselves or to others. 
The Group health and safety policy is 
endorsed by the Chief Executive and sets out 
the Group’s requirement to ‘meet or exceed 
legislative and other requirements in the 
countries in which Rotork operates’. The 
policy can be viewed on the Group’s website 
under Corporate Social Responsibility – 
Health and Safety in the investors’ section. 
Effective management of the Group’s health 
and safety programme enables us to:
•	 Minimise the risk of injury to our 
employees, customers and suppliers and 
damage to property;
•	 Reduce costs associated with employee 
illness, injury and loss of physical assets;
•	 Continually improve the Group’s health 
and safety practices.
The Group operates a behaviour-based safety 
programme. This requires managers and 
supervisors to encourage safe working 
practices by:
•	 Promoting regular safety observations by 
all staff;
•	 Regularly asking employees for their 
suggestions for improving safety at their 
facility;
•	 Holding employees accountable for 
observing these practices;
•	 Providing managing safety courses for 
line management; and
•	 Regular health and safety training to 
employees on subjects such as manual 
handling and confined spaces.
The Group’s health and safety policy and 
arrangement document sets out the 
Company’s policies for all of its activities. 
Rotork employees are engaged in activities 
which include manual handling of heavy 
objects, mechanical lifting, operating 
machinery and driving to suppliers, and 
customers’ locations. In addition to working 
in the Group’s facilities, employees also work 
on customer sites, which are often more 
hazardous. To reduce the risks associated 
with these activities, additional safe working 
practices are in place and include:
•	 Site surveys, to establish requirements, 
measurements and an assessment of the 
potential work area;
•	 Design assessments to identify risks, hazards 
and necessary controls to eliminate, reduce 
or control the risk to a reasonable level;
•	 Method statements, detailing the work 
that is to be done, the control and 
equipment that are to be used; Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

•	 Point of work risk assessments, before 
work starts, which must also be reviewed 
after any period away from the work area;
•	 The use of permits-to-work when 
working in hazardous environments such 
as confined space work; and 
•	 Unannounced internal audits of employees 
when working on a customer site.
Five performance indicators are monitored 
across the Group and performance against 
these indicates is reported to the Audit 
Committee: 
•	 Accident frequency rate (which is a 
reported Group KPI); 
•	 Lost time rate; 
•	 Incident frequency rate; 
•	 Health and safety audit rating; and
•	 On time completion of health and safety 
audit actions.
By monitoring the results of these performance 
indicators, we are able to identify areas of 
strong performance, which can be shared 
across the Group and areas of weakness which 
may require additional resources and training. 
Progress
One of the Group’s non-financial KPIs is 
Accident Frequency Rate (AFR). It is 
calculated as an average of the past three 
years’ AFR performance. In 2012 the Group 
achieved an AFR of 0.46, surpassing the 
2012 target of 0.47.
Details of the Group’s AFR over the past five 
years and how it is calculated is shown on 
page 29.
2013 Targets
•	 Achieve an AFR of 0.43.
COMMUNITY INvOLvEMENT
Overview
The Group considers it important to 
contribute to and engage positively with 
stakeholders in the communities in which it 
operates and to be a good community 
neighbour around the world. We regard this 
as part of our ongoing responsibilities as a 
corporate entity. The Group seeks to be 
regarded as a good corporate citizen. This 
links into our corporate values which include 
producing a positive and beneficial impact in 
the areas in which we operate. One of the 
ways the Group does this is by having local 
charity committees at each of our sites which 
donate to local charitable causes. This 
empowers local employees to decide how to 
distribute the funds in their local 
communities. The Group aims to contribute 
0.1% of profits to local charitable causes.
Local community involvement highlights 
from the year include:
•	 A Rotork Germany employee based in 
Melle speaking at a local high school 
about job applications;
•	 Various locations running 
apprenticeships, work placement and 
internship programmes;
•	 Rotork Fairchild employees donating to a 
local food bank;
•	 Rotork Shanghai employees supporting a 
local primary school; and
•	 Rotork India employees donating clothes 
to local causes.
The Group has forged links with local 
universities, colleges and schools in a 
number of the locations where we operate 
and sponsors students to go into higher 
education in India in addition to sponsoring 
a school there. The Group is the industry 
member of the Bath Educational Trust, 
which aims to advance education in Bath 
schools and promote community cohesion. 
A Group representative is a member of the 
Industrial Advisory Board for the Mechanical 
Engineering Department of Bath University. 
The Group is also a member of an initiative 
of the Engineering Development Trust and 
sponsors a science project currently being 
undertaken by pupils in the sixth form of a 
local Bath school.

The Group has supported two international charities in 2012, 
WaterAid and Send a Cow. Speciﬁc projects of these charities 
are supported and the Group receives updates throughout the 
year on the progress of the projects.
WaterAid uses the Group’s support to help fund the Jeldu Woreda 
Project in Ethiopia, which aims to deliver safe and adequate water, 
sanitation and hygiene facilities to 16,000 villagers across three 
villages in Ethiopia by using alternative energy sources to provide a 
sustainable water pumping system. WaterAid also use Rotork’s 
support to promote good sanitation and hygiene practices in the 
village by providing adequate facilities such as hand washing basins. 
The project beneﬁts include a reduction in the prevalence of water 
borne diseases, a reduction in the distance travelled to reach fresh 
water, improved access to sanitation facilities and improved 
environmental cleanliness. The Group has supported this project 
since 2011, when it was in its ﬁrst phase, and will continue to 
support it until this project is completed in 2013. 
Send a Cow uses the Group’s contributions to support its Building 
Futures project. Building Futures provides families in Eastern 
Uganda with training, resources and knowledge to equip them with 
vital farming skills to improve agricultural productivity and allow 
families to work their way out of poverty by being able to generate 
a regular income. The Group funds several communities and Send a 
Cow provides livestock, practical training in sustainable agricultural 
practices and training on building strong and harmonious 
communities so that the families can work together and become 
self-reliant. Training is also provided on other issues such as home 
hygiene practices and HIV/AIDS prevention and care.
Progress
•	 £50,000 contributed by the Group to WaterAid plus a further 
£6,378 contributed to WaterAid through employee fundraising 
activities;
•	 £41,000 contributed to Send a Cow; and
•	 £110,000 contributed to local charitable causes.
2013 Targets
•	 To increase donations to charitable causes. The Group will 
endeavour to:
 – Donate 0.1% of Group proﬁts to Rotork’s nominated 
international charities; and
 – Donate 0.1% of Group proﬁts to charitable causes local to 
Rotork’s operating sites.

corporate governance
Roger Lockwood
Chairman
The continuing success of the Rotork Group, 
its reputation in its markets and its 
relationships with its stakeholders is 
dependent on and protected by the 
leadership provided by an effective board. 
Good corporate governance supports the 
effectiveness of your board and contributes 
towards the long term success of our 
Company.
Our corporate governance report is set out 
on pages 44 to 61 and describes the roles, 
accountabilities and expectations for our 
directors and Board structures. In the table 
opposite there is a summary of the business 
the Board considered in 2012. We are 
subject to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (Code) and whilst ensuring we provide 
detailed reporting, we have sought to place 
emphasis on explaining how the principles 
of the Code are applied across our Group. 
I am pleased to report that for the year 
under review, following the appointment 
of an additional independent non-executive 
director, we now fully comply with the 
Code and have ensured an equal balance 
between executive directors and 
independent non-executive directors. 
Corporate governance highlights for  
the year under review include acting  
on our commitment, as contained in  
our announcement in response to the  
Davies Report, to achieve 25% female 
representation in our independent non-
executive directorate. We achieved this 
commitment with the appointment of  
Sally James in May 2012. Sally has joined  
the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees and we look forward to her 
contribution in the future. We revised and 
updated the Terms of Reference of our 
Audit Committee in response to changes 
made to the Code and associated Guidance 
for Audit Committees which will apply from 
the next financial year. We also updated our 
policy on non-audit fees paid to the auditor 
and revised and updated our whistleblowing 
policy. Our revised whistleblowing policy and 
independent hotline to raise whistleblowing 
concerns are to be launched in early 2013.
I believe that good corporate governance, 
when properly applied, supports and 
protects our business and its long term 
success by creating a link, based on trust 
and engagement, between Rotork and its 
stakeholders. It is important for governance 
to focus on the entire organisation and at 
Rotork we seek to apply it across our 
activities worldwide in a consistent and 
unified way to create and maintain the right 
culture throughout our Group. I believe this 
allows us to produce a better business. 
Rotork’s products and services are offered 
in many markets and territories and we 
recognise that our business activities affect 
a diverse range of stakeholders. With that in 
mind, we must ensure that we consistently 
do things the right way through a unified 
approach. Our corporate governance 
arrangements underpin this by ensuring that 
our people know not just what to do, but 
how to do it.

The following section on pages 44 to 61 is a summary of the system 
of corporate governance adopted by Rotork. Following the 
appointment of an additional independent non-executive director 
in May 2012, Rotork plc complied fully with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (Code). The Code is available to download at 
www.frc.org.uk.
t he boa Rd of d iReCto Rs
The Board has a duty to promote the long term success of Rotork 
for its shareholders. Its role therefore includes approval of strategy, 
risk reviews, major contract approvals, finance matters and internal 
control and risk management.
The terms and conditions of appointment of directors are available 
for inspection during business hours at the registered office of 
Rotork plc and at the Annual General Meeting (AGM).
board composition
Rotork is led by an effective Board which consists of nine members: 
the Chairman, four independent non-executive directors and four 
executive directors. Apart from the Chairman, all non-executive 
directors are considered to be independent from Rotork and are 
appointed for an initial term of three years. Upon the completion 
of this term, the appointment is reviewed and, if appropriate, 
extended for up to a further two three year terms following which 
the director normally retires.
The biographies of the directors and details of Board committee 
membership is set out on pages 40 to 41.
During 2012, the Board’s membership was expanded with the 
appointment of SA James as an additional independent non-
executive director. This followed a recommendation from the 
Nomination Committee in 2011 to appoint an additional 
independent non-executive director and ensures the Board has the 
same number of executive directors and independent non-executive 
directors in line with the Code.

Roles and responsibilities
There is a documented clear division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive to ensure that there is a balance 
of power and authority between leadership of the Board and 
executive leadership.
All directors are entitled to seek independent, professional advice at 
the Company’s expense in order to discharge their responsibilities as 
directors. Rotork maintains appropriate directors’ and officers’ 
insurance cover.

board activities
As part of Rotork’s Board effectiveness, day to day responsibility for 
the running of the Company is delegated to executive management. 
However, there are a number of matters where it is not considered 
appropriate to do this. The Board therefore has a formal and documented 
schedule of matters reserved for its decision which includes:
•	 Approval of Group strategy;
•	 Major capital projects and major contracts approval; Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

•	 Acquisition and disposal of any company, business or fixed asset in excess of agreed levels;
•	 Changes to Group corporate, capital, management or control structures or listing status;
•	 Approval of preliminary announcements and results, annual report, dividends, significant changes in accounting policies and procedures 
and treasury policy;
•	 Approval of bank borrowings exceeding a certain percentage of the relevant company’s turnover;
•	 Undertaking an annual assessment of the Group risk control process;
•	 Making appointments and removals (following Nomination Committee recommendations) and changing the size and composition of the Board;
•	 Succession planning;
•	 Determining membership and chairmanship of Board Committees;
•	 Appointment, re-appointment or removal of the external auditor (following Audit Committee recommendation);
•	 Approval of all resolutions and corresponding documentation to be put to shareholders at a general meeting;
•	 Approval of the auditor, brokers and principal corporate finance adviser;
•	 Prosecution, defence or settlement of any material litigation; and
•	 Approval of overall levels of insurance for the Group.
In 2012, the Board met seven times at scheduled meetings and three times at additional meetings to consider other business including 
approval of Interim Management Statements. Key matters reserved for the Board decided at these meetings included: the appointment of 
SA James and approving the acquisitions of Soldo Srl and the operating companies of the Schischek Group.
The Chairman, through the Company Secretary, ensures that the Board agenda and all relevant information is circulated to the Board 
directors sufficiently in advance of meetings. The Chairman and the Company Secretary discuss the agenda in detail ahead of every 
meeting and the Chairman and Chief Executive always have a review meeting ahead of each Board meeting.
At least once annually, the Board meets at one of Rotork’s locations other than its head office in Bath. This allows the Board, and in particular 
the non-executive directors, the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of overseas businesses and their markets and to interact with 
local management and staff as well as to view new capital investments and acquisitions. In 2012, the Board visited Rotork’s new manufacturing 
facility in Chennai, India, which incorporates the Rotork Innovation and Design Engineering Centre (RIDEC). The Board met and received 
presentations from local management.
■ 2012 – Chennai, India;
■ 2011 – Houston, USA;
■ 2010 – Lucca, Italy;
■ 2009 – Bilbao, Spain;
■ 2008 – Leeds, UK.
Location of Board meetings
All Board directors constructively challenge executive management at Board meetings and are entitled to unfettered access to information 
and management across the organisation should they require it. Rotork’s executive directors understand the distinction between their roles 
as executive managers and as Board directors. The Chairman facilitates discussion by ensuring that all Board members have the opportunity 
to fully contribute to all agenda items at Board meetings and he always seeks to obtain unanimous decisions while allowing sufficient time 
for discussion and then drawing discussions to a close in an orderly manner. This means that a range of views are offered by both executive 
and non-executive directors, when the Board discusses any particular issue or topic. Rotork Board members come from a variety of 
professional backgrounds including engineering, legal, accountancy and international sales and collectively possess significant managerial 
experience as well as experience of being company directors of other public limited companies.
At each Board meeting, the Board receives presentations from senior management and has the opportunity to ask questions following  
the presentations. The Chief Executive and Finance Director present to the Board the content of preliminary and half year results 
announcements and the Board is invited to comment on and approve those announcements.  Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

Corporate Governance continued
The performance of the Board is enhanced by the good working 
relationship between the Chief Executive and the Chairman who 
continue to work together to ensure that the best use of the time 
and talents of the Board are applied at Board meetings. 
induction and development
New Board members receive a suitable and tailored induction. This 
is facilitated by the Company Secretary under the direction of the 
Chairman.
In 2012, SA James was appointed as a new independent non-
executive director. Her ongoing induction programme has included:
•	 Meetings with members of the Rotork Management Board and 
other senior divisional management;
•	 A tour of Rotork’s Bath head office and manufacturing plant and 
of Rotork’s India plant;
•	 A Rotork Controls product training course including 
demonstrations of various Rotork products and apparatus; and
•	 Receipt of statutory and corporate documentation, Board 
policies and Board Committee minutes and resolutions from the 
last two years.
During 2013, SA James’ continuing induction will include:
•	 Visits to the Rotork Fluid Systems plant in Lucca, Italy and the 
Rotork Gears plant in Leeds, UK; and
•	 Attendance at a general Rotork product training course with the 
majority of the other non-executive directors covering all Rotork 
products.
Directors are also encouraged to continually update their 
professional skills and knowledge. During 2012 the non-executive 
directors had the opportunity to attend workshops provided by 
PwC. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee attended an 
Association of British Insurers Investment Conference which 
included presentations and discussions on executive remuneration. 
The Chairman is responsible for reviewing the level and nature of 
training given to the Board of Directors at least annually.
performance evaluations
During 2012 the Board undertook a detailed review of its 
performance, based on a written questionnaire which was designed 
by Vivienne Cassley, an external consultant, who also provides an 
analysis on the responses.
 
The review included revisiting matters raised in 2011, and also 
focused on the approach to risk, and the way in which the Board 
currently believes it is operating as a unit and is unified with each 
member listening to and respecting the opinions of the others. 
Responses indicated that the Board is proactive in looking for ways 
to improve its performance, and that there has been continued 
progress in all areas considered during the year under review. For 
example, in a year which saw the addition of a new operating 
division to the business, the Board also recruited a female, non-
executive director to the Board, which was identified in previous 
reviews as an objective. Some minor changes were also made to 
the scheduling of Board meetings which have increased the time 
available for discussion.
IG King is the current Senior Independent Director. As part of his 
role, he annually arranges a meeting of the non-executive directors 
to appraise the Chairman’s performance. This feedback is used to 
discuss with the Chairman his performance.
diversity on the board
The Board carefully considered and responded to Lord Davies’ 2011 
report, Women on Boards. Rotork recognises the benefits that 
gender diversity can bring to the boardroom and has appointed a 
female non-executive director, SA James, in 2012. Consequently, 
Rotork has met its first published target of achieving 25% female 
representation in its independent non-executive directorate. More 
detail of the work of the Nomination Committee is provided on 
page 52.
internal control and risk management
The Board is cognisant of its responsibility to present a fair, balanced 
and understandable assessment of the Company’s position. The 
Board is responsible for Rotork’s system of internal control and risk 
management and meets at least annually to review the effectiveness 
of it. Internal control can only provide reasonable, not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss, as it is designed to 
manage the risks rather than remove them altogether.
The system covers controls which enable Rotork to respond 
appropriately to financial, operational, compliance and any other 
risks. The system accords with the Turnbull Guidance, Internal 
Control – Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, and key 
elements include:
•	 Robust assurance processes and controls over financial reporting 
procedures;
•	 A formal schedule of reserved matters for the Board including 
responsibility for reviewing Group strategy;
•	 Clearly defined levels of authority and a division of 
responsibilities throughout the Group;
•	 Formal documentation procedures;
•	 A formal whistleblowing policy (with an external whistleblowing 
hotline to be introduced in early 2013); and
•	 An internal audit function made up of accountants from head 
office and across subsidiaries supported by regular training in 
internal audit, best practice and control procedures to monitor 
and identify weaknesses in internal controls.
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the system of 
internal control annually and reports its findings to the Board. The 
Board then carries out its review of the system of internal control. 
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced by Rotork, details of which can 
be found on pages 30 to 31. In the year under review, the annual 
review of the system of internal control identified no significant 
internal control failings or weaknesses.
The Group’s key risks, changes during the year under review and 
details of processes to manage these risks can be found on pages 
30 to 31. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

ReLations with sha Reho LdeRs
Communication with shareholders is a priority for the Board and it 
maintains a regular dialogue with its major shareholders. Rotork 
recognises the value of the UK Stewardship Code 2010. In 2012 the 
Board, and in particular the Chief Executive and Finance Director met 
with shareholders in a number of ways including:
•	 Hosting conference calls;
•	 Hosting webcasts;
•	 Attending shareholder events;
•	 Hosting investor site visits;
•	 Attending conferences and symposiums;
•	 Hosting and participating in roadshows; and
•	 Arranging ad hoc meetings with shareholders.
Through the Chief Executive, the Chairman ensures that all directors 
are made aware of major shareholder issues and concerns and 
accordingly the Chief Executive reports to the Board at each board 
meeting on meetings with analysts, fund managers and shareholders.
Rotork makes constructive use of the AGM as an opportunity to 
communicate with and answer questions from those shareholders 
who attend in person. The entire board is available during the 
meeting and for lunch following the meeting to allow direct 
interaction between its directors and the shareholders.
Rotork also maintains a comprehensive investor relations section 
on its website which provides a variety of resources for investors 
including current webcasts, presentations and press releases. 
The investors section of the website can be accessed at  
www.rotork.com/en/investors/index.
Electronic communications are also used by Rotork to communicate 
with its shareholders. All shareholders have been asked whether 
they would like to receive the Annual Report and Accounts in 
electronic form rather than in hard copy form. Any shareholders 
wishing to receive corporate documents electronically can do this by 
registering for the service at www.shareview.co.uk and clicking on 
‘Register’ under the ‘Portfolio’ section. At the AGM Rotork will also 
introduce electronic proxy appointment.

Company Information 115-117
Audit Committee work in 2012 covered the following matters:
Financial Reporting
•	 Review of the appropriateness of Rotork’s financial statements 
including considering significant financial reporting judgements 
and estimates made by management taking into account reports 
received from the Finance Director and the external auditor to 
ensure compliance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards and UK company law;
•	 Review of: the annual financial statements including statements 
on corporate governance; internal control and risk management; 
the half year and interim management statements; followed by a 
recommendation to the Board to approve these; and
•	 Review of the going concern statement, followed by a 
recommendation to the Board to approve this.
External Auditor
•	 Review of the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditor and the external audit process. The Committee oversaw 
the Company’s relationship with the external auditor, including 
reviewing the engagement letter, audit fee and re-appointment of 
the external auditor, and made recommendations to the Board to 
submit these matters for shareholder approval at the AGM;
•	 Meeting with representatives from the external auditor to receive 
reports on independence and objectivity of the external auditor 
and to ensure adequate mechanisms are in place to ensure this is 
maintained;
•	 Determining whether the external auditor had been effective in 
meeting the agreed audit plan during the year including any 
work undertaken to address any changes in perceived risks; the 
robustness and perceptiveness of the auditor’s handling of key 
accounting judgements; responses to questions from the Audit 
Committee; and feedback about the conduct of the external 
auditor from key finance personnel within Rotork;
•	 The Committee considered whether to put the external audit 
contract out to tender as the incumbent partner was retiring by 
rotation. The Committee’s assessment was that auditor 
independence and objectivity would be maintained by the 
appointment of a new partner who would also bring a fresh 
perspective. The Committee did however note the pending 
revisions to the Code in this regard, which will apply to Rotork 
from next year;
•	 Review of the representation letter;
•	 Review and revision of the non-audit work policy setting out 
approval procedures and levels. Review of non-audit work 
undertaken. The split between audit and non-audit fees can be 
found in note 8 on page 83;
•	 Review of the policy regarding the employment of former 
employees of the external auditor;
•	 Consideration of the risk of KPMG Audit plc, as external auditor, 
leaving the market;
•	 Review of external audit findings;
•	 Discussion with the external auditor on:
 – The appropriateness of accounting policies, estimates and 
judgements;
 – The control environment, including fraud risk management;
•	 Meeting twice with the external auditor, without executive 
management present to permit an additional opportunity for an 
open exchange of views and feedback.
Internal Control and Risk Management
•	 Review of the effectiveness of Rotork’s system of internal control 
and risk management including fraud risk management;
•	 Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of internal audit 
activities, including:
 – internal audits carried out and their results;
 – management’s responses to those results;
 – the internal audit programme and resourcing for 2012 and 2013;
•	 Reviewing the method of internal audit and considering the 
need for a separate internal audit function. The Committee 
concluded that the current makeup of the internal audit function 
being individuals from the Group’s finance departments who all 
have distinct posts, supplemented by external resource where 
particular skills are needed, is appropriate;
•	 Review of Rotork’s procedures for preventing bribery and 
corruption; and
•	 Monitoring health and safety performance data and receiving 
reports from the Rotork Management Board member 
responsible for health and safety practice and procedures.
Other Issues
•	 Noting the changes in the Code and associated Guidance for 
Audit Committees which will apply to Rotork from next financial 
year and updating its Terms of Reference for Board approval and 
making consequent revisions to its annual schedule of work; and
•	 Review, update and the approval of a new whistleblowing policy 
including approval of the use of an independent, external 
whistleblowing hotline.
Policy on non-audit fees
Rotork recognises that certain areas or levels of work may 
cause conflicts with the objectivity and independence of the 
external auditor. Rotork therefore applies a policy on non-audit 
services provided by the external auditor which includes a 
general rule of approval from the Finance Director for 
engagements outside the scope of the external audit to incur 
fees less than £10,000; or from the Audit Committee Chairman 
for engagements outside the scope of the external audit to 
incur fees exceeding £10,000 or where the aggregate 
approvals by the Finance Director exceed £40,000 in any 
financial year. Engagements relating to tax planning to incur 
fees exceeding £50,000 must be approved by the Audit 
Committee and engagements relating to mergers and 
acquisitions to incur fees exceeding £10,000 must be approved 
by the Audit Committee.
The policy also specifies certain activities which the external auditor 
may not undertake such as work relating to financial statements 
which may be subject to external audits; or the management or 
significant involvement with internal audit services. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

Roger Lockwood
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
Members: GB Bullard, PI France, SA James, IG King, JE Nicholas
The Nomination Committee is responsible for leading the process 
for Board appointments and making recommendations to the 
Board; ensuring succession planning is in place; reviewing the 
balance of skills and experience on the Board; regularly reviewing 
the structure, size and composition of the Board, including its 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience and making 
recommendations as appropriate.
a ctivities of the nomination Committee during the year
The Nomination Committee met three times during the year.
Month Principal activities
April 2012 – Recommending to the Board that SA James 
be appointed as a non-executive director.
September 2012 – Review of the Board Evaluation Report 
concerning matters relevant to the 
Nomination Committee;
 – Recommending to the Board approval of 
revised Terms of Reference for the 
Nomination Committee; and
 – Ongoing succession planning discussions.
December 2012 – Approval of a revised procedure for 
Nomination Committee recommendations 
to the Board for the appointment of new 
non-executive directors; and
 – Ongoing succession planning discussions.
During the year under review, the Board appointed SA James as an 
additional independent non-executive director, following a 
recommendation from the Nomination Committee. The 
appointment process began with the Board determining that it 
would be in the best interests of the Company to appoint an 
independent female non-executive director taking into account the 
benefits of having a balance of skills, experience and diversity, 
including gender. The Nomination Committee instructed an 
executive search consultancy, Egon Zehnder, to search for suitable 
candidates in conjunction with a Sub-Committee of the Nomination 
Committee composed of the Chairman and Chief Executive. A 
shortlist of candidates was drawn up and the Nomination 
Committee arranged for the shortlisted candidates to be 
interviewed. Following the interviews, the Nomination Committee 
recommended to the Board that SA James be appointed and the 
Board approved this recommendation.
The appointment of SA James has the effect of balancing the 
Board’s composition so that at least half of the Board are 
independent non-executive directors.
In 2011, Rotork announced a short term objective of ensuring at 
least 25% female representation in its independent non-executive 
directorate by the end of 2012 and this was achieved in the year 
under review.
During the year, the Nomination Committee also recommended 
that the Board should approve a revised process for the 
recommendation of appointments of new non-executive directors 
following constructive feedback given by the non-executive 
directors on the process. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

Remuneration Report
RemUneRat ion Committee Ro Le and Responsibi Lit ies
Gary Bullard
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Members: SA James, IG King, JE Nicholas
The principal role of the Remuneration Committee is to determine 
the framework and policy for remuneration of the executive 
directors and the Chairman, ensuring that remuneration levels are 
sufficient but not excessive in order to attract, retain and motivate 
directors of the quality required to run the Company.
The full terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the 
Company’s website at www.rotork.com/en/investors/index/
committees. Key responsibilities include:
•	 Within the agreed policy, determining individual remuneration 
packages for the Chairman and executive directors, including the 
terms of any discretionary share schemes in which executive 
directors may be invited to participate, taking account of the 
level of remuneration for other Rotork Management Board 
members and being aware of remuneration conditions 
throughout the Group; 
•	 Agreeing the terms and conditions to be included in service 
agreements for executive directors, including termination 
payments; and
•	 Selecting, appointing and setting terms of reference with any 
remuneration consultants who may advise the Committee.
During the year under review the Committee sought the advice of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Towers Watson. PwC’s other 
connections with the Company are limited to the provision of 
actuarial advice for the Sharesave and Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) calculations, associated LTIP accounting advice and other 
corporate advice including UK tax computation and tax advice, due 
diligence work on certain acquisitions and in the year under review 
an audit of the Group treasury function.
The Committee also invited the Group HR Director to inform the 
Committee of pay awards throughout the Group when setting 
executive director remuneration. The Chairman and Chief Executive 
are also invited to attend meetings except when their own 
remuneration is considered. Both attended all Committee meetings 
in the year under review.
During 2012, the Remuneration Committee closely monitored 
developments relating to remuneration and in particular, the 
consultation by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills 
on Directors’ pay and the revised remuneration and reporting 
regulations. The Committee also considered updates on best 
practice from providers of guidance to institutional investors 
including the Association of British Insurers and the National 
Association of Pension Funds. The Committee supports the 
continued emphasis on improvement of best practice and for 
greater focus on transparency, moderation, simplicity and a closer 
alignment of the interests of the directors with those of the 
shareholders.
This remuneration report is presented to shareholders by the Board 
at the AGM for their approval. The auditor is required to report on 
the information concerning directors’ emoluments, LTIP and other 
share awards and pension disclosures.

Remuneration Report continued
RemUneRat ion po LiCy
For the year under review, the Board continued to consider that it was critical that the Company had remuneration policies that enabled  
it to motivate, retain and, when required, recruit high quality management. Levels of remuneration are set to be sufficient to meet these 
objectives but should not be excessive. There should be strong alignment with attainment of performance objectives and the delivery of 
shareholder value. 
The Committee considers it important that a significant proportion of executive directors’ potential total remuneration is dependent  
on attainment of demanding performance related short and longer term targets. This is demonstrated by the percentage of basic salary 
potentially payable as cash or share awards under the annual cash bonus scheme and LTIPs respectively.

expected value of executive remuneration
Base Salary
Fixed elements of remuneration including base salary are designed to be competitive but not excessive. This avoids building unnecessary 
current and future costs into the business.
Executive Bonus
The executive annual cash bonus is focused on delivery of strategically important performance measures. These include demanding 
financial and non-financial business related objectives.
The bonus rewards increases in profit, in two parts. One half is based on the average profit over the three immediately preceding years and 
the other half is based on performance against an annual profit target.
The plan additionally rewards high levels of free cash generation and growth in EPS. The final element of bonus payable is based on 
non-financial targets where objectives will be set annually.
During the year under review the bonus payment for directors other than the Chief Executive was limited to 100% of basic salary. The 
Chief Executive’s bonus was limited to 125% of basic salary.

Rotork Long Term Incentive Plan p
Rotork’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) rewards the creation of shareholder value which is a strategic priority. Performance is measured 
over a three year period using a combination of earnings per share growth and relative total shareholder return (TSR) compared to a 
comparator group. The performance criteria are summarised in the table on page 56.
In the year under review awards of 100% of basic salary were made to directors under the Rotork Long Term Share Incentive Plan 2010 (the 
2010 Plan). The maximum award under the 2010 Plan is 150% of basic salary per annum. This maximum was introduced taking account of 
current market practice and the 10 year life of the Plan to include flexibility, although the Committee has no current plans to utilise this 
increased headroom.
p Denotes Audited information
The bonus is calculated according to targets totalling 80% 
and allocated to directors according to their limits as shown 
in the table on page 54. The 80% is split as follows:
•	 Accident Frequency Rate (5%);
•	 Waste Recycling (5%);
•	 Cash Generation (10%);
•	 EPS growth (10%);

Rotork Long Term Share Incentive Plan 2010 p
In 2010 shareholders approved the Rotork Long Term Share Incentive Plan. Awards under the 2010 Plan were subject to a three year 
performance period. Prior to any vesting, the Remuneration Committee needs to be satisfied that the recorded TSR performance is a 
genuine reflection of the Company’s overall underlying financial performance.
The LTIP award conditions are summarised in the table below:
Vesting requirements
Performance measure Percentage of award 0% 25%

100%

TSR ranking in peer group 50% Below 50th percentile 50th percentile Above 75th percentile
EPS growth 50% Below RPI + 10% RPI + 10% RPI + 25%
1.
 
Proportionate vesting between these points.
It is the intention of the Committee, when considering whether to make awards under the LTIP each year, to review both the size of awards 
and the performance conditions to ensure that, at the time of an award, they are appropriate and challenging taking into account any 
guidelines issued by organisations representing the interests of institutional shareholders or any other relevant guidelines issued from time 
to time. The maximum award permitted is 150% of the basic annual salary, however there is currently no intention to exceed 100% of 
basic annual salary for any participant.
The LTIP grant comparator group of companies applying to the 2010 and 2011 LTIP awards are as set out below. From the 2012 LTIP award, 
the Committee decided to replace the TSR comparator group with a larger group made up of the FTSE 250 (excluding all financial services, 
insurance companies and investment trusts). The original comparator group for the awards granted in 2012 consisted of 172 companies 
(including Rotork plc). As at 31 December 2012, 172 companies (including Rotork plc) remain in the comparator group. Vesting 
requirements remain unchanged and are described in the table above. The Committee made this change as the number of companies 
within the original TSR group was diminishing and suitable replacement within a narrow grouping of industrial stocks was becoming 
increasingly challenging.

Employee Share Awards to Executive Directors p
In common with all eligible employees, UK based executive directors receive an entitlement to ordinary shares under the SIP which is 
approved by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Under the SIP and the OPLSS an aggregate total of up to 5% of profits are 
distributed to employees each year in the form of ordinary shares. The distribution is calculated by reference to years of service and basic 
salary. Details of total free share awards under the SIP and OPLSS and awards made to executive directors in 2012 and the prior year are set 
out above. Free shares awarded to all three UK executive directors under the SIP are subject to the HMRC upper limit of £3,000 by value. 
This limit also applies to the OPLSS for the year under review.
RH Arnold, in common with other eligible overseas employees, participates in the OPLSS. The scheme Trustee is based in Jersey, Channel 
Islands. The figure shown for RH Arnold relates solely to OPLSS.
UK based executive directors, in common with other eligible UK employees, have the opportunity to invest in the HMRC approved Rotork 
Sharesave Scheme. JM Davis, PI France and GM Ogden participate in the Scheme. Once the options mature, the exercise period is six 
months after which the options lapse. The grants made in the year under review are summarised in the table below:

Executive Directors’ Contracts of Employment
RH Arnold, JM Davis, PI France and GM Ogden all have rolling service contracts with a one year notice period.
The most recent executive director service contracts contain provisions which limit payments on termination to basic salary with employer 
rights to require phased payments. For future executive director appointments, the Board’s intention will be to continue to limit service 
contracts to one year on a rolling basis.
None of the executive directors have any external directorships with the exception of PI France who is a director of Bath Education Trust for 
which he receives no fee.

The graph above shows the value, on 31 December 2012, of £100 invested in Rotork plc on 1 January 2008 compared with the value of £100 
invested in the FTSE Industrial Engineering Sector Index. The other points plotted show values at intervening financial year ends. The graph 
measures the Company’s performance against other companies in the FTSE Industrial Engineering sector by showing the TSR on a holding of 
ordinary shares in the Company compared with the average total shareholder return of other companies in its sector being the sector within 
which the Company is quoted on the London Stock Exchange and which is therefore considered the most appropriate index over the five year 
period to 31 December 2012.

Share Retention Policy
The Committee recommended and the Board approved an executive share retention policy which supports the accumulation of significant 
shareholdings in the Company by executive directors and other senior executives. The policy requires executive directors to achieve a 
minimum holding of ordinary shares in the Company equivalent to 150% of basic salary for executive directors. Executive directors are 
required to make use of vesting LTIP shares to meet this minimum target.

1. The figures shown for the increase in accrued pension over the year exclude any increase for RPI inflation.
2. The accumulated accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement from normal pension age, based on service to 31 December 2012, except for GM Odgen 
who became a preserved member of the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme on 5 April 2012.
3. A lump sum death benefit of four times basic annual salary is payable on death in service.
4. A dependant’s pension of one-half of prospective pension is payable on death in service, and of one-half of pre-commutation pension on death in retirement.
5. Post-retirement increases are applied at RPI up to a maximum of 5% per annum, except that for pension benefits in respect of pensionable service up to 15 May 2000 the 
minimum inflationary increase is 4.5% per annum.
6. The Pensionable Salary used to calculate benefits in the defined benefit scheme for JM Davis and PI France is restricted to a Scheme specific earnings cap which is currently 
£129,600.
7. The figures shown for RH Arnold are in respect of his membership of the Rotork Controls Inc. pension scheme and a supplemental executive retirement plan so that, in 
aggregate, the pension arrangements for RH Arnold will provide a pension of at least 60% of uncapped basic salary at age 65.

1. The figures shown for the increase in accrued pension over the year incorporate the increase for RPI inflation.
2. GM Ogden became a preserved member of the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme on 5 April 2012 and therefore these figures are based on service up to this date.
3. The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the relevant Technical Actuarial Standards (TASs) published by the Board for Actuarial Standards.
4. The increase in accrued pension and the increase in transfer value over the year for RH Arnold are affected by movements in the US dollar relative to sterling. In US dollars, the 
accrued pension for RH Arnold increased from $179,195 pa at 31 December 2011 to $189,555 pa at 31 December 2012 and the transfer value increased from $2,503,000 at 31 
December 2011 to $2,649,000 at 31 December 2012. The transfer value of accrued pension for RH Arnold reflects the benefits provided by the US scheme together with a US 
valuation of these benefits and is therefore not directly comparable with the transfer values for directors in the UK scheme.

A summary of the principal subsidiaries of the Group are set out on 
page 112.

future development of the business and information about 
environmental matters, the Group’s employees and social and 
community issues. The review contains analysis using financial and

share Capital
Details of the Company’s share capital including rights and 
obligations attached to each class of share and the ordinary shares 
issued during 2012 are set out in note 17 of the financial

less than 0.1% of the Company’s total share capital.
The Company’s Articles of Association contain customary 
restrictions on the transfer of shares as applicable only in certain 
limited circumstances (e.g. in relation to transfers to a minor). Save 
for those provisions there are no restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares in the capital of the Company other than certain 
restrictions which may be required from time to time by law, for 
example, insider trading law. In accordance with the Model Code 
which forms part of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority (as adopted by the Company) certain directors and 
employees are required to seek the prior approval of the Company 
to deal in its shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities and/or voting rights. The Company’s Articles of 
Association contain limited restrictions on the exercise of voting 
rights (e.g. in relation to disenfranchised shares following the issue 
of a notice to shareholders under section 793 Companies Act 
2006).
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by 
special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders.
The Company is not aware of any significant agreements to which it 
is party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
of the Company following a takeover.

An explanation of the Group policies on the use of financial

statement of directors’ Responsibility for preparing the 
a nnual Report and the financial statements
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with 
the auditors’ Statement of Auditors’ Responsibilities, included in the 
audit report, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders 
the respective responsibilities of the directors and of the auditors in 
relation to the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report & 
Accounts and the Group and Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards 
and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Group and Company for that period. In preparing each of the Group 
and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
•	 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 For the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
•	 For the Company financial statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the Company 
financial statements; and
•	 Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that 
complies with that law and those regulations.
directors statement pursuant to the disclosure and 
transparency Rules 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 40 and 41 confirm that, to the best of each person’s 
knowledge and belief:
•	 The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of the accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group and Company; and
•	 The Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and Company, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
In forming this view, the directors have considered trading and cash 
flow forecasts, financial commitments, the significant order book 
with customers spread across different geographic areas and 
industries and the significant net cash position.
For further information regarding the Company’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk,

Creditor payment policy
Whilst there is no formal code or standard, it is Company and 
Group policy to agree payment terms with its creditors, when 
negotiating general contract terms for each transaction and to 
abide by those payment terms, provided that the supplier is also 
complying with its obligations under those terms. There are no 
creditors subject to special arrangements outside suppliers’ terms 
and conditions. The Company does not have any trade suppliers so 
that a creditor day payment period is not appropriate.
directors’ and o fficers’ indemnity insurance
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Company’s 
Articles of Association provide for the directors and officers of the 
Company to be appropriately indemnified. The Company purchases 
and maintains insurance for the directors and officers of the 
Company in undertaking their duties, as permitted by section 233 
Companies Act 2006.
disclosure of information to a uditors 
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware; and each director has taken all the steps that he ought 
to have taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
a uditors
Resolutions to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors and to 
authorise the directors to determine their remuneration are to be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
a nnual General meeting
The AGM of the Company will be held at the Company’s office at 
Rotork House, Brassmill Lane, Bath, BA1 3JQ on Friday 26 April 2013 
at 12 noon. A separate circular containing the Notice of the Meeting 
is sent to shareholders with this Annual Report & Accounts.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2012
Except where indicated, values in these notes are in £000.
Rotork plc is a company domiciled in England. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2012 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The accounting policies contained below in note 1 and the 
disclosures in notes 2 to 31 all relate to the Group financial statements. The Company balance sheet can be found following note 31. As 
the Company has elected to continue reporting under UK GAAP, the applicable accounting policies are contained in note a, and notes b 
to k relate to the Company’s financial statements.
1. a cc ountin G policie S
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Rotork plc have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention subject to the items referred to in the 
derivative financial instruments accounting policy below.
New accounting standards and interpretations
The amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: disclosures are applicable for the financial year ending 31 December 2012. Application of 
this standard has not had any material impact on the disclosures, net assets or results of the Group.
Recent accounting developments
The amendments to IAS19 Employee Benefits will be applied from 1 January 2013. The principal change relates to the requirement to use 
the schemes’ discount rate to calculate the return on assets rather than using a rate of return appropriate to the various asset classes.
The application of the standard in 2012 would have reduced the pre-tax profit by £702,000 increasing the net pension interest cost to 
£1,092,000. The impact on basic earnings per share would be a reduction of 0.6p to 102.5p. In 2013, the net pension interest cost is 
estimated to be £1,150,000 under the amended standard. The impact on shareholders’ equity will be negligible.
The following standards and interpretations were issued but are not yet effective and have not been adopted as application was not 
mandatory for the year (and in some cases not yet endorsed for use in the EU):
•	 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
•	 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
•	 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
•	 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
•	 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
•	 IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation (amendments)
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and amendments will not have a material impact on the net assets or results 
of the Group.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
In forming this view, the directors have considered trading and cash flow forecasts, financial commitments, the significant order book with 
customers spread across different geographic areas and industries and the significant net cash position.
c onsolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 December 
2012. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences 
until the date control ceases. Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains or losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group 
transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that 
date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign 
exchange rates at the dates the values were determined.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into 
sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to sterling at 
rates approximating those ruling at the date of the transactions. Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net 
investment in subsidiaries, and from the translation of the results of those subsidiaries at average rate, are reported as an item of other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Any differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of 
equity. Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS in respect of all foreign entities are not presented as a 
separate component.
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods or services. Revenue is shown net of 
value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. The Group recognises revenue when the 
amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria 
have been met for each of the Group’s activities.
Revenue from the sale of valve actuators, gearboxes and flow control products is recognised in the income statement when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer in accordance with the contracted shipping terms. 
Revenue from service work is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the 
balance sheet date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed. No revenue is recognised if there are 
significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated completion costs, the possible return of goods or 
continuing management involvement with the goods.
business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
•	 the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
•	 the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
•	 the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
•	 the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as 
equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition, 
including acquisition costs and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2012
1. a ccountin G policie S CONTINUED
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount 
recorded under UK GAAP on transition to IFRS.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at each balance sheet date 
and is allocated to cash-generating units (CGU). An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying value of an asset or its CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
intangible assets
i) Research & development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is 
recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. Development costs incurred after the point at which the commercial and 
technical feasibility of the product have been proven, and the decision to complete the development has been taken and resources made 
available, are capitalised. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of 
overheads. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Development 
expenditure has an estimated useful life of five years and is written off on a straight-line basis.
ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. The useful life of each of these assets is assessed based on discussions with the management of the acquired 
business and takes account of the differing natures of each of the intangibles acquired. The assessed useful lives of intangibles acquired are 
as follows: 
Brands and trademarks  4 to 10 years
Customer relationships  2 to 5 years
Product design patents   5 to 8 years
Order backlog   6 months to 1 year
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. 
property, plant and equipment
Freehold land is not depreciated. Long leasehold buildings are amortised over 50 years or the expected useful life of the building where less 
than 50 years. Other assets are depreciated in equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at 
the following annual rates:
Freehold buildings   2% to 4%
Short leasehold buildings  period of lease
Plant and equipment  10% to 33%
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation. Certain items of property that 
had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, 
being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
l eases
Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had 
been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations under finance leases. Assets acquired under 
finance leases are initially recognised at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The rentals payable are apportioned between 
interest, which is charged to the income statement, and liability, which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of 
charge on the outstanding lease obligations. Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease in arriving at the operating profit. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

taxation
Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable 
on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax 
payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are 
not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting 
nor taxable profits. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
inventory and work in progress
Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost, on a ‘first in, first out’ basis, and net realisable value. In respect of work in 
progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses which 
are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition. The net realisable value in respect of old and slow moving 
inventory is assessed by reference to historic usage patterns and forecast future usage.
c ash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short term (with an original maturity less than three months) deposits. Bank 
overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of 
cash flows.
equity
Equity comprises issued equity capital, share premium, reserves and retained earnings.
When issued equity capital is repurchased, the amount paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. 
Repurchased shares are debited direct to equity and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
provisions
i) Warranties
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty 
cost data, known issues and management expectations of future costs.
ii) Contingent consideration
The terms of an acquisition may provide that the value of the purchase consideration, which may be payable in cash at a future date, 
depends on uncertain future events. Where it is not possible to estimate the amounts payable with any degree of certainty, the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements represent a fair value estimate at the balance sheet date of the amounts expected to be paid. 
employee benefits
i) Pension plans
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes and contributes to these schemes in accordance with qualified actuaries’ 
recommendations. In respect of all actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Group’s obligation in respect of the plans, these 
are recognised in equity. Interest on pension scheme liabilities has been recognised within financing expenses and the expected return on 
scheme assets within financing income in the income statement. 
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The costs for these schemes are recognised in the income 
statement as incurred. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

ii) Share-based payment transactions
The Rotork Sharesave Plan, introduced in 2004, offers certain employees the opportunity to purchase shares in Rotork plc at a discounted 
price compared with the market price at the time of grant. Details of the scheme are given in note 25. The fair value of the right / option is 
recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the 
period between grant and maturity. The right / option reaches maturity when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled. The fair 
value of the grant is measured using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were 
granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is 
due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Rotork Long Term Incentive Plan grants awards of shares to executive directors and senior managers. These awards may vest after a period 
of three years dependent upon both market and non-market performance conditions being met. Details of the grants are given in note 25. 
The fair value of the award is measured at grant date, using a Monte Carlo simulation model which takes into account the market based 
performance criteria, and spread over the vesting period. The fair value of the award is recognised as an employee expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity for the share settled award. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to exclude options that do not 
vest as a result of non-market performance conditions not being met.
iii) Long term service leave
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long term service leave is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for 
their service in the current and prior periods.
iv) Other employee benefits
In addition to the above schemes the Group offers a number of discretionary bonus schemes to employees around the world. The costs of 
these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred. This includes the Share Incentive Plan and Overseas Profit Linked Share 
Scheme both of which are a known liability at the year end.
derivative financial instruments
The Group uses forward exchange contracts and swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and 
financing activities. These are the only derivative financial instruments used by the Group. In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the Group 
does not hold or issue contracts for trading purposes. Forward exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted 
for as trading instruments.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at fair value. Where a forward exchange contract is designated as a hedge of the 
variability in cash flows of a recognised liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any 
gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity. Any effective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and 
recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the 
income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain 
or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss held in equity is recognised in the income 
statement immediately. 
dividends
Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid. Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in 
the period which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

c ritical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related 
actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities in the next financial year are listed below.
i) Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether Goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of CGUs to which Goodwill has been allocated. The 
value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which 
involves judgement, to calculate present values. Explanations of the estimates, judgements and sensitivities in respect of the current year 
impairment review are detailed in note 11.
ii) Valuation of acquired intangible assets
Acquisitions may result in customer relationships, brands and trademarks, product design patents and order backlogs being recognised. 
These are valued using discounted cash flows and relief from royalty methods. In applying these methodologies certain key judgements 
and estimates are required to be made in respect of future cash flows. Details of the accounting policies are shown earlier in this note and 
the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets are shown in note 12.
iii) Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities
Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgement in respect of the assumptions used to calculate present 
values. These include future mortality, discount rate, inflation and salary increases. Management makes these judgements in consultation 
with an independent actuary. Details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are in note 24. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

The Group continues to expect its effective rate of corporation tax to be higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in the 
USA, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and India.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries. Rotork plc controls the 
dividend policies of its subsidiaries and subsequently the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences. It is not practical to quantify 
the unprovided temporary differences as acknowledged within paragraph 40 of IAS 12.  Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. The Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Soldo has not been impairment 
tested due it being acquired in late 2012 and there being no indication of impairment.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs. These calculations use 
cash flow projections on actual operating results and management forecasts.  Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

The three year plan is a bottom up process which takes place as part of the annual budget process. The three year plan is prepared by each 
reporting entities’ management reflecting their view of the local market, known projects and experience of past performance. The annual 
budget and the three year plan are approved by the Board each year.
ii) Long term growth rates
In the period after the three year plan growth rates are forecast at 2% per annum for each CGU (2011: 2%). A rate of 2% is considered to 
be prudent considering the significant organic growth of the business over the last 10 years.
iii) Discount rates
Rotork divisions operate in all the same industry sectors and markets around the world. Therefore discount rates for each of the CGUs are 
considered to be 10.4% (2011: 9.8%) which represents a reasonable rate for a market participant in this sector.
Sensitivity analysis
Base case forecasts have significant headroom above the carrying value of each CGU with the exception of Fairchild. Sensitivity analysis has 
been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonable change in assumptions. With the exception of Fairchild, there is no 
reasonable change that would cause the carrying values to exceed the recoverable amount.
With regard to Fairchild, which has only been part of the Group for 14 months downside sensitivities have been assessed. An increase in 
the discount rate to 12.8% would result in the goodwill being impaired. If the long term growth rate was 3%, the discount rate would 
need to increase to 13.6% for the goodwill to become impaired. It is anticipated as Fairchild becomes more established within the Group 
and leverages the sales network opportunities the long term growth rate should comfortably exceed the 2.0% growth rate assumed in the 
base case forecast. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

A deferred tax asset of £12,984,000 (2011: £13,244,000) has been recognised at 31 December 2012. The directors are of the opinion, 
based on recent and forecast trading, that the level of profits in the current and future years make it more likely than not that these assets 
will be recovered. 
A deferred tax asset of £1,807,000 (2011: £1,958,000) has not been recognised in relation to capital losses and certain tax credits, tax 
losses and other temporary differences. These assets may be recovered if sufficient taxable or capital profits are made in future in the 
companies concerned.

basic earnings per share
Earnings per share is calculated for both the current and previous years using the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders for the 
year. The earnings per share calculation is based on 86.6m shares (2011: 86.5m shares) being the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue (net of own ordinary shares held) for the year.

shares). The number of shares is equal to the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (net of own ordinary shares held) 
adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. The Company has three categories of potentially dilutive ordinary 
shares: those share options granted to employees under the Share option scheme and Sharesave plan where the exercise price is less than 
the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and contingently issuable shares awarded under the Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP).

The individual return assumptions for each asset class are based on market conditions at 31 December 2012 and represent a best estimate 
of future returns for that class allowing for risk premiums where appropriate. No scheme assets are invested in the Group’s own equity.
The Group estimates that cash contributions to the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes during 2013 will be £3,476,000 for regular 
payments and additional payments of £1,700,000 in relation to past service (2012: £7,300,000).
The mortality assumptions used are the S1NXA year of birth tables with future improvements in mortality based on the CMI_2009 
projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum (2011: 1.5%).
By way of example the respective mortality tables indicate the following life expectancy:

ii) o ther pension plans
The Group makes a contribution to a number of defined contribution plans around the world to provide benefits for employees upon 
retirement. Total expense relating to these plans in the year was £2,558,000 (2011: 2,565,000).

The Group awards shares under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and under the Save As You Earn scheme. The share-based payment 
expense included in the income statement for each of the plans can be analysed as follows:
2012 2011
LTIP - equity settled 1,782 1,057
Sharesave plan 248 194
Total expense recognised as employee costs (note 6) 2,030 1,251
volatility assumptions for equity-based payments
The expected volatility of all equity compensation benefits is based on the historic volatility (calculated based on the weighted average 
remaining life of each benefit), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
a) Share option scheme
At 1 January 1995 the Group established a share option programme for employees. The allocation of options was linked to the completion of 
service. In accordance with the programme, once vested the options grant the right to purchase shares at the market price at the date of 
grant. Options vested after three years and expire 10 years after being granted. No new grants have been made under the scheme since 2004. 
Options over 6,480 shares were outstanding at the beginning of the year. During 2012 all remaining options (2011: 5,332) were exercised 
and the Group received proceeds of £25,000 (2011: £17,000) at a weighted average exercise price of £3.87 (2011: £3.14).  Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

c) l ong term incentive plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is a performance share plan under which shares are conditionally allocated to selected members of 
senior management at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis. Following shareholder approval of the LTIP at the 
Company’s AGM on 18 May 2000, awards over shares are made to executive directors and senior managers each year.  Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

2009 LTIP award
No shares or cash units will normally be released to participants unless they are still in the Group’s service following completion of three 
year performance periods and the Company’s relative total shareholder return (TSR) against a comparator group of companies places it in 
at least the 50th percentile position in the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period. 
TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement. The actual number of shares or 
cash units transferred will be determined by the number of shares or cash units initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage. The 
actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be 30% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile with each 
percentile position above the 50th adding 2.8% to the vesting percentage. The Company’s earnings per share (EPS) is also monitored 
during the relevant performance period to ensure it meets a minimum average annual growth equal to the rise in the Retail Price Index (RPI) 
plus 2% per annum. Failure to meet the RPI requirement will result in nil vesting.
The performance period for the 2009 awards ended on 31 December 2011. Messrs. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent actuaries 
certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 30.0% vesting of this award as the Company was in the 50th percentile relative 
to the comparator group and the Group’s EPS growth has exceeded the minimum average annual growth in the RPI plus 2% per annum. 
The awards vested during 2012.
2010 LTIP plan
Following shareholder approval of the 2010 LTIP plan at the Company’s AGM on 23 April 2010, awards of shares have been made 
annually to executive and senior managers. Half of these awards vest under a TSR performance condition and half under an EPS 
performance condition.
TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement. The actual number of shares 
transferred will be determined by the number of shares initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage. The actual number of shares 
transferred will be 25% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile.
The EPS performance condition is satisfied with 15% of the awards vesting if the EPS growth is RPI + 10% over the vesting period up to a 
maximum of 100% vesting if EPS growth exceeds RPI +25%.
The performance period for the 2010 awards ended on 31 December 2012. Messrs. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent actuaries 
certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 75.5% vesting of these awards based on the performance criteria of the 
scheme. The awards will vest during 2013.

Financial risk and treasury policies
The Treasury department maintains liquidity, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk, manages relations with the Group’s bankers 
and provides a treasury service to the Group’s businesses. Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are 
conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risk. The Group Treasury 
department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no 
underlying exposure. Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net  
exposure may be hedged.
a) c redit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and cash on deposit with financial institutions. 
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of 
credit insurance covering 80% to 90% of trade receivables at any time. Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit 
above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set around this depending on the value of the sale. At the balance sheet date there 
were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non–payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group maintains an allowance for impairment in respect of non–insured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
The Group Treasury Committee meets regularly and reviews the credit risk associated with institutions that hold a material cash balance. As 
well as credit ratings, counterparties and instruments are assessed for credit default swap pricing and liquidity of funds. Rotork plc  Annual Report 2012

b) l iquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on 
investments. Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses; it also maintains a 
£7m overdraft facility (2011: £7m) on which interest would be payable at base rate plus 1.5%. In January 2013 the Group arranged a £15m 
committed loan facility with a tenor of one year. Interest is payable on this committed facility at LIBOR plus 1%.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting

Where a counterparty experiences credit stress then the foreign exchange contracts may be settled on a net basis but standard practice is 
to settle on a gross basis and the undiscounted gross outflow in respect of these contracts is £134,353,000 (2011: £116,580,000) and the

c) market risk
Market risk arises from changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, and may affect the Group’s results. The objective 
of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
i) Currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the business unit’s 
functional currency. The currencies primarily giving rise to this risk are the US dollar and related currencies and the euro. The Group hedges 
up to 75% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward exchange contracts. In respect of other non–sterling 
monetary assets and liabilities the exposures may also be hedged up to 75% where this is deemed appropriate.
As part of the Group’s cash management some of the overseas subsidiaries have loan and deposit balances where their intra–group 
counterparty is in the UK. The balances are typically in local currency for the subsidiary so the UK holds a foreign currency current asset or 
liability which is usually hedged through the use of foreign exchange swaps. At the balance sheet date only the ‘forward’ part of the swap 
remains and this is designated as a cash flow hedge to match the currency exposure of the intercompany loan asset.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts (that hedge both the forecast sale and purchase transactions and the intercompany 
loan and deposit balances) as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. The net fair value of foreign exchange contracts used as 
hedges at 31 December 2012 was a £2,158,000 asset (2011: £378,000 asset) comprising an asset of £2,254,000 (2011: £992,000) and a 
liability of £96,000 (2011: £614,000). Forward exchange contracts in place at 31 December 2012 mature in 2013 and 2014.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and 
for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the income statement. 
Sensitivity analysis
It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal (in particular other exchange rates), a general change of one cent in the value of 
either the US dollar or euro against sterling would have had an impact on the Group’s operating profit for the year ended 31 December 
2012 of £350,000 (2011: £350,000). The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the transaction 
impact of US dollar and euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year:
a verage rate c losing rate
2012 2011 2012 2011
US dollar 1.59 1.59 1.62 1.55
Euro 1.23 1.15 1.23 1.20
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area. All cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and the majority is 
available with same day notice, though deposits are sometimes made with a maturity of no more than three months. The main element of 
interest rate risk concerns sterling, US dollar, euro and renminbi deposits, all of which are on a floating rate basis.
The interest rate profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows:
2012 2011
Fixed rate financial liabilities 150 269
Floating rate financial liabilities 22 83
172 352
The fixed and floating rate financial liabilities comprise finance leases, preference shares and bank loans. The floating rate lease obligations 
bear interest at rates determined by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial liabilities is 1.1%, or 6.3% excluding the zero rate debt (2011: 1.6% or 5.3%). 
The weighted average period for which (non zero) interest rates on the fixed rate financial liabilities are fixed is 1.7 years. Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

d) c apital risk management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure it maintains sufficient capital in order to support its business and 
maximise shareholder value. The group has an asset-light business model and uses cash generated from operations to either invest organically 
or by acquisition. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic and market conditions. 
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders or issue new shares. 
The Group defines capital as net funds and equity attributable to shareholders (see note 17). There are no externally imposed restrictions 
on the Group’s capital structure.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators:
i) Group net funds 
2012 2011

Basis for determining fair values
The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in 
the table above.
i) Designated cash flow hedges
Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the appropriate value dates, and gains and 
losses are taken to equity. 
ii) Trade and other receivables/payables
As the majority of receivables/payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
iii) Contingent consideration
As all the contingent consideration is contractually due for payment within 15 months, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.

a. a ccountin G policie S
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
financial statements. Notes a to k relate to the Company rather than the Group.
basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK GAAP. 
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account. 
Under FRS 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the Group includes the 
Company in its own published consolidated financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 and has not disclosed transactions with entities which are 
subsidiaries of the Group.
The Group financial statements contain financial instruments disclosures which comply with FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. 
Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 not to present separate financial instrument disclosures for 
the Company.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the 
Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee 
contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the 
guarantee. The Company continues to account for intra–group cross guarantees under FRS 12.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on 
translation are included in the profit and loss account.
investments
Investments are measured at cost less any provision for impairment and comprise investments in subsidiary companies.
depreciation and amortisation
Freehold land is not depreciated. Long leasehold buildings are amortised over 50 years or the expected useful life of the building where less 
than 50 years. Other assets are depreciated by equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at 
the following annual rates:
Freehold buildings   2% to 4%
Short leasehold buildings  period of lease
Plant and equipment  10% to 33%
post-retirement benefits
The Company participates in a UK Group pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable salary. The assets of the scheme 
are held separately from those of the Company. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the 
scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 Retirement benefits, accounts for the scheme as if it 
were a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to 
the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
c lassification of preference shares
Following the adoption of the presentation elements of FRS 25, Financial Instruments, the cumulative redeemable preference shares issued 
by the Company are classified as long term debt. The preference dividends are charged within interest payable.

Share-based payments
The Company has adopted FRS 20 and the accounting policies followed are in all material respects the same as the Group’s policy under 
IFRS 2. This policy is shown in note 1 to the Group financial statements. Costs in relation to share-based awards made to other Group 
company employees are recharged to each subsidiary company.
deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full, without discounting, on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more 
tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law, except for 
the items explained below. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in 
periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences 
arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the assets or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where 
there is no commitment to remit those earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not 
that they will be recovered.
dividends
Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid. Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in 
the period which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

Share-based payments
The share-based payment charge relates to employees of the Company participating in the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The disclosures 
required under FRS 20 can be found in note 25 to the Group Financial Statements. The table below sets out the movement of share options 
under the LTIP for employees of the Company.

The above ten year history has not been restated to apply IFRS to all periods. Had this exercise been undertaken the major changes would 
have been the removal of amortisation of goodwill and the introduction of amortisation of separable intangibles, capitalisation and 
amortisation of development costs and charges for share-based payments. Dividends shown in the IFRS columns are on a paid basis but in 
the UK GAAP columns are on an accrued basis.

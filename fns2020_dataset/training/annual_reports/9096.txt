The Drozhilovskoye molybdenum-tungsten 
deposit is located in the Denisovski rayon of 
the Kostanayskaya oblast, 55km north east of 
Zhitigara and 31km north west of the rayon 
centre, Denisovka. The small settlement of 
Okrainka lies some 4km from the deposit.
The deposit area covers approximately 6.6km
2
. 
In addition to the molybdenum and tungsten 
content, the deposit is also thought to contain 
quantities of bismuth, beryl, lithium, rubidium, 
caesium, copper, gold and silver.
Since the deposit was discovered in 1964, 
considerable exploration work has taken 
place culminating in the most recent resource 
statement undertaken in 2005 (using the 
former Soviet Union resource and reserve 
classification system common in Central  
Asia), which estimated a GKZ approved 
Category C1 and C2 resource estimate for 
the northern stockwork of 37.2Mt at 0.107% 
molybdenum and 0.086% tungsten trioxide. 
This assumed a 0.05% molybdenum equivalent 
cut-off grade. Importantly, the first resource 
estimate undertaken in 1974 defined a GKZ 
approved estimate for the whole deposit  
at a C2 category of approximately 140Mt  
at 0.188% molybdenum. Subsequently 
additional drilling has been done and  
the latest non JORC resource estimated  
is presented in the Chief Executive  
Officer’s report.

The Smirnovskoye molybdenum-tungsten-
copper deposit is located in the Karabalyksky 
rayon, 120km north west of the Kostanay oblast 
and some 41km north of Karabalyk, the district 
centre in northern Kazakhstan. The village  
of Smirnovka is in the immediate vicinity  
of the deposit. The deposit area covers 
approximately 13.7km
2
.
The deposit has been divided into  
a larger northern and a smaller southern  
zone. Within both zones, the principal ore 
mineral is molybdenite which is associated 
with chalcopyrite and pyrite. Other minerals 
are rare.
The deposit has been studied in less detail than 
Drozhilovskoye, although a 1996, GKZ approved, 
resource estimate produced a combined 
Category C1 and C2 resource for both the 
larger northern and smaller southern zones  
of approximately 109Mt at a grade of 0.1378% 
molybdenum using a 0.05% molybdenum 
equivalent cut-off grade.
A further estimate was undertaken in 2007 
which gave an estimate of 108Mt at a grade  
of 0.1056% molybdenum using the same  
cut-off grade. Subsequently, additional drilling 
has been undertaken and the latest non  
JORC resource estimated is presented  
in the Chief Executive Officer’s report.

Chairman’s statement 
//Strategic report
The Company has continued to develop its significant deposits  
against the background of falling prices.
2014 was a challenging year for the development 
of Kemin’s molybdenum and tungsten deposits in 
Drozhilovskoye and Smirnovskoye which are both  
located in north west Kazakhstan.
Molybdenum, which is primarily used for strengthening 
steel, has been hit hard by the lower demand for 
steelmaking by China and other large steel producers.  
At the beginning of 2013 the price for molybdenum 
oxide was $26,400/t and this had fallen to $22,500/t  
by the commencement of 2014. The price subsequently  
fell further in early May 2015 to $17,500/t, a reduction  
of 34% since January 2013. 
Similarly, from January 2013 to May 2015 the price  
of ferro tungsten has also fallen by 22%. Although both 
Kemin’s deposits are predominately molybdenum ore,  
the potential tungsten concentrates revenues add  
a major positive financial impact to the deposits.
Importantly, both Drozhilovskoye and Smirnovskoye 
have molybdenum grades that are superior to many 
other mines and the tungsten credits strengthen the 
economics of the deposits further. In addition to this 
the Company will also benefit from the support of the 
Kazakhstan government as both Drozhilovskoye and 
Smirnovskoye are included within its State Programme  
on Accelerated Industrial Innovative Development 
(SPAIID). We expect that this will lead to assistance in the 
construction of infrastructure and aid to the Company  
with tax related incentives.
The Board expects molybdenum and tungsten prices  
to recover in the longer term given an improvement in 
the world economy. Overall we remain confident that 
the demand for high quality steels using molybdenum 
will continue and much of that demand will come from 
China, a neighbour and trading partner of Kazakhstan. 
Kazakhstan and China already have well established 
railway networks that link both countries for cross  
border trading.
In order to gauge the options available to the Company, 
the Board has opened preliminary discussions directly 
with potential partners in China on how best to 
develop the projects and how to access markets for 
our molybdenum and tungsten concentrates. This 
work remains ongoing and further updates will be 
reported as progress is made. The Board has noted some 
encouraging early interest from Chinese participants in 
the molybdenum and tungsten industries.
The Board and I agree that the Drozhilovskoye and 
Smirnovskoye deposits provide a very compelling 
development opportunity with good grades, simple  
low strip ratio open-pit mining and we are well located 
to the largest market for molybdenum and tungsten 
concentrates. The drop in the molybdenum and tungsten 
prices has encouraged us to make changes to the cut-off 
grade we use in estimating our JORC resources, with a 
view to how the projects may be developed. However,  
our overall view of these projects has not wavered. 
Drozhilovskoye and Smirnovskoye are exceptional, long 
life deposits with significant exploration potential beyond 
the reserves and resources already identified. The Board is 
keen to progress the projects and is working closely with 
the Government of Kazakhstan on the financing  
of a potential trial 1Mtpa mine at Drozhilovskoye.
Finally I would like to thank our staff and consultants 
who have worked diligently in progressing the technical 
work required to advance both the Drozhilovskoye and 
Smirnovskoye deposits.

Chief Executive Officer’s report 
2014 saw major falls in the demand for mineral resources relating to the  
steel industry including molybdenum and tungsten, and the Company  
is reviewing its strategy based on the changing parameters.
Background to strategic review
A strategic review was considered prudent during a  
time of falling demand for steel and the inevitable fall 
in the price of the commodities used to make speciality 
steels. The outcome of the strategic review resulted in a 
revision of Kemin’s reserve and resource estimates using 
a higher cut-off grade. This was to ensure that the reserve 
and resource base provided a robust financial outcome at 
a time of low commodity prices. In addition the cost base 
of the Company was reviewed to conserve cash resources 
during this developmental stage of the Company.
The intention of the strategic review was to prepare 
a reserve and resource statement that would ensure 
both deposits would remain profitable even with low 
commodity prices well into the future. This strategy is 
supported by known exploration targets that indicate 
that with more drilling, significant resources and 
ultimately reserves can be added to the current reserves 
and resources. This will extend the life of both deposits 
well beyond the current resource base.
Both the Drozhilovskoye and Smirnovskoye deposits are 
large, near surface ore bodies that allow simple open-pit 
mining at low strip ratios. The Drozhilovskoye deposit is 
intended to be developed well before the Smirnovskoye 
deposit due to the fact that the molybdenum and 
tungsten grades are much higher than those at 
Smirnovskoye plus there is significantly more drilling  
and metallurgical test work completed at Drozhilovskoye.
The impact of the strategic review has delayed  
the development timeline but this work was critical  
in ensuring a robust development strategy was put  
in place. The impact of remodelling the geological data  
of both deposits, to reflect lower commodity prices 
and the development of supporting mining options 
has delayed the development timeline by nine months. 
Although it is disappointing, this work has been crucial  
in ensuring Kemin develops the deposits to maximise  
the value for its shareholders in a time of expected  
lower prices for molybdenum and tungsten.
As part of the finalisation of the strategic review, Kemin 
engaged Venmyn Deloitte to prepare an independent 
Competent Persons Report (CPR) for the Drozhilovskoye 
and the Smirnovskoye deposits. As part of this process 
Venmyn Deloitte also assisted Kemin, by coordinating 
with both Datamine Pty and Eurus Mineral Consultants, 
with studies relating to the mine plan and metallurgical 
test work. Datamine Pty provided investigations into the 
optimum mining scenarios for both the Drozhilovskoye 
and Smirnovskoye deposits aimed at maximising Net 
Present Values. Eurus Mineral Consultants completed an 
independent review of the metallurgical test work and 
proposed flow sheets for the mineral processing plants  
at Drozhilovskoye. 
Mineral resource statement
The full CPR is currently in the final stages and is  
expected to be published in Q3 2015. This is 
expected to reclassify the resources under the 
JORC (2012) code from the previously reported 
GKZ classifications reproduced below.
The Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration 
Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (“the 
JORC code”) is a professional code of practice that sets 
minimum standards for Public Reporting of minerals 
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. 
The JORC code provides a mandatory system for the 
classification of minerals Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves according to the levels  
of confidence in geological knowledge and the technical  
and economic considerations in Public Reports. 
 
The current edition of the code was published in 2012, 
and moving to a JORC based classification is expected  
to have a number of benefits and is expected to define 
much more clearly the targets to be developed.

Chief Executive Officer’s report (continued)
//Strategic report
Local support for our projects
During 2014, Kemin was also able to announce that  
its Smirnovskoye and Drozhilovskoye deposits have  
been approved for inclusion in the State Programme  
on Accelerated Industrial Innovative Development 
(SPAIID). These assets have been identified as strategic 
mineral developments for Kazakhstan, and the 
Government will:
• build infrastructure to connect Kemin’s planned 
processing plant to the Bukhara-Ural gas pipeline, 
and will provide electricity, water and transportation 
networks;
• ensure regulatory approvals are issued in a timely 
manner. Additionally, the Government of Kazakhstan 
has enacted broad legislative changes that will further 
increase state support for key mineral development 
projects including:
• income tax exemptions for 10 years;
• land tax exemptions for 10 years;
• property tax exemptions for 8 years;
• reimbursement of up to 30% of project capital 
expenditure;
• guarantees to keep tax rates and state tariffs 
unchanged for a period of 10 years;
• policies to allow investors to hire foreign staff  
for the period of construction without applying  
labour quotas.
The impact of this support by the Government  
of Kazakhstan and the proposed legislative changes 
has further strengthened the investment case for 
both deposits and considerably reduced the risk, and 
should aid the Company in receiving the necessary 
development permits in a timely manner. This is  
an important step forward for both deposits 
development prospects.
Looking forward
Following the conclusion of the CPR, management 
expects to commission a definitive feasibility study  
for the Drozhilovskoye deposit initially, and anticipates 
that this will be completed during early 2016.
With the support of the Government of Kazakhstan, 
the Board is continuing to review the option of a pilot 
processing plant of 1 million tonne pa (Mtpa) capacity 
as an initial early, quick start, investment option prior to 
the major investment required at the 5Mtpa operation at 
Drozhilovskoye and then Smirnovskoye. 
 
This provides a unique opportunity to:
• test and improve enrichment technology;
• establish a customer base;
• define an efficient logistics chain to customers.
These discussions, whilst ongoing, were delayed during 
2014 as part of the strategic review to ensure that a 
robust development scenario is in place for the 1 Mtpa 
prior to any finalisation of financing.
China offers a variety of options to Kemin in terms  
of off-take agreements, potential joint venture partners 
who wish to supplement their access to molybdenum 
and tungsten concentrates, and metals and mining 
companies producing molybdenum and tungsten.  
At this early stage Kemin has conducted an initial 
scoping study to better understand its options in  
China and the interest of Chinese companies in doing 
business with Kemin. Kemin has been pleased by the 
initial interest shown by Chinese companies and looks 
forward to further discussions in due course.

Financial performance review
The consolidated loss attributable to Kemin Resources 
shareholders in the twelve months ended 31 December 
2014 was £818,000 (FY 2013: £3,092,000 loss). These 
costs relate to the ongoing administrative costs and 
capital costs in developing the projects. In 2013 the 
costs were much higher as they principally related to 
higher legal and professional costs associated with the 
reverse takeover. In addition, a non-recurring adjustment 
was made for the share based payment arising as part 
of the reverse takeover of £2.6m. The strategic review 
conducted during 2014 has led to a significant reduction 
in ongoing head office costs. 
Cash spend is tightly monitored against budgets and the 
limited capital expenditure programme. 
The Company is continuing to spend resources  
on capital development and aiming to control all costs 
within tight financial limits. In the current year £1,162,000 
was spent on development of the projects, resulting  
in total capital spend to date on both projects of £2.8m.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks exposed to the Company are:
• availability of future funding;
• political and economic environment;
• fluctuation in commodity prices;
• financial risk; 
• the resource differing in grade and quantity  
to that predicted by feasibility studies.
Mitigation of risks and uncertainties
The Company’s management has analysed the risks and 
uncertainties and monitors the risks as far as it is practical 
given the early development of the Group.
While the Company has sufficient working capital 
facilities at present to meet its cash flow requirements,  
it is considering the availability of future funding options. 
The Company is reviewing its capital structure in this 
regard with the aim to fix interest rates, where possible, 
and with the preferred option to raise funds via equity.
Certain factors are beyond the control of the Company 
such as the fluctuations in the price of the commodities 
it is going to extract and possible political upheaval. 
However the Company is aware of these factors and 
tries to mitigate them as far as possible. The Company 
maintains close relationships with the Kazakhstan 
authorities, in order to minimise bureaucratic delays  
and problems.
In relation to the commodity prices, the project  
model, which has now been remodelled based on  
the movement in commodity prices suggests sufficient 
headroom given the low cost base which will provide 
a buffer against the effect of any further downward 
pressure on commodity prices.
The Company has used independent consultants, 
experienced in resource reports of the type required  
by the Company, to mitigate as far as possible any 
material changes in the resource estimates. It has 
recently further enhanced the estimates by engaging  
a well respected firm to obtain a JORC (2012) compliant 
resource statement. Further drilling will be undertaken  
as necessary based on the future project plan.
Key performance indicators
Given the stage of development of the Company,  
the key performance indicators used by the 
management for monitoring progress and strategic 
objectives for the business are set out below: 
The key statistic is the level of resources which has been 
measured by an independent consultancy.
Given the stage of development of the Group, it has  
a low number of employees who are concentrated  
in the head office. Details of the Group policy on 
employees is given on page 09.

Directors’ report
//Governance
The Directors present their report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Principal activity and business review
The principal activity of the Company is that of an exploration and mine development company with a trading subsidiary in Kazakhstan. A review  
of the business and future prospects is contained in the Strategic report, which includes information on the Company’s principal risks and uncertainties  
and performance indicators to the extent they are relevant at this stage of the Company’s development. Although the financial statements are prepared  
on a going concern basis, reference should be made to the ability of the Company to continue trading as noted below.
Going concern and the availability of project finance
The Group’s principal assets are the molybdenum and tungsten deposits at Drozhilovskoye and Smirnovskoye in Kazakhstan. The updated studies  
indicate substantial economic exploitable reserves. This will be underpinned by a feasibility study which is expected to be completed in 2016. At this stage 
the Group will access the requirements for future funding and implement a strategy to raise the project finance required for the long-term development 
needs of the Company. 
The Directors anticipate that, whilst the Group may seek to raise further finance in the future, it now has access to sufficient funding for its immediate needs. 
The Group is currently funded by a working capital facility that is being provided by a company controlled by its principal shareholder. Cash flows indicate 
that it expects to have sufficient cash flow from this facility to finance its on-going operational requirements. The Directors are confident that further sources 
of funding can be acquired in the timescales required to meet the future funding requirements as necessary.
On this basis the Directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.

The Company’s policy on Executive Director Remuneration is to attract and retain high quality executives by paying competitive remuneration packages 
relevant to each Director’s role and experience and the external market. 
The key management personnel comprises only the Directors.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic report, the Directors’ report, the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under Company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Company and of the loss of the Group for that period. The Directors are also required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of  
the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative Investment Market.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union or United Kingdom Accounting Standards,  
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s and Group’s transactions  
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Kemin Resources Plc  Annual Report 2014 10
Directors’ report (continued)
//Governance
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the financial statements are made available on a website. Financial statements are 
published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the 
Directors which extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
Communications with shareholders are considered important by the Directors. The Directors regularly speak to investors and analysts during the year.  
Press releases have been issued throughout the year, a website www.keminresources.com is regularly updated and contains a wide range of information 
about the Company.
Corporate governance
The Directors are aware of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) (formerly the Combined Code), the new edition of which was published by the 
UK Financial Reporting Council in September 2012 and is applicable to all premium listed companies on the London Stock Exchange. As a company which 
is listed on AIM, the Company is not required to comply with the Code, but the Directors intend to comply with its main provisions as far as is practicable 
having regard to the size of the Group.
Board composition and committees
The Directors who served during the year are shown on page 08.
The Directors have responsibility for the overall corporate governance of the Group and recognise the need for the highest standards of behaviour and 
accountability. The Directors are committed to the principles underlying best practice in corporate governance and intend to comply with the principles  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code in such respects as they consider appropriate for a company of its size and nature. The Board has a wide range  
of experience directly relevant to the Group and its activities and its structure ensures that no one individual or group dominates the decision making.  
At each Annual General Meeting, one third of the Directors must retire by rotation, whereupon they can offer themselves for re-election if eligible.
The Company has established an Audit Committee which is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly reported  
and monitored, considering and setting adequate and appropriate accounting policies and reviewing the Auditor’s report. The Audit Committee comprises 
two Directors who are considered to be independent, being Non-Executive Director Ken Crichton and Non-Executive Vice Chairman Ashar Qureshi.
Internal controls
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The procedures which include, inter alia, financial, operational and compliance matters and risk management are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The internal 
control system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Directors do not believe an internal audit 
function is practicable for a company of this size.
Subsequent events
Details of events after the end of the financial year are set out in note 20 on page 32 of the financial statements.
Auditors
All of the current Directors have taken all of the steps that they ought to haver taken to make themselves aware of any information needed by the Company’s 
auditors for the purpose of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of this information. The Directors are not aware of any relevant audit 
information of which the auditors are unaware.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418(2) of the Companies Act 2006.
BDO LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed in the forthcoming  
Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at the offices of Gowlings (UK) LLP, 15th Floor, 125 Old Broad Street, London, EC2N 1AR  
on 29 June 2015 at 11:30am. 
The Directors consider that all of the resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.  
The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of all resolutions.
The Directors’ report has been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:

//Financial statements
1. Accounting policies
Nature of operations and general information
The Group’s principal activity is that of mining, exploration and mine development. The parent company’s principal activity is managing the trade and  
the investment of its subsidiary company. It is incorporated in England and Wales and has its registered office and business address at 28 Eccleston Square, 
London SW1V 1NZ. The shares of Kemin Resources Plc are quoted on the AIM market which is operated by the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are for the year ended 31 December 2014. They have been prepared in accordance with the accounting 
policies set out below.
The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the  
European Union.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis. They are presented in Pound Sterling and are rounded  
to the nearest thousand (£’000) except where otherwise noted.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with the adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires Group 
management to exercise judgment in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas where significant judgments are estimates and have been made  
in preparing the financial statements, and their effects, are disclosed in note 2.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the profit or loss account of Kemin Resources Plc is not presented.
Going concern
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had cash in hand of £704,000 and at the reporting date the Group’s liabilities exceeded its assets by £968,000.
The parent company has an agreement with Amrita Investment Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and ultimately controlled  
by the Assaubayev family, for the provision of an unsecured £7m loan facility to be applied towards working capital requirements. At present there  
is still a facility of approximately £5m available under this facility. The Company has received confirmation that liquid funds of not less than £5m are held  
by Amrita with a financial institution. To compliment this the Company raised equity of £1.9m (net of fees) during the year.
The loan bears an interest rate of LIBOR +5%. The loan is repayable on the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the agreement or on the date of a fundraising 
completed date in respect of any equity fundraising, raising at least £5m (before expenses) at which point the Lender may choose to convert  
the loan in the ordinary shares of the Company at the conversion rates stipulated by the agreement.
The Directors anticipate that while they may seek to raise further finance in the future but presently has access to sufficient funds for its immediate need,  
and have therefore prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis.
New accounting standards and amendments
A number of new standards and amendments to existing standards and interpretations were applicable from 1 January 2014. The adoption  
of these amendments did not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The management are evaluating the impact of new standards amendments to standards and interpretations which have been issued but are  
not yet effective. However they are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s earnings or shareholders’ funds.
Basis of consolidation
Business combinations
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements was adopted in the year to replace IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. The adoption  
of IFRS 10 has had no material impact on the financial statements.
Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if all three of the following elements  
are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable 
returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed a single entity. Inter-company 
transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the statement of financial position, 
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired 
operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are de-consolidated  
from the date on which control ceases.
Segmental reporting
In the opinion of the Directors, who are regarded as the chief operating decision makers, the Group has one business activity, being the exploration for,  
and development of, the molybdenum, copper and tungsten deposits in Kazakhstan.
The Board of Directors considers there to be only one operating segment, the exploration and development of mineral resources and only one geographical 
segment, being Kazakhstan. Therefore no additional segmental information is presented. Kemin Resources Plc  Annual Report 2014 19

Foreign currency translation
Transactions entered into by the Group entities in currencies other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate  
(their “functional currency”) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occurred. The functional currency of KMRC is the Kazakh Tenge which  
is the currency of KMRC’s primary economic environment in which it operates. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates 
ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately  
in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into Pound Sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took 
place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the 
opening net assets at the opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the foreign exchange reserve.
On the disposal of foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation up to  
the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provision  
of the instrument.
Financial assets
Financial assets of the Group consist of other receivables and cash.
All financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are initially recognised  
at fair value plus transaction costs.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Trade and other 
receivables and cash are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using  
the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in profit  
or loss.
De-recognition of financial instruments occurs when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire or are transferred and substantially  
all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. An assessment for impairment is undertaken at least at each reporting date whether  
or not there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject  
to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include bank loans, finance lease liabilities, convertible loan stock, bank overdrafts, trade and other payables.
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. All financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs.
Interest-free loans and loans below market rate received are initially recorded at fair value. They are estimated using discounted cash flow forecasts,  
based on a risk-adjusted discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the loans, with reference to the market rates for loans to similar companies.  
The difference between the fair value and the loan received is recorded within equity, where the loans provided by parties controlled by the Company’s 
ultimate controlling party.
Subsequently, all financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an 
expense in finance cost in profit or loss. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged  
to profit or loss using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled  
in the period in which they arise.
A financial liability is de-recognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual agreements of the instrument. All interest related charges  
are recognised as an expense in “Finance costs” in the income statement.
Trade payables are recognised initially at their fair value net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost less settlement payments. Kemin Resources Plc  Annual Report 2014 20

//Financial statements
1. Accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities continued
Loans that have a convertible element into equity comprise both a liability and an equity component. The elements are classified in accordance with their 
contractual provisions. At the date of issue, the liability component is recorded at fair value, which is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for  
a similar debt instrument without the equity conversion feature. Thereafter, the liability component is accounted for as a financial liability in accordance  
with the above.
The residual is the equity component, which is accounted for as an equity instrument.
Upon a conversion of a loan, a number of ordinary shares may be issued corresponding to the value of the loan note being converted and the agreed 
conversion value of the loan note. The corresponding carrying value of the loan liability and loan equity reserve are released, and the difference between 
these and the nominal value of the shares issued on conversion is recognised as share premium. Where the terms of the instrument are revised, the 
instrument is accounted for as a new instrument.
Exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation assets comprise of exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred on projects where insufficient work has been performed  
to confirm whether significant mineralisation exists or whether the project is economically feasible. Costs are capitalised as intangible assets until the  
decision is made to proceed to development, in which case the related expenditures are transferred to noncurrent assets as mining properties unless  
the projects are determined not to be commercially viable, in which case the related costs are written off to the statement of comprehensive income. 
Depreciation on non-current assets used on exploration and evaluation projects is capitalised. Exploration and evaluation assets are not amortised.
Pre-licence costs are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed at each reporting year to determine whether there are indicators that assets might be impaired.
An impairment review is undertaken when indicators of impairment arise, typically when one of the following circumstances applies:
• sufficient data exists that renders the resource uneconomic and unlikely to be developed;
• title to the asset is compromised;
• budgeted or planned expenditure is not expected in the forseeable future;
• insufficient discovery of commercially viable resources leading to the discontinuation of activities.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided to write  
off the cost of such assets, other than land, over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis. The periods generally applicable are:
Buildings 5% pa
Production machinery and equipment Between 5% and 20% pa
Impairment of assets
The carrying amount of non-current assets is compared to the recoverable amount of the assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  
that the net book value may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing the value in use, the expected future cash flows from the assets is determined by applying a discount rate to the anticipated pre-tax future cash 
flows. Impairment is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets’ recoverable amount. 
The revised carrying amounts are depreciated/amortised in line with accounting policies.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the conditions that originally resulted  
in the impairment. The reversal is recognised in the profit and loss account and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined,  
net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior reporting years.
Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (“cash generating units”) for the purposes of assessing 
impairment. The estimates of future discounted cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties including the future commodity prices. It is therefore 
reasonably possible that changes could occur which may affect the recoverability of assets. Kemin Resources Plc  Annual Report 2014 21

Income taxes
Current income tax assets and liabilities comprise those obligations to fiscal authorities in the countries in which the Group carries out its operations.  
They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal period and the country to which they relate provided they are enacted  
or substantively enacted by the reporting date. All changes to current tax liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the profit or loss account.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. This involves the comparison of the carrying amount of assets  
and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with their respective tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of 
goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits  
will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected  
to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event,  
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate,  
the risks specific to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance expense in the statement of comprehensive income as it occurs.
Provisions are made for the estimated rehabilitation/decommissioning costs relating to areas disturbed during the mines’ operation up to the reporting  
date but not yet rehabilitated. Such provisions are been made in accordance with local legislation.
The estimated cost of rehabilitation includes the current cost of re-contouring, top-soiling and re-vegetation in accordance with legislative requirements. 
Changes in estimates are dealt with on a prospective basis as they arise.
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historic  
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future,  
actual experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within  
the next financial year are discussed below.
(i) Carrying values of exploration and evaluation assets and property, plant and equipment
The Group monitors internal and external indicators of impairment relating to its exploration and evaluation assets and property, plant and  
equipment. Management has considered whether any indicators of impairment have arisen over certain assets relating to the Company’s mining  
operations. After assessing these, management has concluded that no impairment has arisen in respect of these assets during each year.
(ii) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on the management’s estimates of the number of years  
over which the assets will generate economic benefits. This is periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Due to the long lives of certain assets, 
changes to the estimates used could result in significant variations in the carrying values.
(iii) Decommissioning and rehabilitation
The ultimate decommissioning and site restoration costs are uncertain and can be impacted by changes to legislation, restoration techniques and changes  
to the expected timing of closure resulting from changes to ore reserves. As a result, there could be significant adjustments to the provisions established  
which would affect future results.
(iv) Base of mining operations
The Group’s primary base of operations is in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan’s economy continues to display certain characteristics of an emerging market.  
These characteristics include, in particular, inconvertibility of the national currency in most countries outside of Kazakhstan and relatively high inflation rates. 
The Kazakh tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations and frequent changes. The financial information has been prepared  
on the assumption that no significant adverse changes to the economic, regulatory and fiscal environment will arise.
(v) Fair value of financial instruments
The Group determines the fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted, based on estimates using present values or other valuation techniques. 
Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. Where market prices are not 
readily available, fair value is either based on estimates obtained from independent experts of quoted market prices of comparable instruments. In this regard, 
the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison with independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realised immediately.
(vi) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income tax in Kazakhstan and significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes. During the ordinary 
course of business, there are any transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, tax liabilities are recognised 
based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognised, when, despite the Group’s belief that its tax return 
positions are supportable, the Group believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Kemin Resources Plc  Annual Report 2014 22

6. Income tax expense
There is no tax charge/credit in the year due to losses incurred by the Group, which are not currently being recognised as a deferred tax asset due  
to uncertainty over the recoverability of such losses in the foreseeable future.

Where a loss has been incurred the diluted loss per share does not differ from the basic loss per share, as the conversion of the convertible loan would have  
the effect of reducing the loss per share, and are therefore not dilutive under the terms of IAS 33.
8. Investments

The loans, which are denominated in US Dollars, represent investments into the subsidiaries and in the opinion of the Directors the aggregate value of  
the investments in the subsidiaries is not less than the amount shown in these financial statements. The Directors review the intercompany borrowings  
on a regular basis, together with the associated cash flows of each company, and consider that no impairment is required. 
The recent loans to subsidiaries are charged at a fixed interest rate of 5% and and are repayable giving twelve months notice by the lender, and these are also 
included within fixed assets. The foreign exchange movement on the loans/investments to subsidiaries is to revalue the amounts which are denominated in  
US Dollars to the year end exchange rate. The movement is reflected within the income statement of the parent company and is treated as part of the net 
investment in the subsidiary and on consolidation is taken to the translation reserve.  Kemin Resources Plc  Annual Report 2014 24

Financial liabilities refer to unsecured interest on non interest bearing loans received from related parties and other companies. Interest-free loans  
are initially recognised at fair value, and are subsequently accounted for at amortised cost using an effective interest rate.
The effective interest rates used to measure the initial fair value of the interest-free loans were the interest rates on long-term loans granted in Kazakhstan.  
The Kazakhstan bank rates were applied at the date of receipt of the next tranche under the interest-free loan, which ranged from 10.0% to 10.8%  
(2013: from 10.0% to 10.8%).
As per the Addendum, dated 29 October 2008, to the loan agreement signed with Hawkinson Capital INC, 20% interest has not been accrued since  
29 October 2008.
Loans provided as short-term are past due and are payable on demand. As at the reporting date and signing date of the financial statements the  
Company had not agreed with the lenders on repayment dates of past due financial liabilities, and these amounts are currently being negotiated.
All non-current loans as noted above are controlled by the ultimate owners and agreements are currently in place or have been obtained to reschedule 
repayment of the debts to a period at least one year from the date of these financial statements.  Kemin Resources Plc  Annual Report 2014 28

14. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group and Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise unsecured loans and other payables which are measured at amortised cost or fair value.  
Its principal financial assets comprise cash deposits in banks and other receivables which are all categorised as loans and receivables. These instruments  
arise from investing and borrowing activities.
The Group and Company are exposed to market risk by virtue of holding financial liabilities and assets. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing 
the risks arising from the holding of these instruments, such as changes in interest rates and liquidity risks. The Company does not:
• actively engage in trading of financial assets for speculative purposes;
• buy or sell derivative securities or contracts; or
• execute financial instruments or contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rates or interest rates. The most significant financial risks to which the Group 
is exposed are described below.
a) Liquidity risk
The Group had £704,000 of net bank balances at the year-end (2013: £111,000). The Directors monitor cash flow on a regular basis as the Company is in  
the development stage and the cash flows are predictable on a monthly basis. The Company is currently utilising the working capital facility as provided  
by Amrita Investment Limited and is in the process of considering various avenues to raise further funds.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s and Company’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2014 based on contractual undiscounted 
payments:

b) Interest rate risk
The Group and Company have floating rate obligations. However, the sensitivity of the Group or Company to changes in the base rate is not  
considered material.
c) Forex risk
The Group credit risk arises from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the significant proportion of the KRMC’s funding being in Pound 
Sterling, whilst KRMC’s principal operating costs are denominated in Kazakh Tenge which is KMRC’s functional currency. There is no forex risk in the Company 
as the principal costs are incurred in Pound Sterling with the funding in Pounds. As the operating costs are at low levels at present the credit risk is not 
material. However, it is the intention to minimise the effect of foreign currency fluctuations for the Group and Company by maintaining its cash reserves  
in sufficient quantum in currencies it expects to incur expenditure. The amounts due in foreign currencies are noted below:

The effect of a 10% strengthening/depreciation of the Pound Sterling against the US Dollar or Kazakh Tenge at the reporting date on the Pound Sterling 
denominated payables carried at that date with all other variables remaining constant, results in the following effect on the Group’s and Company’s losses

d) Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for  
shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Management considers as part  
of its capital, the financial sources of funding from shareholders and third parties with an equity investment in the Group. These are analysed as set out below:

Glossary of terms
The tenor or concentration by weight of a metal in a mineral deposit or ore.
Metres above sea level.
Australasian code for the reporting of exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves (Joint Ore Reserves 
Committee). See www.jorc.org/main.php 
A concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in such form, grade (or quality), and quantity that 
there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade (or quality), continuity 
and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological 
evidence and knowledge, including sampling. 
That part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are 
estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine 
planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately 
detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations 
such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes, and is sufficient to assume geological and grade (or quality) 
continuity between points of observation where data and samples are gathered. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a 
lower level of confidence than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable 
Ore Reserve.
That part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade (or quality) are estimated on the basis of limited 
geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade 
(or quality) continuity. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. An Inferred Mineral Resource has 
a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to an 
Ore Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated 
Mineral Resources with continued exploration.
The economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and 
allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at Pre-
Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate 
that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. The reference point at which Reserves are defined, 
usually the point where the ore is delivered to the processing plant, must be stated. It is important that, in all situations 
where the reference point is different, such as for a saleable product, a clarifying statement is included to ensure that 
the reader is fully informed as to what is being reported.
The economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource.  
The confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Ore Reserve is lower than that applying  
to a Proved Ore Reserve.
A term used to describe mineral resources and mineable reserves which are not static as additional resource 
delineation is not yet complete, and engineering calculations are pending. As such what might be a mineral resource 
today may be a mineable reserve tomorrow.

Mineral inventory
GKZ is a classification system used within CIS states. This system classifies mineralisation estimates into seven categories 
of three major groups, based on the level of exploration performed into Explored Reserves (A, B, C1), Evaluated Reserves 
(C2) and Prognostic Resources (P1, P2, P3). These categories are based on the degree of reliability of data and their 
comparative importance to the national economy.

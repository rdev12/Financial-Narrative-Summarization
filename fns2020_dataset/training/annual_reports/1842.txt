Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Group overview
The year under review began with promise –  
a clear plan to complete the integration  
of Wilson Bowden and to satisfy the 
burgeoning demand for our homes. Aligned  
to these objectives was the opportunity  
to apply the best from both organisations  
to increase efficiency, improve the use of 
IT across the Group and enhance sales, 
particularly in the new area of web  
based marketing. 
The Executive Team made substantial 
progress in meeting these objectives, 
delivering synergies and improving 
operational performance. However, as  
the year progressed and trading  
conditions softened, it became clear that  
it was essential to change our priorities  
and reconfigure the business in response  
to the sharp deterioration in the market.  
The market
After a sustained period of growth in terms  
of volume and price, the residential property 
market has now entered a period of rapid 
decline. This is being reflected in terms of the 
number of transactions, the period of time 
taken to sell a property and the prices that are 
being achieved. UK mortgage approvals for 
house purchases have fallen by 68% during 
the year with the rate of decline intensifying 
through the final quarter.
The reasons have been widely reported  
and analysed. The main cause is the sharp 
reduction in the availability of mortgage 
finance as major lenders have looked to 
repair their own balance sheets by limiting 
lending. The number of mortgage products 
available to the market has fallen from  
15,599 at 30 June 2007 to 3,405 at  
30 June 2008, a fall of 78%. This has 
particularly affected the plight of first time 
buyers who now face greater difficulty  
getting mortgages and are having to raise 
substantially higher deposits. The position  
is vividly illustrated by the fact that whilst 
private sales in our second half fell by  
42.9%, visitors to our sites, looking to buy,  
only fell by 14.8% compared to the same 
period last year. 
We believe it is likely that this situation  
will continue for the foreseeable future.  
Whilst the initial package of measures  
to support home buyers is welcome,  
if the Government wishes to stabilise  
the market further action will be required  
to ensure buyers can secure finance  
for the homes they wish to purchase. 
This is my first report to you as Chairman and 
whilst these are extremely testing times for the 
whole sector, it is already clear to me that this  
is a well run business with skilled employees 
delivering homes of the highest standard.
Chairman’s statement
“Barratt Developments,  
in its expanded format 
with David Wilson Homes, 
is an outstanding business 
with the breadth of  
skills and products to 
meet the needs of the  
UK housing market.”

Performance
Against the backdrop of these market 
conditions, our performance has been 
satisfactory with profit from operations before 
exceptional costs

 of £550.2m representing  
a like-for-like
2
 decline of 21.5% on the previous 
year (restated
3
). Falling like-for-like
2
 sales 
revenues have been partially offset by a good 
performance on reducing costs. 
As conditions became progressively more 
difficult, we felt it prudent to create sufficient 
additional headroom to enable the Group to 
trade through the declining market. We therefore 
started discussions with our lenders about 
rescheduling debt and amending covenants.  
It is a great tribute to the management of the 
Group that they were able to complete these 
complex and difficult negotiations at a time of 
very significant distress in the financial markets. 
 
The strengthening of our funding position has 
enabled the organisation to focus on a clear  
set of priorities – pursuing sales as effectively  
as possible, reducing our costs with renewed 
vigour and managing our working capital 
aggressively. At the same time we must do 
everything we can to protect the fundamental 
infrastructure of the business. 
Initial observations
I joined the Company on 1 June 2008 and 
have spent as much of my time as possible 
visiting divisions and our operating sites.  
I have been impressed with the quality  
of our finished product and the process  
to create it. This combined with our 
exceptional sales and presentational skills 
enable us to serve the market in a sector 
leading manner. Where planning conditions 
allow, the Group has the skills and 
experience to design, build and sell homes 
by creating an environment in which people 
want to live. The Group has the capability  
in depth to tackle successfully all forms  
of residential construction, from complex 
urban brownfield sites to greenfield 
developments in every region of the  
country, from luxury homes to first time  
buyer products. 
I have great confidence in our people to 
manage through these challenging conditions 
and ensure that we are positioned as the 
leader as conditions improve. In tough times, it 
is not only shareholders that suffer but also the 
staff. I wish to record the Board’s appreciation 
and thanks for their professionalism, 
commitment and all-pervasive enthusiasm. 
Board
The current Board has a great breadth  
of experience and a rounded approach to 
issues. I take no credit for this – Charles Toner 
chaired the Company for six years and 
created the current Board. He retired at the 
end of the financial year and whilst he leaves 
the industry during a period of significant 
challenges, his legacy is an effective Board 
that will take the right decisions. We wish him  
a long, healthy and fulfilling retirement.
On 1 May 2008, Mark Rolfe joined the Board 
and in August took over the Chairmanship  
of the Audit Committee from Michael Pescod. 
Mark brings a tremendous breadth of financial 
experience to the Board and I know that  
the Audit Committee will continue to be in 
good hands.  
Dividend
Given the steep decline in market conditions, 
which was not foreseen at the half year,  
the Board has decided that the requirement  
to conserve cash is paramount. We have 
therefore reluctantly decided not to pay  
a final dividend so the dividend for the year 
is 12.23p, a decline of 65.7%. Going forward, 
the Board will take due consideration  
of market conditions, the Group’s trading 
performance and cash resources in 
determining future dividend policy. Our 
objective is to pay a dividend at the earliest 
appropriate opportunity. 
Priorities
We have a strong Executive Team and I am 
confident that they have set the right priorities 
and are executing them with energy and 
precision. Barratt Developments, in its 
expanded format with David Wilson Homes,  
is an outstanding business with the breadth  
of skills and products to meet the needs of  
the UK housing market. I believe that upon  
the market’s recovery, your Company will  
be the market leader and recognised for 
excellence in product and financial returns.  
In the meantime there will continue to be a 
ruthless focus on operational performance.

   The results for the year ended 30 June 2007 have been restated as explained in note 1 to the financial statements.

Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
We have achieved satisfactory results for the year 
against the backdrop of a rapidly deteriorating UK 
housing market. With the successful renegotiation of 
our debt covenants, we have now strengthened our 
financial structure and have refocussed the business 
on clear priorities: sales delivery, cost efficiency and 
cash management to reduce debt. 
Group Chief Executive’s statement
“At the same time as 
focussing on current 
market conditions,  
as far as possible we  
will seek to protect  
the longer-term value 
creating qualities of  
the organisation.”
However, we saw an underlying reduction  
of around 5%, mainly in the last quarter of  
the year, as a result of pressure on prices  
and increased sales incentives. 
Declining volumes and prices were partially 
offset by underlying improvements in the 
efficiency of the Group. Wilson Bowden 
synergies of £33m were delivered against  
the target of £30m set for 2007/8 with  
a series of additional cost reduction 
programmes, put in place 18 months ago, 
delivering an additional £20m of cost 
savings. Whilst these improvements have 
reduced the impact of lower volume and 
selling prices, overall Group profit from 
operations before exceptional costs
1
,  
on a like-for-like
2
 basis, fell by 21.5% with  
an operating margin before exceptional  
costs
1
 of 15.5%. 
Tight control of land spend helped to reduce  
our net debt to £1.65bn at the end of the 
second half. However, as a prudent response  
to future market conditions, we have agreed 
with our banks and private placement note 
holders to amend our covenant package.  
In addition, we have recently signed a new 
three-year £400m facility and have reached 
Group overview
Our operational performance
After a relatively stable start to the financial 
year, we saw a sharp decline in the UK housing 
market following the well-publicised financial 
difficulties of Northern Rock. Whilst there  
was some recovery in our sales following 
Christmas, the fourth quarter was particularly 
challenging for the Group. Sales became 
extremely difficult in the traditionally strong 
spring selling season, with cancellation  
rates rising to 37.4% during the second  
half as a result of the severe rationing of 
mortgage finance. 
Total completions for the year, whilst up on  
a statutory basis, decreased on a like-for-like
2
 
basis by 13.8% to 18,588. However, the difficult 
trading conditions, particularly in the fourth 
quarter, have led to a more significant reduction 
in forward sales and we consequently expect 
lower completion volumes in 2008/9. At the 
year-end forward sales totalled £697.6m of 
which £538.7m was contracted.
The overall average selling prices of the 
properties sold increased by 6.0% as a result  
of continued changes in our product mix.

agreement to extend £350m of our existing 
£400m revolving credit facility. These debt 
facilities do not mature until 2011. 
Competing in today’s market
With the successful refinancing of the business, 
a good deal of the uncertainty about our future 
has been removed. However, there is little 
prospect of an immediate housing market 
recovery as mortgage finance remains highly 
constrained. We have therefore put in place 
detailed plans to drive improved operational 
performance in the key areas of sales, costs 
and cash.
Improved sales delivery 
In current market conditions the effectiveness 
of the Group’s marketing and sales capability 
will have a significant impact on our business 
performance in terms of maximising revenue. 
We have put additional investment into sales 
training and site marketing. Both our major 
brands, David Wilson Homes and Barratt 
Homes, have been refreshed and there has 
been significant investment in our ‘online’ 
media activity. ‘New media’ marketing 
campaigns are currently driving circa 70%  
of sales leads and we expect this low-cost 
channel to continue to grow. 
New products aimed at helping our customers 
overcome the current barriers in the housing 
market have also been introduced. Shared-
equity products such as Dream Start and 
Head Start have proved particularly successful 
and we will continue to innovate in these areas. 
Part-exchange is an important sales channel  
in the current market. Our ability to sell 
second-hand products is a key determinant  
of the extent to which we can use this offering 
and last year we sold over 1,900 second-hand 
properties through our Oakleaf network. 
Reducing costs
Although we have made good progress on 
cost reduction, there is still considerable scope 
to improve the efficiency of the Group. Cost 
reduction programmes across the business 
are well established and are continuing  
to reduce construction and supply costs.  
We expect these programmes to deliver  
£40m of savings in 2008/9. 
We have introduced additional cost saving 
measures to take account of the further 
deterioration in the market. During July we 
announced that we would further rationalise our 
divisional structure, and together with savings  
in other divisions this has resulted in the loss  
of approximately 1,200 jobs. The vast majority 
of these people have now left the organisation. 
This rationalisation will bring the total number of 
divisions down from 44, at the time of the Wilson 
Bowden acquisition, to 26. These initiatives are 
likely to result in further savings of around £40m 
per annum, the majority of which will be delivered 
in 2008/9 at a cost of £15m. The structure, whilst 
much leaner, still provides us with nationwide 
coverage and the sound foundations for growth 
when the market picks up.
We also remain on track to deliver approximately 
£60m of annualised savings arising from the 
integration of Wilson Bowden during 2008/9.
Managing cash
Cash control will continue to be central to  
our objectives. Land spend in 2008/9 is likely  
to reduce to around £568m, almost all of  
which relates to contractual commitments –  
a reduction of £400m on 2007/8. Work in 
progress is being tightly controlled and we  
will continue to carefully match construction 
rates to projected sales rates. We will only start 
on new sites or new phases where we are 
confident of sales rates; so the number of sites 
will fall to an average of around 500 for 2008/9.

seek to protect the longer-term value creating 
qualities of the organisation. This means 
continuing to invest in our people, improving  
the quality of construction, safety standards, 
customer service and ensuring that we develop 
our products to meet customers’ preferences 
and changing regulatory requirements. 
The importance of our continued emphasis on 
safety and quality was underlined by the tragic 
death of a resident at the Azure development, 
Bedfont, caused, it appears, by carbon 
monoxide poisoning. Our sympathies lie very 
much with the families of those involved at this 
time. We are working with the relevant authorities 
to understand the full cause of the incident.
Investing in people
At the heart of our capability is a high quality 
and dedicated work force. Their skill and 
expertise has once again been demonstrated 
by winning 73 National House-Building 
Council (‘NHBC’) ‘Pride in the Job’ quality 
awards for the quality of our construction 
teams. This is the highest number of awards 
ever made to a single business in the  
26 year history of the scheme. It follows  
the unprecedented achievement of winning 
both of the NHBC Supreme Awards –  
the very highest construction awards for 
major housebuilders.
Driving up quality
We have continued to focus on driving up  
the quality of everything we do and improving 
customer satisfaction. Customer service 
must remain a high priority for the Group  
and against a background of considerable 
organisational change. The number of our 
customers that would ‘recommend us to 
Whilst we have a minimal exposure to large, 
owned tranches of strategic land and high  
rise flatted developments, we have incurred 
pre-tax write-downs to the value of land  
and work in progress of £208.4m of which 
£51.2m related to commercial developments.  
It is anticipated that a portion of these 
write-downs will enable the Group to release 
cash from work in progress more quickly.
We are progressing with the process to  
divest the assets from the Wilson Bowden 
Developments portfolio which have a potential 
cash value of around £200m. We hope to be 
able to move the majority of these through to 
completion over the next six to twelve months.

We have seen significant improvement in  
the health and safety performance of the 
Group. The reportable injury incidence rate 
was 656 per 100,000 people employed –  
a reduction of 23.5% on the previous year. 
Product innovation
We continually review our product range to 
ensure that it meets customer and regulatory 
requirements. For example, our specialist 
regeneration skills have enabled us to continue to 
win large, high value development opportunities 
with limited cash outlay. Whilst it is inevitable  
that much needed regeneration of many areas 
will now be significantly slower as a result of 
market conditions, we continue to be well 
placed to compete when opportunities arise.
Part of our success in this area is due to the 
increasingly strong social and environmental 
credentials of the Group. These were further 
reinforced by the construction of the country’s 
first zero carbon code level six house by a major 
housebuilder and by winning the first English 
Partnerships Carbon Challenge. This will lead to 
the construction of the nation’s first zero carbon 
community at Hanham Hall, near Bristol.
Current trading and outlook
There remains considerable uncertainty  
about the near-term prospects for the sector 
with market recovery dependent on an 
improvement in the availability of mortgage 
finance and customer confidence. Whilst 
market conditions during the first two months 
of the new financial year have been broadly 
stable, they remain extremely challenging.  
In the last four weeks net private sales rates 
have been down around 30% on prior year. 
Pricing continues to be under pressure with 
higher incentive levels being required. Whilst 
we will deliver further cost savings during the 
year, we expect to see downward pressure 
on margins.
We will continue to focus on sales effectiveness, 
cost reduction and cash generation. When 
confidence returns, the enhanced capability 
and lower cost structure of our organisation 
will ensure that we are in a strong position  
to compete in the market and capitalise on 
available opportunities.

This has been a very challenging year for the Group. 
Although the year started with relatively normal 
seasonal trends, the impact of interest rate rises  
and the liquidity squeeze affecting the availability 
and cost of mortgage finance led to a more difficult 
market place from September onwards. 
Business review
Report of the Directors
The market worsened further from the 
beginning of April with selling prices coming 
under increased pressure and sales rates  
per site falling. In the context of this intensely 
difficult market, the Group has delivered  
a satisfactory performance with 18,588 
completions (2007: 17,168) and profit from 
operations before exceptional costs
1
 of 
£550.2m (2007: £513.3m (restated
3
)). As a 
result of inventory write-downs of £208.4m 
and other exceptional costs
1
 of £46.6m, the 
Group’s profit from operations was £295.2m 
(2007: £487.1m (restated
3
)).
Housebuilding
We completed 18,588 properties in the  
year, up from 17,168 in the prior year. These 
completions delivered housebuilding total 
revenue of £3,414.2m (2007: £3,001.4m)  
and a housebuilding profit from operations

   Exceptional costs, comprising impairment of inventories, goodwill, intangible assets and restructuring costs were £255.0m 
of which £173.1m related to the housebuilding business and £81.9m to the commercial developments business (2007: 
£26.2m, of which £25.6m related to the housebuilding business and £0.6m to the commercial developments business). 09

of £530.0m (2007: 
£506.8m (restated

14,803 were private sales (2007: 14,335), up 
3.3%. Sales of social housing units increased 
by 33.6% to 3,785 sales (2007: 2,833).
On a like-for-like
2
 basis, total completions 
decreased by 13.8%. Private completions 
were 18.4% lower whilst social completions 
were 10.1% higher. Social housing sales 
represented 20.4% of the Group’s sales in  
the current year, versus 15.9% in the prior 
year on a like-for-like
2
 basis.
The average sales price for the year was 
£183,100, which was up by 6.0% on the prior 
year and by 1.3% on a like-for-like
2
 basis. The 
small increase on a like-for-like
2
 basis reflects  
a 3.9% increase, from £197 ,600 to £205,400, 
in the average selling price of our private 
sales; a 3.9% increase in the price of our 
social units, to £95,900; offset by an increase 
in the proportion of social sales from 15.9% 
in the prior year to 20.4% this year. The 
increase of 3.9% in the average selling price 
of private homes benefits from a change 
in our mix of sales, since despite a fall of 
approximately 5% in the underlying sales 
prices and a 1.2% fall in the average size of 
unit sold, our overall average sales price has 
benefited from a number of high value sales  
in premium London locations.
The decrease in completions on a like-for-
like
2
 basis illustrates the challenging markets 
that the sector is facing. Over the course  
of the financial year, market conditions have 
progressively deteriorated. The year started 
with relatively normal seasonal trends in  
July and August, despite the well publicised 
issues impacting upon the US housing and 
sub-prime markets. From September onwards 
the market was affected by the collapse of 
Northern Rock, the impact of five interest 
rate rises and the ‘credit crunch’ on the 
availability and cost of mortgages. In the 
third quarter we experienced an uplift in 
visitor numbers and sales rates compared  
to the first half. However, this improvement 
proved to be short-lived with a significant 
deterioration in the market from the 
beginning of April.

Our wide product range caters for first time buyers to families under  
the Barratt Homes, David Wilson Homes and Ward Homes brands.
‘The Chelworth’ at Swan’s Reach, Daresbury, Cheshire (above top)  
is a four bedroom David Wilson family home featuring a well equipped 
kitchen/breakfast room, dining room for entertaining and a study.
Barratt Homes carefully renovated and converted a derelict former 
nurses’ home at Bloomsbury Terrace, London (bottom left) and created 
54 superb apartments including 20 for key workers and first time buyers.

Geographic and product diversity
around 5%, which has reduced margins by 
4%, reflecting the pressure upon sales prices 
particularly during the last quarter. In addition, 
increased selling costs further reduced 
margins by 0.6%. We have already referred to 
our cost-reduction programme and this along 
with mix changes has benefited the margin  
by 2.7%. Land sales and other income also 
added 0.5% to the margin. 
The Group is implementing the following 
further measures to reduce its costs.
We have in place a programme to reduce 
build costs by: changing specifications and 
improving build processes, renegotiating 
subcontractor rates, and reducing the cost  
of most major materials. These measures  
are expected to deliver £40m of annual  
cost savings in 2008/9, of which £20m was 
achieved in the current financial year. 
In addition, the operational integration of the 
Wilson Bowden acquisition has been completed 
with £33m of cost savings being achieved in 
the current financial year. The Group remains 
on track to deliver approximately £60m of 
annualised cost savings in 2008/9 compared 
to the costs of the two organisations prior  
to acquisition.
During the year ended 30 June 2008, the  
Group has incurred £15.9m of restructuring  
and reorganisation costs. These include 
redundancies made during the year, divisional 
office closures, reorganisations, and contract 
termination costs. 
At the beginning of July we announced  
that we would be closing two divisions and 
merging a further eight divisions into four.  
This has reduced the number of operating 
divisions within the business to 26, down from 
35 at the end of last year and 44 at the time  
of the acquisition of Wilson Bowden and has 
resulted in the loss of approximately 1,200 jobs. 
This reorganisation along with other cost 
savings across the business is expected  
to deliver annualised savings of £40m. We 
expect to deliver the majority of these cost 
savings in 2008/9. The cost of these changes 
is anticipated to be £15m, of which most  
will be incurred in the first half of 2008/9.  11

Commercial developments
Commercial developments delivered a 
revenue of £140.5m (2007: £44.7m) and a profit 
from operations before exceptional costs
1 
of 
£20.2m (2007: £6.5m). Exceptional costs in 
the commercial developments segment were 
£81.9m, consisting of full impairment of the 
goodwill and intangible assets created upon 
acquisition of £30.7m and impairment of 
inventories of £51.2m. The operating loss  
of the commercial developments segment 
was £61.7m. This performance reflected the 
increasingly difficult market conditions and  
the pressure upon yields in the commercial 
property market.
During the year ended 30 June 2008, we 
completed our 194,600 square feet Riverside 
Exchange office development in Sheffield, 
which was pre-let to the Home Office.  
We continue to make excellent progress on 
our forward-sold 102,000 square feet office 
development in the centre of Manchester, 
which we expect to complete in the autumn.
 
With regard to our industrial portfolio, we 
completed the sale of a 48,000 square feet 
unit let to Parcel Force at our Cambuslang 
site in Glasgow, and we also completed  
the sales of a 56,000 square feet unit to 
Takeuchi and a 27,500 square feet unit  
to Vindon Scientific at our prestigious 
development in Rochdale.
 
On the retail side, we are on target to complete 
our redevelopment of Wrexham town centre 
during 2008/9, delivering 382,000 square feet 
of prime retail space. Here, we have 90%  
of lettings either secured or under offer. In 
addition, as preferred developer, we continue 
to push forward with our town centre retail 
and office regeneration schemes in readiness 
to proceed when the market returns. 
price of £183,100. The Group trades using  
the Barratt Homes, David Wilson Homes  
and Ward Homes brands. Barratt Homes 
is focussed upon urban regeneration, 
apartments and traditional houses whilst 
David Wilson Homes predominantly focusses 
upon family homes. Ward Homes is a regional 
brand based in Kent.
We operate throughout Great Britain and at 
30 June 2008 we were selling from 585 sites 
(2007: 590 sites) spread over 32 (2007: 35) 
divisions. The post year-end announcement 
regarding divisional closures and mergers  
will reduce our number of operating divisions 
to 26, but will not reduce either our product 
range or our geographical reach.
The provision of affordable homes continues 
to be a key component of our activities  
with the Group completing 3,785 homes for 
housing association partners during the year 
at an average selling price of £95,900. We are 
one of the leading providers in the industry of 
affordable homes for rent, shared ownership 
or low cost homes for sale. We believe that  
our strength in this area provides opportunities 
for the Group’s further growth especially in 
light of Government policy. 
We continue to be committed to delivering 
affordable homes for first time buyers. We have 
continued to invest in our range of popular and 
pioneering iPad homes and during the year have 
legally completed 312 homes (2007: 120) and 
at 30 June 2008 had planning permission for 
over 700 homes not yet under construction. 
We are building iPads on developments in 
locations including Edinburgh, Leeds, Cardiff 
and Swansea, enabling as many people as 
possible to benefit from these innovative and 
affordable homes. We have also supported 
1,459 buyers throughout the country with our 
own shared-equity products where we retain  
a proportion of the home interest-free for a 
specified period. In addition, during the year  
we completed 232 homes (2007: 133) under 
the English Partnerships’ First Time Buyer 
Initiative at developments across the  
country including Leeds, Liverpool, Torquay 
and Brentwood. We have also participated  
in schemes to allow key workers to get  
onto the property ladder; for example at our 
We are progressing with the process to  
divest the assets from the Wilson Bowden 
Developments portfolio which have a potential 
cash value of around £200m. We hope to be 
able to move the majority of these through to 
completion over the next six to twelve months. 
Land
The Group land bank consists of both owned 
and controlled plots, and plots where offers 
have been accepted. 
Land additions during the year were £922m 
(2007: £1,013m). The Group has an extensive 
owned and controlled land bank, which is 
sufficient to meet our requirements at current 
completion rates for 4.2 years (2007: 4.0 years) 
and therefore almost all of the cash expenditure 
in 2008/9 on land will relate to contractual 
commitments already entered into.
During the year, the Group has impaired its 
inventories by £208.4m, further details of 
which are provided in the Group Finance 
Director’s review on pages 16 and 17. After this 
impairment, our land bank has a carrying value 
of £3,117.5m (2007: £3,266.9m (restated
3
)). 
At 30 June 2008, 98% of our supply for the 
next financial year had detailed planning 
permission. In addition we have 10,900 acres  
of strategic land which we carry at its current 
realisable value until the Group obtains all 
necessary planning consents, so as to minimise 
the Group’s exposure to risk from this portfolio.

Bloomsbury Terrace development in London 
almost 40% of the units are available for key 
workers who can purchase a minimum of  
35% of the property with English Partnerships 
providing the remainder of the funds. 
During the year we have made progress  
with a number of key regeneration schemes 
and sites. 
In London, we recently began building 63 
homes in one of London’s largest regeneration 
schemes, a new Docklands community of 
2,700 homes around the Canada Water basin in 
Southwark. As well as new homes, the project 
will include a new library, civic plaza, leisure 
amenities and green space. A key feature of the 
development will be the use of 10% renewable 
energy. We also recently started work upon the 
first major residential element, comprising 250 
homes, of the £160m transformation of Dalston, 
Hackney. This project will provide over 550 
homes plus shops, a library and a new Tube 
station, and will include environmentally-friendly 
measures such as green roofs and combined 
heat and power generation. 
In the Midlands, we have been selected by 
Birmingham City Council to redevelop the 
Shard End Crescent shopping parade into  
a state of the art ‘urban village centre’. The 
£33m scheme will contain approximately 
2,000 square metres of retail, around 190  
new homes, a new community library and 
neighbourhood office, and a new vicarage.  
All of the facilities will be arranged around a 
central square to create a safe, secure and 
pleasant living environment.
We have also started work upon a major 
riverside regeneration scheme in Tyneside,  
at the former Stella South power station site  
at Blaydon. This scheme will provide 275  
new Barratt homes.
Quality and service
As a Group we are committed to offering the 
highest standards of customer service and to 
operating in a transparent way. Our customers 
are central to all of our business operations and 
as such we continue to develop our service  
by listening to our customers, monitoring our 
performance and adopting best practice 
throughout the organisation. In the year ended 
30 June 2008, our overall customer satisfaction 
rating has improved to 81% (2007: 80%  
on a like-for-like
2
 basis). In addition, 88%  
of customers responded that they would 
‘recommend us to a friend’ (2007: 88% on a 
like-for-like
2
 basis), a satisfactory achievement 
against a backdrop of considerable change  
in the business and the market. As part of our 
commitment to customer service, we continue 
to train and develop all of our employees to 
ensure the highest standards are met and we 
are further developing our customer service  
IT systems to support this.
The quality of our product offerings has  
been recognised once again this year with 
our construction teams winning an industry 
leading 73 National House-Building Council 
(‘NHBC’) ‘Pride in the Job’ quality awards,  
an improvement on last year’s achievement  
of 71 awards. This excellent performance  
is a new record for the Group and is the 
largest number ever awarded to a single 
business. In addition, in 2007, Barratt 
became the first housebuilder to win both  
of the industry’s most prestigious awards,  
for large housebuilders, for quality 
workmanship with two of our site managers, 
Jamie Bishop and Paul Robinson, winning 
Supreme Awards in the large builder and 
multi-storey categories.
We were also named ‘Homebuilder of the Year’ 
at the Mail on Sunday British Homes Awards 
and we won awards for the best housing 
project (Great West Quarter), best small house 
(eScape at Eden Village, Sittingbourne) and 
were joint winner of the best affordable housing 
development (Tachbrook Triangle). At the ‘Your 
New Home’ Awards the best city development 
was awarded for our ‘The Zone’ development 
in Bristol. In the ‘Hot Property’ Awards we 
won platinum awards for the best waterside 
development (Bakers Mill, Sudbury), best  
value for money development (Forest Place, 
Walthamstow) and best family homes (Kings 
Meadow, Newmarket). 
Our people and expertise
We recognise that one of our key strengths  
as a Group is our people. The extent  
of the decline in the housing market and  
the unprecedented lack of access to 
mortgages has meant that we, in common 
with all other housebuilders, have had to 
reduce costs right across the organisation.  
It is deeply regrettable that the challenging 
market conditions have meant that we have 
had to look closely at our structure and as  
a result have seen around 1,200 talented 
people leave the Group.
Despite the current economic environment,  
it is important that we continue to  
develop and invest in our people and their 
expertise to ensure the continued success  
of our business. 
Our Graduate Recruitment and Development 
Programme has been a success. We have  
39 graduates participating in a two year 
multi-disciplinary programme of both on-job 
and off-job modules. All of the graduates 
have completed volunteering activities in the  
local community, supporting our corporate 
responsibility strategy. 
We have embedded succession planning 
processes across the business with bi-annual 
reviews in place. Every individual identified  
on the succession plan with the potential to 
progress in the next two years has a personal 
development plan. This plan may involve 
items such as attending our Leadership 
Development programme or having a coach 
or mentor to promote development. 
We conducted our first Engagement Survey  
in January 2008, which has enabled us to 
ascertain how we can make our business 
a better place to work and become an 
employer of choice. We have also introduced 
human resources key performance indicators 
to enable us to measure the success of our 
people strategy more effectively and to enable 
us to take appropriate action on staff turnover, 
retention, sickness, absence and capability.
We have continued to make progress  
towards our target of a fully Construction 
Skills Certification Scheme (‘CSCS’) carded 
and qualified workforce, including our 
subcontractors, by 2010. At present, 90% 
(2007: 62%) of our workforce, including

We are committed to the highest standards of customer service. In the  
year ended 30 June 2008, 88% of customers responded that they would 
‘recommend us to a friend’, a satisfactory achievement against a backdrop 
of considerable change in the business and the market. 
We have won a series of national awards including ‘Homebuilder of the

(main picture: the Vanquish at ‘The Zone’).
Charlotte Salvage (pictured above) purchased the elegant and spacious 
Richmore at Manor Farm, North Hykeham, a few miles from RAF Waddington 
where she is based, with the help of our Forces Discount Scheme. 
Environment
During the year, we have made substantial 
progress in pursuing our environmental 
agenda to enable us to respond to the 
challenge made by the Government’s 
requirement for all new homes to be zero 
carbon by 2016. 
We have completed building the ‘Green House’ 
prototype home at the Business Research 
Establishment’s Innovation Park using an award 
winning design developed by architects Gaunt 
Francis. The Minister for Housing, the Right 
Honourable Caroline Flint MP , officially opened 
this home in May 2008. This is the first house  
to be built by a mainstream housebuilder that 
meets the highest level, code level six, of the 
Government’s code for Sustainable Homes  
which will emit zero carbon on average over the 
course of a year. The home includes innovative 
eco-friendly features such as heavyweight 
construction that mitigates peaks and troughs  
of temperature change within the house, an air 
source heat pump to convert the energy of air 
into heat supplying the house, solar hot water 
panels, automatic window shutters to prevent 
the house over-heating in the summer and 
photovoltaic panels to supply power. The home 
is now the subject of rigorous scientific testing 
over the next two years assessing every aspect 
of its design, construction and materials. We 
intend to take the most successful aspects of 
the design and apply them to future homes 
that we build.
We are to develop Hanham Hall, near  
Bristol into the first large-scale zero carbon 
community in Britain, having won the first site 
of English Partnerships’ Carbon Challenge. 
The community will comprise 200 homes and 
commercial space and is due to be completed 
in 2011. All of the homes on the site will meet 
the requirements for code level six of the 
Government’s Code for Sustainable Homes, 
which will enable a family living there to reduce 
its carbon footprint by 60%. The development 
will also include many environmentally friendly 
features including a combined heat and  
power plant generating carbon neutral energy, 
a sustainable urban drainage system and 
retention of existing hedgerows and trees.  
We continue to look to include carbon saving 
measures on our developments, and 21 of our  14

Report of the Directors | Business review
Core strength 
Our people and expertise
sites, where we registered legal completions 
in the year ended 30 June 2008, incorporated 
a renewable energy source on-site. These 
included solar panels, wind turbines and 
combined heat and power units.
We continue to build the majority of our 
developments on brownfield sites, with 71% 
(2007: 78% of Barratt Homes developments) of 
our developments in the year being built upon 
brownfield land, which significantly exceeds 
the Government’s target of 60%. 
The Group continues to make excellent progress 
in accreditation of divisions to the environmental 
standard ISO 14001. We previously reported that 
all Barratt divisions had achieved accreditation 
and that we would target the eight David Wilson 
Homes divisions this year. This has been 
achieved and all the Group’s divisions are now 
accredited to the standard.
The Group has reviewed its overall objectives for 
environmental management and has set targets 
for improved on-site and office performance. 
To assist the divisions, all of the Safety, Health 
and Environmental management team are 
undergoing accredited training to enable 
membership of the Institute of Environmental 
Management and Assessment (‘IEMA’). 
Health and safety
The Group considers health and safety to be 
of paramount importance for its employees, 
customers and the general public. 
The Group is saddened to report the death 
of one person and serious illness of another 
at a completed development at Bedfont 
Lakes in West London in February 2008.  
The primary cause appears to be carbon 
monoxide poisoning from a gas heating 
installation. We continue to work closely with 
the authorities in their investigation and our 
thoughts remain with the families of those 
involved in the incident. 
Notwithstanding this tragic event, we have 
continued to make good progress in the field 
of health and safety with a reduction in our 
reportable injury incidence rate to 656 per 
100,000 persons employed, a reduction of 
23.5% on the previous year (the enlarged 
Our people’s expertise ensures the continued success of our business. 
We are the first major housebuilder to build a code level six house, the 
‘Green House’. The main picture shows the living area of the ‘Green House’.
Our construction teams won an industry leading 73 NHBC ‘Pride in the 
Job’ quality awards, and were awarded the prestigious NHBC Supreme 
Awards for quality workmanship in the large builder and multi-storey 
categories (NHBC Supreme Award winner Jamie Bishop – below right).
We train and develop our employees to ensure the highest standards  
of customer service. Allyson Wilkins (below left) came to work for Barratt

Group had a reportable injury incidence rate  
of 857 for 2006/7).
In addition, we have revitalised and reissued 
our Safety, Health and Environmental 
management system and have further 
strengthened our in-house team. This has 
provided the focus to enable overall 
improvements in our performance with  
all divisions achieving over 88% compliance 
following monitoring visits to developments.
The Group continues with certifying divisions 
to the heath and safety standard OHSAS 
18001. At 30 June 2008, 27 of the 32 
housebuilding divisions and Wilson Bowden 
Developments were certified to this level and 
we aim to have all remaining divisions certified 
by the end of 2008. 
Corporate responsibility
As outlined in the sections above the Group 
has continued to make good progress on 
corporate responsibility throughout the year. 
The Group’s 2008 Corporate Social 
Responsibility Report will contain further 
details on our progress in corporate 
responsibility and will be found on the Group’s 
website, www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk, 
later this year. 
Group key risks
The Group’s financial and operational 
performance is subject to a number of risks. 
The Board seeks to ensure that appropriate 
processes are put in place to manage, 
monitor and mitigate these risks which  
are identified in the table on the right.
The Group recognises that the management  
of risk is fundamental to the achievement of 
Group targets. As such all tiers of management 
are involved in this process. 
Details of the Group’s management of liquidity 
risk, market risk, credit risk and capital risk in 
relation to financial instruments is provided  
in note 27 to the financial statements. 
Outlook
The Group Chief Executive has discussed the 
outlook for the business on page 7. 
Principal risks of the Group include, but are not limited to:
Risk Mitigation
Market
Response to changes in the macroeconomic 
climate including buyer confidence and 
interest rates 
The Executive Directors conduct a weekly meeting which reviews key trading 
indicators, including sales rates, visitor levels and levels of incentives and cash 
flow projections.
Availability of mortgage finance for  
our purchasers
The Executive Directors monitor on a weekly basis the number of reservations 
that require mortgages.
The Group has a policy of giving mortgage providers complete transparency 
regarding house purchase prices alongside any discounts or other incentives  
in order that they have appropriate information upon which to base their  
lending decision.
Provision of high quality product and service 
to maintain brand quality and minimise 
remedial costs
The Group has a comprehensive approach to quality, service and customer 
care enshrined in the ‘Forward through Quality’ initiative and customer care 
code of practice.
Liquidity
Availability of sufficient borrowing  
facilities to enable the servicing of  
liabilities as they fall due
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and medium-term 
committed facilities that are designed to ensure that it has sufficient available 
funds for operations.
The Group’s borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and 
as such the Group maintains sufficient headroom to cover these requirements. 
On a normal operating basis the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom 
of £250m of available committed facilities.
The Group has in place a comprehensive detailed regular forecasting process 
encompassing profitability, working capital and cash flow that is fully 
embedded in the business. These forecasts are further stress tested at a 
Group level to ensure that adequate headroom within our facilities and banking 
covenants is maintained.
Inability of the Group to refinance  
its facilities as they fall due
The Group has a policy that the maturity of its committed facilities and private 
placement notes is at least three years on average.
Land
Securing sufficient land of appropriate size  
and quality to provide profitable growth 
subject to the available borrowing facilities
Each division produces a detailed site-by-site monthly analysis of the amount 
of land currently owned, committed and identified. These are consolidated 
upwards for regular review at Board level. In addition, each operating division 
holds weekly land meetings.
Every land acquisition is subject to a formal appraisal procedure and is 
required to achieve an overall Group defined hurdle rate of return.
Government regulation
Delays obtaining required planning  
and technical consents
The Group has considerable in-house technical and planning expertise 
devoted to achieving implementable planning consents.
Consequence of changes in  
tax legislation
The Group has adopted a low risk strategy to tax planning and potential  
and actual changes in tax legislation are monitored by both our industry 
experienced in-house finance teams and our external tax advisors.
Construction
Failure to identify and achieve key 
construction milestones
The Group’s weekly reporting identifies the number of properties at key stages 
of construction. Projected construction rates are evaluated as part of the 
monthly forecasting cycle.
Excessive investment in work in progress The build status of all sites is reported weekly and compared to sales taken  
on each site.
Failure to promptly identify cost overruns The total costs on every site in progress are evaluated once a quarter and 
reviewed by the divisional management teams.
Innovative design and construction 
techniques are not employed
The Group ensures that it is at the forefront of design and construction techniques 
by a combination of in-house technical departments, the employment of external 
consultants and an ongoing commitment to building experimental house types.
Health and safety The Group has a dedicated health and safety audit department which  
is independent of the management of the operating divisions.
Consideration of the impact of construction 
schemes upon the environment and social 
surroundings
The Group regularly monitors a number of environmental impact indicators. 
The results of this will appear in our Corporate Social Responsibility Report 
later this year.
People
Ability of the Group to attract and retain a 
sufficiently skilled and experienced workforce
The Group has a comprehensive Human Resources policy in place which 
includes apprentice schemes, a Graduate Recruitment Programme, succession 
planning, training schemes tailored to each discipline and the Group has set 
itself the target of having a fully CSCS carded and qualified workforce by 2010.
Adequate succession planning to retain  
and develop key management skills
Underfunding of the Group’s obligations in 
respect of the defined benefit pension scheme
An actuarial valuation is conducted every three years. The Group reviews this and 
considers what additional contributions are necessary to make good this shortfall. 16

Segmental analysis
The Group has two segments, being 
housebuilding and commercial developments. 
These segments reflect the different product 
offerings and market risks facing these areas 
of the business.
The table opposite shows the respective 
contributions of these segments to the Group.
An analysis of the operational performance  
of these segments is provided within the 
Business review on pages 8 to 11. 
Exceptional costs
During the year, the Group has recognised  
a number of items which due to their size  
and unusual nature have been disclosed  
as exceptional costs. 
i) Impairment of inventories
The total impairment of land and work  
in progress, recognised in exceptional cost  
of sales, in the year was £208.4m, which 
comprised £151.2m housebuilding, £51.2m 
commercial developments and £6.0m  
of historic Barratt and Wilson Bowden 
acquisition fair value adjustments.
The Group conducted a review of the 
carrying value of its housebuilding land  
at 30 June 2008 in accordance with normal 
practice and accounting standards. This 
review was carried out on a site-by-site  
basis using valuations incorporating forecast 
sales rates and average selling prices that 
reflect both current and anticipated trading 
conditions. We paid particular attention to 
high-risk sites including large and complex 
sites, apartment blocks outside London and 
sites with low sales rates. The review also 
considered sites that have not yet been 
started and larger, more capital-intensive 
“The Group is committed  
to reducing the level  
of borrowings of the  
business over the short-term 
and has focussed the 
business upon maximising 
cash generation whilst 
ensuring that on a  
site-by-site basis we 
maintain an appropriate 
balance between volume  
and margin.”
1
   Exceptional costs, comprising impairment of inventories, goodwill, intangible assets and restructuring costs were £255.0m 
of which £173.1m related to the housebuilding business and £81.9m to the commercial developments business (2007: 
£26.2m, of which £25.6m related to the housebuilding business and £0.6m to the commercial developments business).

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors | Group Finance Director’s review
sites where it may be more appropriate to 
realise cash through sale of the assets rather 
than developing the site through to completion. 
As a result of the review, the Group recognised 
an impairment of the housing land bank of 
£151.2m in the year ended 30 June 2008.
The Group also reviewed the land and  
work in progress held within its commercial 
developments business for impairment  
on a development-by-development basis. 
This identified the need for an impairment  
of £51.2m in the year ended 30 June 2008. 
This review reflects the marketplace  
currently experienced within commercial 
development and in particular declining 
yields. We have also considered the carrying 
value of sites where it may be more sensible  
to realise cash rather than to continue to 
develop the site.
In addition, the Group had £6.0m of fair value 
uplift that had not been recovered through 
cost of sales which arose on historic Barratt 
and Wilson Bowden acquisitions. Due to the 
current difficult marketplace, these balances 
have been written off on the basis that the  
fair values adopted do not reflect current 
market conditions.
ii) Impairment of goodwill and  
intangible assets
On the acquisition of Wilson Bowden, the Group 
recognised goodwill of £816.7m and intangible 
assets related to the brands acquired of 
£107.0m. These were split between the 
housebuilding and commercial developments 
businesses, with £792.2m of goodwill and 
£100.0m of brand value attributed to our 
housebuilding business and £24.5m of 
goodwill and £7.0m of brand value attributed  
to the commercial developments business.
In accordance with the requirements of 
accounting standards the Group has conducted 
its annual review of the carrying value of 
goodwill and intangible assets. This review was 
conducted by comparing discounted future 
cash flows with the carrying value of assets at 
the balance sheet date. The cash flows were 
generated using our current five-year business 
plan beyond which we used a long-term 
growth rate, in accordance with accounting 
standards, of 2.5% based upon the expected 
long-term growth rate of the UK economy. 
The business plan used in the analysis 
contains the Directors’ current view of 
expected changes in selling prices for 
completed houses and site costs to complete. 
The discount rate used in the impairment review 
is 10%, being the Group’s estimated pre-tax 
weighted average cost of capital. As a result of 
the impairment review, no impairment was 
recognised on the housebuilding business and 
all of the goodwill related to the commercial 
developments business, £24.5m, was impaired.
On acquisition, the David Wilson Homes brand 
was designated as having an indefinite life as 
the Group intends to hold and support the 
brand for an indefinite period and there are  
no factors that would prevent it from doing so. 
The Wilson Bowden Developments brand was 
designated as having a ten-year life as it is a 
business-to-business brand operating in niche 
markets. During the year, £0.8m of the Wilson 
Bowden Developments brand was amortised. 
As a result of the Group’s impairment review, 
the housebuilding brand was not impaired  
but the Wilson Bowden Developments brand 
was fully written off, resulting in an exceptional 
charge to the income statement of £6.2m. This 
impairment is driven by declining commercial 
property yields, which affects the ability of this 
brand to generate future revenues.

assets recognised in exceptional operating

expenses in the income statement was 
therefore £30.7m, comprising a commercial 
developments goodwill impairment of £24.5m 
and the impairment of the Wilson Bowden 
Developments brand of £6.2m.
iii) Restructuring and reorganisation costs
During the year the Group incurred £15.9m of 
restructuring and reorganisation costs. These 
costs include redundancy costs arising from 
both divisional closures and reorganisations 
during the year, and costs related to office 
closures and contract severance. No charge 
for the reorganisation announced on 3 July 
2008, estimated at £15m, has been included 
in the income statement for the year ended  
30 June 2008. 
Tax
The Group corporation tax charge for the year 
was £50.9m, an effective rate of 37.1%. When 
the impairment of goodwill of £24.5m, which 
is not allowable for tax purposes, is excluded 
the effective rate is 31.5%. 
The tax charge of £50.9m comprises a total 
current year tax charge of £53.7m (33.2%  
of profit before tax excluding the impairment 
of goodwill) and a total prior year tax credit  
of £2.8m. 
The Group’s current year effective tax rate  
of 33.2% is higher than the standard rate of 
29.5% due to writing off the deferred tax asset 
on anticipated tax relief on share options, as well 
as disallowable costs and tax on joint ventures, 
partially offset by contaminated land relief. 
Dividend
The Board has decided that no final dividend will 
be paid for the year ended 30 June 2008. The 
total dividend for the year is therefore the interim 
dividend of 12.23 pence per share, which was 
paid in May 2008. Going forward, the Board  
will take due consideration of market conditions, 
the Group’s trading performance and cash 
resources in determining future dividend policy.
Balance sheet
The net assets of the Group decreased by 
£54.3m to £2,843.7m. The decrease reflects 
the retained loss of £39.6m, after inventory 
write-downs, goodwill impairments, other 
exceptional costs and dividends paid in the 
year, and other reserves movements of £16.5m, 
offset by £1.8m issues of share capital during 
the year (including £1.3m on Wilson Bowden 
share option schemes). Significant movements 
in the balance sheet include:
The Group’s book value of land was •	
£3,117.5m (2007: £3,266.9m (restated
2
)),  
a decrease of £149.4m. This decrease 
includes land additions of £922m offset  
by land usage and the impairment of land 
explained above. During the current year, 
the Group reduced its actual expenditure 
on land following the deterioration in the 
market to £1.0 billion from the £1.5 billion 
expenditure anticipated at the beginning  
of the year. It is our intention in the 
forthcoming year to only commit cash 
where land is already contracted.
Work in progress of the Group at 30 June •	
2008 was £1,569.3m (2007: £1,368.5m). 
We are actively reducing our investment  
in work in progress and as a result the 
value has fallen by £134.0m since  
31 December 2007.
Part-exchange properties and other •	
inventories were £143.2m (2007: £104.5m) 
with the increase reflecting the current 
demand for this as an incentive. In 
accordance with normal commercial 
practice, the Group provides against these 
properties when they are taken onto our 
balance sheet and we continue to actively 
manage and trade through these properties. 
Group net debt increased by £351.2m  •	
to £1,652.4m over the full year. However, 
since December 2007, net debt has 
reduced by £86.1m reflecting reduced  
land spend and work in progress. 
Goodwill and intangible assets  •	
decreased by £31.5m to £892.2m  
reflecting the amortisation and impairments 
explained above.
The pension fund deficit on the Barratt •	
Homes defined benefit pension scheme 
reduced by £7.6m in the year to £70.7m, 
reflecting the additional contributions that  
the Group has made to reduce the deficit. 
Trade and other payables decreased  •	
by £179.1m to £1,405.9m reflecting  
a £109.2m decrease in land payables.
Other assets and liabilities have increased •	
by £51.6m during the year.
Cash flow
The tables on the opposite page explain the 
increase in the Group’s borrowings. 
The increase in net debt of £351.2m  
during the year is made up of an outflow  
of £437.3m in the first half and an inflow  
of £86.1m in the second half. The inflow 
during the second half reflects our strategy  
of decreasing land spend and work in 
progress (inventories fell £409.9m, excluding  
the £68.0m increase due to acquisitions;  
a £201.5m net decrease plus £208.4m  
fall due to exceptional impairment) offset  
by an outflow in other working capital and  
a decrease in land payables of £14.1m.
Other cash movements include net interest 
payments of £137 .1m, tax payments of £114.8m, 
dividend payments of £126.0m and proceeds 
from the issue of share capital of £0.5m 
(excluding the proceeds from the issue of shares 
under Wilson Bowden share schemes).
 
The Group is committed to reducing the  
level of borrowings of the business over the 
short-term and has focussed the business 
upon maximising cash generation whilst 
ensuring that on a site-by-site basis we 
maintain an appropriate balance between 
volume and margin.
Treasury
The Board approves treasury policies and 
certain day-to-day treasury activities have been 
delegated to a Treasury Operating Committee 
that in turn regularly reports to the Board. The 
Report of the Directors | Group Finance Director’s review
“This has been a very 
challenging year for  
all housebuilders. We 
have taken appropriate 
measures to reflect  
the significant market 
downturn. Earnings 
have proved robust and 
we have continued to 
maintain asset quality.” 19
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Group operates a centralised treasury function 
which does not speculate and operates within 
guidelines established by the Board and the 
Treasury Operating Committee. 
The Group has a conservative treasury risk 
management strategy which includes a target 
that 60-80% of year-end debt should be at 
fixed rates of interest. At 30 June 2008, 63.0% 
of the Group net debt was fixed (2007: 72.4%). 
Group interest rates are fixed using both 
swaps and fixed rate debt instruments. Net 
bank interest was covered 4.0 times before 
exceptional costs
1
 (2007: 12.8 times covered).
Borrowing facilities and refinancing
At the year-end, the Group’s committed 
facilities had an average life of 3.3 years, 
headroom of £870.0m, and we continued to 
operate within all of our banking covenants.
However, in the light of current market 
conditions, the Board considered that it would 
be a prudent approach to extend our short-term 
refinancing requirements and seek a more 
flexible covenant package which would be more 
suitable in the current trading environment.

Therefore, on 9 July 2008, the Company 
entered into a new £400m three-year 
committed revolving credit facility and agreed 
(subject to contract) to extend the maturity 
date of £350m of the existing £400m 
revolving credit facility to expire at the same 
date as the new facility. On 6 August 2008, 
the Company redeemed £400m of the 
existing acquisition facility.
In addition, the Company agreed with its 
bankers and private placement investors to 
amend its financial covenants. The interest 
covenant has been replaced with a cash flow 
covenant and the gearing and minimum 
tangible net worth covenants have been 
relaxed. These amendments were signed on  
5 August 2008 and all conditions precedent 
were satisfied on 6 August 2008. 
The new covenant package and revolving 
credit facility led to the weighted average cost 
of the Group’s borrowings increasing to circa 
9.75% from 6 August 2008.
As a result of the agreements reached with 
our bankers and private placement investors, 
we have put in place a more appropriate 
capital structure for the Group. 
In conclusion
This has been a very challenging financial year 
for all housebuilders. We have taken appropriate 
measures to reflect the significant market 
downturn. Earnings have proved robust and  
we have continued to maintain asset quality. 
The refinancing and revised covenant package 
recently put in place was an important step in 
ensuring that the Group has strong foundations 
to weather market conditions which are likely 
to remain difficult for the foreseeable future.

Risk management objectives 
The Group’s operational risks and their mitigation are outlined in the Business review on page 15. The Group’s financial assets, financial liabilities 
and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 24, 25 and 26 to the financial statements. 
The Group’s operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit 
risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and as such there is a regular, detailed system  
for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management so as to ensure that risks are promptly identified and 
appropriate actions taken by the central Treasury Department. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to 
limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives,  
to fix interest rates and currency rates. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 24
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors | Statutory information
The Board of Directors is responsible for setting specific, clearly defined guidelines regarding treasury that are applied by the Group. The Group 
has a Treasury Operating Committee which operates within specific parameters set by the Board and consists of any two of the Group Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Treasurer. In addition, the Board approves and reviews all facilities and derivative transactions that 
they have not delegated to the Treasury Operating Committee. The Group operates a central Treasury Department to implement the guidelines 
established by the Board, to whom it reports regularly. 
a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and 
medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations. The Group’s borrowings 
are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and as such the Group maintains sufficient headroom to cover these requirements. On a normal 
operating basis the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom of £250m of available committed facilities and identifies and takes appropriate 
actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations. At 30 June 2008, the Group had 
committed facilities of £2,555.4m (2007: £2,630.0m) and total facilities of £2,651.6m (2007: £2,786.3m). The Group’s drawn debt was £1,685.2m 
(2007: £1,483.3m). This represents 65.9% (2007: 56.4%) of available committed facilities. 
The Group’s objective is to minimise refinancing risk. The Group therefore has a policy that the maturity of its committed facilities and private 
placement notes is at least three years on average. At 30 June 2008, the average maturity of the Group’s facilities was 3.3 years (2007: 3.5 years). 
As explained in note 25 to the financial statements, on 9 July 2008, the Company entered into a new £400m three-year facility and agreed to 
extend (subject to contract) £350m of the existing £400m revolving credit facility to further minimise refinancing risk. All conditions precedent were 
satisfied on 6 August 2008.
b) Market risk (price risk)
i) UK housing market risk
This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group balance sheet. 
The Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic 
conditions including employment levels, interest rates and consumer confidence.
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy. However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographical 
spread of operating divisions and appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions. The Group’s management  
of operational risks is detailed in the Business review on page 15.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Group’s non-financial assets and liabilities, notably land and work in progress, and the critical 
judgements applied by management in these financial statements, which include the valuation of land and work in progress, are detailed on page 55. 
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are directly linked to the UK housing market are detailed in note 27 to the financial statements.
The value of the Group’s available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market. At 30 June 2008 these were carried at a fair 
value of £66.9m (2007: £37.3m). The Company has no financial assets and liabilities that are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis
At 30 June 2008, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s house price linked financial assets and 
liabilities would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by £14.9m (2007: £1.9m) with a corresponding reduction in both net profit and equity.
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk 
and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term fixed rate funding and medium-term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is 
appropriate flexibility for the Group’s operational requirements. In order to achieve this the Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge 
cash flow risks relating to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of sterling and US 
Dollar private placements.  25
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors | Statutory information
The Group has a policy that 60–80% of the forecast debt for the year-end is at a fixed rate, with an average minimum duration of five years and an 
average maximum duration of fifteen years. At 30 June 2008, 63.0% (2007: 72.4%) of the Group’s net debt was at a fixed rate.
The exposure of the Group’s and Company’s financial liabilities to interest rate risk is detailed in note 27 to the financial statements.
Floating interest rates on sterling borrowings are linked to UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates. The floating rates are fixed in advance for 
periods generally ranging from one to six months. Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank 
facilities. The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2008 was 6.6% (2007: 5.7%).
Sterling private placement notes of £125.5m (2007: £81.8m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate 
risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate sterling private placement notes for 2008 was 7.8% (2007: 7.5%) with, at 30 June 2008, a 
weighted average period of 9.5 years (2007: 2.5 years) for which the rate is fixed.
US Dollar private placement notes of £150.5m (2007: £nil) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate 
risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2008 
was 6.9% (2007: nil) with, at 30 June 2008, a weighted average period of 8.8 years (2007: nil) for which the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis
In the year ended 30 June 2008, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s 
pre-tax profit would decrease/increase by £4.8m (2007: £2.8m), the Group’s post-tax profit would decrease/increase by £3.4m (2007: £2.0m) and 
the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £3.4m (2007: £2.0m).
iii) Foreign exchange rate risk
The Group has fixed rate US Dollar private placement notes of $300m (2007: $nil). In order to mitigate risks associated with the movement in the 
foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging its US Dollar denominated debt. The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange 
swap arrangements on the issue of its US Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges. 
Details of the Group’s foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 26 to the financial statements.
Sensitivity analysis
As the Group’s foreign exchange hedges are fully effective, the Group’s profits will be unaffected by any variation in foreign exchange rates and any 
impact on net equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates is unlikely to be significant.
c) Credit risk
The UK housing market is structured so that in the majority of cases the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives 
advance stage payments from Registered Social Landlords. As such, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over 
a large number of counterparties and customers. The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2008 was £8.6m (2007: £32.0m). The carrying 
amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
In addition, the Company is exposed to £2,230.1m of credit risk in relation to inter-company loans, financial guarantees and the bank borrowings  
of subsidiary undertakings. Further details are provided in notes 35 and 36 to the financial statements.
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways:
•	 	 th e 	 G r ou p 	 h a s 	 a 	 c r e dit 	 policy 	 t hat 	 is 	 limit e d 	 t o 	 fina nc ia l 	 inst it u t io ns 	 w it h 	 hig h 	 c re dit 	 rat ing s 	 a s 	 set 	 b y 	 int e r n at io n a l 	 c re dit -rat ing 	 ag e ncie s 	 a nd 	 ha s 	 
a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any counterparty; and
•	 th e 	 G r ou p 	 onl y 	 c ont rac t s 	 d e r i v at i v e 	 fina nc ia l 	 inst r um e nt s 	 w it h 	 c ou nt e r pa r t ie s 	 w it h 	 w hic h 	 t h e 	 G r ou p 	 h a s 	 a n 	 ISD A 	 M a st e r 	 Ag re e m e nt 	 in 	 p l ac e .	
 These agreements permit net settlement thereby reducing the Group’s credit exposure to individual counterparties.
d) Capital risk management (cash flow risk)
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. 26
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors | Statutory information
The Group ensures that there are appropriate controls over the purchase of land and levels of work in progress in the business in order to appropriately 
manage its capital. These controls are discussed in the business risk table on page 15. In addition, the other methods by which the Group can 
manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders, issuing new share 
capital and arranging debt to meet liability payments, and it may also sell non-core assets to reduce debt.
Likely future developments 
An indication of likely future developments in the Group including in the field of research and development is given in the Business review  
on pages 8 to 15.
Creditor payments 
Each Group company is responsible for agreeing the detail of terms and conditions relating to transactions with its suppliers. It is Group policy to 
ensure that suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and to abide by the agreed terms of payment with suppliers where the goods and 
services have been supplied in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions of contract. Implementation of this policy resulted in a supplier 
payment period by the Company of 26 days (2007: 32 days) for its trade creditors at 30 June 2008.
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
As at the date of this report, qualifying third party indemnity provisions under Companies legislation are in force under which the Company has 
agreed to indemnify the Directors, former Directors and the Company Secretary of the Company, Directors and former Directors of any member  
of the Group or of an associated company or affiliate company and members of the Executive Committee, to the extent permitted by law and the 
Company’s Articles of Association against all liability arising in respect of any act or omission in their duties.
Investor relations
The Board believes that the effective management of investor relations is critical to its relationship with its shareholders and to the market in which  
the Company’s shares are held, analysed and traded. The Group’s corporate governance framework sets the context for its continuing investor 
relations programme particularly in respect of key areas such as board membership, remuneration and public accountability statements.
During the year we continued to develop the investor communication programme in conjunction with our financial public relations (‘PR’) advisors, 
Weber Shandwick Square Mile, until June 2008 at which point this role was taken over by Maitland, and the Group’s joint brokers, Credit Suisse 
Securities (Europe) Limited and UBS Investment Bank. The Investor Relations website (www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk) provides a full Company 
profile, regular corporate news updates, access to the Company’s share price and regulatory announcements. Further shareholder services have 
been established whereby shareholders may deal in the Company’s shares via its website and also access the Company’s share register to view 
their shareholding, with the opportunity to make changes to their account details, including the downloading of appropriate forms and also access 
the history of their shareholding.
Our annual and interim reports, together with interim management statements and half-yearly trading updates, will continue to be the primary 
means by which information about the Group, its Board and its business is communicated to institutional and private shareholders, investors and 
analysts. In addition, other major Company publications are available to shareholders on our Investor Relations website. The AGM is used to enable  
all shareholders to discuss the Group’s operations and progress directly with the Board. The Directors are available to answer shareholder 
questions, informally, before and after the AGM. The Chairman also invites questions from shareholders during the AGM.
Information of a price sensitive nature is communicated as required by the Company Secretary to the Company Announcements Office of the 
London Stock Exchange and the Group strives to ensure that all key information is effectively and clearly communicated.
In addition to the above formal communications, the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director meet regularly with institutional investors 
and analysts in order to convey an understanding of the Group’s operations, the market and its management objectives, and in the year under 
review in excess of 100 such meetings have been held. The aim is to meet with major institutional shareholders at least once a year. Press releases 
on the Group’s activities are made to journalists and the media through the Group Press Office and its external PR advisors. The Group’s joint 
brokers, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and UBS Investment Bank, also work actively on our behalf in an effort to ensure that investors 
and potential investors in the business are given reliable information on the Group’s operations, its values and ethos in order to make informed 
investment decisions.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
The Board believes that, in terms of the overall direction and control of the Company, effective corporate governance will come principally from the 
values, standards and disciplines it seeks to apply in dealings with shareholders, customers, staff, suppliers, contractors and other stakeholders. 
Many of the Company’s core values and standards are set out in a range of procedures and practice guidelines communicated throughout the 
Group. However, external governance codes set the framework for our internal standards and we therefore seek to comply with established best 
practice in all areas of corporate governance.
Statement of compliance with Code provisions 
The Company is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. Throughout the year ended 30 June 2008 the Company complied 
with the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 (the ‘Code’). 
The Board 
The Company is led and controlled by the Group Board. The details of the Group Board Directors are set out on pages 20 and 21 of this report. 
 
Mr C G Toner retired from the Board and as Chairman on 30 June 2008. Mr R A Lawson took over as Chairman of the Company with effect from
1 July 2008.
At the end of the financial year the Board comprised eleven members, including the Chairman, six Non-Executive Directors and four Executive Directors. 
The Company therefore complied during the relevant period with the principles of the Code in relation to the balance of Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors. The number and calibre of Non-Executive Directors on the Board, together with their diverse backgrounds and experience, also ensures 
that this principle is met. 
In accordance with best corporate governance practice, the Company’s Articles of Association require one-third of the current Directors to retire  
at each Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). Accordingly, Mr R MacEachrane and Mr C Fenton will retire by rotation and put themselves forward for 
re-election at this year’s AGM in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Articles. In addition, Mr R A Lawson and Mr M E Rolfe will retire at 
this year’s AGM and offer themselves for election, having been appointed by the Board since the last AGM.
Mr R A Lawson is also the Chairman of the Board of Hays Plc and brings a wealth of experience and strong leadership to the Company. 
Mr M E Rolfe is also a Non-Executive Director of the Sage Group Plc and Hornby Plc. His track record and breadth of experience as a Finance 
Director is a great asset to the Company.
Following a formal evaluation process, the Company believes that the performance of Mr R MacEachrane continues to be effective and that he 
demonstrates commitment to his role.
On joining the Company, each new Director participates in an induction process which includes a meeting with all of the current Directors, provision 
of an induction pack, site visits and meetings with senior and operational management teams.
The Directors update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Company by attending appropriate external seminars and training courses, and 
meeting with senior management and visiting regional and divisional operating offices.
The Board believes that the Chairman and all Non-Executive Directors are wholly independent in that they have no business or other relationship 
with the Group that might influence their independence or judgement. 
The division of responsibility between the Chairman of the Board and the Group Chief Executive is clearly defined and has been approved by the 
Board. The Chairman leads the Board in the determination of strategy and in the achievement of its objectives. He is responsible for organising the 
business of the Board, for setting its agenda and for ensuring its effectiveness. The Chairman facilitates the effective contribution of Non-Executive 
Directors and also ensures that the Board receives timely and accurate information so as to properly conduct its business as well as ensuring that 
communications with shareholders are effective. 
Corporate Governance 29

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors | Corporate Governance
The Senior Independent Director has specific responsibility for co-ordinating the evaluation by the Nominations Committee of the Chairman’s 
effectiveness as well as being a point of contact for shareholders in the event of there being any material issues or concerns which the Chairman 
and/or Group Chief Executive have failed adequately to address. The current Senior Independent Director is Mr M Pescod. 
During the year the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors met on one occasion independently of management.
Board process 
The Board has overall authority for the conduct of the business. The Board’s responsibilities include:
determination of strategy and plans to achieve the Group’s objectives; •	
determination of policy and the overall direction of the Group; •	
approval of the Group Report and Accounts prior to publication; •	
establishment of effective systems of delegation and internal control and the annual review of their effectiveness; •	
authorising material acquisitions, disposals, investments, capital projects and other significant transactions; and •	
monitoring the Group’s overall performance in relation to its strategies, plans, budgets and decisions. •	
In January 2008, the Board met for a full day to review and develop the overall business strategy of the Group. 
In the week prior to each Board Meeting, each Director is issued with an agenda, briefing papers and comprehensive operating and financial 
management reports for the period under review. The Company Secretary, a solicitor, attends all Board and Committee Meetings and all Directors 
have access to his advice and, if necessary, to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
Board Committees 
The Board has established four standing Committees; the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the 
Nominations Committee. Terms of reference for the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees are available on our corporate website. 
Membership and attendance of each Committee is shown in the table on page 31. Any Director who did not attend a meeting presented his 
apologies and provided his views to the Chairman ahead of the meeting having reviewed the reports and management information. 
Executive Committee
The Board delegates management of the business to the Executive Committee, which is led by the Group Chief Executive. In addition to the 
Directors identified in the table on page 31 and Mr L Dent, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Executive Committee includes 
Mr N Richardson, Managing Director Wilson Bowden Developments, Mr P Law, Group Director of Corporate Affairs, Mrs J Mee, Group Human 
Resources Director and Mr S Cunningham, Group Sales and Marketing Director. The Executive Committee’s principal responsibilities include:
implementing all operational policy and strategy across the Group; •	
 the preparation and development of the Group Three Year Plan, Annual Business Plan and Budget to achieve the Group’s objectives •	
as determined by the Board;
 monitoring the performance of the Group with particular emphasis on performance as measured against the Strategic Plan, Annual Business •	
Plan and Annual Budgets, and other relevant key performance indicators;
monitoring all monthly financial and other management reports; •	
approving schemes, projects and contracts in accordance with authority delegated by the Board; •	
the management of proper systems of internal control and the identification of material risk to the business; •	
 determining the senior management and staff structures of the organisation, terms and conditions of employment and remuneration and  •	
reward policies; and
taking all necessary action to ensure that day-to-day Group business operations are effectively managed and controlled. •	
The Audit Committee
All members of the Audit Committee are wholly independent Non-Executive Directors in accordance with Code provision C.3.1. The Board  
is satisfied that at least one member of the Committee has recent and relevant financial experience. Mr M E Rolfe succeeded Mr M Pescod  
as Chairman of the Audit Committee on 1 August 2008.
The Committee invites the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, other members of senior management and senior representatives  
of the external auditors to attend meetings as required. 30

responsibilities during the year including the review of the effectiveness of internal control systems, the internal audit plan and certification, key 
accounting policies, judgements and issues, appointment of new external auditors and external audit plan and associated reports.
The Company’s auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, provided non-audit related services during the year primarily relating to Corporate Financial 
Services for the reorganisation of and sale of assets from the Wilson Bowden Developments business. 
Auditor objectivity and independence was maintained by the provision of non-audit related services from a separate office under the supervision  
of a separate partner from that providing audit related services.

Board achievement, performance evaluation and training 
The procedure for appointment of new Directors to the Board is overseen by the Nominations Committee. All Directors joining the Board submit 
themselves for election at the AGM following their appointment and a third of Directors retire each year and submit themselves for re-election at the 
AGM. The names of the Directors subject to re-election at this year’s AGM are set out on page 28. Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a 
three-year term and normally serve a second three-year term subject to performance review and re-election. Beyond this a third three-year term 
may be served subject to rigorous review. 
During the year a formal and structured process of evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors was 
undertaken by the Board. In previous years the performance evaluation was carried out using a questionnaire completed by all Board members. 
This year the Board decided that it would be appropriate to use independent external consultants, Independent Audit Limited.
Central to the evaluation process are the Board’s annual review of business strategy and the objectives and performance targets set by the Board 
each year for itself, its Committees and for the Group Chief Executive, and through him for the Executive Team, against which overall performance 
is measured. In this way the evaluation is undertaken within clear parameters linked to overall strategy, operational and financial performance and 
the role and contribution made by the Board, its Committees and individual Directors in the attainment of agreed objectives and targets.
The performance evaluation was carried out by reviewing Board and Committee papers and other background material and by interviewing all 
Board members and members of the senior management team and advisors. Independent Audit Limited also observed a meeting and compared 
the Company’s Board practice with other major companies and with the good practice that leading institutional investment groups in UK 
companies expect.
The results of the evaluation were presented to the Board in July 2008 and the Chairman and Company Secretary have developed an action plan 
to implement Independent Audit Limited’s recommendations. 32

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors | Corporate Governance
Employment policy and involvement 
The Board recognises that employees need to understand and contribute to the broad objectives of the business and seeks to develop good 
relations with employees through regular communications and consultation. Selection for employment and promotion is based on the objective 
assessment of ability and experience, giving full and fair consideration to all applications for employment, and the Group is committed to ensuring 
that its workplaces are free from unlawful discrimination of any sort. The Group strives to ensure that its policies and practices provide equal 
opportunities in respect of issues such as training, career development and promotion for all existing or potential staff irrespective of gender, race, 
ethnic origin, colour, religion, physical disability, marital status, sexual orientation or age. Every effort is made to retrain and support employees  
who become disabled while working within the Group.
The Group is committed to employee training and development at all levels of the organisation and endeavours to contribute to the industry’s future 
skills base through graduate and apprentice training programmes. 
This year the Group’s human resources team, who provide our divisional management teams with advice on how to deliver best practice  
in terms of employment procedure and Group human resources policies, also helped to deliver strategic programmes such as our Performance 
Development Review and Management Development programmes. The strategic programmes are used to encourage employee involvement  
in the Group’s performance.
The Group works closely with the Construction Industry Training Board (‘CITB’) and the National House-Building Council (‘NHBC’) in training 
provision and a training plan is prepared annually linked to identified business priorities and objectives. Having regard to the nature of our business, 
particular focus is given in the training programme to construction management, trade skills, health and safety and customer care. We have also 
committed to the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (‘CSCS’) for our employees and subcontractors as part of the Major House Builders 
Group Qualified Workforce Initiative.
Investor relations
Details of the Group’s management of investor relations are provided on pages 26 and 27. 
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason,  
the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Internal control and risk management 
The Board confirms that it has maintained a sound system of internal control, for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by  
the Group, throughout the year ended 30 June 2008 and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report, and reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal controls in accordance with Code provision C.2, in particular C.2.1, and that this statement has been prepared in 
accordance with the ‘Turnbull Guidance’ on internal control appended to the Code, as revised in October 2005, the ‘Revised Turnbull Guidance’.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is designed to manage risks that 
may impede the achievement of the Group’s business objectives rather than to eliminate those risks entirely. The system of internal control therefore 
provides only reasonable, not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The system of internal control does, however, provide 
reasonable assurance that potential problems can be identified promptly and appropriate remedial action taken. 33
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors | Corporate Governance
It is the responsibility of the Executive Directors and senior management to implement and maintain the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems in accordance with policy approved by the Board. The key aspects of the Group’s internal control and risk management 
framework are as follows:
i) a clear organisational structure with defined levels of authority and responsibility for each operating division;
ii) extensive financial and management reporting systems under which financial and operating performance is consistently reviewed against 
 budget and forecasts at divisional, regional and Group level on a monthly basis;
iii)  principal risk areas are embedded in the Group’s monthly management reporting system so that risk identification and the control of risk are  
a routine aspect of management responsibility. These risks include:
the market including changes in the macroeconomic climate, sales and quality of product; •	
liquidity including the availability of sufficient borrowing facilities; •	
securing sufficient land; •	
Government regulation including obtaining planning permission; •	
 construction including achieving key milestones, service standards, health and safety and the impact on the environment and social •	
surroundings; and
people including the development of a skilled and experienced workforce; •	
iv)  internal control and risk management systems are supported by the Group internal audit team which is responsible for advising senior 
management, the Executive Directors and, through the Audit Committee, the Board on the operation and effectiveness of those systems.  
The internal audit team undertakes a planned programme of audit appraisals across Group operations approved by the Audit Committee, including 
full divisional audits and targeted audits of key risk areas such as the land viability process, land acquisition control and monitoring, work in progress 
and subcontractor payment controls. Material issues identified in these audits and follow-up action plans are reviewed by the Executive Directors 
and by the Board on a quarterly basis, and necessary actions are taken to remedy any failings in the internal control system.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control in accordance with the Revised Turnbull Guidance and is satisfied that it 
is in accordance with that guidance.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
Additional information for shareholders
The following description summarises certain provisions of the  
current Articles of Association (as adopted by special resolution  
on 27 November 2007 (the ‘Articles’) of Barratt Developments PLC  
(the ‘Company’) and applicable English law concerning companies  
(the Companies Act 1985 and the Companies Act 2006, together the 
‘Companies Acts’)). This is a summary only and the relevant provisions 
of the Companies Acts or the Articles should be consulted if further 
information is required. Certain amendments to the Articles will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 18 November 
2008, primarily to deal with further changes required under the 
Companies Act 2006. Details of these proposed changes are set out  
in the notice of the AGM and copies of the Company’s current Articles, 
together with copies marked up to show the proposed amendments, 
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. 
Share capital
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided into 
ordinary shares of 10 pence each. The shares are in registered form.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
Subject to applicable statutes and other shareholders’ rights, shares 
may be issued with such rights and restrictions as the Company may 
by ordinary resolution decide, or (if there is no such resolution or so far 
as it does not make specific provision) as the Board (as defined in the 
Articles) may decide. Subject to the Articles, the Companies Acts and 
other shareholders’ rights, unissued shares are at the disposal of the 
Board. At each AGM the Company puts in place annual shareholder 
authority authorising the Company’s Directors to allot unissued shares, 
in certain circumstances, for cash, in accordance with the guidelines  
of the Investor Protection Committees.
Voting
Subject to any rights or restrictions attaching to any class of shares, 
every member present in person or by proxy at a general meeting or 
class meeting has, upon a show of hands, one vote or upon a poll,  
one vote for every share of which they are a holder. In the case of joint 
holders of a share, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether  
in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of votes of the 
other joint holders and seniority shall be determined by the order in 
which the names stand in the register in respect of the joint holding. 
Under the Companies Acts members are entitled to appoint a proxy to 
exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their 
behalf at a general meeting or class meeting. A member may appoint 
more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting or class meeting 
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to  
a different share or shares held by that member. A member that is a 
corporation may appoint one or more individuals to act on its behalf at  
a general meeting or class meetings as a Corporate Representative. 
Restrictions on voting
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class 
meeting in respect of any shares held by them if any call or other sum 
then payable by them in respect of that share remains unpaid. Currently 
all issued shares are fully paid. In addition, no member shall be entitled  
to vote if they have been served with a restriction notice (as defined  
in the Articles) after failure to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under  
the Companies Acts.
Deadlines for voting rights
Votes are exercisable at the general meeting of the Company in respect 
of which the business being voted upon is being heard. Votes may  
be exercised in person, by proxy, or in relation to corporate members, 
by Corporate Representative. Under the Companies Acts, the deadline 
for delivering proxy forms cannot be earlier than 48 hours (excluding 
non-working days) before the meeting for which the proxy is being 
appointed. The Articles however, provide a deadline for submission of 
proxy forms of not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the Board 
may determine) before the meeting (not excluding non-working days).
Dividends and distributions 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the Company may by 
ordinary resolution from time-to-time declare dividends not exceeding 
the amount recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim 
dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, whenever the financial 
position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies their 
payment. If the Board acts in good faith, it is not liable to holders of 
shares with preferred or pari passu rights for losses arising from the 
payment of interim or fixed dividends on other shares. 
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of any dividends  
or other monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares from a 
person with a 0.25% interest (as defined in the Articles) if such person 
has been served with a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) after 
failure to provide the Company with information concerning interests  
in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Acts.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Acts, the Articles specify that rights attached 
to any existing class of shares may be varied either with the written 
consent of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of 
the issued shares of that class (calculated excluding any shares held as 
treasury shares), or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a 
separate general meeting of the holders of those shares. At every such 
separate general meeting (except an adjourned meeting) the quorum 
shall be two persons entitled to vote and holding or representing by 
proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of  35

the class (calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares),  
(but so that at any adjourned meeting one holder entitled to vote and 
present in person or by proxy (whatever the number of shares held by 
him) shall be a quorum). The rights conferred upon the holders of any 
shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights 
attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation  
or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them. 
Transfer of shares
Any shares in the Company may be held in uncertificated form and, 
subject to the Articles, title to uncertificated shares may be transferred 
by means of a relevant system. Provisions of the Articles do not apply 
to any uncertificated shares to the extent that such provisions are 
inconsistent with the holding of shares in uncertificated form or with  
the transfer of shares by means of a relevant system. Registration of a 
transfer of an uncertificated share may be refused in the circumstances 
set out in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations (as defined in  
the Articles) and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders,  
the number of joint holders to whom the uncertificated share is to  
be transferred exceeds four.
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of their 
certificated shares by an instrument of transfer in any usual form or in 
any other form which the Board may approve. The instrument of transfer 
must be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and (in the case of a 
partly-paid share) the transferee. The transferor of a share is deemed to 
remain the holder until the transferee’s name is entered into the register.
The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any 
reason, decline to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully 
paid share. The Board may also decline to register a transfer of a 
certificated share unless the instrument of transfer: (i) is duly stamped 
or certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be 
exempt from stamp duty and is accompanied by the relevant share 
certificate and such other evidence of the right to transfer as the Board 
may reasonably require; (ii) is in respect of only one class of share; and 
(iii) if joint transferees, is in favour of not more than four such transferees.
The Board may decline to register a transfer of any of the Company’s 
certificated shares by a person with a 0.25% interest (as defined in the 
Articles) if such a person has been served with a restriction notice  
(as defined in the Articles) after failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided 
under the Companies Acts, unless the transfer is shown to the Board 
to be pursuant to an arm’s length sale (as defined in the Articles).
Repurchase of shares
Subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, the Company may 
purchase its own shares in accordance with the Companies Acts. Any 
shares which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares 
or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon completion of 
the purchase, thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued 
share capital. The Company currently has authority to buy back up  
to an aggregate of 34,657,547 ordinary shares during the period up to 
the next AGM. The minimum price which must be paid for such shares  
is 10 pence and the maximum price payable is an amount equal to  
the higher of: (i) 105% of the average of the closing middle market 
quotations for an ordinary share (as derived from the London Stock 
Exchange Daily Official List) for the five business days immediately 
preceding the day on which that ordinary share is contracted to be 
purchased; and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade 
and the highest current independent bid on the London Stock Exchange 
at the time the purchase is carried out.
Amendment of Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Articles of the Company may be made in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts by way of 
special resolution. 
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Directors shall be no less than two and no more than fifteen in number. 
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution  
or by the Board. A Director appointed by the Board holds office only 
until the next following AGM and is then eligible for election by the 
shareholders but is not taken into account in determining the Directors 
or the number of Directors who are to retire by rotation at that meeting. 
The Board may from time-to-time appoint one or more Directors to 
hold employment or executive office for such period (subject to the 
Companies Acts) and on such terms as they may determine and may 
revoke or terminate any such appointment. Directors are no longer 
subject to a maximum age limit.
At every AGM of the Company, a minimum of one-third of the Directors 
shall retire by rotation. The Directors to retire by rotation shall be those 
who held office at the time of the two preceding AGMs and who did  
not retire at either of them. If the number so retiring is less than the 
minimum number of Directors required to retire, additional Directors up 
to that number shall also retire. The additional Directors to retire shall be 
those who have been longest in office or, in the case of those who were 
appointed or reappointed on the same date, shall be determined by lot. 
Any Director who has held office for a continuous period of nine years 
or more shall also retire. The Company may by special resolution 
remove any Director before the expiration of his term of office. The 
office of Director shall be vacated if: (i) he resigns or offers to resign and  36
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors | Additional information for shareholders
the Board resolves to accept such offer; (ii) his resignation is requested 
by all of the other Directors and all of the other Directors are not less 
than three in number; (iii) he is or has been suffering from mental ill 
health; (iv) he is absent without permission of the Board from meetings 
of the Board for six consecutive months and the Board resolves that  
his office is vacated; (v) he becomes bankrupt or compounds with his 
creditors generally; (vi) he is prohibited by law from being a Director; (vii) 
he ceases to be Director by virtue of the Companies Acts; or (viii) he is 
removed from office pursuant to the Articles.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Memorandum of Association, the Articles, 
the Companies Acts and any directions given by special resolution,  
the business of the Company will be managed by the Board who  
may exercise all the powers of the Company, whether relating to the 
management of the business of the Company or not. In particular, the 
Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money 
and to mortgage or charge any of its undertakings, property, assets 
and uncalled capital and to issue debentures and other securities and 
to give security for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company to 
any third party.
Shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust
The Barratt Developments Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) holds ordinary 
shares in the Company. The shares are held in the EBT for the purpose  
of satisfying options that have been granted under The Barratt Developments 
PLC Executive and Employee Share Option Plans. These ordinary  
shares do not rank for dividend and do not count in the calculation of the 
weighted average number of shares used to calculate earnings per share 
until such time as they are vested to the relevant employee. 
The Trustees of the EBT may vote or abstain from voting on shares held 
in the EBT in any way they think fit and in doing so may take into account 
both financial and non-financial interests of the beneficiaries of the EBT 
or their dependants.
Significant agreements
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the 
counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event of  
a change of control of the Company:
• 	 	 u n d e r 	 t h e 	 £ 2 , 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 	 c r e d i t 	 fa c i l i t i e s 	 a g r e e m e n t 	 d a t e d

between, amongst others, the Company, Lloyds TSB Bank Plc (as 
the facility agent) and the banks and financial institutions named 
therein as lenders (together, the ‘Credit Facilities’), the facility agent 
must, upon a change of control, cancel the total commitments of  
the lenders under such Credit Facilities and declare all outstanding 
credits, together with accrued interest and any other amounts 
payable in respect of such Credit Facilities, to be immediately due  
and payable. For these purposes, a ‘change of control’ occurs  
if any person or group of persons acting in concert gains control  
of the Company;

£20,000,000 (the ‘£20m Notes’) issued pursuant to a note purchase 
agreement dated 29 August 2007 to various institutions within a 
single corporate group, the holders of the £20m Notes have an 
option to require the Company to prepay the entire unpaid principal 
amount of the £20m Notes held by each holder (at par), together with 
interest accrued thereon and a ‘make-whole’ amount in respect of 
any repayment occurring during an interest period; and

pursuant to note purchase agreements dated 23 August 2007 and 
23 April 2008 by the Company to various institutions, the holders  
of the Remaining Notes have an option to require the Company to 
prepay the entire unpaid principal amount of the Remaining Notes 
held by each holder (at par), together with interest accrued thereon 
but without any ‘make-whole’ amount in respect of any repayment 
occurring during an interest period.
Under the terms of the note purchase agreements in respect of the 
£20m Notes and the Remaining Notes, a ‘change of control’ occurs  
if any person or group of persons acting in concert acquires beneficial 
ownership of more than 50% of the issued share capital of the 
Company carrying voting rights.
The note purchase agreements also impose upon the holders 
customary restrictions on resale or transfer of the notes other than  
in compliance with applicable securities laws.

Introduction
This year’s Remuneration report is prepared in accordance with Part 3 of schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 (the ‘Act’) and will be subject  
to an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’).
The key issues to be aware of this year are:
1.  As a result of the tough trading conditions, no annual bonuses have been earned and the Directors have not been awarded a salary increase. 
Similarly, as performance targets have not been met, the Long-Term Performance Plan (‘LTPP’) award granted in 2005 will not vest.
2.  The Remuneration Committee is proposing to suspend the operation of the LTPP and subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM 
grant market value share options to the Company’s most senior executives under a new Executive Share Option Scheme.
3.  A Return On Capital Employed (‘ROCE’) performance condition shall apply to options granted this year. The Remuneration Committee feels that 
ROCE is the most rounded measure of financial performance for a housebuilder in the current trading environment. It is a fundamental measure  
of Barratt’s underlying performance and is directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders.
4. The Committee also wishes to introduce a savings-related share option scheme to encourage wider employee share ownership.
Remuneration Committee 
The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on behalf of the Board for:

interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committee’s decisions. The Group Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee as required but he is 
not present when matters affecting his own remuneration are considered. 
The Remuneration Committee has complied with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. The Committee recognises its accountability  
on executive remuneration to shareholders through this report and through regular dialogue with institutional investors. In determining future 
remuneration policy it will consider both the shareholders’ vote on the report and views expressed by shareholders on the detail of the report.

Director. Mr Dent also acts as secretary to the Committee. In addition, independent advisors Hewitt New Bridge Street and Hay Group advised  
the Committee in relation to changes to the Company’s remuneration policy and on the design, establishment and operation of remuneration 
arrangements. Hewitt New Bridge Street and Hay Group did not provide any additional services to the Company.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited has advised the Company in relation to various pension issues and, with effect from 10 July 2004, 
were appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
Remuneration policy 
Each year the Remuneration Committee reviews the policy on executive remuneration in the context of the business environment, best practice 
and market trends for the current and subsequent financial years. The underlying principles remain the same, namely the Committee believes that 
executive remuneration:

Report of the Directors | Remuneration report 
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting 
the remuneration of the Executive Directors. In addition, the Remuneration Committee does take into account environmental, social and governance 
risks when setting any incentive structures for senior management in order to mitigate the possibility of the incentive structures motivating 
irresponsible behaviour.
Central to the Group remuneration policy is recognition that the sustained growth and profitability of the business is determined in no short measure 
by the skill and commitment of the Executive Team. The reward policy for Executive Directors seeks to provide remuneration and other service 
conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and reward Executive Directors of the highest calibre within the industry’s highly competitive employment 
market. Within these broad objectives the executive remuneration package is based on the following principles:
• 	 	 t h e 	 g r e a t e r 	 p a r t 	 o f 	 r e m u n e r a t i o n 	 p a i d 	 t o 	 e x e c u t i v e s 	 s h o u l d 	 b e 	 l i n k e d 	 t o 	 t h e 	 a c h i e v e m e n t 	 o f 	 d e m a n d i n g 	 p e r f o r m a n c e 	 t a r g e t s ; 	 c u r r e n t l y 	 o v e r 	 5 0 %

measures of shareholder return. The current targets are based on Total Shareholder Return and Earnings Per Share but the Company intends  
to introduce a Return On Capital Employed target for 2008; and

The remuneration package for Executive Directors
The remuneration package for Executive Directors comprises:
•	 ba sic 	 s a la r y ;
•	 a nnu a l 	 p e r f or ma nc e 	 re lat e d 	 bonus ;
•	 long- t e r m 	 s ha re 	 inc e nt i v e s ; 	 a nd
• 	 p e n s i o n 	 a n d 	 o t h e r 	 b e n efi t s .
The performance conditions which apply to the performance related element of executive remuneration are the same for all Executive Directors and 
are set out in the following sections of this report.
Basic salary
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash. Salaries are set having regard to individual responsibilities, 
skills and experience and to competitive market practice. As part of the review carried out, the Committee looked at the market rate for similar 
positions in large national housebuilding companies, and also for companies comprising the FTSE 250. This provides a broad perspective on pay, 
although the primary comparator group remains the housebuilding companies. It was decided that in light of the prevailing market conditions 
salaries for the Executive Directors would remain unchanged for the coming year. Therefore salaries with effect from 1 July 2008 remain as follows: 
    1 July 2008 1 July 2007 
    £ per annum £ per annum
Mr M S Clare    630,000 630,000
Mr S J Boyes    350,000 350,000
Mr C Fenton    350,000 350,000
Mr M A Pain    350,000 350,000
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is dependent upon the achievement of demanding financial objectives and key strategic measures for the business, set annually 
by the Board. For the attainment of 100% of target the amount of bonus will be 130% of basic salary. The maximum amount of bonus which can be 
received by any executive is 180% of basic salary for the attainment of 110% of target. If actual performance falls below 90% of target then no bonus 
will be payable. Payment of the bonus is on a progressive scale with proportionately more being attainable for performance over and above target. 
Performance objectives for the 2008/9 year will be based on cash and profit targets.
Any bonus earned above target is deferred on a compulsory basis, with an opportunity for additional voluntary deferral. The deferred amounts will 
be converted into shares under the Co-Investment Plan, with an opportunity for additional matching shares to be received on a one for one basis  
if further performance targets are met. These additional performance targets are the same as those used for the Long-Term Performance Plan,  
as detailed on page 39. 39
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors | Remuneration report 
No part of the annual bonus is pensionable. 
For the financial year 2007/8 achievement fell below 90% of target and therefore no annual bonus is payable.
Co-Investment Plan
The Co-Investment Plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2005. As explained above, any annual bonus earned above 
target will be compulsorily deferred into shares held under this Plan.
The Executive Directors also have the opportunity to voluntarily defer additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 25% of basic salary 
into the Plan. 
Matching awards will then be made by the Company, at the rate of one for one, which will be subject to performance conditions measured over a 
period of three years. The relevant performance conditions are the same as those used for the Long-Term Performance Plan, and detailed below. 
As no bonus is payable for 2007/8 no Co-Investment Plan awards will be granted this year.
Long-Term Performance Plan 
The Long-Term Performance Plan (the ‘LTPP’) was approved by shareholders at the AGM held in November 2003 to take effect from 1 July 2003.
Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 200% of basic salary 
with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three-year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets. 
There is no retesting of performance conditions. 50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Basic Earnings Per 
Share (‘EPS’) growth and 50% based on Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’). 
For the award made in 2004 the targets were as follows: for the EPS element of the target the full 50% vested if EPS growth exceeded the Retail 
Price Index (‘RPI’) plus 45% and 10% vested if EPS growth exceeded the RPI plus 30%; for performance in between the award vested on a 
straight-line basis. The remaining 50% vested subject to TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE Construction and 
Building Materials Sector Index. A vesting schedule was established so that the full 50% vested if TSR growth was in the upper quartile of the 
comparator index and 10% vested if TSR growth was at the median of the index, with straight-line vesting between the two points.
For awards made in 2005, 2006 and 2007 the targets are as follows: for the EPS element of the target, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds 
the RPI plus 18% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 9%; for performance in between the awards will vest on a straight-line basis.
The TSR portion of the awards made in 2005 and 2006 use a peer group comprising listed housebuilders as follows: Berkeley Group, Bellway, 
Bovis Homes Group, Redrow, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey. For awards made in 2007 the comparator group for the TSR portion of the award 
comprises those companies ranked 51-100 in the FTSE Index.
 
A vesting schedule will be drawn up by taking an average of the two highest and two lowest TSR figures for such companies over the performance 
period and creating a mid-point and an upper-quartile from those two figures. The full 50% will vest if the Company’s TSR is within the upper-quartile 
and 10% will vest at the mid-point mark; for performance in between, the award will vest on a straight-line basis.
The award made in 2005 was tested on 30 June 2008 and the required targets were not achieved, therefore none of this award will vest.
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the long-term share incentive schemes available to the Company. The Committee has concluded that in the 
current market in which the Company is operating a new Executive Share Option Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) should be implemented. The grant of share 
options under the Scheme is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance 
of the Group. Options must normally be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised 
within ten years of grant. It is proposed that the exercise of options to be granted in 2008 will be subject to the achievement of an objective performance 
condition set by the Remuneration Committee based on Return On Capital Employed (‘ROCE’). There will be no opportunity to retest any performance 
criteria. The ROCE performance condition will be underpinned by the requirement that the Committee is satisfied that vesting determined by the ROCE 
condition is such that it correctly reflects the underlying financial performance of the Company across the performance period. Shareholders’ approval 
for the new Scheme will be sought at the AGM and details of the Scheme will be outlined in the Circular that accompanies the Notice of AGM. 40

Share Option Plan
In November 1997, the Company adopted an Executive Share Option Plan (the ‘Plan’). The grant of share options under the Plan is at the discretion  
of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options must be held for  
a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years. The exercise of options 
granted under the Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee.
No options have been granted under the Plan during the financial year. Options which have been granted in previous years remain unchanged  
and are set out on page 44. The award granted to Mr S J Boyes in 2003, vested in 2006 but has not been exercised and the awards granted  
to Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton in 2004 lapsed in 2007.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the provision of employee share incentive schemes available to the Company and has concluded that a 
Savings Related Share Option Scheme (‘SAYE Scheme’) should be implemented. Shareholders’ approval for the new SAYE Scheme will be sought  
at the AGM and a summary of the main features of the SAYE Scheme will be set out in the Circular that accompanies the Notice of AGM.
Pension benefits 
Mr S J Boyes and Mr C Fenton are members of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, which is now closed to new entrants. The scheme 
entitles Mr S J Boyes to a pension on retirement at age 65 of two-thirds of final pensionable salary after 40 years’ membership of the scheme. The 
Executive Directors are also eligible for dependants’ pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on death in service.  
The final pension is calculated from the highest yearly average pensionable salary over three consecutive years during the last ten years of service.
The entitlement of Mr C Fenton is restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 1989, for service up to 5 April 2006. 
Following the introduction of the Lifetime Allowance Pension Rules on 6 April 2006 the Committee has agreed to make changes to the existing 
pension provision. With effect from 1 July 2006 all Executive Directors have and continue to have a choice of remaining in the defined benefit 
pension scheme as described above, or opting to leave this scheme and instead receive a cash supplement equal to 25% of their basic salary. This 
choice is at the discretion of the individual Executive Directors. In lieu of membership of the defined benefit scheme Mr M S Clare receives a cash 
supplement equal to 30% of base salary per annum, and Mr M A Pain receives a cash supplement equal to 25% of base salary per annum. These 
cash allowances are in line with competitive market practice.
Only the basic salary element of a Director’s remuneration is pensionable.
Service contracts 
Executive Directors are engaged on the basis of one-year rolling contracts which can be terminated by twelve months notice given by the  
Company or by twelve months notice given by the Executive at any time. There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination 
or loss of office due to a takeover bid. The contracts entitle Executive Directors to the provision of a company car and membership of a private 
healthcare scheme.
Individual Executive Director’s service contracts:

Mr M S Clare 27 June 2006  2 October 2006  12 months

Directors’ own contributions have been deducted from the change in the transfer value over the year, calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance 
Note GN11.
The figures do not take account of any retained benefits the members may have.
The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the Director would have accrued if he left the scheme at the end of the year. The Listing Rules 
require this to be disclosed excluding inflation.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the end of the year and that at the previous year-end.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. The transfer values of 
the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring 
the scheme’s liability in respect of the Directors’ pension benefits. They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, 
cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The actuarial basis and assumptions used to calculate the transfer values changed in October 2007. The new basis results in higher transfer values 
at the 2008 year-end than at the 2007 year-end.

The performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee for the award granted in 2003, that the growth in earnings per share of the Company 
over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the RPI by at least 9%, was met in 2006, but the option has not yet 
been exercised. The performance condition for the award granted in 2004, which was the same as the performance condition set for the award 
granted in 2003, was tested in 2007 and the required targets were not met therefore the award lapsed. 
The mid-market share price of the Company was 1,000p on 2 July 2007 and 58p as at 30 June 2008. The mid-market high and low share prices of

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Report of the Directors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report including the Directors’ Remuneration report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are required by the IAS Regulation to 
prepare the Group financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union and have also 
elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements 
are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the International Accounting 
Standards Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for 
the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all 
applicable IFRS. However, Directors are also required to:
 properly select and apply accounting policies; •	
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; and •	
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact •	
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position  
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that, to the best of each person’s knowledge:
a) the Group and Parent Company financial statements in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, 
IFRIC interpretation and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and of the Group taken as a whole; and
b) the management report contained in this report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position  
of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
The Directors of the Company and their functions are listed on pages 20 and 21.

Financial statements
Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations 
and Standing Interpretations Committee (‘SIC’) interpretations 
endorsed by the European Union (‘EU’) and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS 
and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of 
the EU International Accounting Standards Regulation. The financial 
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention  
as modified by the revaluation of available for sale financial assets, 
derivative financial instruments and share-based payments. A summary 
of the more significant Group accounting policies is set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these 
estimates are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of the amounts, 
actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The most 
significant estimates made by the Directors in these financial 
statements are set out in ‘Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty’.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the year ended 30 June 2008, the Group has adopted IFRS7 
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. IFRS7 has expanded the 
disclosure requirements of the Group regarding financial instruments. 
The adoption of this standard has not had any impact upon the profit  
or net assets of the Group in either the current or comparative year.
In the current financial year, the Group has also adopted the 
amendment to IAS1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements Capital 
Disclosures’. This amendment has expanded the disclosures provided 
by the Group about the management of its capital resources. The 
adoption of this amendment has not had any impact upon the profit  
or net assets of the Group in either the current or comparative year.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of the holding 
company and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 June.  
The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated  
from the date when control passes to the Group using the  
purchase method of accounting and up to the date control ceases.  
All transactions with subsidiaries and inter-company profits or  
losses are eliminated on consolidation. 
Business combinations
All of the subsidiary’s identifiable assets and liabilities, including 
contingent liabilities, existing at the date of acquisition are recorded  
at their fair values. All changes to those assets and liabilities and the 
resulting gains and losses that arise after the Group has gained control 
of the subsidiary are included in the post-acquisition income statement.
Jointly controlled entities
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds an interest 
with one or more other parties where a contractual arrangement has 
established joint control over the entity. Jointly controlled entities are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Jointly controlled operations
The Group enters into jointly controlled operations as part of its 
housebuilding and property development activities. The Group’s share  
of profits and losses from its investments in such jointly controlled 
operations are accounted for on a direct basis and are included in the 
consolidated income statement. The Group’s share of its investments’ 
assets and liabilities are accounted for on a directly proportional basis 
in the consolidated balance sheet.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised at legal completion in respect of the total 
proceeds of building and development, and an appropriate proportion 
of revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to 
the stage of completion of contract activity. Revenue is measured at  
the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents the 
amounts receivable for the property, net of discounts and VAT. The sale 
proceeds of part-exchange properties are not included in revenue.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Construction contracts
Revenue is only recognised on a construction contract where the 
outcome can be estimated reliably. Revenue and costs are recognised 
by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity at the 
balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys of work 
performed to date. Contracts are only treated as construction contracts 
when they have been specifically negotiated for the construction of a 
development or property. When it is probable that the total costs on a 
construction contract will exceed total contract revenue, the expected 
loss is recognised as an expense in the income statement immediately.
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts are included in trade 
receivables and stated at cost plus attributable profit less any foreseeable 
losses. Payments received on account for construction contracts are 
deducted from amounts recoverable on construction contracts.
Payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on construction 
contracts are included in trade payables. 50

Financial statements | Accounting policies
Exceptional items
Items that are both material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature 
are presented as exceptional items in the income statement. The 
Directors are of the opinion that the separate recording of exceptional 
items provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying 
business performance. Examples of events that, inter alia, may give  
rise to the classification of items as exceptional are the restructuring  
of existing and newly-acquired businesses, gains or losses on the 
disposal of businesses or individual assets and asset impairments, 
including currently developable land, work in progress and goodwill.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs are recognised in the income statement when the 
Group has a detailed plan that has been communicated to the affected 
parties. A liability is accrued for unpaid restructuring costs.
Profit from operations
Profit from operations includes all of the revenue and costs derived 
from the Group’s operating businesses. Profit from operations excludes 
finance costs, finance income, the Group’s share of profits or losses 
from joint ventures and tax.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised in the financial statements at the time 
that they are paid, and final dividends are recognised at the time of 
agreement by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The Company recognises dividends from subsidiaries at the time that 
they are received.
Segmental reporting
The Group consists of two separate segments for management 
reporting and control purposes, being housebuilding and commercial 
developments. The Group manages these segments separately due  
to the different operational and commercial risks that they face. These 
segments therefore comprise the primary reporting segments within 
the financial statements. As all of the Group’s operations are within the 
United Kingdom, which is one economic environment in the context of 
the Group’s activities, there are no geographic segments to be disclosed. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value 
of the consideration over the fair value of the separately identifiable net 
assets and liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses 
is capitalised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of 
the cash-generating units of the Group at acquisition. Cash-generating 
units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment  
at least annually. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating  
unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the  
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment  
is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets
Brands
Internally generated brands are not capitalised. The Group has capitalised 
as intangible assets brands that have been acquired. Acquired brand 
values are calculated using discounted cash flows. Where a brand is 
considered to have a finite life, it is amortised over its useful life on a 
straight-line basis. Where a brand is capitalised with an indefinite life, it is 
not amortised. The factors that result in the durability of brands capitalised 
are that there are no material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, 
economic or other factors that limit the useful life of these intangible assets.
The Group carries out an annual impairment review of indefinite life 
brands by performing a value-in-use calculation, using a discount factor 
based upon the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Investments
Interests in subsidiary undertakings are accounted for at cost less any 
provision for impairment.
Where share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary 
undertakings by the parent Company, they are treated as a capital 
contribution to the subsidiary and the Company’s investment in the 
subsidiary is increased accordingly.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets 
on a straight-line basis to their residual value over their estimated useful 
lives. Residual values and asset lives are reviewed annually.
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 25 years. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Plant is depreciated on a straight-line 
basis over its expected useful life, which ranges from one to seven years.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a 
weighted average cost basis. Cost comprises direct materials, direct 
labour costs and those overheads which have been incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present location and condition.  51
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Financial statements | Accounting policies
Land held for development, including land in the course of 
development, is initially recorded at fair value. Where, through deferred 
purchase credit terms, the fair value differs from the amount that will 
ultimately be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as  
a finance cost in the income statement over the period of settlement. 
Due to the scale of the Group’s developments, the Group has to allocate 
site-wide development costs between units built in the current year  
and in future years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such 
developments. In making these assessments there is a degree of inherent 
uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls to assess and 
review carrying values and the appropriateness of estimates made.
Leases as lessee
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement in equal 
instalments over the life of the lease.
Leases as lessor
The Group enters into leasing arrangements with third parties following 
the completion of constructed developments until the date of the sale 
of the development to third parties. Rental income from these operating 
leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and 
arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the 
leased asset and recognised in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS2 
‘Share-based Payments’ has been applied to all grants of equity 
instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at  
1 January 2005.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date 
of grant. Fair value is measured either using Present-Economic Value 
models or Monte Carlo models dependent upon the characteristics of the 
scheme. The fair value is expensed in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest where non-market vesting conditions apply.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and 
deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the profit for the year. Taxable 
profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences  
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date  
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more  
tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred  
at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates 
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore 
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can  
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable 
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and the 
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Pensions
Defined contribution
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for certain 
employees. The Group’s contributions to the schemes are charged 
against profits in the year in which the contributions fall due.
Defined benefit
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is 
determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. The assets of  
the defined benefit pension scheme are measured at fair value. The 
liabilities of the defined benefit pension scheme are measured on an 
actuarial basis and discounted to present value. The net obligation  
is calculated by a qualified independent actuary and is recognised  
as a liability in the balance sheet.
The Group uses a corridor approach when accounting for actuarial 
gains and losses. The corridor used is the greater of:
• 	 	 1 0 % 	 o f 	 t he 	 p r e s e n t 	 v a l u e 	 o f 	 t he 	 d e fi ne d 	 b e ne fit 	 obl i g a t i on 	 a t 	 t he 	 e n d	
of the previous year; or
•	 	 1 0 % 	 o f 	 t h e 	 fa ir 	 v a lu e 	 o f 	 pla n 	 a s set s 	 at 	 t h e 	 e nd 	 o f 	 t h e 	 pre v ious 	 y e a r .
The amount recognised in the income statement is the excess of 
unrecognised actuarial gains and losses over the corridor spread over 
the expected average working lives of members of the scheme.
The operating and financing costs of the defined benefit pension 
scheme are recognised in the income statement.  52
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Financial statements | Accounting policies
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the financial 
asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
asset to another entity.
The Group derecognises a financial liability only when the Group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Financial assets
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either ‘available for  
sale financial assets’ or ‘loans and receivables’. The classification 
depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is 
determined at the time of initial recognition.
Available for sale financial assets
Zero coupon loans granted as part of sales transactions that are 
secured by way of a legal charge on the respective property are 
classified as being available for sale and are stated at fair value.  
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 17.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised 
directly in equity in retained earnings, with the exceptions of impairment 
losses and interest calculated using the ‘effective interest rate’ method, 
which are recognised directly in the income statement. Where the 
investment is disposed of, or is determined to be impaired, the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included  
in the income statement for the period.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They 
are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater 
than twelve months after the balance sheet date, which are classified  
as non-current assets and are measured at amortised cost less an 
allowance for any uncollectable amounts. The net of these balances 
are classified as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the balance sheet. 
Trade and other receivables are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
Impairment of financial assets
Trade and other receivables are assessed for indicators of impairment  
at each balance sheet date and are impaired where there is objective 
evidence that the recovery of the receivable is in doubt. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial 
difficulty of the customer, default on payment terms or the customer 
going into liquidation.
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables is reduced through 
the use of an allowance account. When a trade or other receivable  
is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance 
account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written  
off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the 
carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the 
income statement.
For financial assets classified as available for sale, a significant or 
prolonged decline in the value of the property underpinning the value  
of the loan is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.  
In respect of available for sale financial assets, impairment losses 
previously recognised through the income statement are not reversed 
through the income statement. Any increase in fair value subsequent  
to an impairment loss is recognised directly in equity.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances in bank 
accounts with no notice or less than three months’ notice from 
inception and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance  
of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments consist of the Company’s ordinary share capital  
and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as ‘other financial 
liabilities’ and are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction  
costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
Other financial liabilities consist of bank borrowings and trade and  
other payables.
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the balance sheet date. 53
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Financial statements | Accounting policies
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and 
are stated at amortised cost. 
Trade and other payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of 
land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset 
to which they relate by discounting at prevailing market interest rates  
at the date of recognition. The discount to nominal value, which will be 
paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, is amortised over 
the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the 
‘effective interest rate’ method.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Where bank agreements include a legal right of offset for in hand and 
overdraft balances, and the Group intends to net settle the outstanding 
position, the offset arrangements are applied to record the net position 
in the balance sheet.
Finance income and charges are accounted for using the ‘effective 
interest rate’ method in the income statement. 
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
in the period to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into derivative financial instruments in the form 
of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage the interest 
rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising from the Group’s operations 
and sources of finance. The use of financial derivatives is governed by 
the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors as detailed in 
notes 26 and 27 to the financial statements.
The swap arrangements are designated as hedging instruments, being 
either hedges of a change in future cash flows as a result of interest 
rate movements, or hedges of a change in future cash flows as a result 
of foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current  
asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedging 
relationship is more than twelve months and as a current asset or  
a current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship  
is less than twelve months.
Hedge accounting
All of the Group’s interest rate and cross currency swaps are 
designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge 
relationship the Group documents the relationship between  
the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk 
management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various 
hedged transactions. In addition, at the inception of the hedge and  
on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instrument is highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash  
flows of the hedged items.
Details of the fair values of the interest rate and cross currency  
swaps are provided in notes 24, 25 and 26 to the financial statements. 
Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are detailed in note 31.
Cash flow hedge
To the extent that the Group’s cash flow hedges are effective, gains 
and losses on the fair value of the interest rate and cross currency 
swap arrangements are deferred in equity in the hedging reserve until 
realised. On realisation such gains and losses are recognised within 
finance charges in the income statement. To the extent that any  
hedge is ineffective, gains and losses on the fair value of these swap 
arrangements are recognised immediately in finance charges in the 
income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods 
when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.  
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in 
equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 
recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in 
equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as  
to match with the related costs that they are intended to compensate. 
Grants related to assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the 
asset. Grants related to income are deducted from the related expense  
in the income statement. 54

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Financial statements
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements there are  
a number of standards, amendments and interpretations that have 
been published. All of these have been endorsed by the EU with the 
exception of the revisions to IAS1, IAS27, IAS39 and IFRS3, IFRIC15 
and IFRIC16, and part 1 of the Improvements to IFRS, and are therefore 
mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 July 2008 and later periods. The Group has not early-adopted any 
standard, amendment or interpretation.
The standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected  
to impact upon the Group are: 
• 	 	 I F R S 8 	 ‘ O p er a t i n g 	 S eg m en t s ’ . 	 I F R S 8 	 a m en d s 	 t h e 	 c u r r en t 	 s eg m en t a l	
reporting requirements of IAS14 and requires a ‘management 
approach’ to be adopted so that segment information is presented  
on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.  
This standard will apply to the Group from the accounting period 
commencing 1 July 2009 and is expected to impact upon the Group 
by requiring additional disclosures in the annual financial statements.

an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of 
the cost of the asset. A qualifying asset is one that takes a substantial 
period of time to get ready for use or sale. The option of immediately 
expensing these borrowing costs is removed. This amendment  
will apply to the Group from the accounting period commencing  
1 July 2009 and its impact is currently being assessed.

Funding Requirements and their Interaction’. IFRIC14 states when 
refunds or reductions in future contributions can be treated as available 
under IAS19 and how a minimum funding requirement affects future 
contributions or may give rise to a liability. This interpretation applies 
to the Group from the accounting period commenced on 1 July 2008, 
however the Group anticipates that no additional liabilities will be 
recognised upon the adoption of IFRIC14.

transaction costs must be expensed, rather than included as  
costs of acquisition, and contingent consideration will require to  
be fair valued. In addition, there will be a choice of two goodwill 
measurement methods where less than 100% of the entity is 
acquired. This revision will apply to the Group from 1 July 2009,

Financial statements
Critical accounting judgements and  
key sources of estimation uncertainty
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, the Group has detailed 
below the critical accounting judgements made and the key sources  
of estimation uncertainty within these financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are 
described in the accounting policies note, the Directors have made no 
individual judgements that have a significant impact upon the financial 
statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt 
with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date are discussed below.
Carrying value of land and work in progress
The Group’s principal activity is housebuilding and property 
development. Due to the nature of this activity, much of the development 
entered into by the Group is speculative in nature. Accordingly, the Group 
has in its balance sheet at 30 June 2008 current assets that are not 
covered by a forward sale. The Group’s internal controls are designed  
to identify any developments where the carrying value of land and work 
in progress is more than the lower of cost or net realisable value.
At 30 June 2008, the Group conducted a review of the net realisable 
value of its land and work in progress carrying values of its sites in the  
light of the current deterioration in the UK housing market. Where the 
estimated future net realisable value of the site was less than its current 
carrying value within the balance sheet, the Group has impaired the  
land and work in progress value. This has resulted in an exceptional 
impairment of £208.4m as shown in note 19. This review was conducted 
on a site-by-site basis using valuations incorporating forecast sales rates 
and average selling prices that reflect both current and anticipated trading 
conditions. These are key judgements in the impairment calculation. 
Should there be a further significant decline in UK house prices then 
further impairments of land and work in progress may be necessary. 
Estimation of costs to complete
In order to determine the profit that the Group is able to recognise on its 
developments in a specific period, the Group has to allocate site-wide 
development costs between units built in the current year and in future 
years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such developments. 
In making these assessments there is a degree of inherent uncertainty. 
The Group has developed internal controls to assess and review 
carrying values and appropriateness of estimates made.
Recognition of profit where developments are  
accounted for under IAS11 ‘Construction Contracts’
The Group applies its policy on contract accounting when recognising 
revenue and profit on partially completed contracts. The application  
of this policy requires judgements to be made in respect of the total 
expected costs to complete each relevant contract. The Group has in 
place established internal control processes to ensure that the evaluation 
of costs and revenues are based upon appropriate estimates. 
Impairment of goodwill
The determination of the impairment of goodwill requires an estimation of 
the value-in-use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been 
allocated as defined in note 12. The value-in-use calculation requires an 
estimate of the future cash flows expected from these cash-generating 
units, including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs, and 
requires the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate the 
present value of the cash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill at the 
balance sheet date was £792.2m with £24.5m impairment recognised 
during the year ended 30 June 2008.
Impairment of brands
The determination of the impairment calculation for the Group’s 
indefinite life brand, David Wilson Homes, requires an estimation of  
the value-in-use of the brand as defined in note 13. The value-in-use 
calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected from 
this brand, including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs, 
and requires the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate 
the present value of the cash flows. The carrying amount of indefinite 
life brands at the balance sheet date was £100.0m with no impairment 
recognised during the year ended 30 June 2008.
In addition, the Group has a finite life brand, Wilson Bowden 
Developments. This brand had amortisation of £0.8m recognised 
during the year and following an impairment review this was fully 
impaired at 30 June 2008.
Defined benefit pension 
The Directors engage a qualified independent actuary to calculate  
the Group’s liability in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme.  
In calculating this liability it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to  
be made, which include discount rates, salary and pension increases, 
price inflation, the long-term rate of return upon scheme assets and 
mortality. As actual rates of increase and mortality may differ from 
those assumed, the pension liability may differ from that included  
in these financial statements. 
Hedge accounting
The majority of the Group’s facilities are floating rate, which exposes  
the Group to increased interest rate risk. The Group has therefore  
taken out £765.0m (note 26) of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. The 
Group has adopted hedge accounting for these swaps on the basis 
that it is highly probable that there is sufficient forecast debt to match 
with the period of swaps. If the highly probable criteria was not met in 
future then any changes in fair value of the swaps would be recognised 
in the income statement, rather than in equity. During the year ended 
30 June 2008, there was a loss of £19.1m (2007: £12.3m gain) included  
in equity related to these swaps.
In addition, the Group has entered into $300m of cross currency swaps 
to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign exchange, arising from 
the Group’s sources of finance denominated in US Dollars. These swaps 
are designated as a cash flow hedge against future foreign exchange 
rate movements. If the hedges ceased to be highly effective then any 
changes in fair value of the swaps would be recognised in the income 
statement, rather than equity. During the year ended 30 June 2008, there 
was a gain of £7 .4m (2007: £nil) included in equity related to these swaps. 56

Notes to the financial statements
1. Prior year adjustment
IAS2 ‘Inventories’ and IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ require that the Group’s land purchases on deferred terms 
should be recorded at the discounted present value at the date of purchase. The value of the discount is expensed through finance costs in the 
income statement over the period of the deferral, with the associated land payable being increased to the settlement value over the period of 
deferral. The land value carried in inventories is reduced by the value of the discount and this therefore reduces land cost of sales in the income 
statement over the duration of the site.
The Group adopted the above policy upon transition to IFRS at 1 July 2004. The calculation methodology adopted at transition, and subsequently 
applied, did not discount any deferred term land payable at inception for the first twelve months that it was due to remain outstanding. The Group 
has reviewed this calculation methodology in the current year and considers that it is appropriate to discount any deferred term land payable for the 
entire period of deferral.
The Group has therefore recalculated the adjustment made for deferred term land payables and, due to the fact that the impact of the change  
is considered by the Directors to be material, it has adjusted the results presented at 30 June 2007 by means of a prior year adjustment.
The effect of this calculation change is summarised below:

4. Exceptional costs
Impairment of inventories
At 30 June 2008, the Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying values of its sites in the light of 
the current deterioration in the UK housing market. Where the estimated future net present realisable value of the site was less than its carrying value 
within the balance sheet the Group has impaired the land and work in progress value. This has resulted in an impairment of £208.4m. Further details 
on this impairment are given in note 19.
Impairment of goodwill
At 30 June 2008, the Group conducted an impairment review of its goodwill as explained in note 12. This resulted in an impairment charge  
of £24.5m for the year.
Impairment of intangible assets
At 30 June 2008, the Group conducted an impairment review of its brands as explained in note 13. This resulted in an impairment charge  
of £6.2m for the year.
Restructuring costs
During the year ended 30 June 2008, the Group has incurred £15.9m (2007: £26.2m) of costs in relation to reorganising and restructuring the 
business, including redundancy costs of £3.7m (2007: £12.2m) where existing employees could not be retained within the Group.

The impact of the change introduced in the Finance Act 2007 regarding the reduction in the corporation tax rate from April 2008 from 30% to 28% 
has been incorporated into the Group’s tax charge and deferred tax provided.
At 30 June 2007, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of £5.8m in relation to the anticipated tax relief available on the future exercise of 
options under the Barratt Share Option and Long-Term Performance Plans. As a result of the fall in the Company’s share price since that date,  
the anticipated tax relief on future exercises is now lower and accordingly the attributable deferred tax asset recognised as at 30 June 2008 is £nil.

11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £86.4m (2007: £298.3m (restated*)) 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are treated 
as cancelled, which were 345.0m (2007: 258.6m).
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £86.4m (2007: £298.3m (restated*)) 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the start 
of the year, giving a figure of 346.7m (2007: 262.8m). 63

Goodwill cost of £792.2m relates to the housebuilding segment and £24.5m relates to the commercial developments segment.
The Group conducts its annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for both the housebuilding and commercial developments 
segments. Any impairment identified is allocated first to goodwill and then to intangible assets.
The impairment review was performed at 30 June 2008 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding and commercial developments 
segments with the carrying value of their tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill.  64
Barratt Developments 
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Financial statements | Notes to the financial statements
12. Goodwill (continued)
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding and commercial developments segments.  
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were those regarding the discount rates, expected changes in selling prices and sales 
volumes for completed houses and expected changes in site costs to complete. The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates  
that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the housebuilding and commercial developments 
businesses and therefore the discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is a pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate of 10% 
being the Group’s estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. Changes in selling prices, sales volumes and direct costs are based upon 
past experience and expectations of future changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
The Directors have used the Group’s current budget and internal forecasts for the first five years of the forecast cash flows. Following year five,  
the Group extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which is based upon the expected long-term growth rate  
of the UK economy.
As a result of this review the Group has fully impaired the goodwill of the commercial developments business by £24.5m reflecting declining 
commercial property yields and the impact upon the future profit stream of the business. The impairment has been recognised within exceptional 
administrative expenses in the income statement.

Brands
The Group does not amortise the housebuilding brand acquired with Wilson Bowden, being David Wilson Homes, valued at £100.0m, as the 
Directors consider that this brand has an indefinite useful economic life due to the fact that the Group intends to hold and support the brand for  
an indefinite period and there are no factors that would prevent it from doing so. The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments (valued at £7 .0m prior 
to amortisation) was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-to-business brand operating in niche markets. 
The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. 
An impairment review was conducted using the calculations and assumptions as explained in note 12. As a result of this review an impairment of 
£6.2m has been recorded in relation to the Wilson Bowden Developments brand to reduce the carrying value of this asset to £nil. This impairment 
has been recognised within exceptional administrative expenses in the income statement. 65

Available for sale financial assets principally comprise interest free loans granted as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a legal 
charge on the respective property. These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash flows taking into account the estimated 
market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment. The fair value reduction during the year has been recognised in equity to the extent 
that it was previously credited to equity (£4.6m), and then subsequently charged to the income statement as an impairment (£9.5m).
The impairment of available for sale financial assets arises due to the impact on the fair value of these assets of the decline in UK house prices.

**  At 30 June 2007, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of £5.8m in relation to the anticipated tax relief available on the future exercise of options under the 
Barratt Share Option and Long-Term Performance Plans. As a result of the fall in the Company’s share price since that date, the anticipated tax relief on future 
exercises is now lower and accordingly the attributable deferred tax asset recognised as at 30 June 2008 is £nil. This has resulted in a charge to the income 
statement of £3.3m, the balance being charged to equity. 69

18. Deferred tax (continued)
It is not anticipated that any of the deferred tax liability in respect of the brands will reverse in the twelve months following the balance sheet date. 
Whilst it is anticipated that an element of the remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse during the twelve months following the balance 
sheet date, at present it is not possible to quantify the value of these reversals.
In addition to the above, the Group has not recorded a deferred tax asset of £1.8m (2007: £1.8m) in respect of capital and other losses that are not 
considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.

*  The results for the year ended 30 June 2007 have been restated as explained in note 1.
The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Group’s operational cycle is such that a proportion of 
inventories will not be realised within twelve months. It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this  
will be subject to a number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays. 
At 30 June 2008, the Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying values of its sites in the light  
of the current deterioration in the UK housing market. Where the estimated future net present realisable value of the site was less than its carrying 
value within the balance sheet, the Group has impaired the land and work in progress values. This has resulted in an exceptional impairment of 
£208.4m. The key judgement in estimating the future profit stream is the evaluation of the likely sales prices. Following this impairment £557.0m 
(2007: £nil) of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
The value of inventories expensed in 2008 and included in cost of sales was £2,714.2m (2007: £2,348.3m (restated*)) including £10.4m (2007: £3.5m) 
of inventory write-downs incurred in the course of normal trading and a reversal of £5.4m (2007: £1.4m) on inventories that were written down in  
a previous accounting period, but excluding the £208.4m exceptional impairment. The £5.4m reversal arose mainly due to obtaining planning 
approval on strategic land and other interests that had previously been written down to net realisable value.
The value of inventories written down and recognised as an expense in 2008 totalled £218.8m (2007: £3.5m), being the £208.4m classified  
as an exceptional cost and the remaining £10.4m incurred in the normal course of trading. 
The Company has no inventories. 70

At 30 June      3.1 3.7
The allowance for doubtful receivables consists of individually impaired trade receivables which are in default. The impairment recognised 
represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of any expected recoveries. The Group 
does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.

ii) Fixed rate sterling private placement notes
The Group has £125.5m of sterling fixed rate private placement notes. £20.5m of these are carried at their fair value as at the date of acquisition  
of Wilson Bowden and expire on 15 October 2010. A further £60m of private placement notes, which at 30 June 2007 were also carried at the fair 
value established at the acquisition of Wilson Bowden, were on 23 April 2008 extended so that £30m expires on 23 April 2018 and £30m expires 
on 23 April 2020. These private placement notes are therefore now carried at historical cost. In addition, on 23 April 2008 £45m of new sterling 
fixed rate private placement notes were issued by the Company.
iii) Fixed rate US Dollar private placement notes

on any relevant payment date (i.e. 31 December or 30 June) falling on or after 30 June 2008 at the option of the note holder or are due in  
December 2012, and are subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
v) Bank overdrafts and uncommitted money market facilities
The Group also uses various bank overdrafts arranged through its cash pooling structures and uncommitted borrowing facilities that are subject

vi) Developments relating to committed facilities and private placement notes
On 9 July 2008, the Company entered into a £400m three-year committed revolving credit facility. In addition, £350m of the existing £400m 
five-year revolving credit facility (effective from 2 February 2005) was extended on 6 August 2008 to match the maturity period of the new 
three-year £400m revolving credit facility. The remaining £50m of this facility expires on 1 February 2010.
On 9 July 2008, the Company agreed with its bankers and private placement investors to amend the financial covenants to support the Group 
through the current difficult economic climate. The amendments were signed on 5 August 2008 and all conditions precedent were satisfied on 
6 August 2008. From 6 August 2008 the weighted average interest rate paid by the Group increased to circa 9.75%.

rates, arising from the Group’s and Company’s sources of finance. All of the Group’s and Company’s interest rate swap arrangements contain  
a clause that allows the Group/Company or the issuer to cancel the swap in May 2012 at fair value.
As at 30 June 2008 the Group and Company had outstanding floating rate sterling debt and overdrafts of £1,409.2m (2007: £1,401.5m). In obtaining 
this funding the Group and Company sought to achieve certainty as to both the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated 
proportion of anticipated future debt requirements.  76

26. Derivative financial instruments – swaps (continued)
a) Interest rate swaps (continued)
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap £765.0m (2007: £860.0m) of this debt into fixed rate sterling debt in 
accordance with the Group and Company treasury policy outlined in note 27. After taking into account swap arrangements the fixed interest rates 
applicable to the debt were as follows:
      Fixed 
     Amount rate payable 
     £m % Maturity
     142.5 5.79 2012

     40.0 5.72 2022
     40.0 5.76 2022
     765.0
The swap arrangements are designated as a cash flow hedge against future interest rate movements. The fair value of the swap arrangements as 
at 30 June 2008, which is based on third party valuations, was a liability of £6.8m (2007: £12.3m asset) with a loss of £19.1m (2007: £12.3m gain) 
charged directly to equity in the year. There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through the income statement during the year or the prior year.
Swaps with a notional amount of £95.0m were cancelled during the year on the refinancing of part of the Group’s and Company’s sterling 
borrowings. Cumulative losses on these swaps of £3.6m were deferred in equity as the forecast transaction specified in the hedge relationship  
is still expected to occur. These losses will be recognised in the income statement over the period the forecast transaction occurs; £0.1m of the  
loss was recognised in the income statement in the year, and a balance of £3.5m remains deferred in equity.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 27.
b) Foreign exchange swaps 
The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks, related to foreign 
exchange, arising from the Group’s sources of finance denominated in US Dollars. 
As at 30 June 2008 the Group and Company had outstanding fixed rate US Dollar loan notes of $300m (2007: $nil). 
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap all of this debt into fixed rate sterling debt in accordance with the Group 
treasury policy outlined in note 27. After taking into account swap arrangements the fixed interest rates applicable to the debt were as follows: 
      Fixed 
     Amount rate payable 
     $m % Maturity
     35.0 8.98 2013
     200.0 6.61 2017
     65.0 9.24 2018
     300.0
  
The swap arrangements are designated as cash flow hedges against future foreign exchange rate movements. The hedges match the contractual 
initial receipt, the final settlement, as well as all interest payments. The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 June 2008, which is based  
on third party valuations, was an asset of £7.4m (2007: £nil) with a gain of £7.4m (2007: £nil) credited directly to equity in the year. There was no 
ineffectiveness to be taken through the income statement during the year or the prior year.

27. Financial risk management
The Group’s financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 24, 25 and 26. 
The Group’s operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit 
risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and as such there is a regular, detailed system  
for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management so as to ensure that risks are promptly identified and 
appropriate actions taken by the central Treasury Department. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to 
limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives,  
to fix interest rates and currency rates. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board of Directors is responsible for setting specific, clearly defined guidelines regarding treasury that are applied by the Group. The Group 
has a Treasury Operating Committee which operates within specific parameters set by the Board and consists of any two of the Group Chief 
Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Treasurer. In addition, the Board approves and reviews all facilities and derivative transactions that 
they have not delegated to the Treasury Operating Committee. The Group operates a central Treasury Department to implement the guidelines 
established by the Board, to whom it reports regularly. 
a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and 
medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations. The Group’s borrowings 
are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and as such the Group maintains sufficient headroom to cover these requirements. On a normal 
operating basis the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom of £250m of available committed facilities and identifies and takes appropriate 
actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations. At 30 June 2008, the Group had 
committed facilities of £2,555.4m (2007: £2,630.0m) and total facilities of £2,651.6m (2007: £2,786.3m). The Group’s drawn debt was £1,685.2m 
(2007: £1,483.3m). This represents 65.9% (2007: 56.4%) of available committed facilities. 
The Group’s objective is to minimise refinancing risk. The Group therefore has a policy that the maturity of its committed facilities and private 
placement notes is at least three years on average. At 30 June 2008, the average maturity of the Group’s facilities was 3.3 years (2007: 3.5 years). 
As explained in note 25, on 9 July 2008, the Company entered into a new £400m three-year facility and agreed to extend (subject to contract) 
£350m of the existing £400m revolving credit facility to further minimise refinancing risk. All conditions precedent were satisfied on 6 August 2008.
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Group’s financial liabilities, excluding derivative financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity 
at the balance sheet date are as follows:

In addition, the Group had £88.7m of undrawn uncommitted facilities available at 30 June 2008 (2007: £129.6m).
b) Market risk (price risk)
i) UK housing market risk
This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group balance sheet. 
The Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. UK house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic 
conditions including employment levels, interest rates and consumer confidence.
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy. However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographical 
spread of operating divisions and appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions. The Group’s management  
of operational risks is detailed in the Business review on page 15.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Group’s non-financial assets and liabilities, notably land and work in progress, and the critical 
judgements applied by management in these financial statements, which include the valuation of land and work in progress, are detailed on page 55. 
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are directly linked to the UK housing market are as follows:

The value of the Group’s available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market. At 30 June 2008 these were carried at a fair 
value of £66.9m (2007: £37.3m).
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities that are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis
At 30 June 2008, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s house price linked financial assets and 
liabilities would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by £14.9m (2007: £1.9m) with a corresponding reduction in both net profit and equity.
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate  
risk and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term fixed rate funding and medium-term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is 
appropriate flexibility for the Group’s operational requirements. In order to achieve this the Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge 
cash flow risks relating to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of sterling and  
US Dollar private placements.

The Group has a policy that 60–80% of the forecast debt for the year-end is at a fixed rate, with an average minimum duration of five years and  
an average maximum duration of fifteen years. At 30 June 2008, 63.0% (2007: 72.4%) of the Group’s net debt was at a fixed rate.

Floating interest rates on sterling borrowings are linked to UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates. The floating rates are fixed in advance for 
periods generally ranging from one to six months. Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank 
facilities. The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2008 was 6.6% (2007: 5.7%).
Sterling private placement notes of £125.5m (2007: £81.8m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest  
rate risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate sterling private placement notes for 2008 was 7.8% (2007: 7.5%) with, at 30 June 2008,  
a weighted average period of 9.5 years (2007: 2.5 years) for which the rate is fixed.
US Dollar private placement notes of £150.5m (2007: £nil) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate 
risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2008 
was 6.9% (2007: nil) with, at 30 June 2008, a weighted average period of 8.8 years (2007: nil) for which the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis
In the year ended 30 June 2008, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s 
pre-tax profit would decrease/increase by £4.8m (2007: £2.8m), the Group’s post-tax profit would decrease/increase by £3.4m (2007: £2.0m) and 
the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £3.4m (2007: £2.0m). 81

iii) Foreign exchange rate risk
The Group has fixed rate US Dollar private placement notes of $300m (2007: $nil). In order to mitigate risks associated with the movement in the 
foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging its US Dollar denominated debt. The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange 
swap arrangements on the issue of its US Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges. 
Details of the Group’s foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 26.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk may be summarised as follows:
      2008 2007 
      $m $m
US Dollar loan notes      300.0 –
Derivative financial instruments – foreign exchange swaps     (300.0) –
Net exposure      – –
Sensitivity analysis
As the Group’s foreign exchange hedges are fully effective, the Group’s profits will be unaffected by any variation in foreign exchange rates and  
any impact on net equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates is unlikely to be significant.
c) Credit risk
The UK housing market is structured so that in the majority of cases the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives 
advance stage payments from Registered Social Landlords. As such, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure 
spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2008 was £8.6m (2007: £32.0m). 
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk. 
In addition, the Company is exposed to £2,230.1m of credit risk in relation to inter-company loans, financial guarantees and the bank borrowings  
of subsidiary undertakings. Further details are provided in notes 35 and 36.
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways:
• 	 	 T he 	 G r o up 	 ha s 	 a 	 c r e d it 	 p ol i c y 	 t ha t 	 i s 	 l i m it e d 	 t o 	 fi na n cia l 	 i n s t it u t i on s 	 w it h 	 h i gh 	 c r e d it 	 r a t i n gs 	 a s 	 s e t 	 b y 	 i n t e r n a t i ona l 	 c r e d it 	 r a t i n g 	 a g e n cie s 	 a n d 	 ha s

These agreements permit net settlement thereby reducing the Group’s credit exposure to individual counterparties.
d) Capital risk management (cash flow risk)
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group ensures that there are appropriate controls over the purchase of land and levels of work in progress in the business in order to 
appropriately manage its capital. These controls are discussed in the business risk table on page 15. In addition, the other methods by which the 
Group can manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders, issuing  
new share capital and arranging debt to meet liability payments, and it may also sell non-core assets to reduce debt. 82

Group defined contribution schemes income statement charge     4.9 3.7
At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of £0.2m (2007: £0.4m), which were paid on or before the due date.
Defined benefit scheme
The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, which is now closed to new entrants. A full actuarial 
valuation was carried out at 30 November 2007 and updated to 30 June 2008 by a qualified independent actuary. The projected unit method  
has been used to calculate the current service cost. This will rise over time (as a percentage of payroll) as the members of the scheme approach 
retirement since the scheme is closed to new members. 
The Trustees of the Scheme are currently undertaking their triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes. Discussions are underway between 
the Trustees and the Group regarding future contribution requirements.
At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of £0.4m (2007: £nil).
The assets of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair value. The liabilities of the scheme have been calculated at each balance 
sheet date using the following assumptions:
Principal actuarial assumptions      2008 2007
 Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations   
Discount rate      6.30% 5.80%
Rate of compensation increase      4.70% 5.30%
Rate of price inflation      3.70% 3.30%
Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost   
Discount rate      5.80% 5.25%
Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets     6.70% 6.19%
Rate of compensation increase      5.30% 5.00%
Rate of price inflation      3.30% 3.00%
Members are assumed to exchange 10% of their pension for cash on retirement.
The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice from Mercer Limited, the Group’s actuarial advisors.
The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to calculate 
the scheme liabilities.
      Male Female
Retired member (life expectancy at age 65)      21.3 24.2
Non-retired member (life expectancy at age 65)      23.1 25.9
The mortality assumptions are based upon the PA92 mortality tables, with allowance for future increases in life expectancy in line with the medium 
cohort projection. 83

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free 
investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of risk premium associated with other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested 
and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset 
allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

The Barratt Developments PLC Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’) holds 1,711,046 (2007: 1,714,046) ordinary shares in the Company. The cost  
of the shares, at an average of 165.9 pence per share (2007: 164.6 pence per share), was £2,838,386 (2007: £2,821,186). The market value of the 
shares held by the EBT at 30 June 2008, at 58.0 pence per share (2007: 993.0 pence per share), was £992,407 (2007: £17,020,477). The shares 
are held in the EBT for the purpose of satisfying options that have been granted under The Barratt Developments PLC Executive and Employee 
Share Option Plans. These ordinary shares do not rank for dividend and do not count in the calculation of the weighted average number of shares 
used to calculate earnings per share until such time as they are vested to the relevant employee.
30. Share-based payments
Details of the share option schemes
a) Executive Share Option Plan
In November 1997, the Company adopted the current Executive Share Option Plan (the ‘Plan’). The grant of share options under this Plan is at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options must be 
held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of 
grant. The exercise of options granted under the Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration 
Committee, namely that the growth in the basic earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should 
exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998, and by at least 9% for those options granted  
in and since 1999.
b) Employee Share Option Plan
In November 1999, the Company adopted an Employee Share Option Plan (the ‘Plan’). The Board approves the grant of share options to 
employees under this Plan which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant. The exercise of the options granted 
under the Plan are subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Board, namely that the growth in the basic earnings 
per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 9%. 
Those who have participated in the Executive Share Option Plan do not participate in the Employee Share Option Plan.
c) Long-Term Performance Plan
The Long-Term Performance Plan (the ‘LTPP’) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take effect 
from 1 July 2003. Further details relating to the LTPP are set out in the Remuneration report on page 39.
d) Wilson Bowden plc Savings Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘WBSRSOS’)
Under the WBSRSOS, participants were required to make monthly contributions to an approved savings authority under a contractual savings 
scheme for a period of three years or five years. On entering into the savings contract, participants were granted an option to acquire ordinary 
shares in Wilson Bowden plc at a discount, of no more than 20%, to the middle market price of Wilson Bowden plc’s shares immediately prior  
to the date of grant.
The exercise of options under the WBSRSOS was not subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition, as the WBSRSOS was Inland Revenue 
approved and open to all eligible employees. 86

30. Share-based payments (continued)
In consequence of the acquisition of Wilson Bowden, under the rules of the WBSRSOS, options granted which were not already exercisable became 
exercisable during the six months following 23 April 2007, to the extent of the savings made under related savings contracts at the time of the exercise 
together with any accrued interest or bonus due. Pursuant to the provisions of Wilson Bowden Limited’s Articles of Association, shares arising upon 
exercise of such options after the Reorganisation Record Time (being 6pm on 24 April 2007) for the Scheme of Arrangement by which the acquisition 
was effected (the ‘Scheme’), but prior to expiry of such six-month period, were automatically acquired by the Company in consideration for the payment 
by the Company to the holders of option shares substantially equivalent to that consideration receivable under the Scheme had the option shares been 
in issue at the Reorganisation Record Time. Any options outstanding upon the expiry of this six-month period lapsed. Details of ordinary shares held 
under option under the WBSRSOS together with options exercised or lapsed during the period under review are provided in the table on page 87.

30. Share-based payments (continued)
The weighted average share price, at the date of exercise, of Barratt share options exercised during the year was 807p (2007: 1,075p).
The weighted average life for outstanding Barratt share options at the end of the year was 2.7 years (2007: 4.7 years).
Income statement charge
A charge to the income statement has been made for the awards issued on or after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005  
in accordance with IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments’. 
Long-Term Performance Plan
The weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2008 was 355p (2007: 788p) per award. The awards have been valued using  
a Present-Economic Value model for the EPS element of the scheme and a Monte Carlo model for the TSR element of the scheme.
The weighted average inputs to the Present-Economic Value model were as follows:

Expected dividends      3.0% 3.0%
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over a period consistent with the expected life  
of the options. The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on the Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Total expense
The Group recognised an expense of £2.3m (2007: £4.4m) in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions for the year  
ended 30 June 2008. As at 30 June 2008, an accrual of £1.0m (2007: £1.2m) was recognised in respect of social security liabilities on  
share-based payments. 89

The total cash consideration was £54.6m, £22.3m of which was deferred. These companies were solely acquired for the land and land options that 
they hold. The book value of land acquired was £20.3m and the fair value was £68.0m which was offset by a deferred tax creditor of £nil (£13.4m at 
fair value). No goodwill arose on these acquisitions. The acquisitions did not contribute to the revenue or profit of the Group for the year and would 
not have done had these companies been acquired on 1 July 2007.
Additionally, the Group received cash contributions under the Wilson Bowden SAYE scheme of £1.3m in the year. 93

Financial statements
Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of Barratt Developments PLC
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’) of Barratt Developments PLC for the year 
ended 30 June 2008 which comprise the Group income statement,  
the Group and Parent Company balance sheets, the Group and Parent 
Company cash flow statements, the Group statement of recognised 
income and expense, the Accounting policies and the related notes  
1 to 37, together with the statements on impact of standards and 
interpretations in issue but not yet effective and critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty. These financial 
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set  
out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Directors’ Remuneration report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union are set out  
in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited in accordance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give  
a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part  
of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ 
report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given  
in the Directors’ report includes that specific information presented in  
the Business review and Group Finance Director’s review that is cross 
referred from the Business review section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not 
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined 
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to 
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all 
risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s 
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as 
described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent 
with the audited financial statements. We consider the implications  
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or 
material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.  
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant  
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited. It also includes  
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the 
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information 
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide  
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report 
to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused  
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report 
to be audited.  95

OUR STRATEGIC AIMS
By putting our strategy
to work, and delivering
on our commitments.
Our goal is to continue to develop BTG as a 
sustainable international specialty pharmaceuticals
business that delivers great value to all of our
stakeholders – patients, physicians, shareholders,
employees and business partners.
To achieve this, our near-term strategy has three parts:
establishing commercial operations in the US so 
we can sell our own approved products; building 
value in, and realising value from, our current 
pipeline; acquiring additional specialist products 
to sell in the US.
Over the longer term, our strategy to generate growth
is to become a leader in targeted specialist areas. 
We will achieve this by growing organically by investing
in our own development pipeline and through
acquisition, and by delivering high-quality specialist
products that meet the expectations of patients,
physicians and payers.
We are striving for excellence in product development,
manufacturing and marketing, and we are committed
to demonstrating the highest ethical standards in
everything we do.

#1
How do you generate
significant revenues
going forward?
By looking back.
Historically, BTG’s business model was to generate revenues from
in- and out-licensing early-stage technologies, venture investing 
and patent assertion. Recognising that most of our revenues derived
from licensing life sciences technologies, in 2005 we focused our
business on developing and commercialising medical products. 
This led in December 2008 to the acquisition of Protherics PLC and its
two established products, CroFab™, an anti-venom, and DigiFab™,
for digoxin overdose, which have been sold by Nycomed in the US.
We have now established our own commercial operations in the 
US, and from October 2010 we will market CroFab™ and DigiFab™
ourselves. We expect to continue earning royalties on licensed
products for some time, but over time we aim to generate more
revenues and higher proﬁt margins from selling our own products.

#2
How do you sustain
growth in your
markets?
By opening new ones.
CroFab™ and DigiFab™ provide a solid platform from which 
to launch BTG’s direct sales and marketing activities in the US. 
As established products with limited competition, they should
continue to deliver solid revenues. Our strategy is to leverage the
commercial infrastructure supporting CroFab™ and DigiFab™ 
by expanding our portfolio with new products that address new
markets. Our focus is on product opportunities that meet the 
needs of specialist physicians and their patients in the hospital 
and in selected out-of-hospital settings.

How do you 
achieve sustainable
profitability?
By recognising some
things are short-lived.
From 2011, BTG will no longer receive royalties on BeneFIX
®
, Wyeth’s
treatment for haemophilia B, which comes off patent. The solution to this
loss of revenue was the acquisition of Protherics and the revenues from
CroFab™ and DigiFab™. More importantly, the acquisition provides the
opportunity to create a sustainably proﬁtable business. We will achieve
this by using the resources available to the enlarged BTG to: develop
Voraxaze™ and Varisolve
®
through regulatory approvals and market
them in the US; commercialise other pipeline programmes and replace
them with ones that we can take to market ourselves; acquire additional
products to sell in the US, increasing revenues and gross margins.

How do you respond
to the big issues 
facing Pharma?
By thinking niche.
Healthcare reform, pricing pressures, increased regulation, 
low research and development productivity, patent expiries 
and generic competition are among the many challenges facing 
the global pharmaceutical industry today. Our response to these
challenges is to focus on niche unmet needs and on lower-risk,
later-stage development opportunities where competition is limited
and barriers to entry are high. Such products may target rare
diseases or disorders and therefore address modest markets.
However, their development can be relatively low cost and 
they can usually achieve fair pricing and reimbursement terms. 
A good example in our current pipeline is Voraxaze™.

How do you generate
shareholder value?
By consistently
applying our values.
Openness, accountability, teamwork, integrity, delivery and
continuous learning – these are the values that we have identiﬁed 
as being core to how we run our business. They have been 
brought to life through company and team meetings, the Intranet 
and facilitated workshops, and they have been embedded into 
our business processes and employee appraisals. We believe that 
this creates a positive working environment for our employees and 
trust in our dealings with physicians, patients and business partners. 
We also believe that strong values and ethical behaviour will 
help us realise our full business potential and deliver signiﬁcant
shareholder value.

Chairman’ s statement
Our strategy is delivering
Our business is robust
Since our last annual report to shareholders 
we have made good progress towards achieving
our near-term objectives, while positioning 
the business to deliver sustainable growth over 
the long term.
We have almost completed the integration of the Protherics
business, which we acquired in December 2008. The ﬁnancial
beneﬁts of the acquisition are evident in our strong results for
the year.
Revenue of £98.5m (08/09: £84.8m) generated a gross proﬁt
of £65.7m (08/09: £47.7m). The Group made a proﬁt before
tax of £9.1m, which compares with a loss before tax of £11.3m
in the prior year. Cash and equivalents increased to £82.6m
at 31 March 2010 from £78.2m at 31 March 2009.
The ﬁnancial review on pages 18 to 21 describes the results 
for the year in detail and provides a ﬁnancial outlook for the
year ahead.
A key objective for the past year was the establishment 
of a sales and marketing capability in the US, which is core 
to our growth strategy. I am pleased to report that we have
now put in place the key commercial operations required 
to enable us to begin marketing our own products in the US.
From October 2010, when the current distribution agreement
ends, we will start selling our two approved products,
CroFab™, an anti-venom, and DigiFab™, for digoxin toxicity, 
in the US ourselves. These established, potentially life-saving
products have limited competition and are well known by the
specialists who administer them. These attributes make them
ideal ﬁrst products for our new US sales and marketing teams.
To deliver sustainable growth we must add products both
to our development pipeline and to our marketed products
portfolio. To this end, we continue to invest in our pipeline and
to review suitable in-licensing and acquisition opportunities;
for the latter, having a US sales capability increases our
attractiveness as a partner.
We have made the decision to take Varisolve
®
forward
ourselves. Completing the development of Varisolve
®
and
marketing it in the US reimbursed sector is a big investment
for BTG. It is also an investment that has the potential to 
deliver signiﬁcant returns and is, we believe, in the best
interests of shareholders.
In addition to Varisolve
®
, our pipeline comprises another
programme we intend to take to market ourselves, which 
is Voraxaze™, for methotrexate toxicity, and four other
programmes we intend to partner. Further details are
provided in the CEO’s review on pages 10 to 12 and in the
pipeline update on pages 17 and 18.
I wish to thank the executives, management and employees
of BTG for another year of hard work and progress across 
the business. I am grateful to my Board colleagues for their
continued guidance and in particular, to Professor Colin
Blakemore, who will retire from the Board at this year’s Annual
General Meeting in July, for his signiﬁcant contributions to the
company’s development during his three years as a director.
I would also like to thank our shareholders for their continued
support of our strategy and team.
We look forward with excitement and conﬁdence to the 
year ahead, in which we start selling our own products 
in the US and take the next step towards becoming a
sustainably proﬁtable specialty pharmaceuticals business.

Chief Executive 
Officer’ s review
We have big ambitions
in the short and long term
A strong ﬁnancial performance in 2009/10 was
matched by solid progress in our operations. 
Our near-term focus remains on assuming 
direct sales and marketing responsibility for
CroFab™ and DigiFab™, and on advancing our
development programmes including Varisolve
®
.
To meet our longer-term growth ambitions,
we are also actively reviewing opportunities to
acquire additional products that we can market 
in the US and programmes that we can add 
to our development pipeline.
Integration of Protherics
Our acquisition of Protherics in December 2008 evidenced 
our ambitions to develop BTG as a sustainable, growing
specialty pharmaceuticals business. Within a few months 
of completion, we had prioritised the combined development
portfolio, started a cost-reduction programme and initiated a
reorganisation of the Group’s operations to increase efﬁciency.
We set a target of achieving a £10m reduction in overhead
costs and a £10m reduction in research and development
expenditure by the end of the current 2010/11 ﬁnancial year.
As the results for 2009/10 demonstrate, we are making rapid
progress in meeting these targets and we are delivering
ahead of schedule.
Less visible, but equally important, there has been a huge
amount of work in the background to harmonise research
and development processes, ﬁnancial reporting and 
IT systems, HR policies, corporate and tax structure and 
many other business processes. I am grateful to all of our
employees for their continued focus on meeting business
objectives throughout these changes.
Establishing US commercial operations
Another area of tremendous activity has been the setting 
up of all of the new systems and processes that have to be 
in place for us to sell our own products in the US. As this is 
a new activity, we needed to recruit experienced personnel 
in key areas such as sales, marketing, medical affairs and
associated support functions. I am absolutely delighted 
with the calibre of new recruits we have been able to attract 
and how quickly they have taken ownership of key activities.
Our US commercial operations are now almost all in place,
and we look forward to marketing our two approved
products, CroFab™ and DigiFab™, from October 2010 when
we regain sales and marketing rights. On a stand-alone
basis, this is a proﬁtable acute care franchise. Its strategic
importance to BTG is that we can use it as a growth platform
to add new products, increasing top-line revenues, product
margins and overall proﬁtability.
We are actively reviewing opportunities to acquire products
that are already on the market, nearing approval or in late-
stage development. There is always competition for good
assets, so we are focusing on niche products that leverage
our US operations and therefore may be a better ﬁt for us 
than for others.
We are seeking products that leverage either the specialist
sales force that will sell CroFab™ and DigiFab™ or the
supporting infrastructure, i.e. our medical affairs, compliance,
ﬁnance, distribution and other processes.
Examples of the former are products that are administered 
by the same emergency room physicians as CroFab™ and
DigiFab™. An example of the latter is Varisolve
®
, where a
new specialist sales team that calls on vein clinics would be
supported by the existing commercial support infrastructure.

Varisolve
®
is a business-transforming opportunity
We indicated at the time of our interim results that we were
considering funding the Phase III trials of Varisolve
®
in the 
US and marketing it ourselves in the US reimbursed sector.
Having gained comfort about the trials through the Special
Protocol Assessment (‘SPA’) process with the FDA, and about
the potential market size from our market research, we have
now conﬁrmed that this is our intention. We are continuing 
to explore partnering in the US self-pay or cosmetic market,
while seeking to understand more fully the potential in other
geographic markets.
We estimate it will cost around $55m to get Varisolve
®
to approval in the US. This includes the clinical trial and
regulatory costs as well as the necessary investments in
manufacturing and the supply chain. This is a large though
affordable investment, which is why we have taken our time
to understand everything we can about what is required
to achieve the product label that opens up the market 
we believe exists. By undergoing the SPA process with the
FDA, we believe we have now de-risked the development
pathway sufﬁciently so that we can conﬁdently move forward. 
Our market research suggests that the market opportunity
for Varisolve
®
in the US reimbursed sector alone is in the
$250m to $500m range. If peak sales are only at the lower 
end of that range, the impact on BTG’s revenues and proﬁts
will still be transformational. We believe that Varisolve
®
has
signiﬁcant advantages for patients, physicians and payers,
and thus has the potential to become the leading product 
in the US for treating medically serious varicose veins.
Varisolve
®
represents an excellent investment opportunity
which ﬁts perfectly with our strategy.
Investing in Varisolve
®
will affect our reported results in the
near term. We are on track to achieve the £10m reduction 
in research and development expenditure on the prioritised
pipeline following the Protherics acquisition. However, 
our decision on Varisolve
®
means that reported research 
and development costs will increase over the coming two 
to three years. We make this investment with conﬁdence 
built on the stable ﬁnancial foundations we have created
over the past year.
Building our business on strong core values
Although BTG has a long history and strong heritage, 
we are in many ways a new company. Born of the merger 
of BTG and Protherics, we are adding new employees 
and embarking on new activities. We have big ambitions, 
and to achieve them we need a shared vision, strategy and
commitment from all our employees.
Early on in the integration process, the Leadership Team
developed a new vision for BTG and identiﬁed a set of core
values. We want to make these values underpin everything
we do as an organisation and all of our interactions with 
our colleagues, patients, physicians and business partners. 
We have engaged with employees across the business about
these values, through workshops, our Intranet, company-wide
meetings and other channels. We have made the values
central to how we plan and conduct our affairs, and we have
embedded them into our HR processes and into our
corporate and personal objectives. 
We have made our values core to everything we do, as we
truly believe this makes us more competitive and more able 
to succeed in achieving our goals. I have been inspired by
how readily and rapidly colleagues throughout BTG have
embraced our values and taken ownership of making them
integral to all our activities and interactions.
This is a great foundation for an ambitious, growing business.

Our operating and
financial performance
in 2009/10
Here we describe our business model, 
the ﬁnancial and operating performance in
2009/10, key risk factors and our corporate
responsibility approach.
The following commentary should be read in conjunction 
with the ﬁnancial statements and related notes on
pages 62 to 112.
Overview, company development and principal revenues
BTG is an international specialty pharmaceuticals company
whose purpose is to bring to market specialist products 
that meet the needs of patients, physicians and payers,
generating value for the company and its shareholders.
Core activities are acquiring, developing, manufacturing 
and commercialising niche products that are prescribed by
specialist physicians, either in hospitals or in selected out-of-
hospital settings, and can be sold through small sales forces.
BTG does not conduct basic research, but instead licenses 
or acquires products and programmes from other
pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical technology
companies. Historically, the Group licensed in or acquired
early-stage programmes, strengthened their intellectual
property position and undertook some development 
activities prior to out-licensing to industry partners in
exchange for milestone payments and royalties on sales. 
This business model has led to the Group generating 
a signiﬁcant proportion of its revenues from royalties on
licensed products, comprising recurring royalties, milestones
and other one-off revenues. Such products include BeneFIX
®
,
a treatment for haemophilia B, the two-part hip cup, a design
of artiﬁcial hip used by the majority of manufacturers, and
Campath
®
, a treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
that is also under development for multiple sclerosis. 
The milestone payments typically arise as licensees
successfully develop the programmes through different
phases of clinical development, through regulatory 
approvals and when certain commercial milestones are
achieved. A further source of revenue is the disposal 
of assets the Group no longer considers to be core to its
specialty pharmaceuticals business, usually for one-off
payments but sometimes for additional success-based
milestone payments. A proportion of the royalty revenues 
is shared with the organisation that licensed the programme 
to BTG. In 2009/10, this was approximately 30%.
In December 2008, BTG acquired Protherics PLC and 
as a result now also earns revenues from sales of its own
approved products, principally the polyclonal antibodies
CroFab™, an anti-venom, and DigiFab™, for digoxin 
toxicity, which have been distributed in the US by Nycomed. 
With Protherics, BTG also acquired facilities and know-how 
in polyclonal antibody manufacturing, which are key to 
the production of CroFab™, DigiFab™ and CytoFab™, 
a product that has been licensed to AstraZeneca and 
is in Phase II development for treating severe sepsis.
BTG’s strategy following the Protherics acquisition has 
been to establish US commercial operations in order to sell
CroFab™ and DigiFab™ directly from October 2010 when 
the distribution agreement with Nycomed ends; to build 
value in and commercialise its development pipeline, 
which was prioritised following the Protherics acquisition; 
and to license in or acquire new programmes and products 
that BTG can develop and sell in the US.

Markets
The products on which BTG earns royalties are sold worldwide,
though many licensees are US based and around 80% 
of these revenues are denominated in US dollars. All sales 
of CroFab™, which is used to treat the effects of the venom
resulting from bites by North American Crotalid snakes,
are in the US. DigiFab™ is available in over 40 countries,
with around 80% of sales by value in the US. In the near 
to medium term, the US is likely to remain as BTG’s main
geographical market.
Research and development
The Group’s research and development activities are
principally directed towards further developing its current
pipeline of six clinical stage programmes: Voraxaze™,
Varisolve
®
, OncoGel™, Pleneva™, the Angiotensin
Therapeutic Vaccine and BGC20-1531.
BTG intends to complete regulatory development of
Voraxaze™ and Varisolve
®
and, if approved, market 
the products in the US. The other four programmes are 
being developed to demonstrate proof of concept, which 
varies from programme to programme, prior to seeking
development and commercialisation partners.
Going forward, BTG intends to acquire later-stage
development programmes that it can develop through
regulatory approvals and market in the US itself. The focus 
is on lower-risk development opportunities with strong
potential market positions that meet the needs of specialist
physicians and their patients in the hospital and in selected
out-of-hospital settings.
2009/10 Performance
Key performance indicators
The Board uses ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial measures 
to track progress against objectives. 
The key ﬁnancial indicators are revenue, gross margin, 
proﬁt and cash. These have been selected as measures 
of progress towards achieving sustainable proﬁtability,
operating efﬁciency and cash management. Targets are 
set each year based on the Group’s annual budget.
The proﬁt and cash ﬁnancial indicators are linked to the
Group’s annual bonus scheme (see the remuneration report
on pages 47 to 58). For any bonus to be payable, the proﬁt
result must reach a threshold performance ﬁgure. In addition
to the threshold ﬁgure, the Board sets target and stretch
ﬁgures; the actual result determines the bonus payment
relating to the company performance element of the bonus
potential for all employees.
For the 2009/10 ﬁnancial year, the threshold was set at 80% of
budget, target at 100% and stretch at 120%. The Remuneration
committee determined that the results were achieved at the
97% level.
The non-ﬁnancial indicators used by the Board to track
operating progress against strategy and budgets feed into 
the personal objectives of employees. The results achieved 
by employees in respect of their personal objectives determine
the personal element of their bonuses. Below executive
director level, the weighting of company versus personal
performance depends on seniority, with more senior
employees having a greater weighting on company
performance. No personal performance bonus is payable 
if the proﬁt ﬁnancial indicator does not meet or exceed the
threshold target set for the year.
The key non-ﬁnancial indicators in 2009/10 related 
to establishing US commercial operations, achieving
development and manufacturing project milestones, and
business development activities. The table on page 13 
shows the key indicators and progress made towards
achieving them and sets out the priorities for 2010/11.

Trading update
Revenue of £98.5m (08/09: £84.8m) comprised total royalty
income of £64.2m (08/09: £71.4m) and marketed product
revenues of £34.3m (08/09: £13.4m). Recurring royalties were
£54.1m (08/09: £55.3m). Slightly higher sales of BeneFIX
®
and a positive impact from currency exchange were offset 
by reduced revenues from the three-part knee, for which 
the European patent expired, and lower sales of Campath
®
.
Milestones and one-off income were £10.1m (08/09: £16.1m).
Marketed product revenues from CroFab™ were £24.2m
(08/09: reported: £9.2m; pro forma £20.6m) and from
DigiFab™ were £5.4m (08/09: reported, £2.2m; pro forma,
£5.5m). Further details are provided in the ﬁnancial review.
Pipeline update
BTG has an internal development pipeline and a pipeline 
of licensed programmes.
Internal pipeline
Our pipeline comprises six programmes in clinical
development. Notable progress in 2009/10 included:
Varisolve
®
, being developed to treat moderate to severe
varicose veins – end of Phase II clinical and CMC meetings
held with the US FDA; Special Protocol Assessment (‘SPA’)
request made for two Phase III pivotal trials in the US. At a
recent meeting, the FDA gave support to commence three
planned Phase III trials. BTG plans to fund the Phase III trials 
in the US and to market the product in the US reimbursed
sector while exploring options for partnering in the US
aesthetic and rest-of-world markets. The Phase III trials are
expected to commence in H2 2010, leading to a potential
NDA submission in H2 2012.
Voraxaze™ (glucarpidase), under development for the
treatment of delayed methotrexate elimination – we continue
to prepare submissions for completing the rolling Biologics
License Application (‘BLA’) in the US this year.
OncoGel™, a special formulation of paclitaxel targeting
oesophageal cancer – a Phase IIb study continued patient
enrolment; preliminary tumour response data are anticipated 
at the end of 2010, with survival data expected at the end 
of 2011.
Pleneva™, an oral compound under development for multiple
sclerosis – a Phase IIa study was initiated in January 2010.
Recruitment is on target, with 67 of 166 patients enrolled and 23
of 35 study sites initiated to date; data are anticipated in H1 2011.
ATV (Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine), a novel approach 
to treating hypertension – a Phase I dose-ranging study was
completed with BTG’s novel proprietary adjuvant to explore
suitable doses to take into further clinical studies. BTG is
exploring partnering options while preparing ATV for a new
Phase IIa study.
BGC20-1531, a novel EP4 receptor antagonist targeted at a
number of indications in pain and inﬂammation – formulation
development continued and several studies were performed
in models of pain and inﬂammation.
In November 2009, BTG licensed its exclusive worldwide
rights for Acadra™ (acadesine) back to Advancell S.A., 
in exchange for an undisclosed potential future milestone
payment and a royalty on any future sales. Acadra™ 
is progressing through a Phase I/II study in patients with 
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
A Phase IIa study of Prolarix™ in primary liver cancer was
discontinued following BTG’s decision to seek a specialist
oncology partner that can potentially progress the compound
through a number of cancer indications.
Licensed pipeline
BTG has an economic interest in a number of programmes 
it has licensed to industry partners. The milestones and
royalties payable to BTG on successful development and
commercialisation vary from product to product. Milestones
tend to increase as products progress towards regulatory
approvals; on average, BTG receives mid-to-high single 
digit royalties on product sales and retains low-to-mid single
digit royalties after revenue sharing.
Progress in 2009/10 was made in several programmes.
Campath
®
(alemtuzumab), licensed to Genzyme 
Corporation, is approved as a treatment for chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia and in Phase III development for
multiple sclerosis. Recruitment has been completed in two
pivotal Phase III trials of patients with multiple sclerosis. 
A four-year review of a Phase II study, presented at the
American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, showed
that an estimated 71% of alemtuzumab-treated patients 
were free of clinically-active disease, compared to 35% 
of patients taking Rebif
®
(interferon beta-1a). Data from 
the Phase III trials are anticipated in 2011, with a potential
approval in multiple sclerosis in 2012.

Otelixizumab (formerly TRX4), licensed to Tolerx, Inc., is a
targeted T-cell immunomodulator in Phase III development 
for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Tolerx has partnered 
with GlaxoSmithKline to develop otelixizumab in a range 
of autoimmune disorders. In January 2010, the DEFEND-1
Phase III study completed enrolment of 240 patients, aged 
12 to 45 years, with newly diagnosed autoimmune type 1
diabetes. This triggered a milestone payment to BTG of $2.5m.
A second Phase III trial has commenced recruiting patients.
Abiraterone acetate, licensed to Cougar Biotechnology, Inc.,
which was acquired by Johnson & Johnson in July 2009, is
in Phase III development for treating prostate cancer. The ﬁrst
Phase III trial is testing abiraterone acetate in patients with
metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer who have
progressed after docetaxel-based chemotherapy has failed.
The second Phase III trial is studying abiraterone acetate in
patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer
who have yet to receive chemotherapy.
CytoFab™, licensed to AstraZeneca, is being developed 
to treat severe sepsis. BTG manufactures CytoFab™, which is
based on the same polyclonal antibody platform as CroFab™
and DigiFab™. AstraZeneca successfully completed a 
Phase IIa study CytoFab™ in 70 patients and is preparing 
to initiate a Phase IIb study in around 300 patients.
ONX 0801, licensed to Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a 
novel compound under development for treating a range 
of solid tumours. In September 2009, Onyx initiated a Phase I
open-label, dose-ﬁnding study to evaluate the safety and
pharmacokinetics of ONX 0801 in patients with advanced
solid tumours. Approval to commence this study triggered 
a $7m milestone payment to BTG.
Financial review
BTG’s ﬁnancial performance in 2009/10 was pleasing,
particularly in relation to progress made in achieving 
cost reductions and synergies following the acquisition 
of Protherics PLC in December 2008.
Prior year ﬁgures in the ﬁnancial statements include the 
results of the Protherics business from 4 December 2008 
to 31 March 2009. We include as an appendix to the
accounts, for comparative purposes only, an unaudited 
pro forma consolidated income statement for the prior 
year combining the results of BTG plc and Protherics PLC 
and based on extracts from the books and records of 
both companies.
Revenue
Reported revenue increased by 16.2% to £98.5m (08/09:
£84.8m). Total royalty income of £64.2m (08/09: £71.4m)
included recurring royalties of £54.1m, which were slightly
lower than in the prior year (08/09: £55.3m), when growth
had been 30.4%, and milestones/one-off income of £10.1m
(08/09: £16.1m). Key contributors to recurring royalties
included BeneFIX
®
, the haemophilia B treatment marketed 
by Wyeth, at £26.6m (08/09: £24.7m) and the two-part 
hip cup, licensed to all major hip manufacturers, which
generated £10.8m (08/09: £10.3m).
Marketed product revenues increased to £34.3m (08/09:
£13.4m) and compare favourably to pro forma 08/09
revenues of £29.7m. CroFab™ sales generated £24.2m
(08/09: £9.2m), with reductions in volumes offset by price
increases. DigiFab™ sales were £5.4m (08/09: £2.2m) and
Voraxaze™ generated £3.4m (08/09: £1.0m) from cost
recovery in the US and named patient sales in other territories.
From the pro forma accounts, in the full year to March 31
2009, CroFab™ sales were £20.6m, DigiFab™ sales were
£5.5m and Voraxaze™ generated £2.9m.

BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Non-recurring revenues of £10.1m (08/09: £16.1m) included 
a £4.2m milestone from Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on
approval to initiate a Phase I clinical study of ONX 0801 and
£2.0m revenue recognition of milestones received in prior
period ends under the CytoFab™ contract. The balance
mainly comprised a milestone from Tolerx, Inc. on 
completion of enrolment to a Phase III study of otelixizumab 
in type 1 diabetes and an upfront payment from licensing
exclusive worldwide rights to Allergan to develop products 
for diseases and conditions of the eye using BTG’s ReGel
®
drug delivery system.
Gross proﬁt
Gross proﬁt increased to £65.7m (08/09: £47.7m) and
delivered a gross margin of 66.7% (08/09: 56.3%). The
components of gross proﬁt are royalties, which include
recurring and non-recurring income, and marketed products.
Revenue sharing on recurring royalties was £16.1m (08/09:
£23.2m), giving a gross margin of 70.2% (08/09: 58.0%). 
The increase in margin resulted primarily from reduced
revenue-sharing obligations relating to the Factor IX licence.
On non-recurring royalties, revenue sharing was £1.5m
(08/09: £5.1m). The cost of sales relating to marketed products
was £15.2m and included a non-cash fair value adjustment 
of £0.3m relating to proﬁt in stock on acquisition. This
compared with a cost of sales in the prior year of £8.8m on
sales between 4 December 2008 and 31 March 2009 of
£13.4m, including a non-cash fair value adjustment of £2.3m.
Gross margin on marketed products increased to 55.7%
(08/09: reported, 34.3%; pro forma, 50.5%).
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased to £38.4m (08/09: £23.6m),
reﬂecting the full-year impact of employees and expanded
activities following the Protherics acquisition. Within operating
expenses, acquisition adjustments and reorganisation 
costs relating to amortisation and impairment of acquired
intangibles were £9.1m (08/09: £3.0m).
Other operating expenses of £25.3m (08/09: £19.7m)
included one-off expenditure of £1.9m for legal activity and
advisory services primarily relating to the Multi-level Cell
litigations. Selling costs increased to £3.8m (08/09: £0.5m) 
as preparations continued to establish US commercial
operations and compare to pro forma costs in 2008/09 
of £2.9m. G&A costs of £19.6m (08/09: £19.2m) compare
favourably to pro forma G&A expenses of £26.5m in
2008/09.
Research and development costs of £27.0m (08/09: £21.6m)
compared with costs of £36.0m from the pro forma accounts
for the 2008/09 year.
BTG set a target of reducing G&A costs by £10m and research
and development expenses by £10m by the end of the
2010/11 ﬁnancial year. Reductions to date of £6.9m in G&A
costs and £9.0m in research and development expenses
compared with the pro forma 2008/09 results show that the
Group is making excellent progress.
Major contributors to gross recurring
revenues for 2009/10
7884 Report 2010_Report 2010  02/06/2010  17:39  Page 19 20
Business review
BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Approximately 80% of the Group’s recurring revenue is
denominated in US$. The average £:US$ rate during 2009/10
was £1:$1.60 compared to an average rate of £1:$1.69 in
2008/09. There was a positive impact due to the movement 
of the US$ on reported revenue of approximately £2.8m when
compared to the prior year. The Group has a policy to hedge
between 80% and 90% of surplus US$ cash ﬂows for the
forthcoming 12 months. This results in realised gains and
losses as contracts expire. In 2009/10, settlement of forward
contracts and other $-denominated transactions resulted 
in losses of £4.0m (08/09: £0.9m). In addition, unrealised
foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised at year
end on the mark to market of forward contracts. At 31 March
2010, the total effect of mark-to-market adjustments was 
a gain of £6.5m (08/09: loss of £4.9m). These movements 
in fair value are reﬂected in net ﬁnancing.
The Group made a proﬁt on sale of investments and
intangible assets of £1.1m (08/09: £2.6m).
Acquisition adjustments and reorganisation costs
Acquisition adjustments and reorganisation costs relating 
to the acquisition of Protherics were £8.7m (08/09: £16.2m).
A charge of £9.1m is included in operating expenses of 
which £8.3m (08/09: £3.0m) is amortisation of intangible
assets acquired with Protherics and £0.8m is an impairment
charge following the decision to discontinue development 
of Prolarix™.
A non-cash fair value adjustment of £0.3m (08/09: £2.3m)
has been charged to cost of sales within marketed products
following the sale of inventory acquired with Protherics, 
which had been valued to reﬂect proﬁt accrued up to the
stage of production at the time of the transaction.
In the results for the 2008/09 year, reorganisation costs
relating to redundancies, site closure costs and impairment
charges were £10.9m. In the current year, operating expenses
have beneﬁted from a net credit of £0.7m in relation to
reorganisation costs, which arose following successful exits
from leased premises, allowing the release of previously
provided amounts, offset by other reorganisation costs.
Operating proﬁt
BTG made an operating proﬁt of £10.8m (08/09: £7 .0m) before
acquisition adjustments and reorganisation costs. The pro
forma 2008/09 results showed an operating loss of £1.1m.
Financial income and costs
The net ﬁnancial income was £7 .0m (08/09: net ﬁnancial
expense of £2.1m). Financial income of £7 .1m included interest
on cash held of £0.6m and a fair value gain of £6.5m on
marking to market BTG’s forward contracts to sell US dollars.
Proﬁt after tax
Taxation charges and adjustments in respect of prior years,
together with movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities,
produced a tax credit of £2.2m, resulting in a proﬁt after tax 
of £11.3m (08/09: loss of £13.1m).
To assist with the understanding of underlying trading
performance and earnings trends, BTG has included an
underlying earnings and earnings per share calculation. 
This adjusts for the impact of acquisition adjustments and
reorganisation costs. The underlying proﬁt for the ﬁnancial
year was £17.7m (08/09: £2.1m).
Earnings per share
In our ﬁrst full year of trading following the acquisition of
Protherics we are pleased to report our earnings per share 
of 4.4p which marks a signiﬁcant improvement from the
reported loss per share 7.1p in 2008/09. The underlying
earnings per share was 6.9p (08/09: 1.1p).
Non-current assets
Non-current assets decreased from £211.1m to £197.9m. 
The majority of the decrease relates to amortisation of the
intangible assets acquired with Protherics. The net book value
of the Group’s property, plant and equipment decreased 
by £0.5m owing to depreciation of manufacturing assets 
and equipment offset by additions.

Current assets, current and non-current liabilities
Inventory of raw material, work in progress and ﬁnished
goods of CroFab™ and DigiFab™ decreased to £9.6m
(08/09: £10.5m). Trade and other receivables decreased 
from £29.2m to £20.4m following receipt of one-off accrued
royalties at the prior year-end.
Current liabilities decreased from £69.7m to £43.4m. Trade
and other payables reduced from £52.0m to £40.8m as 
a result of the release of deferred income relating to advance
payments received from Nycomed and due to the payment 
of accrued revenue sharing amounts on one-off income
included at 31 March 2009. Derivative instruments reduced
from £7.3m to £0.8m as a result of the movement in the fair
value of forward contracts to sell US dollars.
Non-current liabilities increased from £47.1m to £52.4m. The
major movements are an increase of £9.2m relating to the
BTG deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan and a reduction of £1.8m 
in the provision for deferred taxation on the valuation of the
intangible assets acquired with Protherics. 
Cash
Net cash and equivalents increased from £78.2m at 31 March
2009 to £82.6m at 31 March 2010. BTG has no debt ﬁnancing
and considers the existing cash balances together with the
cash generated from operations sufﬁcient to meet its current
operational requirements.
Outlook
We exceeded our ﬁnancial goals in 2009/10. By driving
through our integration and cost saving initiatives we
delivered a proﬁtable and cash-generative business. This 
is the important ﬁrst step in our growth strategy. Having
established a resilient ﬁnancial platform we are now able 
to move forward to invest for future growth.
2010/11 is a milestone year for BTG as we will for the 
ﬁrst time sell our own products in the US. To manage this 
transition requires investment in a sales force, marketing 
and working capital as we unwind existing relationships 
with Nycomed, build our capabilities and establish launch
stock to sell ourselves. 
In 2011/12 we will enjoy a full year of
selling CroFab™ and DigiFab™ ourselves
and see the beneﬁts of that investment
ﬂow through in increased sales, gross
margin and earnings.
We have also conﬁrmed that we will take Varisolve
®
forward
in Phase III trials for the US reimbursed market. We estimate
the investment required will be approximately $55m to
achieve product approval. This will be spread over three
years. Varisolve
®
will potentially deliver signiﬁcant revenue
and earnings growth. 
On 18 May 2010, we acquired the land in Australia on which
we manage our sheep from Martindale Holdings Pty Ltd 
for A$13.7m. This is a central part of our supply chain and 
an integral part of our FDA approved manufacturing process.
This acquisition is not only an excellent opportunity to secure
our supply chain, it will also drive further margin efﬁciency
through cost savings.
We are able to make these investments with conﬁdence built
on the stable ﬁnancial foundations we have created over 
the past year and look forward to seeing the beneﬁts reﬂected
in the future ﬁnancial performance of BTG.

Business review
BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Interruption of product supply
BTG relies on third-party 
contractors for the supply of key
materials and services, such as
ﬁlling and freeze-drying of end
products. These processes carry
risks of failure and loss of product.
Problems at contractors’ facilities
may lead to delays and disruptions
in supplies. Some materials and
services may be available from 
one source only and regulatory
requirements make substitution
costly and time-consuming.
BTG’s polyclonal antibody products
rely on serum produced from 
our sheep ﬂocks in Australia, 
which could be subject to disease
outbreaks. BTG relies on its 
single site in Wales for supply 
of manufactured product, with 
the consequent possibilities
for disruption to supplies.
Rigorous monitoring of suppliers;
dual sourcing implemented
wherever possible; inventories
monitored through sales and
operational planning process and
production changes implemented
where needed to ensure continued
product supply; regular checks
made on sheep ﬂock health;
disaster recovery plans in place.
Principal risks and uncertainties
BTG’s performance and prospects may 
be affected by risks and uncertainties relating 
to its business and to the environment in 
which it operates.
The Group’s internal controls include a risk management
process to identify key risks and, where possible, manage 
the risks through its systems and processes and by
implementing speciﬁc mitigation strategies. The Group’s 
risk management processes are described further 
in the corporate governance report on pages 38 to 43.
The most signiﬁcant risks identiﬁed in an annual update 
of the Group’s risk register that could materially affect 
the Group’s ability to achieve its ﬁnancial and operating
objectives are summarised in this section. Other risks 
are unknown or deemed immaterial.

New royalty streams may emerge
from, for example, abiraterone
acetate if approved as a treatment 
for prostate cancer, Campath
®
if approved to treat multiple
sclerosis, otelixizumab if approved
to treat type 1 diabetes and
CytoFab™ if approved to treat
severe sepsis.
Patent expiries, product supply,
safety or compliance issues, 
or competition may reduce
current revenues
BTG’s key current royalty-generating
products are expected to continue
to provide royalty revenues until
their patents or licence agreements
expire. A number of patent expiries
will occur in 2011, including those
relating to BeneFIX
®
, the current
largest revenue earner and 
the only approved recombinant 
Factor IX treatment for the bleeding
disorder haemophilia B. Others are
expected to continue to generate
royalties including the MRC
humanisation IP (2015), Campath
®
(2017) and the two-part hip cup
(2019). Any unforeseen patent loss,
supply, safety or compliance 
issues with these products could
result in premature cessation 
of the revenues.
BTG also earns revenues from 
sales of its critical care products
including CroFab™ and DigiFab™.
Both have patent protection and
are also protected by signiﬁcant
know-how and complex
manufacturing processes, and 
BTG expects to continue earning
revenues following patent
expirations. However, future
competition cannot be ruled out
and competing products could
materially adversely impact 
BTG’s ﬁnancial results.

to challenge at any time.
Challenges can relate to the 
validity of patents or to alleged
infringement of others’ intellectual
property, which might result in
litigation costs and/or loss of
earnings. BTG might be obliged 
to sue third parties for their
infringement of its patents. Failure
by BTG to maintain or renew 
key patents might lead to loss 
of earnings and liability to suit 
from both the licensee and licensor. 
BTG may not be able to secure 
the necessary intellectual property
rights in relation to products in
development, limiting the potential
to generate value from these
products. Changes in patent laws
and regulations in territories where
BTG conducts its business that
make it more difﬁcult or time-
consuming to prosecute patents, 
or which reduce the exclusivity
period for granted patents, could
adversely impact the Group’s
ﬁnancial performance. BTG’s 
patent portfolio is currently subject
to several challenges. 
Dedicated internal resource
supplemented by external
expertise monitors patent 
portfolio and third-party patent
applications; processes in place 
to automate patent renewals;
internal controls established 
to avoid disclosure of patentable
material prior to ﬁling patent
applications.
Failure to comply with 
regulations may result 
in prosecutions
The pharmaceutical industry 
is highly regulated and the 
Group must comply with a broad
range of regulations relating 
to the development, approval,
manufacturing and marketing 
of its products. This is particularly
true in the US, from which 
the Group derives most of its 
revenues and where the Group 
is establishing its own sales and
marketing operations. Regulatory
regimes are complex and dynamic,
and alterations to the regulations
may result in delays in product 
development or in the products
becoming non-approvable.
Ensuring compliance with such
regulations necessitates allocation
of signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and
operating resources.
Failure to comply with relevant
rules, laws and regulations 
may result in criminal and civil
proceedings against the Group.
Signiﬁcant breaches could result 
in large ﬁnancial penalties, which
could materially adversely impact
the Group’s ﬁnancial performance
and prospects. Moreover, failure 
by BTG or a BTG partner company
to comply with regulations 
may result in a product being
withdrawn from the market with 
a subsequent loss of revenues.

BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The success of development
activities is uncertain
BTG may not be able to access 
the later-stage development
opportunities it seeks. The
development of medical products 
is inherently uncertain and the
timelines and costs to approval
may vary signiﬁcantly from budget
or expectation. The product may
not demonstrate the expected
efﬁcacy or safety beneﬁts and 
may not be approved by the
regulatory bodies, such as the 
US Food and Drug Administration.
Manufacturing difﬁculties or patent
litigation may cause programmes
to be delayed or halted. Failure 
of a late-stage programme 
such as Varisolve
®
would
materially adversely impact the
Group’s ﬁnancial prospects.
Inability to access new 
products and programmes 
may limit future growth
BTG does not conduct fundamental
research to generate its own
development programmes, but
instead seeks to acquire new
products and late-stage
development programmes from
other organisations. There is
signiﬁcant competition from other
companies also seeking to acquire
new products and programmes
who may have greater ﬁnancial
resources and sales and 
marketing reach than BTG. 
BTG may not be able to acquire
suitable products and programmes,
which will materially adversely
impact the Group’s ﬁnancial 
future performance and growth
prospects.
Dedicated, experienced product
acquisition team in place; strategy
is to focus on niche opportunities
that leverage BTG’s US commercial
operations and may be a better 
ﬁt with BTG than with other
organisations.
Experienced development team 
in place; focus is on acquiring 
later-stage programmes that 
have already demonstrated proof
of concept and potentially have
lower-risk development pathways;
development programmes
monitored by Pharmaceutical
Management Committee 
to identify risks and challenges 
and recommend mitigating 
and corrective actions.
Competition may erode 
revenues
The Group operates in highly
competitive markets. The products
on which BTG currently earns
revenues, or from which it
anticipates earning revenues once
on the market, face competition
from other products that are already
approved or in development.
Competing products may have
superior efﬁcacy and side-effect
proﬁles, cost less to produce or 
be offered at a lower price than
BTG’s products; such competition
could materially adversely impact
Group revenues.
BTG focuses on niche opportunities
addressing specialist markets
where there is limited competition
and high barriers to entry;
CroFab™ has no current competitor
and BTG estimates DigiFab™ 
has about 80% market share; 
both products are complex 
to manufacture.

Currency and treasury effects 
can adversely impact results
Many of BTG’s revenues and
receipts are denominated 
in US$ and movements in foreign
exchange rates could adversely
impact results. 
Pricing and reimbursement
pressures are increasing
There is increasing pressure on
healthcare budgets causing payers
to demand increasing treatment
and economic beneﬁts before
agreeing to reimburse product
suppliers at all or at appropriate
prices. In March 2010, healthcare
reform legislation was adopted 
in the US requiring manufacturers
to increase the rebates or discounts
they give on products reimbursed
or paid for by public payers
including Medicaid and Medicare.
The purpose of the reform is to
increase healthcare coverage in 
the US population and to manage
treatment of chronic conditions
efﬁciently and cost-effectively.
Management of acute conditions 
is generally not affected. BTG’s
CroFab™ and DigiFab™ products
treat acute conditions and the
impact of healthcare reform on
current Group revenues is expected
to be immaterial. If BTG acquires
products in future that are more
impacted by the healthcare
reforms, revenue expectations
could be lower. Failure of a product
to qualify for government or health
insurance reimbursement or the
failure to achieve an appropriate
sales price could adversely impact
the Group’s ﬁnancial performance.
BTG focuses on niche products 
that address serious unmet 
needs; early on in a product’s
development the Group conducts
pricing and reimbursement 
studies; the assessment 
of potential new products will
include an assessment of
healthcare reforms on pricing 
and reimbursement.
BTG actively manages its exchange
risks where feasible, using 
short-term hedging transactions
guided by market expectations 
and economic forecasts to 
seek to match actual receipts 
and payments over a rolling 
12 month period to those forecast.
This policy can result in both
exchange gains and losses 
but provides a level of certainty 
over cash receipts.

Corporate responsibility
“Corporate responsibility is an integral part of our

sound business sense, enabling us to beneﬁt 
from the adoption of sustainable behaviours for
the environment and to strengthen relationships
with key stakeholders.” 
Louise Makin
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
BTG’s CR framework
In the 2009/10 ﬁnancial year we adopted a new, structured
approach to corporate responsibility (‘CR’) reporting and 
we aim to operate the programme in accordance with
internationally recognised standards. We formed a CR
Committee comprising employees representing the main
Group functional activities and meetings are scheduled 
on a quarterly basis to set targets and monitor progress. 
The Committee reports to Rolf Soderstrom, the Board 
member with overall responsibility for CR.
Our CR reporting criteria have been carefully chosen as 
most relevant to our business impacts and widely feature 
in peer speciality pharmaceutical company CR disclosures:
Employment practices, human rights and standards 
of ethical conduct
Research and development practice
Suppliers, products and customers
Community
Environment
An extensive internal review was conducted by the 
CR Committee to capture all Group activities. Highlights 
are summarised here. Further details are featured on 
our new CR website pages, under each reporting criterion. 
The CR Committee has set targets for the next ﬁnancial 
year, also featured here. 
Employment practices, human rights and standards 
of ethical conduct
Our new Code of Conduct, previously called the Ethics 
and Policy Guide, ensures that our values, listed opposite, 
are reﬂected in everything we do. It includes Group-wide 
and local employment policies, procedures and practices
including equal opportunities and diversity, non-harassment,
violence prevention and family-friendly policies, which in many
instances exceed the minimum local statutory requirements.
Our Code of Conduct also includes business ethics policies,
procedures and practices on transparency, independence
and impartiality, risk management, data protection, corrupt
practices, conﬁdentiality, insider dealing, competition and
anti-trust matters. A comprehensive section on whistle
blowing encourages employees to report any concerns 
and provides for them to do so with anonymity.
An Internal Communications Plan was launched to increase
employee engagement across our different sites. Monthly
company-wide meetings, the intranet and email are used 
to communicate company matters, and elicit questions 
and feedback. Employee Representative Committees in 
our manufacturing facilities in Wales and Australia meet
regularly to discuss items of interest to both employees 
and management.
Training and mentoring is an integral part of our culture 
and dedicated Training Administrators help co-ordinate
employee training and development across the company 
to encourage continuous learning. We consider work
placement requests on a case-by-case basis at each site 
and over a dozen were completed last year. Each employee
has an Annual Training Review to support their professional
development. Lunch and Learn Seminars seek to capitalise 
on existing Group expertise and disseminate knowledge
internally, for the beneﬁt of all employees. During the last 
year we conducted workshops for all employees at all sites
to ensure that the importance of our values is recognised. 
We aim to live by our values and this year they will be 
formally measured as part of the employee appraisal
process. In the coming year BTG aims to launch an annual
employee questionnaire to gauge adoption of company
values and give insight into general employee satisfaction.

Diversity
We believe in equal opportunities and diversity which 
is a central global HR Policy. This year we are reporting the
percentage of women in the general workforce, Leadership
Team and Board.
Suppliers, products and customers
Producing safe, quality medicines has always been a
fundamental business necessity at BTG and the position 
of Head of Quality reports directly to the CEO.
All our products and medicines are developed, tested 
and distributed according to the standard of good practice
required by pharmaceutical regulators. We only appoint
CROs, Contract Manufacturing Organisations and other 
third-party vendors that have high standard of ethics and
quality and comply with good practice guidance.
We operate compassionate use and named patient
programmes to ensure that physicians are able to access 
our emergency medicines for their patients in territories 
where they have not yet received regulatory approval.
In October 2010, we will assume responsibility for selling 
and marketing CroFab™ and DigiFab™ in the US. 
To support preparations in advance of this important
company milestone, we have successfully attracted new
talent to the US-based commercial team in the ﬁelds 
of sales, marketing and medical affairs. To improve our
relationship with our customers we aim to capitalise 
on this new expertise. Several targets have been 
identiﬁed for completion during the next year including 
the development of a new Sales and Marketing Code 
of Conduct and a hotline for sales to incorporate ethical 
and compliance issues such as adverse events reporting. 
In addition, during the coming year we aim to roll out 
a certiﬁcation process for all employees on compliance 
in sales and marketing activities. 
We’re also considering the development of a National
Emergency Programme to supply product free of cost 
to areas where there may be a national emergency.
Research and development practice
We respect the safety of clinical research participants 
and our clinical trials are performed in accordance with the
listed directives, regardless of whether they are performed 
in developed or developing countries. We ensure that 
the medical care given to, and medical decisions made 
on behalf of, research participants are the responsibility 
of a qualiﬁed physician. The rights, safety and well-being 
of the trial subjects prevail over all other interests. We ensure
that all patient data is recorded conﬁdentially and handled
and stored in a way that allows accurate reporting,
interpretation and veriﬁcation according to best practice,
including reporting of adverse clinical events.
Our policy is that all animal experimentation will be
performed to the highest standard of ethics, adhering 
to the three guiding principles of reduction, reﬁnement 
and replacement. All animal experimentation is performed 
at external Clinical Research Organisations (‘CRO’) and
academic units and we will only work with external parties
that evaluate all animal studies using a local ethical review
process. In addition, we will only perform studies in territories
where animal studies are strictly regulated. Alternatives 
to animal use will always be assessed and in vitro testing
performed as an alternative wherever possible.

Community
A policy on political and charitable donations is incorporated 
into the Code of Conduct. We make no political donations but
political lobbying is undertaken when appropriate, generally
through local industry associations.
Local community support is important to us, especially in 
our more remote sites such as Australia and Wales. In our
manufacturing plant in Wales, we periodically organise
educational open days for local schools. In addition we
sponsor the local, mid-Wales section of Royal Society of
Chemistry (‘RSC’) ‘Top of the Bench’ competition, a national
competition run by the RSC for 14 to 16 year old students. 
Our manufacturing plant in Australia supports local 
community sports teams and held an educational open 
day last year for local students from the University 
of Adelaide.
We support charities and organisations that are either
relevant to our area of work or are local to business activities
and operations and we encourage our employees to
participate in fundraising events for our designated charities.
A main focus of our charitable giving initiatives involves
proactive engagement with sustainable development
initiatives. We are sponsoring the education of David Tusime 
in Uganda through World Vision. We’re also sponsoring
Janvier Kaseniza, a pharmacy student, through the Orphans
Project. Janvier is studying at the University of Butare in 
south west Rwanda.
During the last year we made local donations to charities
including:
CCLG – The Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group, UK
Cancer Research UK
Wales Air Ambulance, Wales
Christian Lewis Children’s Cancer Charity, Wales
Tˆ y Hafan – palliative care for children, Wales
CARA – local riding for the disabled, Wales
Melmark School, Philadelphia, PA, US
Leukaemia & Lymphoma Society, US
Anti-Cancer Foundation South Australia
Lifeline telephone counselling service, Australia
We operate a Give As You Earn (‘GAYE’) Scheme in the UK. 
This enables employees to efﬁciently donate so money 
that would normally be given in tax goes to their chosen
charity instead. A new GAYE scheme will be launched 
in the coming year, following the identiﬁcation of a more 
cost-effective service provider.

Environment
The welfare of our employees whether on manufacturing 
sites or in ofﬁces is an important priority for us. Our Health 
and Safety Manual and Policies and Procedures are compliant
with local legislation. Training, audits and risk assessments
occur regularly and we maintain strong local relationships with
government Health and Safety bodies. Consultative processes
are in place in both manufacturing sites to encourage
employee reporting and involvement in health and safety
issues. This year BTG has published health and safety
incidence rates for our manufacturing sites in Wales and
Australia. The Group has an excellent safety record with 
no fatalities and only four minor incidents during 2009.
An environment policy is incorporated into our Code of
Conduct. Our product supply chain involves international
transportation over long distances. Wherever possible, we use
ships rather than air freight for product distribution to reduce 
its carbon footprint. Company policy is to adopt best available
techniques not entailing excessive cost (‘BATNEEC’) and best
practicable environmental option (‘BPEO’) at all times to prevent
pollution to the air, land and water. Our manufacturing site 
in Wales has an Integrated Pollution and Prevention Control
(‘IPPC’) permit from the Environment Agency and has achieved
the Green Dragon Environmental standard Level 2. Our
manufacturing facility in Wales is installing a waste water
treatment plant which should be fully functional next year. Our
manufacturing facility in Australia has installed a 50,000 litre
rainwater tank to collect and recycle grey water from gutters. 
Sustainability is a central CR ethos. We offer recycling of
paper, cardboard, plastic and metal and food waste at each
of our sites and we aim to source local materials, suppliers
and contractors wherever possible, provided these offer
equivalent quality and value for money. Last year our London
ofﬁce received a Merit Award in the 2009 Clean City Awards
Scheme which recognises good waste management
practices in the City of London. 
We monitor electricity and gas consumption at our
manufacturing site in Wales and try to reduce carbon
emissions and increase energy efﬁciency wherever possible.
This year we have started to report consumption with an aim
to increase efﬁciency over the longer term. We aim to include
ﬁgures for our manufacturing site in Australia next year. Our
ofﬁce space is rented so we have limited control on controlling
environmental impacts but wherever possible we try to
inﬂuence landlords and managing agents to provide energy
efﬁcient systems. Additional initiatives are in place to reduce
our carbon footprint. Videoconference and teleconference
systems and net meeting software provide an alternative 
to business travel. Our manufacturing facility in Wales
operates a car sharing initiative to encourage efﬁcient travel
to work for employees. Our manufacturing facility in Australia
is working towards a Green Biz Certiﬁcate, designed to give
small and medium organisations ways to measure eco
efﬁciency footprints.

Directors’ report
The directors present their Annual Report and Accounts
on the affairs of the Group, together with the audited
ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010.
Principal activities and business review
The principal activity of the Group is the development and
commercialisation of life science technologies. The Group 
in-licenses, develops and commercialises pharmaceuticals
and has a broad pipeline of research and development
programmes targeting oncology, neurological and other
disorders. The Group manufactures and sells pharmaceutical
products and potential drugs for use in the treatment of
human diseases. It has a substantial and growing revenue
stream of milestones and royalties from out-licensed 
products and revenues from marketed products. The results 
of the Group are set out in detail on pages 62 to 65 and the
accompanying notes.
The information that fulﬁls the requirements of the Business
Review, including a review of the business, the principal
business risks, key performance indicators and likely future
developments, can be found in the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s
Review on pages 10 to 12, the Business Review on pages
14 to 21, the Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 
24 to 27 and the Corporate Responsibility Report on pages 
28 to 32. These are incorporated into this report by reference.
Further information on the Group is available on the
Company’s website: www.btgplc.com.
Results and dividends
The results for the year and the ﬁnancial position at 31 March
2010 are shown in the consolidated income statement on
page 62 and the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position
on page 63. The directors do not recommend the payment 
of a dividend for the year (2009: nil). The results of the Group
for the year are explained further on pages 18 to 21.

The directors of the Company at the date of this report,
together with their biographical details and dates of
appointment, are shown on pages 34 and 35. The Board
conﬁrms that each of the directors who served during 
the year has been formally appraised during the period 
and that they continue to demonstrate commitment to 
the Group and the Board and to their role. 
In accordance with the Company’s articles of association,
each director is subject to re-election at intervals of not 
more than three years. Any director appointed during the 
year is separately required to retire and seek election 
at the next AGM. Accordingly, Louise Makin and Peter
Chambré retire by rotation and, being eligible, the Board 
is recommending they offer themselves for re-election. 
Colin Blakemore also retires from the Board at the AGM 
but is not standing for re-election.
During the year the Company has maintained cover for its
directors and ofﬁcers and those of its subsidiary companies
under a directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance policy as
permitted by sections 232 to 235 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company has entered into separate Deeds of Indemnity
in favour of each of its directors to the extent permitted by law.
Information on directors’ remuneration, contracts, options 
and their beneﬁcial interests, including those of their
immediate families, in the shares of the Company are shown
in the Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 58. None of 
the directors had an interest in any contract of signiﬁcance 
to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries was party
during the year. Giles Kerr is Director of Finance at Oxford
University, an organisation with which the Group has 
a number of pre-existing agreements. See note 36 on 
page 104 for further information.

Share capital and shareholders
During the year 2,299,676 BTG shares were issued under
various share schemes. Of the shares issued, 1,006,668 
were released to employees and former employees 
of BTG as a result of the exercise of share options under the
Company’s employee share schemes. Under the terms of the
acquisition of the Protherics Group in December 2008, current
and former employees who held share options under the
old Protherics’ schemes were entitled to exercise their options.
Following exercise they received BTG shares in the ratio 0.291
BTG shares for each Protherics share, the same ratio as was
received by shareholders at the date of acquisition. Of the
shares issued, 1,293,008 related to awards under the old
Protherics share schemes. There are no restrictions on voting
rights or on the transfer of securities. Share capital comprises
solely of ordinary shares and all have the same voting rights.
Details of outstanding share options and awards are set 
out in note 30 to the ﬁnancial statements on pages 96 to 98.
Details of the movements in the Company’s share capital 
are shown in note 24 to the ﬁnancial statements on page 90.
At 31 March 2010, the Company had 9,199 shareholders
(2009: 10,429). Further details of shareholdings and Company
reporting dates may be found on page 116.

The Company’s articles of association permit the Company 
to purchase any of its shares, however this cannot be done
without the approval of shareholders at an AGM and there is
no current intention of requesting this authority. The Company
may also issue shares in accordance with the resolutions set
out in the AGM Notice, enclosed with this report.
Policy on payment of creditors
It is the BTG Group’s policy to abide by the terms of payment
agreed with suppliers. In many cases, the terms of payment
are as stated in the supplier’s own literature. In other cases,
the terms of payment are determined by speciﬁc written or
oral agreement.
At 31 March 2010 the total owed to trade creditors by 
the Group was equivalent to 41 days average purchases 
(2009: 35 days). The Company had no trade creditors 
at that date (2009: nil). 
Going concern
On the basis of current ﬁnancial projections and cash
resources and facilities available, and after making enquiries,
the directors believe that the Company has adequate
resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held
at 10.30am on 13 July 2010 at the ofﬁces of Stephenson
Harwood, One St Paul’s Churchyard, London EC4M 8SH. 
The details of the resolutions to be proposed are set 
out in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting which 
is enclosed with this report.
Among the resolutions at the AGM are proposals to adopt new
articles of association in order to incorporate ﬁnal changes
brought in by the Companies Act 2006. Further details are set
out in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
The directors who held ofﬁce at the date of approval of this
Report conﬁrm that, so far as they are each aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor
is unaware; and each director has taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Auditor
Resolutions will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting, to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditor
and to authorise the directors to determine its remuneration.

Directors and governance
BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Corporate governance
The Board of BTG recognises its accountability to shareholders
and believes that good corporate governance is essential 
to running a successful company. The Board is committed 
to ensuring that high levels of corporate governance are
maintained that underpin the management of the Company’s
affairs. This report explains how the Company applies the
principles of the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the ‘Code’), published by the Financial Reporting
Council (‘FRC’).
The Board considers that the Company complied with all 
the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code throughout the
year to 31 March 2010. More information on the Code can 
be found on the FRC website, www.frc.org.uk.
Board composition, responsibilities and balance
The Board comprises six non-executive directors, including
the Chairman, and two executive directors. The Board is
chaired by John Brown who is responsible for leading the
Board and ensuring the effectiveness on all aspects of its role.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Louise Makin, is primarily
responsible for the running of the Group. Rolf Soderstrom,
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, is responsible for all ﬁnancial 
reporting, tax and ﬁnancial control aspects of the Group.
The Board has appointed Giles Kerr as the Senior
Independent Non-executive Director (‘SID’). The principal 
role of the SID is to support the Chairman in his role, to lead
non-executive directors in the oversight of the Chairman and
to ensure there is a clear division of responsibility between 
the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. He is also available
to shareholders to enable them to express concerns which
the normal channels have failed to resolve or which would 
be inappropriate. 
The names and brief biographical details of all the directors
are set out on pages 34 and 35. The table below details the
composition of the Board, its committees, together with their
attendance at meetings since the last Annual Report and the
Company’s assessment of the independence of the directors.

Directors and governance
BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The Board applies a rigorous process in order to satisfy 
itself that its non-executive directors remain independent. 
The Board reviews the independence of the non-executive
directors every year, using its own judgement when applying
the criteria in the Code. Having undertaken this review, 
the Board conﬁrms that all the non-executive directors are
considered to be independent in character and judgement. 
In line with the recommendations of the Code, at least half 
the Board, excluding the Chairman, are independent non-
executive directors. The Chairman, John Brown, was
considered to be independent at the date of appointment
although, in accordance with the Code, he is excluded 
from the determination of whether at least half the Board 
are independent non-executive directors thereafter.
The Board has a number of matters speciﬁcally reserved 
for its decision or approval. These include the approval 
of the interim and annual ﬁnancial statements, the interim
management statements and major public announcements,
setting strategic direction, budgets and long-term plans. 
Other areas include the approval of major investments 
and disposals, major capital expenditure, major litigation,
signiﬁcant ﬁnancing, dividend policy and senior executive
remuneration and appointments.
The Board as a whole monitors operating performance, 
the performance of management, succession planning,
health, safety and environmental performance and 
standards of ethical and social behaviour. It is also
responsible for developing robust corporate governance 
and risk management procedures aimed at safeguarding 
the Company’s reputation and assets and the integrity 
of its ﬁnancial information.
While the executive and non-executive directors are
collectively responsible for the success of the Company 
and have ﬁduciary duties towards shareholders, their roles
are strictly delineated. The executive directors have direct
responsibility for the business operations of the Company, 
the non-executive directors have a responsibility to bring
independent and objective judgement to Board decisions 
and the Chairman’s primary responsibility is for the 
effective running of the Board. The non-executives’ duties
include helping to develop the Company’s strategy and
constructively challenging the executive directors where 
they consider it appropriate. 
To address the effect of Section 175 of the Companies 
Act 2006 (directors’ conﬂicts of interests) which came into 
force on 1 October 2008, the Company’s articles were
amended in October 2008 to enable the Board to authorise
situations that might give rise to directors’ conﬂicts of interest. 
Directors were asked to complete a declaration form in 
order to determine whether any actual or potential conﬂicts 
needed authorisation. The Company Secretary reviewed 
the responses and conﬁrmed that no conﬂicts arose.
Subsequently Board members are reminded at regular
intervals to disclose any conﬂicts should they arise. To date 
no material conﬂicts of interest have arisen.
At the March 2010 Board meeting all directors were asked 
to review and make any necessary amendments to their
existing declarations. All such notiﬁcations are kept in 
a conﬂicts register maintained by the Company Secretary. 
Any director who considers they may have a potential 
conﬂict of interest should report this to the Chairman 
in ﬁrst instance, who may consult the Nomination Committee
and report their ﬁndings to the Board.
There is an agreed procedure for directors to take independent
professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Directors have direct access to the advice and the services 
of the Company Secretary who is responsible for ensuring 
that Board procedures are followed. The Company arranges
appropriate directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance. 
The removal of a director or of the Company Secretary 
is a matter for the Board as a whole. 
Information and training, performance evaluation 
and re-election of directors
The directors are sent an agenda and a full set of papers 
for each item to be discussed, in advance of each Board 
or Committee meeting. Additional information is provided 
as appropriate and senior executives regularly make
presentations at Board meetings on the results and 
strategies in their areas of responsibility.
Upon joining BTG each director receives a comprehensive
induction package, including written information and
opportunities to meet key and relevant members of staff. 
All directors refresh their knowledge regularly through
publications and conferences and through information
provided by the Company and its advisers.
The Board evaluates its own effectiveness and that of its
Committees on an annual basis, both through measuring
performance against annual objectives and through 
an individual appraisal process. The chairman of each
Committee reports the results of the reviews back to the 
Board with identiﬁed areas for future action.

Directors and governance
BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Corporate governance continued
The CEO is responsible for appraising the performance of
the CFO, the Chairman and non-executive directors review 
the performance of the CEO. Each director was asked 
to complete a questionnaire comprising both qualitative 
and quantitative responses. The Chairman, John Brown,
subsequently interviewed each director separately to discuss
individual performance as a director over the past year, the
effectiveness of the Committees and the Board as a whole
and how it might improve its monitoring of the business. 
The non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent
Director and following input from the executive directors,
evaluated the performance of the Chairman. The Committees
also reviewed their performance and reported the results 
to the Chairman and the Board as a whole. The operation 
of the Board and its members was felt to be effective and the
Board considered it had a good mix of experience and skills.
The non-executive directors meet at least once a year without
the executive directors in order to discuss the performance 
of the executive directors and any concerns over their
management of the Company’s affairs.
All directors are required to stand for election at the ﬁrst 
AGM following their appointment and then to be re-elected 
at least once every three years thereafter. The Board reviews
its constitution regularly and has established a clear plan 
for refreshing its members. During the year ended 31 March
2008 Sir Brian Fender retired and was replaced as Chairman
by John Brown. Fred Weiss retired, having served for two
three-year terms, and was replaced on the Board and 
as chairman of the Audit Committee by Giles Kerr and 
Colin Blakemore also joined the Board. At the 2008 AGM
Consuelo Brooke retired from the Board, having served for
two three-year terms and Alison Wood retired due to other
commitments. In December 2008 Rolf Soderstrom joined 
the Board following the acquisition of Protherics and Christine
Soden retired on 31 March 2009. On 2 April 2009, James
O’Shea was appointed to the Board. After these changes 
the Board comprised of the non-executive Chairman, ﬁve
independent non-executive directors, the CEO and CFO. 
As reported in the Nomination Committee report on page 
46, the Committee continues to review the composition of 
the Board on a regular basis to ensure that, as the business
evolves, the Board continues to have the necessary skills 
to continue the development of the business.
Louise Makin and Peter Chambré are standing for re-election
at the 2010 AGM. The Board has reviewed their performance
and commitment to the business and, in the opinion of the
Board, they continue to show effectiveness and commitment
in their respective roles. Louise Makin has a strong background
in the life sciences area and has shown substantial leadership
in her role as CEO in returning the Group to proﬁtability 
and in integrating the two businesses together since the
acquisition of the Protherics Group. Peter Chambré has 
shown substantial commitment and independence in his 
role as a non-executive director and has substantial
experience in managing life science companies. Further
information on the directors is shown in their biographies 
on pages 34 and 35.
Financing reporting and internal control
The statement of directors’ responsibilities in relation to the
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements is set out on page 59
and the auditor’s statement on the respective responsibilities
of directors and the auditor is included within its report set 
out on page 60. 
Communications with shareholders, be they results
announcements, interim reports, annual reports or AGM
and trading updates, are reviewed carefully and approved 
by the Board or a sub-committee thereof in order to ensure
they are transparent and balanced in the view they give 
of the Company’s progress and prospects.
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the
Group maintains an adequate system of internal control 
and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board undertakes the
detailed monitoring of the controls, at least annually, and
reports to the Board on its ﬁndings. The Board has reviewed
the system of internal controls including ﬁnancial controls 
for the year under review and up to the date of approval 
of this Annual Report. Such a system is designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The criteria applied by the directors in judging the effectiveness
of these controls are that they allow the maximisation of
shareholder value by exploiting business opportunities while
ensuring that risks are properly identiﬁed and managed. 
The controls are regularly reviewed to ensure that they enable
the proper management of business risks without so restricting
efﬁciency and entrepreneurial nature that they inhibit proper
running of the business. 
BTG has a management structure with clear lines of
responsibility and accountability, staffed by appropriate
personnel. The Board is responsible for setting the overall
strategy and reviewing the performance of the Group.

Directors and governance
BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The day-to-day running of BTG’s operations is managed by
the Company’s Senior Leadership Team, chaired by the CEO.
Other members include the CFO and senior staff members
from the business. This team is also responsible for the
recommendation to the Board of the Company’s strategy
and its subsequent implementation, for ensuring that
appropriate internal controls are in place to manage and
assess risk and that they are fully complied with.
Following the acquisition of the Protherics Group, the Company
set up an Integration Committee to manage all aspects 
of bringing the two businesses together. This committee
continued its work during 2009/10 including a progress
review of second stage integration. It is the Committee’s
view that integration activities are largely complete.
The review of risk and risk management is embedded
throughout the Group. The Group has a Risk Committee,
chaired by the CFO and including staff from all sections of the
business, which reviews the risks throughout the business 
and to identify and evaluate risks which may impact on the
Group’s strategic and business objectives. The risk team
maintains a risk management plan that identiﬁes the key risks.
The plan is designed to assess the probability of those risks
occurring, the impact should they occur, how such risks may
be mitigated and monitored and the actions and individuals
responsible for managing the risks. The Committee continues
to monitor all areas of risk and the progress of actions
designed to mitigate such risks; it reports its ﬁndings twice-
yearly through the Audit Committee to the Board. For 
details of principal risks and uncertainties that may affect 
the business, see pages 24 to 27 in the Business Review.
The Board has reviewed the risk management process and
conﬁrms that ongoing processes and systems ensure that
BTG continues to be compliant with the guidance on internal
control issued by the Code.
The fundamental elements of the Group’s internal control 
and risk management framework are described below.
Structure and reporting
The day-to-day operation of the Group is carried out 
under the overall guidance of the Senior Leadership Team. 
The Group has well-deﬁned management structures and
processes for acquisition, assessment and evaluation of
technology opportunities, and development and execution 
of commercialisation strategies. A signiﬁcant change in the
structure is currently taking place as a sales and marketing
operation is being set up in the US in order to enable the
selling of healthcare products to US hospitals and other
similar organisations. 
The Group has two committees containing senior members 
of staff who review all stages of its development operations; 
a committee responsible for the review and recommendation
of potential acquisitions or in-licensing of new drug
programmes and a committee responsible for the review 
and proactive management of all projects in BTG’s
development portfolio. These committees report regularly 
to the Senior Leadership Team and are able to call on the
expertise of various internal and external experts to ensure
the programmes are developed effectively and meet
commercial and market needs. 
The Group has also set up a Compliance Committee to
oversee the establishment of a complete compliance system
to ensure that the Group is fully compliant with all US Federal
and State requirements for operating a sales and marketing
team in the US by the time it commences product sales in
October 2010.
BTG actively monitors its royalty revenue streams and from
time to time audits its major licensees to ensure compliance
with the terms of agreements. BTG also has a system for
supporting the protection and maintenance of patents.
The Senior Leadership Team meets formally at least once
each month to review business performance measured
against annual budgets and longer-term plans and an
agreed set of objectives and performance criteria for each
business unit. Forecasts are reset quarterly on the basis 
of detailed reviews of progress and prospects. Reporting 
to the Board is based on these monthly and quarterly
assessments. The reports include non-ﬁnancial as well 
as ﬁnancial information and a review of development
progress with the portfolio. 
Approval procedures
The Group has delegated authority structures that ensure 
that decisions are taken at an appropriate level, with an
appropriate level of input by internal and external expert
advisers. The delegated authority structure prescribes
ﬁnancial limits of approval at each level and requires
decisions with signiﬁcant ﬁnancial, legal or reputational
impact for BTG to be approved by the Board. The process 
has been under review during the year and a revised 
group-wide structure has been put in place.
Corporate policies, values and compliance
A statement of corporate values and a guidance booklet 
on ethics, business practices and compliance are distributed
throughout the Group. Relevant employees meet regularly 
to discuss external changes in the regulatory, legal and
ﬁnancial environments in which BTG operates to ensure 
it remains fully compliant with new legislation and best
practice. The guidance booklet is currently being updated 
to reﬂect changes in the nature of BTG’s business and the
continuing evolution of the rules and regulations under 
which the Group operates. 
7884 Report 2010_Report 2010  02/06/2010  17:40  Page 41 The Board, through the Audit Committee, has reviewed the
effectiveness of the internal controls of the Group. The controls
described above operate and are embedded within the day-
to-day business. There is an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group.
A reporting structure has been in place throughout the year
and up to the date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements 
and is regularly reviewed by the directors in accordance with
the Code.
As required by the Code, the Board has considered whether 
it would be appropriate to have a dedicated internal audit
function within the Group and has concluded that, taking 
into account its relatively small size, and the way the business 
is run, this is not appropriate at present. This decision will be
reviewed on an annual basis. During the year a new process
was set up for internal review. Finance divisions of each 
ofﬁce are responsible for monitoring and reviewing controls 
on a regular basis. Each ofﬁce is to be visited by Head Ofﬁce
ﬁnance staff to ensure compliance. The Group’s ofﬁces in the
UK and US were visited by Head Ofﬁce ﬁnance staff during 
the year; the Australian ofﬁce will be visited in the coming 
year in addition to repeat visits to other sites. The results of 
this work are reported to the Board, via the Audit Committee,
twice a year. 
Related parties and conﬂicts of interest
BTG maintains robust procedures to ensure that related party
transactions and potential conﬂicts of interest are identiﬁed,
disclosed and managed. These procedures include: directors
declare interests in other businesses on appointment to the
Board and annual self-certiﬁcation by directors. Where it is
identiﬁed that a related party relationship exists, the Board
agrees speciﬁc additional procedures to ensure the effective
management of potential conﬂicts of interest.
Giles Kerr, a non-executive director of BTG plc, is also 
the Director of Finance for Oxford University and a director 
of Isis Innovations Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Oxford University. BTG plc’s wholly owned subsidiaries 
BTG International Ltd and British Technology Group Inter-
Corporate Licensing Ltd have pre-existing licence agreements
with Oxford University and Isis Innovations under which 
they are obliged to pay royalties on amounts received from
commercialising certain Intellectual Property.
As a non-executive director of BTG plc, Giles Kerr will 
not participate in any discussions concerning the relevant
agreements either within the Board meetings of BTG plc 
or in any other discussions or meetings with the executives 
of BTG plc and its subsidiaries.
Within Oxford University and Isis Innovations Limited, Giles
Kerr’s responsibilities with respect to the relevant agreements
are limited to ﬁnancial reporting and control together with
managing and applying University revenue recognition
policies. He will not participate in any other discussions
concerning the relevant agreements.
The Board has considered, and is satisﬁed with, this
separation of duties. See note 36 for additional related 
party disclosures.
Market abuse directive
As required by the Market Abuse Directive, the Company 
has set up a Disclosure Committee, comprising the CEO, 
CFO and one other senior member of staff. The Committee
meets on an ad hoc basis as required. The Committee
reviews all signiﬁcant items of business within the Group 
on a regular basis and maintains an Insider List recording
both those employed within the Group and at external
advisers who may have access to inside information.
Whenever individuals are placed on or removed from 
the List they are notiﬁed accordingly and advised of their
responsibilities.
Relations with shareholders and constructive 
use of the AGM
BTG endeavours to maintain good communications 
with shareholders through formal and informal dialogue. 
The Company formally reports its results twice a year with 
full year results announced in May and interim results in
November. The CEO and CFO give presentations of these
results to the Company’s institutional shareholders, analysts
and the media. The presentations are broadcast live on 
the internet for the information of shareholders and are
available thereafter as an archive on the Company’s website. 
In addition the Company prepares Interim Management
Statements that are released to the UK Listing Authority and
are available on the Company’s website.
The CEO and CFO meet regularly with institutional investors
with support from the Investor Relations department. The
Chairman, Senior Independent Director and other directors
are available to meet with major shareholders on request. 
No requests have been received although the Chairman of
the Remuneration Committee has had dialogue with investors
on remuneration issues during the year. As part of his role 
as the Senior Independent Director, Giles Kerr is available 
to shareholders when contact with the executive directors 
or the Chairman may not be appropriate.

making recommendations to the Board on the appointment 
of executive and non-executive directors, and their re-
appointment following retirement by rotation; and for ensuring
that succession planning is in place. The Committee also
advises the Board on matters generally relating to Board
appointments and meets as required, but at least twice a year.
A report on the work of the Committee is set out on page 46.
Compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code
The Board considers that the Company complied in full with
the principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code
throughout the year ended 31 March 2010. Details of directors’
remuneration, as required by the Combined Code and
Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, is set out

The Company’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, is required to review
whether this corporate governance statement reﬂects the
Company’s compliance with nine of the Code’s provisions 
as speciﬁed in the Listing Rules of the FSA, relating to
Accountability and Audit. Having conducted such a review
KPMG is obliged to report if it considers this statement of
compliance does not reﬂect such compliance. The Company
conﬁrms that no such report has been made.

Giles Kerr (Committee Chairman) 6 November 2007
Colin Blakemore 16 July 2008
William Jenkins 27 July 2005
Giles Kerr, as Director of Finance at Oxford University, is
considered by the Board to have the necessary signiﬁcant
recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience to qualify him to be the
chairman of the Committee. He receives additional remuneration
to compensate him for his additional responsibilities, as set 
out on page 53. Other members bring detailed knowledge 
of scientiﬁc research and clinical trial operations to the
deliberations of the Committee. For further information see
the directors’ biographies on pages 34 and 35.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee can be found
on the Group’s website or from the Company on request.
These terms of reference reﬂect the recommendations of 
‘The Smith Guidance’.
A summary of matters considered at the Committee since 
the last Annual Report and actions taken is shown below:
– Review of the Group’s half year results to 30 September
2009 and full year results to 31 March 2010
– Review of the reports from the external auditor on the
interim and full year results to 31 March 2010
– Review of the scope, nature, resource planning and fee
estimate for the full-year audit
– Review of trading updates issued by the Group and
amendments thereto
– Assessment of the going concern basis
– Review of risk management systems, internal controls 
and fraud procedures
– Review of the disclosures relating to material risks 
in the Business Review
– Assessment of the need for an internal audit function
– Review of monitoring process for equity portfolio and 
its valuation
– Considering report of internal review work covering 
a review of controls at Group sites in the UK and US
– Completed effectiveness review.
A key role of the Committee is to undertake detailed
monitoring of the interim and annual ﬁnancial statements. 
As part of this review it discusses the audit ﬁndings and
auditor’s report with management and the external auditor
and considers signiﬁcant judgements and issues contained 
in them, whether the ﬁnancial statements comply fully with 
the relevant statutes and accounting standards and if they
present a balanced assessment of the Company’s ﬁnancial
position and prospects. Following this discussion the
Chairman of the Audit Committee reports the results of the
Committee’s review to the full Board. The external auditor
generally meets with the non-executive directors at the 
time when the half and full-year results are discussed.
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the
Group maintains an adequate system of internal control 
and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board undertakes the
detailed monitoring of the controls and reports to the Board
on its ﬁndings twice a year. The Committee has reviewed the
system of material controls including ﬁnancial, operational,
compliance and risk for the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of this Annual Report. Such a system
is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The criteria applied by the directors in judging the effectiveness
of these controls are that they allow the maximisation of
shareholder value by exploiting business opportunities while
ensuring that risks are properly identiﬁed and managed. 
The controls are regularly reviewed to ensure that they 
enable the proper management of business risks without 
so restricting efﬁciency and entrepreneurial nature that they 
inhibit proper running of the business.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the
material controls of the Group, which are embedded within
the day-to-day business. There is an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing signiﬁcant risks
faced by the Group. A reporting structure has been in place
throughout the year and up to the date of approval of 
the ﬁnancial statements and is regularly reviewed by the
directors in accordance with the Code.

Audit Committee report
For the year ended 31 March 2010
7884 Report 2010_Report 2010  02/06/2010  17:40  Page 44 The Group has a Risk Committee, chaired by the CFO and
including staff from all sections of the business, which reviews
the risks throughout the business and identiﬁes and evaluates
risks which may impact on the Group’s strategic and business
objectives. The Risk Committee maintains a risk management
plan that identiﬁes the key risks. The plan is designed to
assess the probability of those risks occurring, the impact
should they occur, how such risks may be mitigated and
monitored and the actions and individuals responsible for
managing the risks. The Committee continues to monitor all
areas of risk and the progress of actions designed to mitigate
such risks; it reports its ﬁndings twice-yearly through the Audit
Committee to the Board. The Committee received the latest
report at its May 2010 meeting and was satisﬁed with 
actions being taken to control and mitigate risks identiﬁed.
The Group has also set up a Compliance Committee to
oversee the establishment of a complete compliance system
to ensure BTG fulﬁls Federal and State requirements for
operating a sales and marketing team in the US by the time 
it commences product sales in October 2010. The results 
will be reported to the Audit Committee as part of the twice-
yearly risk management report.
The Committee reviews the effectiveness of internal controls
and risk management systems. It also reviews the scope 
and results of the external audit and the independence and
objectivity of the auditor. The Company currently has no
dedicated internal audit function and the Committee reviews
on an annual basis as to whether this is still appropriate. 
The Committee considered the process for internal audit
compliance as part of its review. The process for compliance 
is included as part of the responsibilities of each local ﬁnance
function. This process was strengthened during the year
whereby each ofﬁce is to be visited by Head Ofﬁce ﬁnance 
staff to review the work of local internal audit compliance and
to carry out further testing. During the year the Group’s ofﬁces 
in the UK and US were visited by Head Ofﬁce ﬁnance and the
Australian ofﬁce will be visited in the coming year, in addition
to repeat visits to other sites. 
The ﬁrst report on this new process was reported to the 
Board via the Audit Committee in May; reports will be made
twice yearly in future in May and November. The Committee
noted that the internal audit work did not identify any material
weaknesses in internal control but approved proposals 
to enhance control procedures. The Committee considered
that, bearing in mind the degree of local and central control
and review, that a dedicated full time internal auditor was 
not required at this time.
The Committee is responsible for ensuring that arrangements
under which employees may, in conﬁdence, raise concerns
about possible improprieties in matters of ﬁnancial
performance or other matters are operating effectively and
that appropriate follow up action takes place. The current
arrangements are under review and a revised process will 
be launched shortly.
The Audit Committee reviews the overall performance of 
the auditor annually and approves its terms of engagement
and remuneration. The Committee discussed the auditor’s
proposed work plan prior to the commencement of the audit
of the results for the year to 31 March 2010 and also reviews
the non-audit work carried out by the Company’s auditor,
KPMG Audit Plc (‘KPMG’), to ensure that such services do 
not impair its independence or objectivity. KPMG may not 
be appointed to undertake any non-audit work without 
the approval of the Committee where the cost of the work 
is expected to exceed £50,000. 
The auditor is appointed by the shareholders at the AGM
to ensure its independence. The Audit Committee regularly
discusses the independence of the auditor and whether 
there should be a need to rotate audit ﬁrms. Given the relative
size of BTG to that of KPMG and that the lead audit partner 
is changed on a regular basis (at least every ﬁve years), 
the Audit Committee is presently satisﬁed that KPMG is
independent in its reporting on the audit of the Group and
rotation of ﬁrms is not necessary. A new lead audit partner
took over the audit as from the year ended 31 March 2009. 
At least twice a year, the Audit Committee meets with 
the auditor in the absence of the executive directors and
management.
As part of corporate governance, the Committee also carried
out a review of its effectiveness and reported the results 
and its recommendations for improvement to the Board.

The Committee’s full terms of reference, which are available
on the Company’s website or from the Company on request,
are summarised below:
– to make recommendations to, and determine on behalf 
of the Board, remuneration packages for the Chairman 
and each of the executive directors in accordance with
current best practice
– to give advice and make recommendations on the
framework and broad policy for all aspects of the
remuneration of senior management and on the overall
policy for total compensation for all other employees
– to determine policy and advise on equity participation
schemes, employee share trust matters, pensions and
other beneﬁts. 
Consultants to the Committee
The Committee has authority to appoint such advisers as 
it sees ﬁt. During the year the Committee reviewed its advisers
and as a result appointed Hewitt New Bridge Street (‘HNBS’) 
to replace Hay Group to provide advice to the Committee.
Following a detailed review of directors’ remuneration and
long-term incentive arrangements in the early part of the
ﬁnancial year, HNBS carried out a higher level review of
remuneration taking account of market levels of remuneration
in comparator companies. The ﬁrm also advises the
Committee on vesting of share options and other long-term
incentive arrangements.
The Group continues to use HNBS to advise on other matters
including remuneration matters in general. The ﬁrm also
assists with the total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance
measurement and the implementation of employee 
share schemes. 
The Committee has not formally appointed any US advisers
but, where relevant, the Group uses Smart & Associates or
Radford, specialist remuneration consultants, for matters
speciﬁc to the US employment market. In Australia the Group
uses Mercer Ltd.

Remuneration report continued
Remuneration policy
The policy for remuneration, which is established by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee, is to provide a
combination of salary, short- and long-term incentives and benefits, to form a competitive and fair total remuneration package.
Employees of the Group (including executive directors but excluding non-executive directors) are remunerated using this 
policy. Performance related remuneration is in the form of an annual bonus (half of which is awarded in shares, deferred for
three years for directors and certain senior staff), together with share options and performance shares. This forms a significant
proportion of the total remuneration which is subject to demanding performance conditions and the intention is that
approximately 50% of executive directors’ remuneration should be fixed and 50% variable. 
The balance of fixed and variable remuneration is illustrated below for the two executive directors. The table is a theoretical
model showing the on-target value of annual bonus and the fair value of PSP and ESOP awards (assuming PSP awards have 
a fair value of 55% of salary and ESOP awards have a fair value of 25% of salary):

The Committee believes that the bonus opportunity aligned with the deferral into shares and forfeiture provisions, together 
with other elements of the long-term incentive plans, provides a balanced market-competitive package for the executive team.
However the Committee keeps such targets under regular review in order to ensure they remain appropriate. 
The Committee continues to believe that:
– the overall remuneration package must be market competitive
– short- and long-term variable pay should continue to be a substantial part of overall remuneration
– significant rewards should be available for delivering the Group’s short- and long-term objectives and achieving sector-
leading returns for shareholders
– the structure of the remuneration package should continue to provide significant ‘lock-in’ for the executive team
– executives should be required to build significant shareholdings of 100% of base salary in the Company to increase
alignment with shareholders.
Remuneration levels are reviewed annually and the Committee seeks to target reward packages around the mid-market level
for companies of the size, market capitalisation and sectors in which the Group operates. The Committee and its advisers use 
a number of surveys of the employment market covering pharmaceutical and a wider group of similar sized companies from
which to obtain data. 
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure 
that the incentive structure for executive directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance
(‘ESG’) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall
remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.
Components of the remuneration package
Base salary: Base salary is reviewed annually taking into account the areas and level of responsibility together with the
performance of the individual, benchmarked against information from independent sources and consultants on market levels.
As part of their consideration the Committee reviewed information from management on planned salary changes and bonus
levels for the rest of the Group and how each individual’s personal performance would affect their level of salary increase. 
Following the full review of directors’ remuneration that took place in 2009, HNBS were asked to provide information on
remuneration in similar sized companies in both the biopharmaceutical and healthcare sectors and a more general group 
of companies of similar market capitalisation in the FTSE 250 sector. Following consideration of this information and the
performance of the directors and the Group, the Committee recommended salary increases as follows.

Directors and governance
BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The Committee proposed a larger increase for Rolf Soderstrom taking account of the increasing complexity of his role
compared with the position he held when he was Finance Director of Protherics PLC, and current market levels which indicated
that his current remuneration was below that of comparator companies.
Beneﬁts and pension: Benefits mainly comprise the provision of medical benefits and permanent health insurance.
Louise Makin is a member of the Company’s defined benefit pension scheme to which she contributes 7% and the Company
17 .1% of base salary up to the HMRC Earnings Cap. She makes additional pension contributions to a separate Executive Pension
Scheme to which the Company contributed £59,213 during the year (2009: £49,920), being 20% of base salary above the
HMRC Earnings Cap.
Rolf Soderstrom is a member of the Protherics company defined contribution pension scheme to which the Company
contributed 20% of base salary. The Company paid contributions of £51,995 to the pension scheme for his benefit (2009:
£15,467 from 4 December 2008) being 20% of base salary.
Annual bonuses: The annual bonus incentive scheme applies to all members of staff, including executive directors. The
intention of this bonus is to link incentives more closely to Group performance over the short to medium term. Bonuses are
calculated based on personal and business performance. For the year ended 31 March 2010 bonuses may not exceed 100% 
of base salary for executive directors and up to 75% for other staff. Half of the bonus earned by the executive directors is
deferred under the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan (‘DSBP’) into a conditional award over shares, to be held for 
three years. Normally these will be subject to forfeiture on a time-pro rated basis should they leave the Company during the
deferral period unless they leave as a ‘good leaver’ (due to death, redundancy, or any other permitted reason). If a participant 
is a ‘good leaver’ their deferred shares award will vest in full on cessation but may be pro rated for time. In the event of 
a takeover, scheme of arrangement, demerger or winding-up etc., all awards will vest in full unless the Committee determines
to pro rate the awards for time.
Bonus targets were set at the start of the financial year for both Louise Makin and Rolf Soderstrom based on the achievement 
of certain objectives. These included the achievement of targets for an EBITDA measure, cash generation and growth 
in the business. For each category the Committee defined threshold, target and stretch levels. The level of bonus payable 
is dependent on the degree to which each target is exceeded. The EBITDA measure, used for both bonuses and long-term
incentives, is a normalised measure relating to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The table below shows the amount of base salary that would be paid out in bonus depending on the performance against
each measure set by the Committee at the start of the year. The target level of performance for cash and EBITDA was the
achievement of budget. Threshold and stretch being £5m either side of budget for cash and between 80% and 120% of budget
for EBITDA; payout between the various performance levels being calculated on a straight-line basis. The maximum level of
bonus payable is 100% of base salary. The performance level for growth was measured by the Committee based on various
predetermined measures.

The Company achieved Cash of £82.6m being above the target performance level, EBITDA of £21.0m being above the
maximum performance level and Growth assessed as being above the target performance level. EBITDA is calculated as profit
before tax (£9.1m), add back depreciation and amortisation (£12.4m), less net interest (£0.5m).

The Committee has set business performance objectives for the executive directors for 2010/11 which focus on trading profit 
and operating cash targets with the balance concerned with various growth measures. As last year, the target level of
performance is the achievement of budget with threshold and stretch levels either side. The maximum level of bonus payable 
is 100% of base salary.
Other employees and senior managers were also eligible to receive annual bonuses for the year to 31 March 2010, ranging 
from a maximum of 10% to 75% of base salary depending on seniority, and subject to the achievement of both business and
personal performance targets.
Long-term incentive arrangements: Executive directors and senior managers, together with all other employees, are eligible 
to participate in the Company’s share schemes as operated from time to time.
The Company currently operates the Performance Share Plan 2006 (‘PSP’) and the Executive Share Option Plan 2009 (‘ESOP’).
The Committee’s current policy is that executive directors should receive annual awards under both plans as this:
– places significant weight on longer-term performance given the strategy to transition the business from a research 
and development-focused biotech company to an earnings-driven speciality pharma company; and
– ensures that packages for the executive directors include a strong emphasis on the absolute growth in shareholder
value (by the use of share option grants).
Performance share plan
The awards for 2009/10 have performance conditions based on a combination of an EBITDA measure (as described 
on page 49) and total shareholder return (‘TSR’) measured over three financial years. The Company’s TSR is compared with 
that of a peer group comprising FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts, companies in the financial services sector
(banking, insurance, broking, fund management etc.) and companies in the consumer discretionary sector (non-food retail,
media, leisure, gambling) with opening and closing TSR values averaged over three months prior to the start and end of the
performance period. The two measures were combined as shown in the table below.
Relative TSR

Below threshold –––––– 20% 40% 45% 60%
Recipients of awards under the PSP are entitled to receive annual awards of shares with a face value of up to 100% of base salary.
EBITDA targets for the awards made during 2009/10 were based on cumulative EBITDA measures over a three year period with
a range of performance levels between threshold and stretch. EBITDA will be measured on a normalised basis over the three
year period in the range £38m to £76m.

7884 Report 2010_Report 2010  02/06/2010  17:40  Page 50 Executive share option plan
The Company presented a new share option plan for approval at the 2009 AGM under which grants of options may be made
to executive directors and other employees at the invitation of the Committee. Participants may be granted awards of options
the vesting of which will normally be dependent upon performance conditions measured over a period of not less than three
years. Awards will typically be limited to 100% of base salary, although, in exceptional circumstances, there will be an individual
limit on each award of 150% of base salary. Performance conditions for awards made in 2009/10 were the same as for the 
PSP awards described above.
The Committee has agreed to make awards for 2010/11 of 100% of base salary to Louise Makin and Rolf Soderstrom under
the ESOP. These will be subject to the same performance conditions as for the 2010/11 PSP awards.
Special award to Rolf Soderstrom made on 22 July 2009
As a result of the merger between BTG and Protherics in 2008, existing awards of long-term incentives under the Protherics
long-term incentive arrangements vested on the change of control. In order to ensure that appropriate incentive arrangements
are in place to retain Rolf Soderstrom, the Committee approved a one-off award of 76,448 performance shares that vest two
years after grant, subject to his being employed within the Group at that time and to the extent that challenging performance
conditions have been met. To the extent that the award vests, the relevant shares will be delivered for nil consideration. The
award may also be satisfied in cash. The award was granted pursuant to the exemption from the need for prior shareholder
approval contained in Listing Rule 9.4.2 R(2). The award is non-pensionable and non-transferable (other than on death).
The award was granted on substantially the same terms as awards made under the PSP, the principal terms of which are
described below.
The performance conditions attached to these awards are substantially the same as those that apply to the 2009/10 PSP
awards save that performance is measured over two financial years from the start of the financial year in which the award was
made and the cumulative EBITDA (defined as set out on page 49) targets were set to take account of the shorter performance
period. If Rolf Soderstrom ceases employment with the Group before the second anniversary of grant, the outstanding part 
of the award will lapse, unless he leaves in certain ‘good leaver’ situations (due to death, redundancy or any other permitted
reason). In this event, it will vest on cessation (or, if the Committee so decides, the second anniversary of grant) to the extent 
the performance condition is met at the relevant time. This would be subject to time pro rating to reflect the period of time
between the date of grant and the date of cessation (rounded up to the next half-year), relative to the period of two years,
unless the Committee concludes in its discretion that it is not appropriate to apply the pro rata reduction. If the executive ceases
employment by reason of death the award will vest in full. In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement, or winding-up 
of the Company, the award will vest early to the extent that the performance conditions are met at that time and, unless the
Committee decides otherwise, subject to time pro rating to reflect the period between the grant date and the relevant event 
on the basis set out above. The award may also vest on this basis in the event of a demerger, special dividend or other similar
event which, in the Committee’s opinion, materially affects the price of the Company’s shares.
The award will not, unless the Committee decides otherwise, vest on an internal reorganisation but will instead be exchanged
for an equivalent award over shares in the new holding company. The award will not confer any shareholder rights on Rolf
Soderstrom until it vests, except that he will be entitled to a payment (in cash and/or shares, at the discretion of the Committee)
shortly after vesting to reflect the dividends that would have been paid on those shares, assuming such dividends were re-
invested in further shares at the closing price on the relevant ex-dividend dates. In the event of any variation of the Company’s
share capital, demerger, payment of a special dividend or any other event which materially affects the price of the Company’s
shares, the number of shares under the award may be adjusted as the Committee sees fit. The terms of the award may be
amended in such manner as the executive and the Committee may agree, provided that amendments to his benefit in relation
to the basis for determining the executive’s entitlement to, and the terms of, the shares (or cash) to be acquired and the
adjustment of the award may only be made with the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting. Shareholder approval
will not be required for alterations to the performance conditions or any minor alteration made to benefit the administration 
of the arrangement, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control 
or regulatory treatment for the executive or any Group company. The Committee confirms that the matching award was felt 
to be necessary to facilitate the retention of Rolf Soderstrom following the merger of BTG and Protherics.
The EBITDA performance targets were based on cumulative EBITDA measured over a two year period with a range of
performance levels between threshold and stretch. EBITDA will be measured on a normalised basis over the two year period 
in the range £24m to £41m.

The Company operates an HMRC-approved save-as-you-earn scheme, open to all eligible employees (including executive
directors) who open an approved savings contract, to enable them to purchase shares in the Company. The options are
exercisable after three years at a price not less than 80% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant. The Scheme
provides an international section to allow for the participation of Australian employees. 
The Company also provides a US Internal Revenue Service 423 Plan for its US employees and a restricted share scheme 
in order to award nil paid shares to employees below Board level.
External appointments
The Board believes that it may be beneficial to the Company for executives to hold non-executive directorships outside the
Group. Any such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the director may retain any fees payable. Louise
Makin received fees, from her position at Premier Foods plc, of £61,375 during the year to 31 March 2010 (2009: £57,000). 
Rolf Soderstrom does not currently hold any outside directorships. 
Service contracts
The Company’s policy on directors’ service contracts is that, in line with the best practice provisions of the Code, they should be
terminable by the Company on a maximum of one year’s notice and contracts do not provide for predetermined compensation
in the event of termination or provision for enhanced payments in the event of a takeover of the Company. The Company may
terminate the contracts of the executive directors with immediate effect by making a payment in lieu of notice. Any payments
made would be determined by reference to normal contractual principles with mitigation being applied as wherever relevant 
or appropriate. The directors’ contracts do not provide for automatic entitlement to bonus or share-based payments.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years,
which may be renewed by mutual agreement, normally for a further three-year term. The terms of appointment do not contain
any contractual provisions regarding a notice period or the right to receive compensation in the event of early termination 
with the exception of the Chairman whose appointment is on six months’ notice other than if he is not re-elected at an AGM.
Details of contracts and letters of appointment, for directors serving at the date of this report, are as set out below.

7884 Report 2010_Report 2010  02/06/2010  17:40  Page 52 Non-executive directors’ fees
The Chairman, in consultation with the executive directors, is responsible for proposing changes to the non-executive directors’
fees. In proposing such fees, account is taken of similar fees paid to non-executive directors in listed companies within the
Group’s listing sector and of similar size and the time commitments of BTG’s non-executives. The decision on fee changes
is taken by the Board as a whole. Individual non-executive directors do not take part in discussions on their remuneration. 
Non-executive directors do not receive benefits or pension contributions from the Group and do not participate in any Group
incentive scheme. 
In March 2010 the Committee reviewed the fees payable to the Chairman, following advice from HNBS. HNBS also advised 
the Chairman and executive directors on changes to fees for the non-executive directors. Set out in the table below are the fees
paid for the year ended 31 March 2010 together with changes as the results of the reviews.

Notes:
1   The accrued pension at 31 March 2010 is the leaving service benefit to which Louise Makin would have been entitled to if she had left 
the BTG Pension Fund at that date.
2  This equals the accrued pension as at 31st March 2010 less the equivalent pension as at 31st March 2009 disclosed in the 2009 
Annual Report.
3  This is the transfer value as at 31 March 2010 less the transfer value as at 31 March 2009 less the contributions paid by the director
in the year.
4  Note that inflation was negative over the year.
The BTG Pension Fund is a contracted-out defined benefit arrangement which provides a pension based on an accrual rate 
of either one sixtieth or one eightieth of basic salary (up to the earnings cap), depending on the level of contributions paid by
members of 7% or 5% respectively. Members are able to retire at any time from age 60 onwards and under current legislation, 
if members continue to work beyond age 60, they may continue to pay contributions and enhance their pension entitlement,
subject to a maximum of 40 years pensionable service. In the event of a death of a member the Fund provides for a spouse’s
pension to be payable equal to two-thirds of the deceased member’s pension and for current active members a lump sum
death benefit equal to four times basic salary (up to the earnings cap) plus refund of the member’s contributions is also payable. 
During the year Louise Makin, aged 49, contributed £8,652 to the fund. Details of her individual pension entitlements are
shown in the above table.

PSP awards made prior to March 2009 are subject to cumulative pre-tax profit and relative TSR performance conditions with
each determining the vesting of 50% of an award.
*Following the acquisition of Protherics on 4 December 2008, the Committee recognised that the performance conditions for the PSP awards
made in 2007 and 2008 were no longer relevant having been set prior to the acquisition of the Protherics Group. As it would no longer be
possible to measure the profit performance condition, in accordance with the rules of the Plan, the Committee elected to amend the conditions
for the 2007 and 2008 awards. The Committee reviewed the performance against profit targets for the period to March 2009 for each of
the awards and HNBS were asked to advise on the level of TSR performance. The level of under/over performance for the period was noted. 
For the balance of the three year period the Committee elected to use the TSR and EBITDA measures used for the 2009/10 PSP awards. 
At the end of the three year period the results for the final year will be adjusted for the under/over performance in the period to 31 March 2009.
Following advice from HNBS on the TSR performance for the year to 31 March 2010, (which, combined with the performance 
for the first two years of the performance period, exceeded the maximum target), the Committee approved the release 
of 284,734 shares to Louise Makin under the 2007 PSP award, the balance of 1,241 shares to lapse. The shares being due 
to vest on 15 June 2010.

until 15 June 2010. At this point the cash will be released and she has agreed to invest the full amount in shares in the Company.

Share options and performance shares were granted for nil consideration. The awards are subject to the performance
conditions as set out on page 50. Sharesave options were granted on the condition that participants agree to enter into 
a monthly savings contract. 
The price used for calculating the number of shares awarded under the PSP and DSP was based on the average of the closing
share prices over the five days immediately prior to the award date. Share options are awarded using the closing mid market
price on the date of grant.

7884 Report 2010_Report 2010  02/06/2010  17:40  Page 56 Awards are normally satisfied using new issue shares. BTG’s share plans comply with recommended guidelines on dilution
limits and the Company has always operated within these limits. Assuming none of the extant options lapse and will be
exercised and, having included all exercised options, the Company has utilised 3.3% of the 10% in ten years and 3.1% of the 
5% in ten years in accordance with the Association of British Insurers (‘ ABI’) guidance on dilution limits.
The Committee, with advice from HNBS, is responsible for assessing whether the relevant performance conditions have 
been achieved. 
Other than for minor administrative reasons, the Committee will not make amendments to the arrangements established for
either of these awards that are to directors’ advantage without seeking the consent of shareholders other than to take account 
of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for the executive 
or any Group company. Performance conditions will be amended in the circumstances of a major corporate action. No payment
under long-term incentive schemes is pensionable.
Directors’ shareholdings
The directors’ beneficial interests, including interests of connected persons, in the shares of the Company at the end of the
financial year and at 20 May 2010 are shown below. None of the directors had any non-beneficial interest at any time in the
period 1 April 2009 to 20 May 2010. None of the directors who held office at the end of the financial period had any beneficial
interest in the shares of other Group companies.

The executive directors have a beneficial interest in ordinary shares of the Company by direct holdings and by virtue of their
entitlements in the Company’s employee share option schemes. As employees of the Group, all executive directors also have
an interest in any unallocated shares held on behalf of all employees in the BTG Employee Share Trust, which at 31 March 2010
amounted to 534,049 ordinary shares in the Company. The non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in any of the
Company’s employee share schemes.
Alignment with shareholders
Based on the shares and share options and awards held at 31 March 2010 (assuming full vesting and having taken account 
of any relevant exercise costs), the following table illustrates the value each executive director has at risk and how this has
fluctuated during the year, using the lowest, highest and closing share prices for the year of 122.5p, 203.0p and 178.3p
respectively, for illustrative purposes.

The performance of the Company’s ordinary shares compared with the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment Trusts) (the ‘Index’) 
for the five-year period ended on 31 March 2010 is shown in the graph below.
This graph shows the value at 31 March 2010 of £100 invested in BTG plc on 31 March 2005 compared with £100 invested 
in the Index. The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.
The Company has chosen the Index as a comparator as it believes that it gives shareholders a reasonable comparison 
with the total shareholder return (‘TSR’) of other equity investments in companies of a broadly similar size across all sectors. 
The TSR performance has been measured by HNBS. 
The middle market price of an ordinary share on 31 March 2010 was 178.3p. During the year the share price ranged from a low
of 122.5p to a high of 203.0p.
Directors’ interests in contracts
Except as described in note 36 to the financial statements, ‘Related party transactions’, during or at the end of the financial year
no director or connected person had any material interest in any contract of significance in relation to the Group’s business with
a third party.

Directors and governance
BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the Group and Parent Company ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and
Parent Company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial 
year. Under that law they are required to prepare the Group
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the
ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and
Parent Company and of their proﬁt or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company 
ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
– make judgments and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
– state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
– prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group
and the Parent Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Parent
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Parent Company and
enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are 
also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement
that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The ﬁnancial statements include a fair review of the
information required by: 
– DTR 4.1.12RR of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules,
being a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the issuer and the
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a
whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties faced by the Group.
– DTR 4.2.8R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being
related party transactions that have taken place during the
current ﬁnancial year and that have materially affected the
ﬁnancial position or performance of the entity during that
period; and any changes in the related party transactions
described in the last Annual Report that could do so.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
7884 Report 2010_Report 2010  02/06/2010  17:40  Page 59 We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of BTG plc for the
year ended 31 March 2010 set out on pages 62 to 112. The
ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’s) as adopted by the EU and, as
regards the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements, as applied
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken
so that we might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members, as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities
Statement set out on page 59, the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (‘ APB’s) Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of ﬁnancial 
statements is provided on the APB’s website at
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/UKP. 
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
– the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs
as at 31 March 2010 and of the Group’s proﬁt for the year
then ended;
– the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
– the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions
of the Companies Act 2006; and 
– the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies
Act 2006
In our opinion:
– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and
– the information given in the Directors’ Report for the
ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are
prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
– the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
– certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed 
by law are not made; or
– we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
– the directors’ statement, set out on page 37, in relation 
to going concern; and
– the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page
43 relating to the company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code speciﬁed 
for our review.

1 General information
BTG plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and listed on the London Stock
Exchange. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2010 comprise the results 
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interest in associates.
The financial statements were approved for issue by the Board on 20 May 2010.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies as approved by the Board
and described below.
Accounting standards adopted in the year
The following accounting standards have been adopted in the year:
IFRS8 – Operating segments
During the year, the Group has adopted IFRS8 which requires an entity to report financial and descriptive information about 
its reportable segments. Reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet
specified criteria. In addressing these criteria, it was determined that the Group has two reportable segments, being marketed
products and royalties. 
All significant decisions are made by the Senior Leadership Team (which is BTG’s chief operating decision-making body 
as defined by IFRS8), with implementation of that decision on a group-wide basis then being the responsibility of each member
of the team or of cross-functional global teams where appropriate. The sales, manufacturing, business development, research
and development and support functions are managed and operate on a global basis and are not dedicated to individual
product, marketing or therapy areas.
In assessing performance and making resource allocation decisions, the Senior Leadership Team reviews Gross Profit by segment,
reflecting the two distinct routes available to it in realising commercial value from its assets. All other financial information, including
assets, is presented on a consolidated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and on the same basis as, 
the Group’s IFRS financial statements. Gross Profit is generated from marketed products, such as CroFab™ and DigiFab™, 
or from royalty arrangements such as Factor IX, Campath
®
and Two-Part Hip Cup. Royalty revenues are receivable on a broad
portfolio of underlying intellectual property rights, covering areas including pharmaceutical products, medical devices and
electronic components.
Research and development is an essential upstream activity of the Group, without which there could be no royalty or marketed
product revenues. Research and development activities are managed on a consolidated, group-wide basis and are not
managed by reference to the Group’s operating segments. 
IAS1 – Presentation of Financial Statements (revised 2007)
The adoption of IAS1 (revised 2007) has introduced a number of terminology changes (including titles for the financial statements)
and has resulted in a number of changes in presentation and disclosure. The revised standard has had no impact on the
reported results or financial position of the Group. 
IFRS7 revised – Financial Instruments: Disclosures
The adoption of IFRS7 revised has resulted in additional disclosure being given regarding the level of the fair value hierarchy
within which the fair values of the Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts are categorised and the maturity analysis required
in relation to the timing of cash flows. 
Other accounting standards adopted in the year
The following amendments and standards have also been adopted, but have had no significant effect on the reported results
or financial position of the Group:
– IFRS2 – Amendment regarding Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
– IAS23 – Borrowing Costs (revised 2007)
– Amendments to IAS32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation
– IAS27 Consolidated and separate Financial Statements
– IFRIC14 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction

Accounting standards issued but not yet effective
The Group does not consider that any of the other standards or interpretations issued but as yet not effective will have 
a significant impact on the financial statements.
Going concern basis
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
This conclusion has been reached having considered the effect of liquidity risk on the Group’s ability to operate effectively.
Currently, liquidity risk is not considered a significant business risk to the Group given its level of net cash and cash flow
projections. The Group does not currently require significant levels of debt financing to operate its business. Further details 
of the Group’s policies and objectives around liquidity risk are given in note 33. The key liquidity risks faced by the Group 
are considered to be the failure of banks where funds are deposited and the failure of key licensees or insurers.
In addition to the liquidity risks considered above, the directors have also considered the following factors when reaching 
the conclusion to continue to adopt the going concern basis:
– The Group’s principal licensees are global industry leaders in their respective fields and the Group’s royalty-generating
intellectual property consists of a broad portfolio of both licensees and industries; and
– The Group’s marketed products are life-saving in nature, providing some protection against an uncertain economic outlook.
Acquisition adjustments and reorganisation costs
The Consolidated Income Statement includes a separate column to disclose significant acquisition adjustments and
reorganisation costs arising on the acquisition of Protherics PLC in December 2008. The costs relate to the following:
– The release of the fair value uplift of inventory acquired;
– Amortisation arising on intangible assets acquired; and
– Reorganisation costs comprising redundancy, property costs and asset impairments.
2 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies
have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.
(a) Basis of accounting and preparation of ﬁnancial statements
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘ Adopted IFRSs’). The Consolidated Financial Statements also comply fully with 
IFRS’s as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. 
The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest £0.1m except where
otherwise indicated and have been prepared on the historical cost basis modified to include revaluation to fair value of certain
financial instruments and business combination assets as set out below.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 3.

(b) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiary undertakings
Subsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly,
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control,
potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiary
undertakings are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that
control ceases.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating
policies. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s proportionate share of the total recognised gains and losses
of associates on an equity-accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant
influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds the carrying value of its interest in an associate, the Group’s
carrying amount is reduced to nil and no further losses are recognised except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal 
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
Acquisition accounting
The purchase method is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured
as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus
costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are
measured initially at their fair values on the date of acquisition, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess 
of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets, including intangible assets acquired,
is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of net assets of the subsidiary
acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used into 
line with those used by the Group.
Merger reserve
A merger reserve is used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes 
the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under s612 and s613 of the Companies Act 2006.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements 
of foreign operations that are not integral to the operations of the Company.
Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments. If an investment
suffers impairment due to a prolonged or significant decline in the fair value below acquisition cost, its share of the reserve 
is recycled to the income statement and any further declines in fair value of that investment are no longer charged to the
reserve but immediately taken to the income statement.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised
gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
(c) Operating segments
An operating segment is defined as a component of the Group (i) that engages in business activities from which it may earn
revenues and incur expenses; (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision maker
(the Senior Leadership Team) to make resource allocation decisions and monitor its performance; and (iii) for which discrete
financial information is available.

(d) Foreign currency
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate
ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate
at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair
value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. Exchange gains/losses 
on retranslation of foreign currency transactions and balances within trading intercompany balances are recognised in the
income statement within ‘Operating expenses’.
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, 
are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign
operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in the translation reserve.
(iii) Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to the translation reserve.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal of the investment.
(e) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value and are designated as being measured at fair value through 
the Income Statement on inception. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Income
Statement through ‘Financial income’ or ‘Financial expense’ as appropriate. 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value 
of the quoted forward price.
(f) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on the
acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and associates. In respect of business combinations that have occurred since 1 April
2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable assets,
including intangible assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and 
is tested annually for impairment (see note 2(m)). In respect of associates, the carrying value of goodwill is included in the
carrying value of the investment in the associate.
(g) Intangible assets 
(i) Initial recognition
Intangible assets acquired as a result of a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value in accordance 
with IFRS3 – ‘Business combinations’.
Other intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. Cost includes the cost of obtaining patent protection for intellectual
property rights, the cost of acquisition of patents and the costs of the internal patent attorney specific to obtaining the initial
grant of a patent. Income from patents is derived through licensing and other agreements.

7884 Accounts 2010_Accounts 2010  02/06/2010  16:35  Page 69 2 Accounting policies continued
(ii) Amortisation
Intangible assets are amortised in a manner calculated to write off the cost, on a straight-line basis, over the effective life of the
asset. In determining the appropriate life of the asset consideration is given to the expected cash-generating life of the asset 
or remaining patent life if different.
The effective life of each class of asset is determined as follows:
– Developed technology: expected cash generating life, taking into account specific product and market characteristics 
for each developed technology
– Contractual relationships: period to expiry of the contract
– In-process research and development: amortisation is not charged until the asset is generating an economic return, 
at which point the effective life is assessed by reference to the remaining patent life
– Computer software: the shorter of the licence period and three years
– Patents: period to patent expiry.
In the event that an intangible asset is no longer used or a patent is abandoned, the balance of unamortised expenditure 
is written off immediately. 
The following annual rates of amortisation are in use:
Developed technology 4% to 43%
Contractual relationships 7% to 50%
In-process research and development 4% to 8%
Computer software 33%
Patents 5%
(iii) Income statement disclosure
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets is included within operating expenses in the Income Statement.
(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Expenditure subsequent to the initial acquisition of intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic
benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
(v) Impairment
If an intangible asset is considered to have suffered impairment in value it is written down to its estimated recoverable amount
in accordance with the Group’s policy on impairment (see note 2(m)). 
(h) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (see note 2(m)). 
(ii) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to write assets down to their residual value at the
following annual rates:
Buildings and improvements 5 to 10%
Leasehold improvements 10 to 50%
Plant and machinery 10 to 15% 
Furniture and equipment 10 to 50%
Motor vehicles 20%
Computer hardware 20 to 33% 
Depreciation is not charged until the asset is brought into use. The residual value is reassessed annually.

(iii) Income statement disclosure
Depreciation and impairment of tangible fixed assets is included within Operating expenses in the income statement.
Profits and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are included 
in profit/loss on sale of tangible assets in the income statement. 
(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Expenditure subsequent to the initial acquisition of a tangible fixed asset is capitalised only when it is probable that the 
Group will realise future economic benefits from the asset.
(v) Impairment
If a tangible asset is considered to have suffered impairment in value it is written down to its estimated recoverable amount 
in accordance with the Group’s policy on impairment (see note 2(m)).
(i) Investments
Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group, classified as being available-for-sale, are stated at fair value, 
with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary
items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses which are taken to the income statement. When these
investments are no longer recognised as assets, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is
recognised in the income statement. Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective
interest method is recognised in the income statement.
(j) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The first in, first out method of valuation is used. Cost
comprises materials, direct labour and a share of production overheads appropriate to the relevant stage of production.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate. Net realisable value is determined at the
balance sheet date on commercially saleable products based on estimated selling price less all further costs to completion 
and all relevant marketing, selling and distribution costs. 
Inventories relating to research and development projects are fully written down in the income statement unless the Group
considers it probable to realise economic value from their sale or use. If the circumstances that previously caused these
inventories to be written down below cost subsequently change and there is clear evidence of an increase in realisable 
value, the write down is reversed.
(k) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables do not carry interest and are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses (see note 2(m)).
(l) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand 
and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management and for which the Group has a legal right of set-off are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
(m) Impairment
Impairment testing is performed for all assets when there is an indicator of impairment.
In addition, for goodwill and unamortised intangible assets, impairment testing is performed annually at each balance sheet
date. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount. 
Other specific categories of asset are treated as follows:
(i) Equity investments
Impairment is deemed to arise when there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the equity instrument.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.

BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
7884 Accounts 2010_Accounts 2010  02/06/2010  16:35  Page 71 2 Accounting policies continued
(ii) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date and whenever there are events
that indicate that an impairment may have occurred. An impairment loss is recognised if an asset’s carrying amount exceeds
the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses are recognised within operating expenses 
in the income statement.
(iii) Amortised intangible assets
Amortised intangible assets are also tested for impairment whenever there are indications that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable. Intangible assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. 
Any impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement. When assessing the recoverable amount 
of an intangible asset the Group uses a risk adjusted discounted cash flow model.
(iv) Available-for-sale assets
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective
evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income
statement. The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in the income statement is the difference between the acquisition
cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through
the income statement. If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be
objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the impairment
loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in the income statement.
(n) Government grants
Government grants towards staff re-training costs are recognised as income over the periods in which the related costs are
incurred and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income
statement over the useful lives of the assets concerned.
(o) Employee beneﬁts
(i) Deﬁned contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
as incurred. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with in the same manner as payments 
to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to a defined contribution retirement
benefit plan. The funds of the schemes are independent of the Group’s finances.
(ii) Deﬁned beneﬁt plan
For the Group’s defined benefit pension plan, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method,
with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Allowance is made in the assessment of the defined
benefit obligation for future costs of administering the plan. The assumptions used to determine the valuation are shown 
in note 29. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses
are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested, and otherwise is amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation,
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. The retirement benefit obligation includes an allowance for future administrative
costs of running the scheme. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of
available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Assets of the pension plan are held separately from the Group’s assets.

(iii) Share-based payments
In accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS1 (‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’), 
IFRS2 (Share-based Payments) has been applied to all share-based grants made to employees after 7 November 2002 
that had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company, subject to certain criteria. The fair
value of options granted is recognised as an expense of employment in the income statement with a corresponding increase
in equity. The fair value is measured at the date of grant and spread over the period during which the employees become
unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial lattice model, taking
into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense in any
year is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest. However if share options fail to vest due to share prices
not achieving the designated performance threshold for vesting, no such adjustment takes place.
(p) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result
of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect 
is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract 
are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
A charge for reorganisation costs is taken to the income statement when the Group has approved a detailed and formal
reorganisation plan, and the reorganisation has either commenced or the Group has a constructive obligation, for example 
having made an announcement publicly to the employee or the Group as a whole. 
(q) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
(r) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts received or receivable in respect of the sale of marketed products to customers during the year,
net of trade discounts given and value added tax, and in respect of royalty arrangements.
A description of the various elements of revenue and the associated accounting policies is given below:
(i) Marketed products 
The Group recognises revenue for marketed product sales when each condition of IAS18, paragraph 14, is wholly-satisfied.
Where sales arrangements specify a second element of revenue contingent upon a specified event, this revenue is not
recognised until this event has occurred and it is certain that the economic benefit triggered by this event will flow to the Group.
In cases where product is sold to a customer with a right of replacement, the Group views the transaction as a multi-element
arrangement and a portion of the value from the sale is deferred and allocated to the replacement right based on the 
fair value of the replacement right. Revenue is recognised net of any trade discounts that may be given from time-to-time.
(ii) Royalties
Revenues from the Group’s licensed programmes are generated following the grant of a licence to a third party to undertake
additional development and commercialisation of a research and development programme or other intellectual property
rights. In addition to an upfront payment, BTG may be entitled to additional revenues such as milestone payments or royalties
on revenues generated by the licensee. Revenues associated with royalty arrangements may in turn be linked to additional
obligations on BTG. These revenues are accounted for in line with IAS18 as follows:

BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
7884 Accounts 2010_Accounts 2010  02/06/2010  16:35  Page 73 2 Accounting policies continued
(iii) Upfront and milestone payments
Non-refundable upfront and milestone payments are recognised as the earnings process is completed. This may result in full
recognition in the year in which the income is received. However, where the Group has ongoing performance obligations, such
as the delivery of products or services, upfront payments are deferred over the period in which these obligations are satisfied.
Associated costs of performance obligations are expensed in the period to which they relate. In determining the performance
obligations under the contract, consideration is given as to whether elements of the obligations meet the criteria for separate
accounting. The Group applies the substantive milestone method in accounting for subsequent milestone payments. Milestone
payments that are considered substantive are recognised into income in the year in which they are received. Milestones 
that do not satisfy the criteria to be considered as substantive are amortised over the remaining period in which the Group 
expects to fulfil its performance obligations under the agreement. The Group considers the following when assessing whether 
a milestone is considered substantive:
– Are the milestone payments non-refundable?
– Does the achievement of the milestone involve a degree of risk that was not reasonably assured at the inception 
of the arrangement?
– Is substantive effort involved in achieving the milestone?
– Is the amount of the milestone payment reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with 
the achievement of the milestone? 
– How does the time that passes between the payments compare to the effort required to reach the milestone?
(iv) Outlicensed product royalties 
Royalty income is generated by sales of products incorporating the Group’s proprietary technology. Royalty revenues are
recognised once the amounts due can be reliably estimated based on the sale of underlying products and recoverability 
is assured. Where there is insufficient historical data on sales and returns to fulfil these requirements, for example in the 
case of a new product, the royalty revenue will not be recognised until the Group can reliably estimate the underlying sales. 
(v) Sales/assignments of IPR
Outright sales or assignments of IPR are treated as disposals of non-current assets.
(s) Research and development
Research and development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. Expenditure
incurred on development projects (relating to the design and testing of new or improved products) is recognised as intangible
assets when it is probable that the project will generate future economic benefit, considering factors including its commercial
and technological feasibility, status of regulatory approval, and the ability to measure costs reliably. Other development
expenditures are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development expenditure previously recognised as an expense 
is not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Development expenditure that has a finite useful life and which has 
been capitalised is amortised from the commencement of the commercial production of the product on a straight-line basis
over the period of its expected benefit. 
No development expenditure has been capitalised in either the current or prior year.
Property, plant and equipment used for research and development is depreciated in accordance with the Group’s policy 
and the cost is included within ‘Research and development’ in the income statement.
(t) Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the direct costs incurred in manufacturing and bringing products to sale in the market and revenue
sharing costs.
Revenue sharing costs represent amounts due under royalty arrangements to licensors or assignees of technology upon
recognition by the Group of amounts due from a licensee. They are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with 
the individual agreements relating to the relevant technology, in line with revenue recognition.

(u) Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor 
is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges 
and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income. Such assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful
lives or the length of the lease. Assets purchased under hire purchase agreements are accounted for similarly, except that
these assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant 
lease within the appropriate functional expenditure heading.
(v) Financial income
Net financial income comprises interest income less interest payable during the year, calculated using the effective interest 
rate method, and fair value adjustments relating to foreign exchange forward contracts.
(w) Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying
value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following
temporary differences are not provided for: where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries and associates, where it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying value 
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.
(x) BTG Employee Share Trust
Included within the Group’s financial results are those of the BTG Employee Share Trust, the costs of which are expensed 
within the financial statements of the Trust as incurred.
In the Company accounts the cost of BTG shares held by the Trust is deducted from shareholders’ funds.
(y) Financial guarantees
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within 
its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the
Company treats the guarantee contracts as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company 
will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, described in note 2, management and the Audit Committee
discussed and agreed the selection, application and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting policies and the estimates
used in the preparation of the accounts.
Revenue recognition
As described in note 2, it is the Group’s policy to recognise non-refundable upfront payments over the period in which any
performance obligations are satisfied. In December 2008, the Group acquired Protherics PLC which had received £16,300,000 
from AstraZeneca UK Ltd in a Patent and Know How Licence Agreement for CytoFab™. The Group considers that its obligations
under the licence agreement consist of the licence, provision of development services, regulatory support and steering committee
participation. The Group considers that the development services and the regulatory support it can supply will cease with
the approval of CytoFab™ by the FDA and while the steering committee continues to operate after product approval by the 
FDA, the Group has received confirmation that its participation after this date would become voluntary. Based on the clinical
development plan to be undertaken by AstraZeneca, the Group currently estimates that its performance under the agreement
will be completed over the period to 31 December 2014 and, therefore, is recognising the £16,300,000 on a straight-line basis,
over the estimated performance period. 
In determining the revenue recognition period, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue 
per IAS18, Revenue, and is satisfied that all requirements have been met by the Group.
Acquisitions
Judgements have been made in respect of the identification of intangible assets made on acquisitions based on pre-acquisition
forecasts, analysis and negotiations. In addition to the judgements and estimates made in establishing the intangible assets
acquired and their value, in certain instances these assets are in development and are only amortised once the development
phase has been completed, although these assets are subjected to impairment review in accordance with the accounting policy
described in note 2(m).
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year,
are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-
generating units to which goodwill or other intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires
estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order 
to calculate present value. There is a risk of a material adverse impact on the income statement should an impairment
adjustment be required to be reflected in the financial statements. See note 2(m) for further details.
Fair value of listed and unlisted investments 
Note 20 explains the basis for estimating the fair value of listed and unlisted investments. 
Pension assumptions
Note 29 details the key actuarial assumptions used to establish the pension funding position. These are the best estimates
chosen based on historic experience and future expectations. Should the discount rate used to establish scheme liabilities 
or the long-term expected rate of return on investment vary significantly then the pension fund valuation would be impacted.

The Group has two operating segments (see note 1). Under IAS14, the Group previously reported its results within two operating
segments, being ‘Life Sciences’ and ‘Technology Commercialisation’. Following the acquisition of Protherics PLC in December
2008 and the subsequent reorganisation of the management of the Group during the current financial year, these segments
were no longer deemed representative of the way in which the Group manages its operations. There are no inter-segment
transactions that are required to be eliminated on consolidation.

The Group considers reorganisation costs to be those resulting from decisions to rationalise both operating sites and business
operations.
Following the acquisition of Protherics on 4 December 2008, the Group undertook a restructuring to integrate and align the two
businesses. The principal costs incurred relate to redundancy, property costs associated with onerous leases and impairment
of assets made redundant as part of the restructuring. The majority of costs have been paid, however commitments on
onerous leases extend for a further three years (note 32). 
The credit to the income statement in the year ended 31 March 2010 represents the release of £1.5m of lease costs previously
provided for following the completion of successful negotiations with the landlords of two of the Group’s leased properties. 
This has allowed the Group to exit from the lease commitments below the amount originally provided. This is offset by other

The movements in the deferred tax asset and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as
permitted by IAS12, Income Taxes) during the year are as shown below. The deferred tax asset and liabilities are only offset
where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balance net.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 30% (2009: 30%). 
The movement on the deferred tax account is as shown below:

The deferred tax asset, which relates to trading losses incurred in Australia, has been recognised in the financial statements
following the development of the Group’s products in prior years and the directors are of the opinion, based on recent and
forecast trading, that the level of profits in Australia in the forthcoming years will lead to the realisation of this asset.
In addition to the losses on which the deferred tax asset has been recognised, the Group has additional taxable losses and
other timing differences in the United Kingdom and the United States which arose as a result of the research and development
incurred during the start-up of the Group’s activities. These losses, which total £193.8m, are available for offset against future
taxable profits in these territories. Tax losses of £181.1m in the United Kingdom can be carried forward indefinitely. Tax losses 
of £12.5m in the United States can be carried forward for 20 years. The first year in which losses will expire if remaining
unutilised is 2023. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses and other temporary differences of
£35.6m since there is uncertainty as to how quickly such losses and temporary differences would be utilised and consequently
the recoverability of the deferred tax asset is uncertain. The total amount of deferred tax asset not recognised, measured at
28% is approximately:

The deferred tax liability of £33.4m (2009: £35.2m) arises as a result of the acquisition of Protherics PLC (note 38). Amounts
released during the period of £2.8m (2009: £1.0m) represent the decrease of the deferred tax liability in line with amortisation
charged against the carrying values of the associated assets. The decrease in tax losses available for offset of £1.4m (2009: nil)
represents the decrease of Group tax losses during the period that are therefore no longer available to offset the deferred tax
liability. No deferred tax has been recognised directly in equity.

Adjustments to profit are shown after taking into account the tax effect of such adjustments on the results as shown in the
Consolidated Income Statement as follows:
– No tax adjustment is required on the fair value of acquired inventory
– The release of deferred tax liability of £1.4m (2009: £1.0m) as shown in note 13 has been deducted from the amortisation 
and impairment of acquired intangible assets of £9.1m as shown in note 17
A reorganisation cost credit of £0.7m in the Consolidated Income Statement has been increased by £0.9m tax effect, being the
amount by which the Group’s deferred tax charge would have been affected had there been no tax deduction available for
reorganisation costs. The Group’s tax charge would have been the same in the prior year if there had been no reorganisation costs.

Additions of £0.3m in the year ended 31 March 2010 arose on the issue of shares to former Protherics PLC share option holders
in the period to 4 June 2009 (note 30). At 31 March 2009 there was no expectation that these share options would be exercised
since the share price of the Group was such that all outstanding former Protherics PLC share options were in a loss-making
position at that time.
Impairment review – goodwill and intangible assets
An impairment review of the carrying value of goodwill and unamortised intangible assets was conducted as at 31 March 2010. 
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Protherics PLC in December 2008 (see note 38). This has been allocated across the 
Group’s cash-generating units, being its operating segments, in proportion with the anticipated benefits of that goodwill on the
operating segment, having regard for the assets and liabilities acquired. The carrying value of goodwill in relation to marketed
products is £15.6m and in relation to royalties is £14.7m.
The impairment review required the estimation of the recoverable amount based on the value in use of the underlying cash-
generating unit. Near-term projections are based on the Group’s approved three-year plan. Longer-term projections through 
to the end of an asset’s estimated useful economic life are included due to the long-term nature of pharmaceutical product
development and product life cycles. 
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include market share and gross margin for the marketed
products, individual probability-adjusted cash flow models for all in-process research and development and an assessment 
of the net present value of future net royalty income for licensed patents. 
Cash flow projections for all assets were included for a period equal to the estimated useful economic life of the assets. No
terminal values were applied. All cash flows were discounted back to present value using a pre-tax discount rate of between
7% (2009: 7%) for net royalty income and 24% (2009: 24%) for in-process research and development which takes into account
the individual risk characteristics of each particular asset and related income stream.
For developed technology, near-term sales projections are based on past experience, adjusting for expected changes in future
conditions, including those anticipated as a result of our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes
in the pharmaceutical industry. Long-term sales projections assume near-term growth of 2% for the first eight years and then 
a 20% per annum reduction thereafter through to the end of the asset’s estimated useful life. 
For in-process research and development the key assumptions are the chance of product launch, market share and overall
market size. Industry average statistics are used to assess the chance of product launch, taking into account the stage of
development of the asset, the therapeutic area targeted and any known specific characteristics of the asset. Market share 
and overall market size are assessed by reference to independent industry market reports.
In assessing whether there has been an impairment, the net present value of future cash flows is compared to the carrying
value in the accounts.

Other investments comprise non-current equity investments which are available-for-sale that are recorded at fair value at each
balance sheet date. The fair value of unlisted investments is estimated to be the valuation following the latest round of equity
funding. In the absence of specific market data the Group determines that cost is equal to fair value.
Where the fair value of an available-for-sale asset is impaired, the impairment charge is recognised in the income statement
together with any amounts recycled from the fair value reserve (see note 24). These impairments initially arise from the
prolonged or significant decline in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any
further decline in fair value is immediately taken to the income statement. No amounts (2009: £0.5m) have been recycled 
from the fair value reserve on the sale or impairment of investments.

The Company’s authorised share capital at 31 March 2010 comprised 311,100,000 ordinary shares of 10 pence each (2009:

Protherics Group. These shares were exchanged in the ratio 0.291 BTG shares for each Protherics share, resulting in the issue 
of 1,293,008 BTG shares. The balance of 1,006,668 share options were exercised under BTG share option schemes. All shares
rank pari passu in all respects with existing ordinary shares.
Share options and warrants
Details of outstanding share options are set out in note 30. 
At 31 March 2010, there were unexercised warrants for 100,000 ordinary shares in Enact Pharma Limited, a subsidiary of Protherics
which was acquired by the Company in December 2008. These warrants expire on 9 July 2012 and are exercisable at 30p per
ordinary share of Enact Pharma Limited. Should these be exercised, the Company is entitled to repurchase these shares for
consideration of 19,846 ordinary shares in BTG plc which creates an equivalent exercise price of 151.2p per ordinary BTG share.

The Group utilises foreign currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows. 
At 31 March 2010 the Group had forward contracts to sell US$41m in the period to February 2011 at rates in the range 
£1:$1.49 to £1:$1.61. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments was marked to market at 31 March 2010 at £0.8m. 
At 31 March 2009 the Group had forward contracts to sell US$56m in the period to February 2010 at rates in the range 
£1:$1.98 to £1:$1.44. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments was marked to market at 31 March 2009 at £7.3m. 
The fair value gain/loss for the year associated with these forward contracts was included within ‘Financial Income’ (2009:
‘Financial Expense’).
A 5% weakening of the US$ as at 31 March 2010, all other variables being unchanged, would result in an additional £1.3m gain
within ‘Financial Income’ in the Income Statement and an associated fair value asset of £0.5m within ‘Derivative instruments’
within Current Assets. A 5% strengthening of the US$ would result in a £1.4m reduction within ‘Financial Income’ and an
increased in ‘Derivative Instruments’ to £2.2m within Current Liabilities.

Deﬁned beneﬁt plan
For eligible UK employees the Group operates a funded pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable
emoluments. The plan was closed to new entrants as of 1 June 2004. The assets of the plan are held in a separate trustee
administered fund. The plan generally raises pensions in line with price inflation, and these increases are reflected in the
measurement of the obligation. The last formal actuarial valuation was conducted as at 31 March 2007 by David Jones, 
Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. Its results have been updated to the accounting date by an independent qualified actuary 
in accordance with IAS19. The next formal valuation will be conducted as at 31 March 2010.
As a result of the 31 March 2007 actuarial valuation, the Group agreed with the pension fund trustees to make special
contributions to the fund. In total, £17.4m was committed over a period of five years. Of this, £4.2m was paid in 2008/09,
£3.3m was paid in 2009/10 and £3.3m will be paid in each of the next three financial years. The estimated total amount of
contributions to be paid to the plan during 2010/11, including the special contributions of £3.3m, is £3.8m (2010 actual: £3.9m). 
The expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ending 31st March 2010 was 5.6% pa (2009: 5.5% pa). This rate 
is derived by taking the weighted average of the long-term expected rate of return on each of the asset classes that the plan
was invested in at 31st March 2010, based on the plan’s long-term investment strategy at that date.
The following table sets out the key IAS19 assumptions used for the plan:
                                                                                                                                                                                                   31 March 2010     31 March 2009     31 March 2008

Deﬁned contribution plans
The Group offers defined contribution pension plans both for its UK, US and Australian employees. The total income statement
charge in relation to these plans was £1.6m (2009: £0.8m).
In the UK, the Group contributes between 3% and 10% of base salary up to the HMRC Cap, depending on seniority and 
levels of employee contribution to a defined contribution pension plan open to all employees not in the defined benefit 
pension plan. This plan replaces all previously operated defined contribution pension plans for UK employees.
Eligible employees of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries are members of externally operated defined contribution plans. 
The only obligation of the Group with respect to these plans is to make the specified contributions.
30 Share-based payments
Share options
The Group makes awards under an equity-settled share option plan that entitles employees to purchase shares in the
Company. In accordance with the rules of the plan, options are granted at the market price of the shares on the date of grant
with a vesting period of generally three years. They may only be exercised upon the attainment of certain performance criteria.
If the performance criteria are not met by the date specified at the time of grant, the options do not vest and will lapse. If the
options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are
forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest unless the conditions under which they leave are such that
they are considered to be a ‘good leaver’. In this case their options remain exercisable for a limited period of time. For further
details of current awards, see the Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 58.
Option pricing
For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share-based compensation charge, a binomial lattice option pricing model
has been used. The assumptions used in the model are as follows:

The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility (calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share
options or restricted shares), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly-available information.
Share options are granted under a service condition, a non-market condition and a market condition. Service and non-market
conditions are not taken into account in calculating the fair value measurement of the services received.

Performance shares are awarded under a service condition, a non-market condition and a market condition. Service 
and non-market conditions are not taken into account in calculating the fair value measurement of the services received.
The latest share options and performance share awards have a market condition based on a TSR measure using the 
FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts, companies in the financial services sector (banking, insurance, broking, fund
management, etc.) and companies in the consumer discretionary sector (non-food retail, media, leisure, gambling). Earlier
share options and performance shares used the techMARK (All Share) or FTSE SmallCap (excluding Investment Trusts) indices
(depending on the index chosen for the specific award). If the Company’s share price at least matches the performance of the
relevant index over the vesting period, the market-based performance condition will be considered to have been achieved. The
fair value of an award of shares under the share option and performance share plans have been adjusted to take into account
this market-based performance condition using a pricing model based on expectations about volatility and the correlation 
of share price returns in the relevant index and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share 
price and index performance. This adjustment increases the fair value relative to the share price at the date of grant. See the
Remuneration Report on pages 47 to 58 for further information. 
Restricted shares are awarded to certain management employees under a service condition and a non-market performance
condition. There are no market conditions related to the restricted share awards.

Restricted share awards
The Company established a restricted share scheme for the purpose of making awards to selected members of senior
management below Board level. The vesting period is either two or three years. Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves
the Group before the awards vest, unless the conditions under which they leave are such that they are considered to be a
‘good leaver’; in which case their award is released following their departure. For further details see the Remuneration Report
on pages 47 to 58.
Movement in the number of restricted shares awarded is as follows:

Performance share awards
Following approval of the Performance Share Plan by shareholders at the 2006 AGM, the Company has made awards 
to the executive directors and other employees with a vesting period of two or three years. Awards are forfeited if the director

are considered to be a ‘good leaver’; in which case their award is released following their departure. For further details see

Options remaining in Protherics 
In addition to the options in BTG plc, at the point of acquisition, options remained outstanding in Protherics under its unapproved,
approved and sharesave plans as well as certain individual options. All options had vested at the point of acquisition and thus
the Group has not experienced a share-based payment charge in respect of these options.
When these shares were exercised, the newly issued shares in Protherics were exchanged for shares in BTG plc at a ratio 
of 0.291 of a BTG plc ordinary share for each Protherics ordinary share. The final date for exercise of these options was 
4 June 2009 meaning that all share options of the former Protherics Group have now either been exercised or have lapsed.
Movement in the options during the year were as follows:

Lease provisions relate to onerous leases and represent the net present value of future obligations and where relevant, 
not covered by income from tenants (see note 2(m)).
The provision for reorganisation costs arose as a result of the Group’s rationalisation activities following the acquisition 
of Protherics on 4 December 2008 (note 38). The provision principally comprises redundancy and other site closure costs.

The Group has exposure to credit, liquidity and market risks from its use of financial instruments. This note sets out the Group’s
key policies and processes for managing these risks.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a licensee fails to meet its contractual obligations or a customer fails to
pay for goods and services received. The Group’s primary objective with respect to credit risk is to minimise the risk of default 
by licensees or customers.
A substantial element of the Group’s revenue is derived from royalties which are only payable if a licensee is generating
income from sales of licensed products. In such instances the Group’s exposure to credit risk is considered to be inherently
relatively low, although it is influenced by the unique characteristics of individual licensees. Approximately 49% of the Group’s
royalties are derived from one licensee who has held a licence for seven years. The Group’s policy is to provide against bad
debts on a specific licence by licence basis.
The majority of the marketed product revenues are currently generated from sales to one customer in the US. Management
is constantly in communication with this customer and monitors both sales to and payments from this customer to minimise 
the credit risk exposure.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they fall due,
under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group has limited debt facilities in the form of assets held under finance leases but has substantial cash balances to fund
its operations.
The Group’s policy is to place surplus cash resources on short-term fixed interest deposits, to the extent that cash flow can 
be reasonably predicted. Term deposits are denominated in UK sterling with institutions rated as A or higher by both Moody’s
and Standard & Poor’s.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect
the Group’s income or the value of its holdings in financial instruments. The Group has little exposure to interest rate risk other
than that returns on short-term fixed interest deposits will vary with movements in underlying bank interest rates. The Group’s
principal market risk exposure is to movements in foreign exchange rates.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has several overseas subsidiary undertakings, the revenues and the expenses of which are denominated in local
currencies being US dollars and Australian dollars. As a result the Group’s sterling income statement, balance sheet and cash
flows may be affected by movements in sterling exchange rates with these currencies. The Group’s primary objective with
respect to managing foreign exchange risk is to provide certainty over the value of future cash flows.
A significant element of the Group’s revenue is denominated in US dollars with the remainder split between sterling, euros, yen
and other currencies. The majority of the Group’s operating expenses are in sterling along with smaller elements in US dollars
and Australian dollars. Where possible, anticipated foreign currency operating expenses are matched to foreign currency
revenues. The excess exposure over and above this natural hedge, to the extent that cash flows are predictable, is managed
using forward contracts (see note 26).
Sensitivity analysis
A 5% weakening of the US$ at 31 March 2010 would have resulted in the following increases/(decreases) in equity and profit 
or loss.

Interest rate risk
The Group seeks to mitigate partially against increased interest rates while maintaining a degree of flexibility to benefit from
decreasing rates of interest by holding a mix of fixed and floating rate financial liabilities. The Group seeks to maximise the
amount of interest income from its cash balances by using a variety of short-term, fixed high-interest deposit and money-
market accounts. The Group does not consider the impact of interest rate risk to be material to its results or operations and
accordingly no sensitivity analysis is shown.
Market price risk
It is, on occasion, deemed appropriate to take equity stakes in early-stage companies utilising the Group’s technology as part of
the overall licensing arrangement and small loans may be granted to these companies to further technology development. These
investments will be realised at an appropriate time in the development cycle. Regular reports are made to the Board on the
status of investments. These investments form part of the Group’s overall technology portfolio and do not materially affect liquidity.

Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total equity. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are: 
– To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
– To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
– To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits 
for inventive sources and returns to investors.
– To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group’s capital and equity ratio are shown in the table below.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   31 March 2010     31 March 2009

Following the implementation of IFRS7 Revised ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ the Group is disclosing for the first time a fair
value hierarchy to reflect the significance of inputs used in making fair value assessments. The fair value hierarchy includes the
following three levels:
Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 2 – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3 – unobservable inputs

Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected 
in the table.
Other investments
These comprise both listed and unlisted investments, available-for-sale. The figure recorded in the statement of financial
position (note 20) is the best estimate of fair value.
Borrowings and ﬁnance leases
The fair values of such balances are estimated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.
Trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents
Trade payables and receivables have a remaining life of less than one year so their value recorded in the statement of financial
position is considered to be a fair approximation of fair value.
34 Operating leases
Total non-cancellable operating lease rentals are due in the following periods:

to the Plan up to a maximum amount equal to the lowest non-negative amount which, when added to the assets of the Plan
would result in the Plan being at least 105% funded on the date on which any liability arose, calculated on the basis set out in

The goodwill arising on acquisition resulted from assets which could not be recognised separately including early-stage pipeline
products and a highly skilled workforce. The fair value adjustments have not been adjusted since their provisional valuations.
The main elements of the significant fair value adjustments are described below:
– Intangible assets in respect of the marketed products, in-process research and development and contractual relationships 
in accordance with IFRS3 – Business Combinations
– Revaluation of inventory reflecting profit accrued up to the stage of production at the time of the transaction
– Deferred tax liabilities in relation to the acquired intangible assets over and above £18.2m of deferred tax assets 
in recognition of acquired accumulated tax losses

1 Accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Company financial statements are the same as those set out

Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Share-Based Payments
The Company has elected to apply IFRS2 to all share-based awards and options granted post 7 November 2002 that had not

Credit risk
The Company’s credit risk is the risk that one of its subsidiaries is unable to repay intercompany amounts owing. The recoverability
of the Company’s intercompany receivable is considered at each balance sheet date.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company does
not hold significant cash balances as Group cash is managed centrally within its subsidiaries. Accordingly the Company is
funded by its subsidiaries as its liabilities fall due.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect
the Group’s income or the value of its holdings in financial instruments. As holding company of the BTG Group, the Company
does not have significant exposure to movements in market prices and accordingly no additional disclosure is provided. There
are no foreign currency balances within the Company’s Statement of Financial Position.
Capital management
Details of the Company’s objectives with respect to managing capital are disclosed in note 33 to the Group financial statements.

10 Guarantees and contingent liabilities

The Company has provided a Guarantee to certain subsidiary undertakings in respect of the BTG Pension Plan up to a
maximum amount equal to the lowest non-negative amount which, when added to the assets of the plan, would result in
the plan being at least 105% funded on the date on which any liability arose, calculated on the basis set out in section 179 
of the Pensions Act 2004, were a valuation to be conducted as at that date.

being the deficit repair contributions agreed with the Trustees of the plan following the finalisation of the last actuarial valuation.
The Guarantee reduces as payments are made and expires on 31 January 2013.

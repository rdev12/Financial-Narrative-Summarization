Highlights 2 Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008 Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008 3
Activity in 2008 has seen the Company 
focus on its technical objectives. During 
this period we have completed the 
acquisition and processing of a large 3D 
survey and finalised its interpretation. 
The results of this work have yielded 
what we believe to be a very attractive 
and exciting prospect inventory.
Against a challenging economic background, 
the Company, whilst experiencing a decrease in 
value along with market trends, has performed 
well relative to its peer group of AIM listed 
Exploration & Production Companies. We also 
have a strong cash balance. 
During the period we have witnessed the oil price 
decline from $147 per barrel down to around 
$35 per barrel. Recently the oil price has showed 
signs of recovery with prices approaching $60 
per barrel again. However, it should be noted that 
our projects in the Falkland Islands are likely to 
be commercial at the $35 level.
Whilst we cannot impact the external 
environment, we can influence the technical 
evaluation by the correct choice of data 
acquisition and the areas we select in which 
to collect the data. In this regard, the Board 
of Directors considers that it has been very 
successful. Multiple, high quality, large volume 
prospects have been defined, many of which 
are supported by geophysical attributes of 
the type we had hoped for at the onset of the 
exploration programme.
With the completion of the main phase of 3D 
seismic interpretation there will be no further 
requirement for additional data acquisition 
prior to drilling a well. We are now in a position 
to define drilling locations on our prioritised 
prospects. As we have previously reported, the 
first two high-graded prospects are Darwin 
and Stebbing.
As we look forward, technical work will continue 
but our energy will be placed into bringing a 
partner into the licences to help fund the wells. 
Given the scale and quality of the prospect 
inventory we are optimistic that we can attract a 
credible partner. 
Chairman’s Statement
Borders & Southern Petroleum has a 100% interest in five deep 
water production licenses in the South Falkland Basin (80 blocks, 
nearly 20,000 sq km). The basin is untested, comprising similar 
geology to the contiguous Malvinas and Magallanes Basins to the 
west where discoveries of approximately six billion barrels of oil 
equivalent have been reported. 4 Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008 Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008 5
The technical programme undertaken in 
2008 involved the acquisition, processing 
and interpretation of 1,492 sq km of 3D 
seismic data. The 3D data has been fully 
integrated into our regional evaluation 
so that we now have a comprehensive 
understanding of the South Falkland 
Basin. As a result, not only have we been 
able to define a high quality multi-billion 
barrel (recoverable) prospect inventory, 
but also identify those play types within 
the basin that we think are most likely to 
deliver success.
As previously reported, the step change in 
understanding from 2D to 3D seismic data 
has been dramatic and justifies the size and 
expenditure of the 3D survey. Prospect sizes 
are large (up to 150 sq km of mapped structural 
closure) and display important geophysical 
attributes that help reduce the risk. These include 
seismic amplitude conformance to structure, flat 
spot and AVO anomalies, along with gas hydrates 
located above prospects. We interpret these 
seismic attributes to indicate that the structures 
have received a hydrocarbon charge.
Individual prospect volumes in some cases 
exceed 1 billion barrels of recoverable oil. 
The previously reported Darwin and Stebbing 
prospects have P50 recoverable oil volumes of 
300 million and 710 million barrels respectively. 
Additional stacked reservoirs on the same 
structures could increase these numbers. These 
prospects represent different play types and 
have been prioritised due to the chance of 
success rather than size. 
Whilst the exploration drilling programme will 
target high-graded oil prospects, each prospect 
has also been considered as a gas case. If gas 
was the only outcome, and we consider it 
unlikely, then the prospect gas volumes would 
be sufficient to justify an LNG development. 
Individual prospect volumes can exceed (P50) 
5 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas.
Chief Executive’s Review
 6 Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008
Chief Executive’s Review (continued)
Aside from producing a ranked prospect 
inventory we have conducted a benthic sampling 
programme, one of the key requirements for the 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The 
operations were completed efficiently and the 
analysis is currently underway. Once the EIA has 
been submitted and approved we will be ready 
to drill and should the opportunity arise will be 
able to share in a combined drilling operation 
with other operators in the area.
Whilst the Company has a strong cash balance it 
does not have sufficient funds to execute a two 
well programme. Given the economic climate 
the Board has decided the best way to finance 
our wells is to seek a partner. Within the coming 
months we will further discussions with third 
parties and will report later in the year. Given 
the strength of the prospect inventory, scale of 
opportunity and the quality of the geophysical 
attributes, the Board is confident of securing a 
competent partner.
The naming theme for our 
prospects has been chosen to 
celebrate the exploration voyage of 
HMS Beagle under the command 
of Robert FitzRoy. Each prospect is 
named after a member of the crew 
or passenger on the ship. During 
the Beagle’s circumnavigation of 
the world it carried out important 
surveying work of the South 
American coastline, including the 
Falkland Islands where it stopped 
twice in 1833 and 1834. 
Charles Darwin joined the voyage 
as a companion to Robert FitzRoy. 
Famous for his observations and 
theories as a naturalist, which led 
to the publication of his work On 
The Origin of Species, Darwin was 
also a very good geologist. He had 
been inspired by the work of Charles 
Lyell and carried Lyell’s book 
“Principles of Geology” with him on 
the voyage. This book suggested that 
modern day geological processes 
such as sediment erosion and 
deposition and volcanic eruptions 
had occurred in the past. Because of 
the incredibly slow pace of many of 
these processes, it pointed towards 
a vast timescale for the age of the 
earth, a very controversial issue at 
the time. Darwin’s own observations 
from the voyage supported this 
view.  He collected many geological 
specimens, including fossils from 
the Falkland Islands, now kept 
in the Natural History Museum 
in London.
As explorers for oil and gas we 
use many of the basic principles of 
geology described in Lyell’s book to 
help us understand the sedimentary 
basins responsible for the generation 
and entrapment of hydrocarbons. 
Today, with the advancement of 
science, we now know that the age 
of the source rocks surrounding the 
Falklands (those organic rich rocks 
responsible for the generation of 
hydrocarbons) are between 120 and 
160 million years old.
Prospect Inventory – Key Features
 Multi-billion barrel recoverable prospect potential
 Structurally robust prospects up to 150 sq km in area
 Amplitude conformance to structure
 Credible flat spot and AVO anomalies
 Gas Hydrates above prospects
 Multiple play types and large prospect inventory Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008 7
As you will have read elsewhere in this 
report, the Company completed the 3D 
seismic acquisition in the first quarter 
of the year and spent the balance of 
the year processing and interpreting 
the data. All of this was fully funded 
through the two private share 
placements during 2007. 
As a result, the Company is fortunate to have 
around US$19.5 million in cash at year end 
which was held in near term bank deposits and 
UK Treasury Stock.
Looking forward, it is clear that drilling activity 
in the Company’s licenses is the next key 
objective and the most significant potential 
capital expenditure.  We are currently actively 
seeking a partner, via a farm-out, to fund these 
costs in return for equity in the licenses. It is not 
clear, at this stage, the impact such a farm-out 
transaction would have on the Company’s cash 
position and it’s forward capital commitments. 
However, given that we go into the farm-out 
process with both a strong cash balance and 
technical case, we feel that we are well placed to 
attract a favourable outcome.
This year the Company’s functional currency 
changed to US$ reflecting the nature of the 
Company’s activities and at the same time the 
presentation currency changed to US$ to be 
more comparable with peer group companies. 
As a result, the Group is now exposed to 
foreign exchange movements on its balances 
and transactions denominated in £, whereas 
in the prior year, the Group was exposed on its 
balances and transactions in US$.
The Group made a loss for the year of $4.7m 
(2007: $0.3m). This was primarily due to a 
$4.4m (2007: nil) foreign exchange loss on £ 
denominated cash and other financial assets due 
to the devaluation of the £ against the $ during 
the second half of the year. Administrative costs 
for the year were $1.3m (2007: $1.7m) and in line 
with expectations.
Capital additions of $12.9m (2007: $19.9m) 
to the Group’s oil and gas exploration and 
evaluation assets were made during the year.
As you can see from the charts, despite the 
financial turmoil during 2008 and 2009 to date, 
the Company’s shares have performed well 
both in absolute terms and relative to our AIM 
listed peers.

Directors’ Report 
for the Year Ended 
31 December 2008
The directors present their report and the 
audited consolidated financial statements for 
the year ended 31 December 2008.
Domicile
The parent company of the group (which is 
also the ultimate parent), Borders & Southern 
Petroleum Plc, is a public limited company and is 
registered and domiciled in England.
Principal activity
The principal activity of the group is the 
exploration for oil and gas.  
Results and dividends
The group income statement is set out on 
page 17 and shows the result for the year.
The directors do not recommend the payment of 
a dividend.
Review of business and future developments 
A review on the operations of the group is 
contained in the Chief Executive’s Review and 
Financial Review on pages 5-7. 
Principal risks and uncertainties and financial 
risk management
Exploration risk
The exploration for and development of 
hydrocarbons is speculative and involves a 
high degree of risk. These risks include the 
uncertainty that the Group will discover 
sufficient oil or gas to exploit commercially.
Financial risk management
The company’s operations are such that it has 
a limited exposure to a variety of financial 
risks. These may, from time to time, include the 
effects of changes in price risk, liquidity risk and 
a foreign exchange risk. The company does not 
use derivative financial instruments to manage 
interest rate or currency risks and as such, no 
hedge accounting is applied.
Given the size of the company, the directors 
have not delegated the responsibility of 
monitoring financial risk management to a 
sub-committee of the board. The company’s 
management implements the policies set by the 
board of directors.
Price risk  
The company is exposed to price risk due to 
normal inflationary increases in the purchase 
price of goods and services. The company has 
no exposure to equity securities price risk, as it 
holds no listed or other equity investments.
Liquidity risk 
The company has no long term commitments and 
is able to satisfy any current liability from cash 
reserves. 
Foreign exchange risk
The company has potential exposure due 
to some of its purchases being invoiced in 
currencies other than the US dollar functional 
currency. The exposure relates mainly to items 
denominated in £. To mitigate the risk, the 
company when it becomes aware of a liability in 
a different currency, seeks to minimise the risk 
by either immediately converting the required 
funds to the relevant currency or taking out a 
forward contract. Other than forward contracts, 
the company does not use any other type of 
currency hedging.
Key performance indicators 
The Company’s key performance indicators 
(discussed in the Chief Executive’s Review 
and Finance Review on pages 5-7 are the 
management of its cash position ($19.5m at year 
end, 2007: $39.1m) and the fulfilment of the 
exploration program. 
Post balance sheet events
No events have occurred since the year end 
which require reporting or disclosing in the 
financial statements.
Charitable and political donations
There were no political or charitable 
contributions made by the company or the 
group during the period. 10 Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008
Directors’ Report (continued)
Health, safety and environment
The group has an overriding commitment to health, safety and environmental responsibility. The group works closely with host governments 
and communities in the countries in which it operates, together with its contractors and partners, to ensure internationally recognised 
standards are implemented and maintained along with compliance to local legislation.  
The group’s exploration activities are subject to the relevant environmental protection acts. The group closely monitors its activities to ensure 
to the best of its knowledge there is no potential for the breach of such regulations. There have been no convictions in relation to breaches of 
these Acts recorded against the group during the reporting period.
Creditor payment policy
It is the group’s policy to settle the terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of the transaction, to ensure that suppliers are 
aware of these terms and to abide by them.
The amounts owed to the company and group’s trade creditors at the year end represented 5 days (2007: 39 days) as a proportion of the total 
amounts invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Financial instruments
Details of the use of financial instruments by the company and its subsidiary undertaking are contained in note 21 of the financial statements.
Directors and their interests
The beneficial and other interests of the directors and their families in the share capital at the beginning of the year or the date of their 
appointment to the board, whichever is later, and at 31 December 2008, were as follows:

Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the company, for safeguarding the assets of the company, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities and for the preparation of a Directors’ Report which complies with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.  The 
directors are also required to prepare financial statements for the group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs) and the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative 
Investment Market.  The directors have chosen to prepare financial statements for the company in accordance with IFRSs.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the company’s financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows.  This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’.  In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation 
will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs.  A fair presentation also requires the  directors to:



impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance. 
Financial statements are published on the group’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the group’s 
website is the responsibility of the directors. The directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements 
contained therein.
Auditors
All of the current directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information needed by the 
company’s auditors for the purposes of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. The directors are not aware 
of any relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware.
BDO Stoy Hayward LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting.

Independent Auditors’ Report
Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of Borders and Southern Petroleum Plc
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of Borders and Southern Petroleum plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the 
Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related Notes.  
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.  
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985 and whether the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with those financial statements.  We also 
report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.  This 
other information comprises the Highlights, Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Financial Review, the Board of Directors, 
the Directors’ Report, the Audit Committee Report and the Remuneration Committee Report. We consider the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.  Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any other information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.  No person is entitled to rely 
on this report unless such a person is a person entitled to rely upon this report by virtue of and for the purpose of the Companies Act 1985 or 
has been expressly authorised to do so by our prior written consent.  Save as above, we do not accept responsibility for this report to any other 
person or for any other purpose and we hereby expressly disclaim any and all such liability.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.  An 
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
financial statements. Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008 15

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the Year Ended 31 December 2008  
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below and have been consistently applied 
to all years presented.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs and IFRIC 
interpretations) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under IFRS. The parent company financial statements have also been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Effective 1 July 2008, the Company’s functional currency changed from Pounds sterling (‘£’) to the US dollar (‘$’). This change was made as, 
due to the $ being the currency that mainly influences significant transactions and balances, the directors considered the $ to most faithfully 
represent the economic effects of the underlying transactions, events and conditions in the Company. Concurrent with this change in 
functional currency, the Group adopted the $ as its presentation currency and consequently the financial information for the year ended 31 
December 2007 has been re-presented in $.
In accordance with International Accounting Standards, this change in functional currency has been accounted for prospectively by translating 
all items using the $:£ exchange spot rate on that date, being $1.9902:£1. In the parent company accounts the resulting translated amounts 
for non monetary items at this date have been treated as their historic cost.
For the purposes of changing the Group’s presentation currency, the comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2007 were translated for 
the balance sheet using $:£ exchange spot rate on that date, being $1.9906:£1, for the income statement using the average $:£ exchange rate 
during the year being $2.0015:£1, and for the opening the balances as at 1 January 2007 using the $:£ spot rate on that date being $1.9728:£1. 
Resulting exchange differences have been taken to the Foreign currency reserve.

Basis of consolidation
Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another entity or business 
so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements present the results of 
the company and its subsidiaries (“the group”) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group 
companies are therefore eliminated in full.
Profit/(loss) for the financial year
The company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and has not presented its own 
income statement in these financial statements. The group loss for the year includes a loss after tax of $4,713,772 (2007 - $295,660) which is 
dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company.
The company’s investments in subsidiaries
In the parent company’s accounts subsidiaries are carried at cost less amounts provided for impairment. 26 Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008
Notes to the Financial Statements
for the Year Ended 31 December 2008 (continued)
Income
At the end of the year the group had not commenced commercial production from its exploration sites and therefore has no revenue in the year.
Finance income
Finance income is measured and recognised using the effective rate of interest. The income consists of interest on cash deposits.
Segment reporting
A business segment is a distinguishable component of an enterprise that is engaged in providing an individual product or service or a group of 
related products or services and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. The group has 
only one business segment, which is the exploration for oil and gas, and is its primary reporting segment.
A geographical segment is a distinguishable component of an enterprise that is engaged in providing products or services within a particular 
economic environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic 
environments. The group’s geographical segments are the United Kingdom, the Falkland Islands and other areas Worldwide, and make up the 
group’s secondary reporting segment.
Property, plant and equipment
Office equipment is initially recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on office equipment so as to write off the cost, less any estimated 
residual value, over their expected useful economic life as follows:
Office equipment  33 1/3%
Assets are depreciated from the date of acquisition, and on a straight line basis.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
As permitted under IFRS 6, the group has accounted for exploration and evaluation expenditure using the full cost method, whereby all costs 
associated with oil exploration are capitalised as intangible assets on a project-by-project basis, pending determination of feasibility of the 
project. Costs incurred include appropriate technical and administrative expenses but not general overheads. If an exploration project is 
successful, the related expenditures will be transferred to tangible assets and amortised over the estimated life of the commercial reserves. 
Where a licence is relinquished, a project is abandoned, or is considered to be of no further value to the group the related costs are written off. 
All capitalised costs are reviewed annually against the underlying value of oil and gas reserves, unless the expenditure relates to an area where 
it is too early to make a decision about the value of the assets.
Impairment 
Exploration assets are reviewed regularly for indication of impairment, if any, where circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable. If an indication of impairment exists, the asset is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS36- Impairment of Assets.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount, generally by reference to the present value of future net cash 
flows expected to be generated from the production of commercial reserves. The cash generating unit (“CGU”) applied for impairment 
testing is usually the individual field, except that a number of fields may be grouped together to form a single CGU where the cash flows are 
interdependent. 
Any impairment loss arising from the review is charged to the income statement whenever the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at the closing rates at the balance sheet date and the exchange differences 
are included in the income statement. The functional and presentational currency of the parent and all group companies is US dollars. Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008 27 
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Share based payments
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. In accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-
based Payments’ the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options. The amount of charge is 
adjusted each year to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
Where equity settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the income 
statement over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the 
number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other 
vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense 
is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately 
before and after the modification, is also charged to the consolidated income statement over the remaining vesting period.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, as follows:- 
 Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective rate of interest, net 
of allowances for impairment.
 Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective rate of interest.
 The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
 Financial instruments issued by group companies are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial 
liability. The group’s and company’s ordinary shares are all classified as equity instruments.
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank on demand and balances on deposit with an original maturity of three months or less.
 Assets available for sale comprise of government treasury stock. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly 
in the available for sale reserve. Where there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available for sale financial asset, the 
full amount of the impairment, including any amount previously charged to equity, is recognised in the income statement.
Taxes
The major components of income tax on the profit or loss include current and deferred tax.
Current tax is based upon the profit or loss for the year adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed and is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except where the tax relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in 
which case the tax is also dealt within equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs to its tax base.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when deferred tax liabilities and assets are settled or recovered. 28 Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008
Notes to the Financial Statements
for the Year Ended 31 December 2008 (continued)
Critical accounting estimates and judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future 
such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from 
the actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions with be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances 
change. Where necessary, the comparatives have been reclassified or extended from the previously reported results to take into accounts 
presentational changes.
Management has made the following judgements which have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements:
 Recoverability of exploration and evaluation costs
The group uses the full cost method of accounting, whereby exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised as intangible assets if the 
associated project is commercially viable, and reviewed for impairment. This requires judgement assessments as to (a) the likely future 
commerciality of the asset, and (b) future revenues and costs relating to the project in order to determine the recoverable value of the asset.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, which have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are as follows:
 Share options
The group’s share based payments were recognised at fair value, as in the prior period, using a 65% (2007: 50%) volatility rate. This is set out 
in greater detail in note 7.

Sundry items 376,962 412,420
Total administrative expenses 1,287,544 1,715,392
3 LOSS PER SHARE
The calculation of the basic loss per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year. The loss for the financial year for the group was $4,727,900 (2007 - $335,701) and the weighted average 
number of shares in issue for the year was 194,344,170 (2007 - 144,351,668). 
Potentially Dilutive Share Options
Due to the loss in the year for 2008 and 2007, the effect of the share options in issue is anti-dilutive and therefore diluted earnings per share 
has not been calculated.
At 31 December 2008 there were options over 1,000,000 shares outstanding which are potentially dilutive (2007 - 700,000). These options 
are described in Note 7. For the majority of the options their exercise price is greater than the weighted average share price during the year and 
it would not be advantageous of the holders to exercise these, therefore these options do not have a diluted effect. Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008 29

Total current tax for the year ––
The rate of UK corporation tax changed from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008. The average rate applicable for the period is

21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The main risks arising from the group’s operations are interest rate risk and foreign currency translation risk. The group monitors risk on a 
regular basis and takes appropriate measures to ensure risks are managed in a controlled manner.
a) Interest rate risk
The group’s financial assets and liabilities accrue interest at prevailing floating rates in the United Kingdom or at pre-arranged fixed rates, as 
described further below. The group does not currently use derivative instruments to manage its interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2008 the company held cash at bank and in deposits under its control of $9,522,035 (2007 - $39,064,938), in addition to UK 
Treasury stock of $9,950,668, which matures in March 2009.  These form the majority of the group's working capital. Of the cash at bank and 
in deposit, $584,285 (2007 - $741,614) relates to deposits placed with banking institutions that are available on demand which carry interest 
at prevailing United Kingdom deposit floating rates. The balance represents restricted deposits of $8,937,750 (2007 - $38,323,324) with 
weighted average fixed interest rate of 1.7% for three months.
b) Foreign currency translation risk
The operational currency of the oil and gas exploration and evaluation activities of the group is US $, services and treasury function is UK £. 
Balances are held in £ sterling and US $ are purchased when required and used to meet exploration and evaluation needs. Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008 37 
The interest rate risk and foreign currency profile of financial assets and liabilities of the group and the company are as follows:

of $10,324 for the group and $9,605 for the company (2007 - $37,127 for the group and $35,979 for the company). 
c) Credit risk
The group has no customers so formal credit procedures are in the process of being established. Credit risk on cash balances is managed by 
only banking with reputable financial institutions with a high credit rating. The only significant concentration of credit risk is cash held at bank 
and the maximum credit risk exposure for the group and company is detailed in the table below:

Fair values
The fair values of the group’s financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2008 and at 31 December 2007 are materially equivalent to their 
carrying value as disclosed in the balance sheet and related notes.
Capital
The objective of the directors is to maximise shareholder return and minimise risk by keeping a reasonable balance between debt and equity. 
To date the group has minimised risk by being purely equity financed. The group considers its capital to comprise its ordinary share capital, 
share premium, accumulated retained earnings and other reserves. Borders & Southern Annual Report 2008 39

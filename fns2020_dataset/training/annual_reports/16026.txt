 · Pos T Turnaround grow Th 
In 2009 and 2010 management began a strategic exercise to reduce 
operating expenses by shifting from a brand-based to a functionally-
based organisation. This shift allowed for the consolidation of 
numerous systems and offices, more efficient strategies and 
management of resources and a lower cost base upon which to 
develop the Group. 
 · l eading marke T Brands 
The Group has various well recognised brands in the UK and  
North America. Its leading brand in Canada is itravel2000, which  
firmly holds a leading market position in the leisure travel sector.
 · e x Perienced managemen T Team 
Our team is comprised of travel professionals with great 
depth and experience in specialist travel products and online 
and offline retailing, together with non-travel professionals who 
provide new thinking to the Group.
 · c ohesive s YsT ems  
We have instilled improved management and control by significantly 
reducing the number of independent systems in the Group. 
 · e conomies of scale 
The Group handles over 300,000 passengers per year, over  
2 million room nights, to over 500 destinations. A unified 
contracting strategy has now been implemented in the Group,  
which will provide for improved margins and access to inventory.
 · sP ecialisT Brands  
We continue to develop various specialist agency and merchant  
brands that will allow us to create and manage our customer 
experience in a more informed and controlled manner.

Travelzest plc Annual Report & Accounts for the year ending 31 October 2010
The	y ear	to	31	October	2010	was	the	
first	full	y ear	f or	 T ra v elzest	under	the	
executive leadership of Jonathan Carroll 
and Jack Fraser, who were appointed in 
ma y	2009. 	it	was	a	y ear	of	pr ogr ess	 
and improvement. 
The restructuring of the Group’s  
operations, which commenced in 2009, 
continued apace and this investment has 
begun	to	yield	benefits. 	 W e	simplified	
our operating structure and now have 
 an integrated and common approach  
to advertising, marketing, product 
purchase and support services. The  
aim	of	this	simplification	is	to	pr o vide	
better	management	of	our	businesses	
and share common skills and customer 
inf ormation	betw een	our	nor th	
american	and	UK	operations. 	
The consequence of this reorganisation 
is	that	 T ra v elzest	is	e v olving	fr om	a	gr oup	
of	independentl y	managed	businesses	
to	a	single , 	unified	entity	with	common	
controls, processes and governance. This 
giv es	gr eater	efficiency	and	will	pr o vide	
inf ormation	to	enable	us	to	manage	the	
Group effectively.
The Group sells overseas holidays and 
travel to clients who live mainly in the 
United	Kingdom	and	nor th	 america. 	
Our	model	pr o vides	us	with	a	div ersity	
of geography, currency, seasonality and 
distribution. 	 This	div ersity	is	a	str ength	in	
an industry where an excessive exposure 
to any of these risks is potentially very 
damaging. 	 The	po w er	of	 T ra v elzest’ s	
brands	and	the	r etailing	ability	of	our	
businesses, 	par ticularl y	those	in	Canada, 	
gives us attractive markets to exploit 
and	the	ability	to	cr eate	value	f or	
shar eholders. 	 T ra v elzest’ s	ambition	is	to	
be	our	customers’	adv ocate	in	finding	
them the most attractive holidays and 
the	best	experiences. 	
y our	Boar d	is	v er y	pleased	with	the	
progress made. We expect to see 
ad ditional	benefits	of	the	r eorganisation	
in	f or thcoming	y ears	and	belie v e	the	
Group is well positioned to prosper 
through the market and economic cycles 
which are a feature of the travel industry.
We are also in the process of discussing 
with	a	n umber	of	UK	and	Canadian	
banks	a	r efinancing	of	our	facilities	on	
more advantageous terms than those 
that	w e	cur r entl y	enjo y . 	Once	in	place , 	
this will put the Group in a yet stronger 
position to capitalise on the market 
opportunities that we foresee.
Results 
Total transaction value has grown  
15% 	 to 	 £217.6 	 million 	 fr om 	 £189.5	
million. 	r e v enue 	 incr eased 	 14% 	 to 	 
£43.8 	 million 	 fr om 	 £38.3 	 million. 	 
Gross 	 profit 	 impro ved 	 18% 	 to	 
£24.5 million from £20.8 million, and 
underl ying	operating	pr ofit	bef or e	
separately disclosed items increased  
11%	to	£6.1	million	fr om	£5.5	million. 	
as	par t	of	the	Gr oup	r estructuring	 
that	has	been	under tak en, 	y our	Boar d	
has decided to write-off the remaining 
goodwill 	 of 	 £11.3 	 million 	 r elating 	 to 	 our	
UK 	 businesses. 	 This 	 decision	was	tak en	
after reviewing the performance of the 
UK operations since they were acquired 
and	the	ability	of	the	UK	operations	to	
generate improved returns in the near 
future.

These motivated our team to work

were the closure of many airports in 
Europe and one in Canada as a result of 
the	icelandic	ash	cloud, 	and	the	demise	
of	Skyser vice	 airlines	in	Canada. 	Both	
these events caused some of our clients 
enormous	disruption	and	pr oblems	
which we resolved for them. These 
issues were addressed while we were 
facing	a	difficult	economic	situation	
around the world that put enormous 
pressure on consumers choosing their 
travel holidays and destinations.
Group performance
The Group has produced record 
financial	r esults	with	transaction	value	
gr o wth	of	15%	to	£217.6	million. 	 This	is	
the	first	time	in	the	Compan y’ s	histor y	
that we have achieved a transaction level 
o v er	£200	million, 	despite	the	difficult	
trading environment all of which was 
achieved through organic growth. This 
organic	gr o wth	was	primaril y	driv en	b y	
our	nor th	 american	operations, 	which	
performed strongly. Revenue was up 
14%	to	£43.8	million, 	gr oss	pr ofit	up	
18%	to	£24.5	million, 	and	underl ying	
operating	pr ofit	up	11%	to	£6.1	million. 	
p erha ps	the	most	significant	financial	
achievement in the year was the increase 
in cash generated from operations, up 
513%	to	£4.9	million. 	 This	allo w ed	the 
Company to execute on its strategic 
plans	and	to	ser vice	its	debt	facilities 
as restructured in 2009. 
During the year we completed the 
largest part of the restructuring of 
the Group. The tasks involved were 
not trivial and their completion within 
the time frame we set was challenging. 
We have completed in one year the 
consolidation of nine reservation 
systems	to	f our , 	fiv e	accounting	
systems	to	one , 	and	10	offices	to	six. 	
The management of the organisation 
has	shifted	fr om	a	brand-based	to	
pr edominatel y	functionall y-based	
structure with common marketing, 
purchasing, accounting and human 
resource practices. These actions will 
enable	us	to	de v elop	and	manage	ne w	
strategies that will allow us to grow 
the	Gr oup	substantiall y . 	
The shared services structure provides 
the	ability	to	manage	the	Gr oup	mor e	
efficientl y	with	better	contr ol	o v er	our	
operations. 	it	also	pr o vides	a	le v el	of	
governance that gives the Board the

General information
Travelzest plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together, 
the ‘Group’) provide retail travel sales and merchant 
operation services.
The Company is a public limited Company, which is listed on 
the AIM, a market operated by the London Stock Exchange 
plc. The address of its registered office is 2nd Floor Delta 
Place, 27 Bath Road, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, GL53 7TH, 
United Kingdom.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Travelzest plc have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union, IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention as modified by financial assets 
and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair 
value through profit or loss. The financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
sufficient resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable 
future. The Group is currently negotiating a new debt capital 
structure on terms more favourable to the business.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation 
of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years 
presented, unless otherwise stated.
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The following are critical judgements in applying the accounting 
policies of the Group that have the most significant effect on 
the financial statements:
Revenue
Management make critical judgements in determining when 
to recognise income. The recognition is based on whether 
companies within the Group are an agent (formerly travel 
agent) or merchant (formerly tour operator). Revenue is 
recognised when it can be measured reliably. Revenue and 
direct expenses relating to tours arranged by the Group’s 
merchant operators are taken to the income statement on 
the date of holiday departure. Revenue relating to agency 
commission receivable on third party leisure travel products 
is recognised when earned, which is on receipt of the full 
payment from the customer; and for business travel products 
is recognised when earned, which is upon booking from the 
customer as bookings are ticketed immediately and are non-
refundable. In all cases recognition occurs when it is probable 
that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will 
flow into the Group, and the costs incurred or to be incurred 
can be measured reliably. 
Impairment
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which 
the cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. Determining whether goodwill is 
impaired requires an estimate of value in use of the cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The 
value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate 
future cash flows from the cash-generating units and a 
suitable discount rate in order to calculate a fair value. 
In the process of measuring expected future cash flows, 
management makes assumptions about future gross 
profits. These assumptions relate to future events and 
circumstances. In most cases, determining the applicable 
discount rate involves estimating the appropriate adjustment 
to market risk and the appropriate adjustment to asset-
specific risk factors.
Share-based payments
Management uses valuation techniques in determining the fair 
values of share-based payments at the date of grant; it adopts 
the Black-Scholes pricing model approved and unapproved 
options schemes, and it adopts the Monte-Carlo Simulation 
pricing model for management incentive options. Significant 
inputs into the calculation include the market price at the date 
of grant and exercise prices. Furthermore, the calculation takes 
into account the future dividend yield, the share price volatility 
rate and risk-free interest rate.
Fair value of financial instruments
Management uses active market quotes to measure the fair 
value of derivative financial instrument hedges. The effectiveness 
of financial instrument hedges is assessed by considering the 
underlying liability to which the hedge relates. If the conditions 
for hedge accounting are no longer met and the previously 
designated hedged item is measured by means of the effective 
interest method, the necessary adjustment of the carrying 
amount of the underlying transaction has to be effected over 
its remaining term. The carrying value of derivative assets and 
liabilities is set out in Note 19.
Deferred tax assets
The assessment of the probability of future taxable income 
in which deferred tax assets can be utilised is based on the 
Group’s latest approved budget which is adjusted for significant 
non-taxable income and expenses and specific limits to the 
use of any unused tax loss or credit. If a positive forecast of 
taxable income indicates the probable use of a deferred tax 
asset, especially when it can be utilised without a time limit, that 
deferred tax asset is usually recognised in full. The carrying value 
of deferred tax assets and liabilities is set out in Note 14.
Litigation
Where the Group has an outstanding legal claim against it an 
appropriate accrual or provision is recognised in respect of the 
expected settlement. 18
Travelzest plc Annual Report & Accounts for the year ending 31 October 2010
PrinciP al accoun Ting P olicies 
continued
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase 
method. The purchase method involves the recognition of the 
acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent 
liabilities, regardless of whether they were recorded in the 
financial statements prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, 
the assets and liabilities of the acquired subsidiary are included 
in the consolidated financial statements at their fair values, 
which are also used as the basis for subsequent measurement in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Any deferred 
consideration in respect of the acquisition is held as a liability 
until payment is due and reflected in the initial carrying value 
of the subsidiary. Any subsequent changes to the amount of 
deferred consideration are recognised against the liability, 
and through the income statement. Goodwill is stated after 
separating out identifiable assets where applicable.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on acquisition represents any excess of 
the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value 
of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Under IFRS, 
goodwill is not amortised. Goodwill is recognised as an asset, 
and is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the Group’s income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed. The recoverable amount is the higher of 
an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Impairment tests for goodwill were conducted on the basis 
of cash-generating units. According to the IFRS rules, a cash-
generating unit is the smallest identifiable Group of assets that 
generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or Groups of 
assets. Cash-generating units were established for the individual 
merchant operators, and for the agency businesses, in specific 
countries. The expected cash flows generated are discounted 
using rates that represent estimated weighted average cost of 
capital for the respective business. The approach, assumptions 
and results of the impairment test are set out in Note 8.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to 
IFRS has been retained at previous UK GAAP amounts subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written 
off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 2006 has not been 
reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent 
profit or loss on disposal. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the 
carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are 
recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. The relationships 
have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line 
method over the expected life of the relationship. These have 
been classified as Other intangible assets.
Costs that are directly associated with the purchase and 
implementation of websites and unique software by the 
Group are recognised as intangible assets. Expenditures that 
enhance and extend the benefits of these items and lives are 
recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original 
cost of the website and software. Intangible assets are carried 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Other intangible assets are accounted for at cost whereby 
capitalised costs are amortised over their respective lives. 
Acquired computer software and website development are 
capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and install. 
The estimated useful economic life of these assets are as follows:
Other intangible assets – 1 to 6 years
Website development – 3 to 5 years
Computer software – 3 to 5 years
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Where costs are incurred as part of the start-up or 
commissioning of an item of property, plant or equipment, 
and that item is available for use but incapable of operating in 
the manner intended by management without such a start-up 
or commissioning period, then such costs are included within 
the cost of the item. Costs that are not directly attributable 
to bringing an asset to the location and condition necessary 
for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by 
management are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order 
to write off each asset over its estimated useful life. 
Property improvements – 5 years
Office equipment and computer equipment – 3 to 5 years
Motor vehicles – 3 to 5 years
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing 
the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised 
within administrative expenses in the income statement. When 
revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in other reserves 
are transferred to retained earnings.
Financial assets
i) Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following 
categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
receivables, and available for sale. The classification depends 
on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. 
Management determines the classification of its financial assets 
at initial recognition.  19
consolidated Financial s tatements Travelzest plc Annual Report & Accounts for the year ending 31 October 2010
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial 
assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this 
category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the 
short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading 
unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are 
classified as current assets.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They are included in current assets, except for 
maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans 
and receivables comprise Trade and other receivables and cash 
and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are 
either designated in this category or not classified in any of 
the other categories. They are included in non-current assets 
unless management intends to dispose of the investment 
within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
ii) Recognition and measurement
The Group measures its financial assets initially at fair value. 
The subsequent measure depends on classification, for example 
trade and other receivables which are fixed price are carried 
at amortised cost (if applicable) using an effective interest 
method if the time value of money is significant. Due to the 
nature of the businesses, credit risk is deemed low, therefore 
amortisation or impairment is unlikely. 
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings, trade 
and other payables and derivative financial instruments. 
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities 
measured at amortised cost or derivatives designated as 
hedging instruments. 
The Group determines the classification at initial recognition 
and measures initially at fair value. The subsequent 
measurement depends on classification, for example financial 
liabilities measured at amortised cost having been initially 
recognised at fair value (in case of borrowing, fair value of 
proceeds net of issue costs), are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost (if applicable) using an effective interest 
method taking into account discounts and issue costs. This 
category of financial liability includes borrowings and trade 
and other payables. 
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are accounted 
for in accordance with the policy set out below. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured 
at the fair value attributable to them on the day of the 
conclusion of the agreement. The follow-up measurement 
is also effected at the fair value applicable at the respective 
balance sheet date. The method applied in recording profits 
and losses depends on whether the derivative financial 
instrument is classified as a hedge, and on the type of hedged 
item. As a matter of principle, the Group classifies derivative 
financial instruments either as fair value hedges to hedge 
exposure to changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities 
or as cash flow hedges to hedge exposure to risks of varying 
cash flows from highly probable future transactions. 
Upon inception of the transaction, the Group documents the 
hedging relationship between the hedge and the underlying 
item, the risk management goal and the strategy pursued 
in entering into the hedges. In addition, an assessment is 
made both at the beginning of the hedge relationship and 
on a continual basis as to whether the derivatives used for 
the hedge compensate for the changes in the fair values or 
cash flows of the underlying transactions in a highly effective 
manner. The Group currently has no fair value hedges in place. 
Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments 
not achieving the criteria for hedge accounting are directly 
recognised in the income statement.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a 
hedge of the variability in cash flows arising from a recognised 
asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the 
effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial 
instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. Any 
ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in 
the income statement. 
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, 
the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the 
hedging reserve and is included in the initial cost or other 
carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If 
a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in 
the recognition of financial asset or financial liability, the 
associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in 
equity are reclassified into the income statement in the same 
period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability 
assumed affects profit or loss.
For cash flow hedges, the associated cumulative gain or 
loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income 
statement in the same period or periods during which the 
hedged forecast transaction affects in the income statement. 20
Travelzest plc Annual Report & Accounts for the year ending 31 October 2010
PrinciP al accoun Ting P olicies 
continued
Derivative financial instruments and hedging continued
Prospective hedge effectiveness is performed at the 
commencement of hedge accounting, and subsequently at 
each balance sheet date, through comparison of the critical 
terms of the hedged forecast transaction and the hedging 
instrument. Critical terms are the maturity, amount and 
currency of the cash flows relating to the hedging instrument 
and the forecast hedged transaction. Retrospective hedge 
effectiveness is performed at each reporting date principally 
using a dollar offset analysis, comparing the cumulative 
changes in the fair values of the forecast hedged transaction 
and the hedging instrument.
When a hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria 
for the hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge 
relationship, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. 
If the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, 
the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity 
and is recognised in accordance with the above policy 
when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is 
no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised 
gain or loss is recognised in equity or recognised in the 
income statement immediately.
Total transaction value and revenue recognition
T otal transaction value, which is stated net of value added tax, 
does not represent the Company’s statutory revenue. Where 
companies within the Group act as agent or cash collector, 
total transaction value represents the price at which goods or 
services have been sold to the consumer and is recognised on 
the same time basis as statutory turnover. 
Revenue represents the aggregate amount of gross 
consideration receivable from inclusive tours, agency 
commissions receivable and other services supplied to 
customers in the ordinary course of business. Revenue and 
direct expenses relating to the inclusive tours arranged by 
the Group’s merchant leisure travel providers are taken to 
the income statement on holiday departure. Revenue relating 
to agency commission receivable on third party leisure travel 
products is recognised when earned, which is on receipt of the 
full payment from the customer. Revenue relating to agency 
receivable on third party business travel products is recognised 
when earned on date of booking, which by the terms of 
contracts is the date the invoice is raised and the customer 
becomes liable for payment under the terms of their contract. 
In all cases recognition occurs when it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow 
into the Group, the costs incurred or to be incurred can be 
measured reliably. Other revenue and associated expenses are 
taken to the income statement as earned or incurred. Revenue 
and expenses exclude intra-Group transactions.
Income statement presentation
Profit or loss from operations includes the results from 
operating activities of the Group. 
Separately disclosed items are those that are unusual because  
of their size, nature or incidence which the Group’s 
management consider should be disclosed separately to enable 
a full understanding of the Group’s results.
Tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and 
deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, 
the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, respectively. The current income tax charge is 
calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the 
Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable 
income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in 
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions 
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid 
to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated 
financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not 
recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. 
Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income 
tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and 
are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax 
asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income 
taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or 
different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle 
the balances on a net basis. 21

Pensions
The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered 
pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The 
Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions 
have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee 
benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are 
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a 
reduction in the future payments is available.
Foreign currency
(a) Functional and presentation currency
In the Group’s financial statements, all assets, liabilities and 
transactions of the Group’s entities are translated into sterling, 
the functional currency of the parent Company. Average 
exchange rates are used to translate the income and expenses 
of all subsidiaries that have a functional currency other than 
sterling where there has been no significant fluctuation in 
the rate. The balance sheets of such entities are translated 
at period end exchange rates. On consolidation, exchange 
differences arising from the translation of the net investment 
in foreign operations, and of borrowings designated as hedges 
of such investments, are recognised in equity. 
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the 
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at 
the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are 
re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting 
from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised 
in the income statement, except when deferred in other 
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and 
qualifying net investment hedges. The Group’s third party 
borrowings qualify as a hedge. Foreign exchange gains and 
losses that relate to cash and cash equivalents are presented 
in the income statement within ‘finance income or cost’. All 
other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the 
income statement within ‘administrative expenses’.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated 
using the exchange rates at the date of transaction (not 
retranslated). Non-monetary items are measured at fair value 
are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the 
fair value was determined.
Share-based payments
The Group issues share-based instruments to certain 
employees as part of their total remuneration at fair value. 
The fair values of these instruments are calculated at the date 
of grant, using the Black-Scholes or Monte-Carlo Simulation 
pricing models. These fair values are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the expected vesting 
periods of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in 
equity reserves. Any waivers to share-based payments are 
treated as cancellations by the Group. When the options are 
exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds 
received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.
The Group also issued a cash bonus award which is recorded 
as cash settled share-based compensation. The fair value of 
the cash bonus award is calculated using the Monte-Carlo 
Simulation pricing model at each reporting date. The fair value 
is charged to the income statement with a corresponding 
entry to non-current liabilities.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) 
over which the Group has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding 
of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and 
effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or 
convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group 
controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for 
the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, 
equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed 
at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to 
the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, 
irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of 
the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net 
assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised 
directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains 
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered to be 
an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting 
policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to 
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Equity and reserves
Share capital presents the nominal value of shares that have been 
issued. Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of shares and share awards are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
Share premium includes any premiums received on the issue of 
share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing 
of shares are deducted from the share premium, net of any 
related income tax benefits.
The translation and hedge reserve includes the effects of foreign 
currency translation differences arising on the translation of 
the Group’s foreign entities and the gains and loss on financial 
instruments designated as effective hedges are also included. 22

continued
Equity and reserves continued
The Company was entitled to the merger relief offered by section 
131 of the Companies Act 1985 in respect of the consideration 
received in excess of the nominal value of the equity shares issued 
in connection with the acquisition of Peng T ravel Limited, Fair’s Fare 
Limited and the settlement of outstanding consideration on the 
acquisition of Holiday Express Group Limited.
On acquisition, the investments in the Company’s immediate 
subsidiary companies were recorded in the Company’s balance 
sheet at the fair value of the assets acquired, with the difference 
between this and the nominal value of the shares issued being 
credited to a merger reserve.
Retained earnings include all current and prior period 
retained profits.
Brochure and advertising costs
The costs of brochure publication and advertising including 
web based advertising are charged to the income statement 
as incurred.
Operating lease agreements
In accordance with IAS 17 Leases, rentals applicable to 
operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks 
of ownership remain with the lessor are charged against profits 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. 
Finance lease agreements
The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. 
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group 
has substantially all the risks and the rewards of ownership 
are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised 
at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value 
of the leased property and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and the 
finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance 
balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net 
of finance charges, are included in other long-term payables. The 
interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income 
statement over the period of the lease so as to produce a 
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability for each period. 
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance 
leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of 
the asset and the lease term.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker is the executive 
management, who are responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance of the operating segments.
Cash and cash equivalents 
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash comprises 
cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less 
overdrafts payable on demand.
Highly liquid investments are disposable without curtailing or 
disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into 
known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or 
traded in an active market. These comprise term deposits of 
less than one year (other than cash).
Capital management policies and procedures
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
• to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders
by pricing holidays effectively and considering the level 
of risk. The Group monitors capital on the basis of the 
carrying value of equity plus its facility loan, less cash and 
cash equivalents as presented in the face of the financial 
statements. The Group’s goal in capital management is 
to comply with its covenants arising under the Group’s 
current borrowing facility.

1 Segment reporting
Management has determined the reportable operating segments based on the information which is reviewed by the executive 
management, which is considered to be the chief operating decision maker. The executive management considers the business 
from an operating division perspective. For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into two operating 
divisions: merchant operations and agency operations. Merchant operations revenue is primarily when the Group becomes 
principal on the transaction and defines the terms of the transaction with the consumer. Agency operations revenue is primarily 
when the Group passes on to the consumer the majority of the terms of sale from the ultimate supplier and earns a commission 
for completing the transaction. 
The segment information provided to the executive management for the year ended 31 October 2010 is as follows:
Total transaction value 2010

£000s 
Merchant Operations 20,111 19,153
Agency Operations 197,534 170,303
217,645 189,456
All revenues in 2010 and 2009 are in respect of external customers. The Group is not reliant on any one major customer (2009: none).

A number of changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement. The Finance (No 2) 
Act 2010, which was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010, includes legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 
27% from 1 April 2011. Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014. 
These further changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial 
statements. The overall impact is not expected to be material to these financial statements. 34

7 Earnings per share
The basic loss per share of 8.80p (2009: 1.52p profit per share) is based on a loss of £12,769,000 (2009: profit of £719,000)  
and 145,136,110 (2009: 47,231,425) shares of 2p, being the average number of shares in issue during the year.
As the Group made a loss during the year, the impact of potential ordinary shares is anti-dilutive and therefore the dilutive loss  
per share is the same as the basic loss per share at 8.80p. In 2009, there were no share options/warrants that would constitute  
a dilutive calculation and therefore the dilutive profit per share was 1.52p.

For the year ended 31 October 2010 management has undertaken a detailed review of the carrying value of these investments both 
at a consolidated and company level and have determined that an impairment charge of £11,320,000 is required to write off 100% 
of the UK goodwill. A full list of the subsidiaries of the Group has been included at Note B to the company financial statements.
In making estimates of future profit and cash flows, the growth rate assumptions that have been applied to each businesses’ current 
year profits are deemed to be appropriate by management.
Growth rate estimates by their nature will include assumptions which have been considered in detail by management. In making 
assumptions, management has taken into account the following factors:
• Cash flow projections based on the Group’s latest approved four year budget plan which are sensitised to consider the impact 
of current trends in consumer demand;
• Historic results;
• Cash flows are discounted using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, adjusted as appropriate for business specific 
factors of sector risk, business size and other macro-economic factors relevant to the specific businesses; 
• Customer base to which the businesses sell;
• The Group’s post tax weighted average cost of capital is 16.5%;
• An average growth rate of 10% over the next four years in Canada and 5% in the UK has been used for the cash generating 
units above; 
• A terminal value multiple of 6 times cash flow has been applied to all segments; and 
• The impact of business downturn and changes in interest rates in growth rate assumptions.
If the estimated cost of capital used in determining the pre-tax discount rate for the CGU’s above had been 1.0% higher than 
Management’s estimates (for example 17.5% instead of 16.5%) no additional impairment would have been recorded. Using an 
average growth in cash flows of 7.0% instead of 10.0% in Canada also does not lead to an impairment being recorded. 36

Employee Option Scheme
The Company issues long-term incentive stock options to certain employees under an approved and unapproved option scheme. 
Both schemes have similar terms that include a minimum vesting period of 3 years from the date of grant and active employment  
in the Group. 
The fair value of options granted were determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. 
An amount of £105,000 (2009: credit of £557,000) relating to share options not vested held by employees who have left in the year 
has been credited to the income statement. 41
consolidated Financial s tatements Travelzest plc Annual Report & Accounts for the year ending 31 October 2010
Management Incentive Plan
The Company detailed in the Shareholder Circular issued 5 August 2009 the creation of a Management Incentive Plan which was 
agreed by shareholders at the General Meeting of 28 August 2009. In 2010, 28,587,000 options were granted. No options were 
granted in the prior year. The incentive options have a market exercise price and vest in the event of a sale of the entire issued 
share capital of the Company for an amount valuing the Company at least 15 pence per Ordinary Share. The options have good 
leaver and bad leaver terms, and all share options must be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant.
The fair value of options granted has been determined using the Monte-Carlo Simulation which is a generally accepted statistical 
technique used, in this instance, to simulate a range of possible future stock prices for the Company. The method uses geometric 
Brownian motion based upon a risk-neutral framework. The model projects stock prices on a daily basis assuming 250 trading 
days per year. The significant inputs into the calculation for share options granted during the year were the weighted average 
share price factored into the model of 12.1 pence, the exercise price ranges between 7.5 pence and 18.5 pence, the expected 
volatility of approximately 85% the option life of 5 years, the expected dividend yield of Nil, and the risk-free interest rate 
between 2.06% and 2.91%.

The warrants outstanding at 31 October 2010 had a weighted average exercise price of £1.30 and a weighted average contractual 
life of 6 years. The subscription rights attached to each warrant in issue must be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant.
The fair value of warrants granted were determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Significant inputs into the calculation 
include the market price at the date of grant and exercise prices. Furthermore, the calculation takes into account the future 
dividend yield, the share price volatility rate and risk-free interest rate. The underlying expected share price volatility was 
determined by reference to historical data. The Company expects the volatility of its share price to reduce as it matures.  
The risk-free interest rate was determined by the implied yield available on a zero-coupon government bond.
Cash Bonus Award
During the year, the Independent Board members approved a cash bonus award to J G Carroll, J C Fraser and M T J Molyneux. 
The bonus is not payable until a sale of the entire issued share capital of the Company at the time of grant, for an amount valuing 
the Company at least 15 pence per Ordinary Share. The bonus has good leaver and bad leaver terms similar to the Management 
Incentive Plan and has a graduated payout between 15 pence and 18.5 pence per Ordinary Share.
The fair value of the cash bonus award was determined using the Monte-Carlo Simulation. One of the provisions of the cash bonus 
award is around the performance of the Company’s stock price which is a market condition (i.e. trading above 15 pence). The expense 
recognised is based upon the fair value determined above the 15 pence value regardless of the stock price at the time of the change of 
control. The other significant inputs into the calculation for the cash bonus award granted during the year were the expected volatility 
of 84.99% the cash bonus award life of 5 years, the expected dividend yield of Nil, and the risk-free interest rate of 1.62%.  42

Interest on the liabilities to banks is payable at a variable rate, which is set at 4.50% above LIBOR on both denominated components 
of loan of which 100% has been fixed by means of an interest rate swap agreement at 4.0%. The bank loan is secured on the assets  
of Travelzest plc. In November 2010, the fixed rate increases to 8.48% on the Canadian denominated element of the loan.
During the prior year, the Group renegotiated the existing facility of £14,500,000 of which £10,000,000 is now denominated in 
Canadian dollars. In May 2010 a repayment of £1,729,000 was made, along with a further repayment of £2,251,000 in November 2010. 
Repayments are due every six months thereafter with a balloon payment in May 2012. The loan is presented net of the arrangement 
fee of £401,000 (2009: £687,000). 
The Group is currently reviewing new facilities that will amend the term and structure of the current facility to more 
commercially beneficial terms.

Liabilities from derivative financial instruments 1,247 1,691
Derivative financial instruments, all with a remaining term of more than one year, primarily serve to hedge future operative business. All 
instruments are outlined in Note 27. The fair value of the financial derivatives has been determined by relevant active market valuations. 
During the prior year, interest swaps denominated in sterling and Canadian dollar that were aligned to the restated facility in 
June 2009 were terminated and new interest swaps matching the amounts of the loan denominated in Canadian dollar and sterling.  
An element of the future cash flows relating to the former sterling interest swaps no longer exists and has been released from the 
cash flow hedge reserve to the income statement to the value of £262,000 (2009: £128,000). 
All financial instruments have been designated as hedging instruments as cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39, except for the 
Canadian dollar denominated interest rate swap which is an ineffective economic hedge. The following table indicates the periods in 
which the cash flows associated with the derivatives which as a cash flow hedge are expected to occur.

The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework 
and to ensure that the Group has adequate policies, procedures and controls to successfully manage the financial risks that it faces. 
These form part of the Group’s overall Risk Management Framework.
Incorporated within the framework’s terms of reference are the determination of all treasury policies and the monitoring of 
the effectiveness of those polices. Group Treasury implements and agrees policies on a day-to-day basis. The procedures also 
stipulate the levels of authority applied to dealing and to approving the types of hedging financial instrument used to manage 
these exposures. Transactions are only undertaken to hedge underlying exposures. Financial instruments are not traded, nor are 
speculative positions taken.
The Treasury position of the Group, including liquidity and foreign exchange hedging exposure, is managed centrally in accordance 
with polices appropriate to cover specific risks faced by each business unit, and is the responsibility of the Financial director. 
Management conducts regular reviews of financial risks with business unit management teams. Reports and forecasts are submitted 
monthly to the Board.
In line with its established policy, the Group has monitored throughout the year its counterparty exposure with individual financial 
institutions. Such counterparty risk can arise by way of cash deposited or derivative instruments traded.
The Group uses various financial instruments. These include loans and cash together with various items, such as trade debtors and 
trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the 
Group’s operations and group acquisitions. As a matter of principle, all hedging transactions of the Group were based on appropriately 
recognised or future underlying items. The hedging transactions by the Group companies were based on the risk profile and hedge 
schedule of the respective company. The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group to a number of financial risks, 
market risk (in respect of foreign currency rate risk and interest rate risk), liquidity risk (in respect of the Group’s ability to meet its 
liabilities) and credit risk (in respect of recovery amounts owing to the Group). The directors review and agree policies for managing 
each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained unchanged from previous years. 47
consolidated Financial s tatements Travelzest plc Annual Report & Accounts for the year ending 31 October 2010
Currency risk
The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and as a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange 
translation risk in respect of the translation of the results and underlying assets of its foreign operations into sterling. In relation  
to translation risk, as far as possible the assets held in the foreign currency are matched to an appropriate level of borrowings in 
the same currency. T ransaction exposures, including those associated with forecast transactions, are hedged when known, principally 
using forward currency contracts. T ransaction exposures primarily comprise accommodation and other costs of overseas holidays 
payable in currencies other than sterling. 
The table below shows the extent to which the Group had financial assets and liabilities at the year end in currencies other than sterling:

The Group hedges its foreign currency exposures generally on a seasonal basis, i.e. winter and summer seasons. At the start of the 
season the Group will have hedged some of its foreign currency exposure for that season, using predominantly forward exchange 
contracts, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.

US dollars 1.5566 1.5988 1.5444 1.6445
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
Trade and other receivables exposures are managed locally in the operating businesses where they arise; there is no concentration 
of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables due to a majority of holidays being paid for in advance. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk is £4,948,000 as outlined in Note 11.
In addition, the Group makes prepayments for hotel accommodation. Whilst such prepayments do not meet the definition of a 
financial asset under IAS39, such prepayments give rise to a risk similar to credit risk due to the inherent risk of the Group not 
recovering the prepayment through full delivery of the related goods and services. 48

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach is to 
ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meets it liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed circumstances.
The Group’s liquidity peaks in July and August during the European summer holiday season and December through February during 
the North American holiday season, with the liquidity low points in April and November.
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash 
assets safely and profitably. The Group’s financial assets are highlighted below:

Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through retained profits. Acquisitions are financed through a combination of share capital, loan notes 
and bank borrowings. The Group exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings is managed by the use of interest rate swaps. 
Details of interest rates on borrowings are given in Note 17 to the accounts.
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis is for illustrative purposes only and should be considered a projection of likely future events and gains or losses.
The sensitivity analysis includes the following assumptions:
• Change in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense of variable financial instruments;
• Change in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest 
rates are recognised at fair value;
•  Change in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments; and
•  All foreign currency hedges are expected to be highly effective. 49
consolidated Financial s tatements Travelzest plc Annual Report & Accounts for the year ending 31 October 2010
Currency risk
Under these assumptions, with a 10% strengthening of sterling against all other currencies, profit after tax would be decreased 
by £0.3m (2009: decrease by £0.2m) and equity would be decreased by £3.3m (2009: decreased by £3.8m). A 10% weakening of 
Sterling against all other currencies would result in a gain after tax of £0.4m (2009: gain of £0.2m) and an increase in equity of 
£4.1m (2009: increase of £4.7m).
Interest rate risk
Under these assumptions, with a 1% (100 basis point) difference in market interest rates, loss after tax would have reduced or 
increased by £0.1m (2009: £0.1m).
Fair value estimation
Effective 1 January 2009, the Group has adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance 
sheet at fair value. This requires the disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy.
• Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (level 1).
• Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices)  
or indirectly (derived from prices) (level 2).
• Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (level 3).
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 October 2010:

Travelzest plc for the year ended 31 October 2010 which 
comprise the Company balance sheet, the Company statement 
of changes in shareholders’ funds, the Company principal 
accounting policies and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors  
and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by 
our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs 
as at 31 October 2010;

Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the parent company financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the parent company 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to  
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.

company Financial statements
c om Pany P rinciP al accoun Ting P olicies 
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the Company have been  
prepared under the historical cost convention, and in 
accordance with UK GAAP and the accounting policies  
have been applied consistently. The financial statements are 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, 
which assumes that the Company will continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.
As a consolidated profit and loss account is published, a 
separate profit and loss account for the parent company is 
omitted from the Group financial statements by virtue of 
section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The loss dealt with 
in the accounts of the parent company under UK GAAP is 
£3,021,000 (2009: loss of £1,533,000).
Under Financial Reporting Standard No 1 (revised), the 
Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a 
cash flow statement as its cash flows are included within the 
published consolidated cash flow statement of Travelzest plc.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained 
within Financial Reporting Standard No 8 and has not therefore 
disclosed transactions or balances with wholly owned entities 
that form part of the Group.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained 
within Financial Reporting Standard No 29 and has not 
provided the required financial instruments disclosure on the 
basis that the Group’s consolidated financial statements include 
consolidated IFRS 7 disclosures which are compliant with the 
requirements of FRS 29.
Merger relief
The Company was entitled to the merger relief offered  
by section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 in respect of  
the consideration received in excess of the nominal value  
of the equity shares issued in connection with the acquisition  
of Peng Travel Limited, Fair’s Fare Limited and the settlement  
of outstanding consideration on the acquisition of Holiday 
Express Group Limited.
On acquisition, the investments in the Company’s immediate 
subsidiary companies were recorded in the Company’s balance 
sheet at the fair value of the assets acquired, with the difference 
between this and the nominal value of the shares issued being 
credited to a merger reserve.
Investments 
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision 
for any permanent diminution in value. Such provisions are 
charged to the profit and loss account. The directors will carry 
out an impairment review if there are events or circumstances 
which indicate that the carrying value of the investment may 
not be recoverable. Where loans made to Group undertakings 
are not expected by the director’s to be repaid in the 
foreseeable future these are treated as equity in nature and are 
classified within fixed asset investments.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs 
attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for 
its intended use. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to 
write off the cost of fixed assets, less their estimated residual 
value, over their expected useful lives on a straight line basis:
Office equipment and computer equipment – 3 to 5 years
Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to land and building operating leases where 
substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain 
with the lessor are charged against profits on a straight line 
basis over the period of the lease.
Pension costs
The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately 
administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual 
or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have been paid. The 
contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense 
when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as 
an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in 
the future payments is available.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences 
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay 
more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future 
have occurred at the balance sheet date. A net deferred tax 
asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised 
only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax 
losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing 
differences can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured at the 
average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in 
which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based 
on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured  
on an undiscounted basis. 54

Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are 
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at  
the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies  
are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling  
at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are  
taken into account in arriving at the operating profit.
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after 
deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments 
(including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt 
instrument, those financial instruments are classified as financial 
liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the balance 
sheet. Finance costs and gains or losses relating to financial 
liabilities are included in the profit and loss account. Finance 
costs are calculated so as to produce a constant rate of return 
on the outstanding liability.
Share-based payments
The Group issues share-based instruments to certain 
employees as part of their total remuneration at fair value. 
The fair values of these instruments are calculated at the date 
of grant, using the Black-Scholes or Monte-Carlo Simulation 
pricing models. These fair values are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the expected vesting 
periods of the instruments, with a corresponding increase 
in equity reserves. Any waivers to share-based payments are 
treated as cancellations by the Group. When the options 
are exercised, the company issues new shares. The proceeds 
received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium 
when the options are exercised. 
The Group also issued a cash bonus award which is recorded 
as cash settled share-based compensation. The fair value of 
the cash bonus award is calculated using the Monte-Carlo 
Simulation pricing model at each reporting date. The fair value 
is charged to the income statement with a corresponding entry 
to non-current liabilities.
Directors
Details of directors’ remuneration, share-based payments and 
pension entitlements in the current period and prior period are 
contained in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Details of share-based payments are also contained in Note 16 
to the consolidated financial statements.

Employee Option Scheme
The Company issues long-term incentive stock options to certain employees under an approved and unapproved option scheme. 
Both schemes have similar terms that include a minimum vesting period of 3 years from the date of grant and active employment  
in the Group. 
The fair value of options granted were determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. 
An amount of £105,000 (2009: credit of £557,000) relating to share options not vested held by employees who have left in the year  
has been credited to the income statement. 
Management Incentive Plan
The Company detailed in the Shareholder Circular issued 5 August 2009 the creation of a Management Incentive Plan which was 
agreed by shareholders at the General Meeting of 28 August 2009. In 2010, 28,587,000 options were granted. No options were 
granted in the prior year. The incentive options have a market exercise price and vest in the event of a sale of the entire issued 
share capital of the Company for an amount valuing the Company at least 15 pence per Ordinary Share. The options have good 
leaver and bad leaver terms, and all share options must be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant.
The fair value of options granted has been determined using the Monte-Carlo Simulation which is a generally accepted statistical 
technique used, in this instance, to simulate a range of possible future stock prices for the Company. The method uses geometric 
Brownian motion based upon a risk-neutral framework. The model projects stock prices on a daily basis assuming 250 trading 
days per year. The significant inputs into the calculation for share options granted during the year were the weighted average 
share price factored into the model of 12.1 pence, the exercise price ranges between 7.5 pence and 18.5 pence, the expected 
volatility of approximately 85% the option life of 5 years, the expected dividend yield of Nil, and the risk-free interest rate 
between 2.06% and 2.91%.

The warrants outstanding at 31 October 2010 had a weighted average exercise price of £1.30 and a weighted average contractual 
life of 6 years. The subscription rights attached to each warrant in issue must be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant.
The fair value of warrants granted were determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Significant inputs into the calculation 
include the market price at the date of grant and exercise prices. Furthermore, the calculation takes into account the future 
dividend yield, the share price volatility rate and risk-free interest rate. The underlying expected share price volatility was 
determined by reference to historical data. The Company expects the volatility of its share price to reduce as it matures.  
The risk-free interest rate was determined by the implied yield available on a zero-coupon government bond.
Cash Bonus Award
During the year, the Independent Board members approved a cash bonus award to J G Carroll, J C Fraser and M T J Molyneux. 
The bonus is not payable until a sale of the entire issued share capital of the Company at the time of grant, for an amount valuing 
the Company at least 15 pence per Ordinary Share. The bonus has good leaver and bad leaver terms similar to the Management 
Incentive Plan and has a graduated payout between 15 pence and 18.5 pence per Ordinary Share.
The fair value of the cash bonus award was determined using the Monte-Carlo Simulation. One of the provisions of the cash bonus 
award is around the performance of the Company’s stock price which is a market condition (i.e. trading above 15 pence). The expense 
recognised is based upon the fair value determined above the 15 pence value regardless of the stock price at the time of the change of 
control. The other significant inputs into the calculation for the cash bonus award granted during the year were the expected volatility 
of 84.99% the cash bonus award life of 5 years, the expected dividend yield of Nil, and the risk-free interest rate of 1.62%.

O Post balance sheet events
Post 31 October 2010 the Company secured a seasonal overdraft facility of £1.5 million from its primary bank with standard terms 
that fall within the current facility. There have been no other significant post balance sheets events since 31 October 2010.

In 2009 and 2010 management began a strategic exercise to reduce 
operating expenses by shifting from a brand-based to a functionally-
based organisation. This shift allowed for the consolidation of 
numerous systems and offices, more efficient strategies and 
management of resources and a lower cost base upon which to 
develop the Group.

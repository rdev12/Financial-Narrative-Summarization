Clinical development
Cogane
TM 
is currently being evaluated 
in a 400 patient multi-national Phase II, 
randomised, double blind, placebo 
controlled, dose ranging study 
(CONFIDENT-PD). The study is comparing 
the safety, tolerability and efficacy of three 
doses of Cogane
TM
 and placebo when 
administered for 28 weeks to untreated 
patients with early stage Parkinson’s disease. 
Parkinson’s disease is a movement disorder 
characterised by muscle rigidity, tremor 
and a slowing of physical movement 
(bradykinesia) and, in extreme cases, a loss 
of physical movement (akinesia). The primary 
symptoms are the result of altered signalling 
of an area of the brain, the striatum, 
responsible for the control of movement.

ALS P61 Legacy products
Glaucoma
Glaucoma is a multifactoral, progressive 
optic neuropathy that is characterised 
by a loss of retinal ganglion cells (“RGCs”) 
beyond typical age related baseline loss.
Published preclinical studies have shown 
that both BDNF and GDNF can protect 
RGCs both in vitro and in vivo.
Phytopica®
Phytopica® is a natural, three plant 
marketed product for canine skin health 
that provides a novel three in one 
approach to help maintain a normal 
healthy immune system, support normal 
white cell function and provide antioxidant 
benefits. Discussions are ongoing with 
potential partners regarding the future 
commercialisation of Phytopica.
ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, 
is the most prevalent form of motor neurone 
disease which generally strikes people 
between 40 and 60 years of age. It is 
characterised by progressive loss of both 
lower (spinal cord and brain stem) and upper 
(cerebral cortex) motor neurones, which leads 
to severe muscle weakness and wasting, 
followed by paralysis and death, generally 
caused by respiratory failure.
The P61 programme was established by 
Phytopharm to investigate the known 
pharmacological properties of curcumin 
and gingerol. A medicinal chemistry 
programme has produced a series of 
synthetic new chemical entities (“NCEs”) 
with a range of attractive pharmacological 
properties. As with other compounds in 
the Phytopharm portfolio, this series has 
its origins based around compounds 
extracted from a plant source, but is 
now entirely synthetic in nature. 
Hoodia
The CSIR, one of the leading research and 
development, technology and innovation 
institutions in Africa, is now responsible 
for the further development and 
commercialisation of Hoodia for the 
management of obesity. 
Phytopharm will receive a share of future 
commercialisation income.

Chairman’s review
2010 was a year which saw some significant 
changes in Phytopharm’s business and outlook. 
The business is now focused solely on the 
development of its pharmaceutical pipeline. 
In December 2009 the Company completed 
an equity financing of £24.09 million net 
of expenses. This financing will allow the 
Company to make significant progress in 
the development of its product pipeline. 
This was followed by the appointment 
of a new management team headed by 
CEO Tim Sharpington and Research and 
Development Director Roger Hickling. Both 
Tim and Roger bring significant pharmaceutical 
and biotech industry experience. Having taken 
the decision to focus on our pharmaceutical 
products, the Company has curtailed 
expenditure on its functional food products 
and has subsequently restructured the 
business, reducing internal head count and 
costs. Phytopharm now operates as a virtual 
biotech company. With a strong financial 
position and a product pipeline reaching key 
development milestones in the next two years, 
Phytopharm is well placed to deliver value to 
shareholders in the coming period.

Chief Executive’s review
I was delighted to join Phytopharm in July 2010. 
The Company has an exciting product pipeline 
with the potential to make a significant impact 
in the treatment of diseases that presently 
have limited therapeutic options. Since joining 
I have been working with the Board and the 
Phytopharm team to put in place the plans to 
turn that potential into reality. We now have a 
number of programmes underway which will 
deliver key development milestones in the next 
two years. If results from these studies 
continue to be positive, the Company will be in 
a good position to further exploit and increase 
the value of our products in partnership with 
larger pharmaceutical companies and generate 
value for shareholders.
Good progress has been made with our lead 
programme, Cogane™, in Parkinson’s disease. 
In 2009 the Company received data from a 
key non-clinical study which underlined the 
product’s potential and has generated much 
interest and excitement amongst leading 
scientists, neurologists and patient groups in 
the Parkinson’s disease community. If this result 
is replicated in clinical trials, it will provide a 
major breakthrough in the treatment of this 
condition. Since then we have completed 
a Phase I safety study in healthy volunteers 
and patients and have initiated a large, dose 
ranging Phase II study in patients with early 
stage Parkinson’s disease. The study is being 
conducted at leading neurology centres in 
North America and Europe. We are making a 
significant investment into this study to ensure 
that Cogane™ is evaluated against study 
endpoints which fulfil regulatory obligations 
as well as demonstrating medically and 
commercially meaningful results. This study 
will take two years to complete, with results 
due by the end of 2012. If successful, it will 
allow the project to be rapidly progressed 
into registration studies either by 
Phytopharm or in partnership with 
a larger pharmaceutical company.
Cogane™, and its structurally related compound 
Myogane™, have demonstrated neuroprotective 
and neurorestorative properties in a range of 
cell types and industry-standard in vivo models.

Chief Executive’s review continued
This leads us to believe that these compounds 
have potential utility in a number of 
neurodegenerative conditions in addition to 
Parkinson’s disease. We have recently initiated 
studies in glaucoma, a degenerative eye 
condition and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the 
most common form of motor neurone disease. 
Both programmes will evaluate the efficacy 
of our products in key in vivo models of these 
conditions. As both Cogane™ and Myogane™ 
have completed required preclinical safety 
studies and clinical Phase I clinical safety 
studies, rapid progression to clinical Phase II 
efficacy studies in these indications will be 
possible if the preclinical results are positive. 
Neurodegeneration is an attractive target 
for pharmaceutical treatment and many 
approaches to tackling this process, which 
is fundamental to many diseases, are being 
developed, including gene therapy and stem 
cell therapy. The fact that Cogane™ and 
Myogane™ are small molecule therapies, 
suitable for once-daily oral dosing with the 
potential to induce the production of innate 
neurotrophic factors, makes them particularly 
attractive. Small molecule treatments have 
a well described regulatory development 
pathway and are relatively simple to produce 
and administer, producing attractive 
therapeutic and commercial options.
In addition to Cogane™ and Myogane™, we 
have re-activated a programme investigating 
a new class of compounds called P61. These 
early stage compounds have anti-inflammatory, 
anti-remodelling, anti-spasmodic and TRPv-1 
modulating activities. This range of activities 
point to potential utility in a number of 
inflammatory therapeutic categories, including 
respiratory diseases, dermatological conditions, 
gastro-intestinal disorders and pain. We will 
further evaluate these compounds over the 
coming year.
Over the past year we have re-focused 
the business onto the development of our 
pharmaceutical pipeline. Following the receipt 
of the promising results generated from 
Cogane™ and the subsequent fundraising, 
an evaluation of the Group’s assets concluded 
that there was a higher chance of generating 
“ We now have a number of programmes 
underway which will deliver key development 
milestones in the next two years.”
value for shareholders by investing all of our 
resources in our pharmaceutical assets. As a 
result, we have curtailed all expenditure of 
Phytopharm’s functional food products. With 
regard to Hoodia our weight loss food product 
previously licensed to Pfizer Inc and unilever, we 
have entered into a cooperation agreement with 
the CSIR. This is the South African Government 
sponsored body from whom Phytopharm 
originally licensed the patents supporting 
Hoodia development. The CSIR will evaluate 
the data generated by Phytopharm and its 
partners with an aim to further developing 
and commercialising weight loss products 
based on Hoodia. In return for transferring our 
intellectual property and know-how relating to 
Hoodia, Phytopharm will receive a share of any 
future commercial milestones and royalty on 
sales. Our canine atopic dermatitis product, 
Phytopica, has been promoted by Intervet/
Schering Plough Animal Health over the last 
few years. Sales have been disappointing and 
the agreement with Intervet/Schering Plough 
terminated at the end of December 2010. 
We are in discussions with other potential 
commercial partners for this product.

When looking at the wider pharmaceutical 
industry environment we believe that there 
are good prospects if our assets continue to

During the year, the Board was delighted to 
welcome Tim Sharpington as Chief Executive 
Officer and Roger Hickling as Research and 
Development Director. These appointments 
strengthen our ability to drive our research and 
development programmes forward following 
our successful fundraising activities.
We have continued to limit expenditure 
to our two legacy programmes, Hoodia 
and Phytopica®. We have been able to enter 
into a cooperation agreement with the CSIR 
for the future development of the Hoodia 
programme and we are progressing discussions 
on a number of opportunities for Phytopica®. 
Our pipeline has been sourced from our own 
research activities and from licensing activities, 
particularly from leading research institutions 
in China with whom the Company has 
long-standing relationships.
Our objective is to develop products aimed at 
major markets with high unmet medical need 
to key value inflection points before seeking 
late-stage development and commercial 
partners as appropriate. We will consider 
retaining certain rights to products targeting 
orphan indications.
Overview
In December 2009, Phytopharm successfully 
completed a Placing and Open Offer securing 
significant investment of £24.09 million net of 
expenses, providing a robust balance sheet to 
progress our promising pharmaceutical pipeline.
Following the equity fundraising, we have 
progressed our strategy of focusing on our 
pharmaceutical programmes, specifically on the 
development of Cogane™ for Parkinson’s disease. 
During the year, we reported promising results 
with Cogane™ in a preclinical model and in a 
safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic study 
Strategy
Phytopharm is a development stage 
pharmaceutical Company developing novel 
treatments targeting diseases with high levels 
of unmet need. Our lead series of compounds, 
the Sapogenins (including Cogane™ and 
Myogane™), has the potential to be a new class 
of therapy for neurodegenerative diseases 
including Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone 
disease and glaucoma.
Phytopharm’s strategic direction has evolved 
from developing products extracted from 
natural botanical sources to investigating 
single chemical entities. 
Phytopharm operates as a virtual company. 
We utilise a network of scientific and clinical 
experts to help guide our development 
projects with our experienced pharmaceutical 
managers overseeing operations.
Our commercially focused development 
projects have the potential to produce 
significant treatment advances in our target 
areas of neurodegeneration and inflammatory 
disease. Our products are single chemical 
entities with novel mechanisms of action 
protected by strong patent families.

Pharmaceutical programmes
The Sapogenins
Phytopharm’s lead products, Cogane™ and 
Myogane™, are structurally related, small 
molecule, chemical entities and members 
of the Sapogenin class of compounds. They are 
orally bioavailable neurotrophic factor inducers 
that readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Both 
compounds have demonstrated neuroprotective 
effects in a range of preclinical models. 
Specifically, Cogane™ and Myogane™ have been 
shown to induce and modulate the production 
of neurotrophic factors. 
Both compounds have completed long term 
toxicology studies, have been formulated as 
once daily, orally administered therapies and 
have completed Phase I studies demonstrating 
good bioavailability and safety profiles.
Cogane™ is being studied in a Phase II trial of 
early stage Parkinson’s disease and in preclinical 
models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”, 
also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease). It has also 
been evaluated for safety and tolerability in 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
Additionally, Cogane™ and Myogane™ 
are being assessed in preclinical models of 
glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease of the 
eye, and, if results are encouraging, have the 
potential to be progressed rapidly into clinical 
proof of concept studies.
The neuroprotective and neurotrophic actions 
of Cogane™ suggest potential beneficial effects 
in other orphan neurodegenerative diseases.
Neurodegeneration
Neurodegeneration is the umbrella term for 
the progressive loss of structure, function or 
death of neurones. Many neurodegenerative 
diseases including Parkinson’s disease, ALS, 
glaucoma and Alzheimer’s disease occur as 
a result of neurodegenerative processes that 
exhibit many similarities suggesting that these 
diseases are related on a sub-cellular level. 
Because of the similarities in neurodegeneration 
across this range of diseases, there is hope that 
therapeutic advances, such as Cogane™ and 
Myogane™, could be beneficial in more than 
one of these diseases.
Cogane™ in Parkinson’s disease 
Parkinson’s disease is a movement disorder 
characterised by muscle rigidity, tremor and 
a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia) 
and, in extreme cases, a loss of physical 
movement (akinesia). The primary symptoms 
are the result of altered signalling of an area 
of the brain, the striatum, responsible for 
the control of movement. This is caused by 
degeneration of dopaminergic neurones 
between the substantia nigra and the striatum 
parts of the brain, leading to insufficient 
formation and action of dopamine. Parkinson’s 
disease is therefore termed a neurodegenerative 
disease. The disease is slow in onset and the 
appearance of symptoms reflects the gradual 
loss of dopaminergic neurones.
The prevalence of Parkinson’s disease is 
estimated at being 0.3% in the whole 
population in industrialised countries, rising to 
1% in those over 60 years of age and to 4% 
of the population over 80. The market size for 
Parkinson’s disease was $3.2 billion in 2009 and 
is forecast to grow to $4.6 billion by 2012.
_1_PHY_ar10_front_[LP.SH].indd   9 26/01/2011   08:52:42 Phytopharm plc 10 Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Business review continued
We have also shown in preclinical models that 
administration of Cogane™ in conjunction with 
L-dopa (the standard treatment for Parkinson’s 
disease) resulted in improved control of 
symptoms compared to those treated with 
L-dopa alone. These data continue to support 
the development of Cogane™ as an exciting 
new and potentially disease-modifying therapy 
for Parkinson’s disease. 
In addition to its effects in preclinical models 
of Parkinson’s disease, Cogane™ has shown 
efficacy in preclinical models of cognitive 
impairment and so may have utility in treating 
the non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. 
Clinical
Four Phase I studies have evaluated Cogane™ 
in healthy adults and Parkinson’s disease patients 
for up to 28 days. In these studies, daily, oral 
administration of Cogane™ was well tolerated 
with a good overall safety profile. In a recently 
completed Phase Ib safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetic clinical study in both healthy 
volunteers and Parkinson’s disease patients, 
Cogane™ was shown to be safe and generally 
well tolerated over the 28 day study period. 
Pharmaceutical programmes
continued
Mode of action
Glial derived neurotrophic factor (“GDNF”) and 
brain derived neurotrophic factor (“BDNF”) 
have been shown to be effective in re-growing 
damaged nerves. Since they are proteins, they 
cannot be given orally (in tablet or liquid form) 
because they are degraded in the stomach 
and intestine, and also do not readily cross the 
blood-brain barrier. GDNF and BDNF can work 
only when injected into, or when produced 
inside the brain. Direct injection of GDNF into 
the area of the brain involved in Parkinson’s 
disease has shown evidence of being clinically 
effective in restoring the control of movement 
but requires highly complex and difficult 
surgical procedures. Cogane™ has the 
potential to overcome many of the difficulties 
associated with GDNF administration. 
In preclinical models, Cogane™ stimulated the 
release of GDNF and BDNF in the brain and 
increased neurite outgrowth. When administered 
orally in several different preclinical models of 
Parkinson’s disease, Cogane™ reversed the 
decrease of neurotrophic factors and reversed 
the loss of dopaminergic neurones in the 
striatum, the area of the brain most affected 
in Parkinson’s disease. 
Progress to date
We have made significant progress 
demonstrating that, in preclinical models 
of Parkinson’s disease, Cogane™ reverses the 
damage to dopamine-containing neurones 
and elevates GDNF and BDNF in the area 
of the brain involved in Parkinson’s disease. 
In a recently completed preclinical study, 
oral administration of Cogane™ over 18 weeks 
significantly reduced parkinsonian disability 
by 43% in the gold standard preclinical model 
of Parkinson’s disease research (MPTP-induced 
Parkinson’s disease model), which will be 
clinically highly relevant if repeated in 
Parkinson’s disease patients. Encouragingly, 
in this study a statistically significant reduction 
in parkinsonian symptoms was reached after 
nine weeks of administration with Cogane™. 
The magnitude of the effect increased over 
the subsequent nine weeks of administration 
and was still increasing at the end of the study 
(week 18). Data from this study suggests that 
the mechanism underlying these effects 
is considerably more complex than originally 
envisaged. This study was supported by the 
Michael J Fox Foundation and further work 
in this area is ongoing.

Phytopharm plc 11 Annual Report and Accounts 2010
It is estimated that over 30,000 patients 
are diagnosed with ALS in the seven major 
markets. ALS is classified as an orphan 
disease and, as such, offers the potential 
for expedited development.
Progress to date
In preclinical studies, Cogane™ protects spinal 
motor neurones from glutamate-induced 
neuronal damage, increases neurite outgrowth 
and has also been shown to increase lifespan 
and improve muscle strength and coordination 
in several different models of ALS. With the 
support of the Motor Neurone Disease 
Association, a leading uK charity, we are 
undertaking work in additional preclinical 
models of ALS. If positive, these studies will 
facilitate rapid progression to clinical trials.
As noted in the Parkinson’s disease section, 
Cogane™ has been evaluated in a number 
of Phase I studies and shown to be generally 
safe, well tolerated and orally bioavailable.
Glaucoma
Glaucoma is a multifactoral, progressive optic 
neuropathy that is characterised by a loss of 
retinal ganglion cells (“RGCs”) beyond typical 
age related baseline loss.
Importantly at day 28, plasma levels of Cogane™ 
in Parkinson’s disease patients reached levels 
associated with efficacy in the preclinical 
efficacy study. 
Cogane™ is currently being evaluated in a 
400 patient multi-national Phase II, randomised, 
double blind, placebo controlled, dose ranging 
study (CONFIDENT-PD). The study is comparing 
the safety, tolerability and efficacy of three 
doses of Cogane™ and placebo when 
administered for 28 weeks to untreated 
patients with early stage Parkinson’s disease. 
Cogane™ in motor neurone 
disease/ALS 
ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is the 
most prevalent form of motor neurone disease 
which generally strikes people between 40 
and 60 years of age. It is characterised by 
progressive loss of both lower (spinal cord and 
brain stem) and upper (cerebral cortex) motor 
neurones, which leads to severe muscle weakness 
and wasting, followed by paralysis and death, 
generally caused by respiratory failure. There is 
an urgent need for the development of new 
approaches to this devastating condition. 
Glaucoma is the second most common cause 
of worldwide blindness (after cataracts) with 
approximately 60 million sufferers worldwide. 
This figure is expected to rise to 80 million by 2020. 
In the uSA, the prevalence of primary open-angle 
glaucoma, the most common form of glaucoma, 
in people over 40 years of age is 1.86%.
Elevated intraocular pressure (“IOP”) is an 
important risk factor for glaucoma and has 
remained a clinical focus for several years, 
however, 20–30% of patients with glaucoma 
have a normal IOP. Additionally, there are 
people who have raised IOP who do not 
develop glaucoma. Even in patients treated 
with IOP-lowering therapies the annual 
progression rate of the disease is 
~
10%. 
Therefore, drugs that treat the underlying 
neuropathy are needed. 
Published preclinical studies have shown that 
both BDNF and GDNF can protect RGCs both 
in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, co-application 
of BDNF and GDNF provided a better level of 
protection than either factor used individually. 
As Cogane™ and Myogane™ stimulate the 
release of BDNF and GDNF, they are potential 
treatments for glaucoma.

“ Our objective is to develop products aimed at major 
markets with high unmet medical need to key value 
inflection points before seeking late-stage development 
and commercial partners as appropriate.”
Legacy products 
Hoodia programme
The CSIR, one of the leading research and 
development, technology and innovation 
institutions in Africa, is now responsible for the 
further development and commercialisation 
of Hoodia for the management of obesity. 
The CSIR will collaborate with national and 
regional stakeholders, and has the full support 
of the South African San Council for future 
developments. Phytopharm is committed 
to support this development effort through 
the contribution of supporting intellectual 
property and the transfer of technical 
know-how. In return, Phytopharm will receive 
a share of future commercialisation income.
Phytopica®
Phytopica® is a natural, three plant marketed 
product for canine skin health that provides 
a novel three in one approach to help maintain 
a normal healthy immune system, support 
normal white cell function and provide 
antioxidant benefits. Intervet/Schering Plough 
Animal Health will continue to market Phytopica® 
until 31 December 2010. Discussions are ongoing 
with potential partners regarding the future 
commercialisation of Phytopica.
Pharmaceutical programmes
continued
Alzheimer’s disease
Cogane™ and Myogane™ protect cortical 
neurones from glutamate and ß-amyloid 
induced neuronal damage and increase neurite 
outgrowth in vitro. Cogane™ and Myogane™ 
also increase the density of muscarinic 
receptors both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, 
Cogane™ and Myogane™ improve cognition 
in the aged rat and ß-amyloid/ibotenic acid 
rat model of Alzheimer’s disease.
The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics 
of orally administered Cogane™ in patients 
with Alzheimer’s disease has previously been 
assessed in a twelve week study. Cogane™ was 
generally well tolerated in this patient group. 
Further work may be undertaken in this area 
if additional resources become available.
P61 Programme
The P61 programme was established by 
Phytopharm to investigate the known 
pharmacological properties of curcumin and 
gingerol. A medicinal chemistry programme 
has produced a series of synthetic new 
chemical entities (“NCEs”) with a range 
of attractive pharmacological properties. 
As with other compounds in the Phytopharm 
portfolio, this series has its origins based 
around compounds extracted from a plant 
source, but is now entirely synthetic in nature. 
The chemical series contains molecules which 
exhibit the following activities:
Ì Anti-inflammatory 
Ì Anti-spasmodic
Ì Anti-remodelling 
Ì TRPv1 modulatory activity
These activities have potential utility in a 
number of inflammatory indications including 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, 
atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, gastrointestinal 
inflammatory conditions and pain.
We are conducting preclinical studies on 
this series of compounds with a view to 
establishing one or more compounds for 
progression into development.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Phytopharm plc 13 Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Building shareholder value
The fundraising in December 2009 has provided the resources to progress 
the development of our pharmaceutical programmes.
Financial review
Income statement
The revenue from continuing operations for 
the year of £0.70 million (2009: £0.87 million) 
was principally generated from our residual 
functional food programmes.
under certain collaboration agreements, 
funding was provided for development 
activities and certain of our employees. 
The majority of these activities are now 
completed resulting in revenue for the year 
of £0.51 million (2009: £0.57 million).
Sales of Phytopica® continue to be disappointing 
and during the year we agreed with Intervet/
Schering Plough to terminate our agreement 
for the product and we are exploring further 
opportunities for the product. Revenue from 
Intervet/Schering Plough during the year 
amounted to £0.06 million. Sales of Phytopica® 
during the year amounted to £0.01 million 
(2009: £0.14 million). 
We continued to reduce our inventory of raw 
materials during the year realising revenue 
of £0.12 million (2009: £0.16 million). 
Other income during the year represents 
funding from the Michael J Fox Foundation 
for preclinical development work on Cogane™ 
completed during the year.
The financial performance for the year ended 
30 September 2010 reflects the Group’s 
ongoing pharmaceutical development and 
residual functional food activities.
Cash flow
The Company ended the year with £23.61 million 
of cash and money market investments. The 
£24.09 million (net of expenses) fundraising 
approved by shareholders in December 2009 
strengthened our balance sheet significantly 
and has provided the resources to progress the 
development of our pharmaceutical programmes.
The net cash used in operating activities 
for the year ended 30 September 2010 was 
£4.44 million, an increase from £3.40 million 
in the prior year, reflecting the Group’s 
continuing focus on the development of its 
lead programme, Cogane™, in Parkinson’s 
disease. The Group’s focus remains on building 
shareholder value by effective progression 
of its innovative pharmaceutical programmes. 
We expect our net cash outflow to increase 
in 2011 to continue the development of our 
pharmaceutical programmes, primarily 
Cogane™ in a Phase II proof of concept and 
dose range finding clinical study. We also 
intend to maintain our strong links with disease 
specific charities which may result in additional 
charitable funding being available.
Cost of sales for the year amounted to 
£0.09 million (2009: £0.19 million) and 
comprised the costs of the inventories sold 
during the period, the costs of the raw 
materials and the manufacture of Phytopica®.
Research and development costs for the 
year amounted to £4.01 million compared to 
£3.91 million in the previous year reflecting the 
focus on progressing Cogane™ into the next 
stage of development following the successful 
fundraising during the year. 
Our administrative costs before exceptional 
items remained constant at £1.12 million for 
the year (2009: £1.12 million). Administrative 
costs for the year were also £1.12 million 
(2009: £1.39 million). Exceptional costs of 
£0.41 million were recognised in the year ended 
30 September 2009 in respect of former 
executive directors and restructuring costs.
Our overall operating loss before tax was 
£4.50 million compared to £4.38 million 
for the previous year.
Our interest received increased to £0.29 million 
compared to £0.18 million for the year ended 
30 September 2009 due to increased cash 
balances following the fundraising activities 
during the year. 
_1_PHY_ar10_front_[LP.SH].indd   13 26/01/2011   08:52:43 Phytopharm plc 14 Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Financial review continued
Income statement continued
The tax credit of £0.41 million (2009: £0.29 million) 
represents amounts that are expected to be 
received under current legislation on research 
and development tax credits. The increase for 
the year is due to increased expenditure on the 
unfunded development activities primarily 
in relation to the Cogane™ programme. 
Balance sheet
Non-current assets representing property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets decreased 
from £0.20 million at 30 September 2009 to 
£0.11 million at 30 September 2010. Property, 
plant and equipment amounted to £0.11 million 
at 30 September 2010 (2009: £0.10 million).
Intangible assets represent patent and 
know-how licences acquired externally that 
have been recognised as an asset at cost. 
At each balance sheet date we review the 
carrying amount of our intangible assets to 
determine whether there are any indications 
that these assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. Following a review at 31 March 2010, 
an impairment charge of £0.10 million was 
recorded to write down to £nil the carrying 
value of the intangible assets (2009: £0.10 million). 
These assets were fully impaired as a result 
of our strategic focus on specific chemical 
entities as pharmaceutical products.
Current assets comprise inventories, trade 
and other receivables, tax receivable, money 
market investments and cash and cash 
equivalents which increased from £4.68 million 
at 30 September 2009 to £24.50 million at 
30 September 2010.
Money market investments together with cash 
and cash equivalents at 30 September 2010 
increased by £19.70 million due to the equity 
fundraising completed during the year offset 
by cash outflows from operating and investing 
activities. Money market investments represent 
fixed-rate, short-term deposits placed with a 
range of banks at fixed terms with a maturity 
date of more than three months. Cash and 
cash equivalents are invested for a period 
of 90 days or less. 
During the year we have completed the sale 
of all our existing inventory of raw materials. 
In addition, we have written off our inventory 
of work in progress to the value of £0.13 million 
(2009: £nil) resulting in a carrying value of £nil 
(2009: £0.13 million), due to the disappointing 
sales of Phytopica® and the termination of our 
agreement with Intervet/Schering Plough. 
Current tax receivable has increased from 
£0.29 million at 30 September 2009 to 
£0.41 million at 30 September 2010 due 
to increased expenditure on our qualifying 
pharmaceutical programmes.
Current liabilities decreased to £1.13 million 
at 30 September 2010 (2009: £1.75 million) 
principally due to the recognition as revenue 
of previously deferred revenue during the year.
The increase in ordinary shares and share 
premium reflects the equity fundraising 
completed in December 2009.
“ The financial performance for the year ended 
30 September 2010 reflects the Group’s ongoing 
pharmaceutical development and residual functional 
food activities.”

Directors’ report
for the year ended 30 september 2010

t he Directors of Phytopharm plc (“Phytopharm”) (registered in england and w ales: 03131723) present their report together with the financial 
statements and auditors’ report for the year ended 30 september 2010.
t he Corporate Governance statement (on pages 29 to 33) forms part of the Directors’ Report.
Principal activities
Phytopharm is a development stage pharmaceutical company developing novel treatments targeting diseases with high levels of unmet need.
Review of the business and future developments
t he Group is required to set out in this Directors’ Report a fair review of the business of the Group and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group (known as a “Business Review”). t he Business Review is required to set out a balanced and comprehensive analysis 
of the development and performance of the Group’s business during the year ended 30 september 2010 and of the position of the Group at the 
end of that financial year. t he information that fulfils the requirements of the Business Review, in addition to that set out below, can be found on 
pages 8 to 12.
t he Directors are satisfied with the progress made across the product portfolio and with the year end position.
Key performance indicators
t he principal key performance indicators (“KPi’s”) of the Group are the progress of the Group’s development programmes through preclinical and 
clinical development, in particular its lead programme Cogane™, whilst tightly controlling its cost base. w hile these KPi’s demonstrate relevant 
factors by reference to which the development, performance and position of the Group can be measured effectively, it is the nature of Phytopharm’s 
business and the biopharmaceutical industry in general, that these KPi’s are not readily or meaningfully comparable on a year-on-year basis.
Principal risks and uncertainties
t he nature of pharmaceutical development is such that there are significant inherent risks due to the long and complex development process. 
Below are those principal risks and uncertainties that the Board considers could have a material impact on the Group’s operational results, financial 
condition and prospects. t hese risks are not in any particular order of priority and there may be other risks that are either currently unknown or 
not considered material which could have a similar impact on the Group’s business in the future.
t he Board reviews each area of the business at least annually to identify material risks and the controls in place to manage these risks. t his comprehensive 
review is undertaken as part of the review of internal controls as set out on page 32.
industry risk
in common with other research and development stage businesses, Phytopharm’s business risks relate principally to the success of its development 
programmes and to the need to fund its operations through these. t he progress of the development programmes therefore represents the best 
indicator of the Group’s performance and a full review of the programmes is given in the Business Review on pages 8 to 12. 
Financial risk
t he Group expects to continue to make losses until it is able to increase its revenues sufficiently. Additional funds such as charitable income, 
collaboration deals and/or further financing may be required to allow further scope for product development. t he availability and timing of such 
additional external funds represent a material uncertainty, although the Group currently has sufficient funds to finance its operational activities for 
at least the next twelve months.
Clinical and regulatory risk
successful commercialisation of the Group’s products is likely to depend on successful progress through clinical studies and registration. 
Development of product candidates involves a lengthy and complex process, and products may not meet the necessary requirements in terms 
of toxicity, efficacy or safety, or the relevant regulators may not agree with the results of the Group’s research and may require further testing 
or withhold approval altogether.

Directors’ report continued
for the year ended 30 september 2010
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Competition risk
t he Group’s success depends on acceptance of the Group’s products by the markets, including physicians and third party payers, and consequently 
the Group’s progress may be adversely affected if it is unable to achieve market acceptance of its products. Factors which may affect the rate and 
level of market acceptance of any of the Group’s products include the existence or entry on to the market of superior competing products or 
therapies and the price of the Group’s products compared to competing products.
intellectual property risk
t he Group’s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain protection for its intellectual and proprietary information, so that it can 
stop others from making, using or selling its inventions or proprietary rights. t he Group’s patent applications may not be granted and its existing 
patent rights may be successfully challenged and revoked.
Counterparty risk
t he Group relies on third party organisations to conduct its clinical trials and to manufacture its products. if the relationship with, or performance 
of, any of these partners is adversely affected, the Group’s results or operations may be adversely impacted.
t he Group also derives revenue or financial support from its collaborators and expects to derive additional support from partnering with certain 
charitable organisations. if these relationships are adversely affected, or if the products involved fail to continue to make satisfactory progress, 
the Group’s results or operations may be adversely impacted.
Post balance sheet events
see note 26.
Results and dividends
t he Group’s results for the year ended 30 september 2010 are presented on page 37. t he Group’s net loss after taxation was £3,801,514 
(2009: £3,910,688). t he Group is not yet in a position to pay a dividend and the loss for the year has been added to the accumulated losses 
in reserves.
Research and development activities
t he Group continues to develop pharmaceutical products, as described in the Business Review.

Regulations). t he report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information 
Remuneration Committee
t he Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is comprised exclusively of independent non-executive Directors. t he Directors who have 
served on the Remuneration Committee during the year are as follows:
Dr P R Blower (Chairman)  
mr A H taylor 
mr A D morrison temporarily stepped down as a member of the Remuneration Committee on 14 november 2008 whilst Acting Chief executive 
Officer and returned to serve as a member of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 6 July 2010.
t he Remuneration Committee decides the remuneration policy that applies to executive Directors and all of the Group’s employees including 
other senior management. t his comprises the setting of salaries for the executive Directors, the setting of salary scales for other employees, 
approving the format and range of all performance related arrangements (both annual and long term equity incentive arrangements) and 
determining the extent to which the elements of variable pay vest. in determining remuneration, consideration will be given to reward levels 
throughout the organisation as well as in the external employment market. t he Remuneration Committee aims to reward all employees fairly 
based on their role, their performance and salary levels in the wider market.
t he executive Directors are invited to attend the Remuneration Committee meetings to make recommendations on compensation levels for employees.
During the year ended 30 september 2010, the Remuneration Committee met four times and there was full attendance at each meeting. 
Remuneration of non-executive Directors
t he non-executive Directors each receive a fee for their services, which is agreed by the Board following recommendation by the Committee 
in respect of the Chairman and by the Chairman in respect of the other non-executive Directors with the assistance of independent information 
regarding the level of fees within the sector, where necessary, concerning comparable organisations and appointments.
neither the Chairman nor the other non-executive Directors receive any pension or other benefits from the Group.
Remuneration policy for executive Directors
t he Group’s remuneration policy for executive Directors is to:
Ì  have regard to the Directors’ experience and the nature and complexity of their work, and regard to Directors’ remuneration in comparable 
companies, in order to pay a competitive salary, including a performance related cash bonus that attracts and retains management of the 
highest quality; 
Ì  link individual remuneration packages to the Group’s long-term performance through the award of share options via the Phytopharm share 
Option Plan 2007 and the Phytopharm l ong term incentive Plan 2007; and
Ì provide post retirement benefits through the Group’s pension schemes.
Consistent with the above policy, compensation awarded to executive Directors comprises four main performance and non-performance related elements:
Ì basic salary and bonuses;
Ì benefits;
Ì share options and performance share awards (awarded by reference to annual performance); and
Ì pension arrangements.

Remuneration policy for executive Directors continued
During the year under review mr A D morrison continued as Acting Chief executive Officer until 6 July 2010 and his remuneration during this period 
comprised a basic salary payable according to the number of days he had been acting in his capacity as Acting Chief executive Officer.
Basic salary
t he Committee sets the annual salaries for executive Directors, having regard to personal performance and responsibilities of each Director and 
their expected future contribution. 
Performance related bonuses
t he Group may make bonus payments depending upon the overall performance of the Company. 
incentive schemes
t he Group operates incentive schemes to assist in attracting and retaining high calibre employees and to focus the performance of key 
management on creating long-term shareholder value. t he awards to individuals are linked to the performance targets of the Group and the 
individual. t he Group’s targets and those for executive Directors are approved by the Board.
share option schemes
t he total number of unissued Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company which may be placed under option on any day under the Phytopharm 
share option schemes may not exceed, when added to the aggregate number of shares that have been or may be issued pursuant to rights granted 
for the past ten years, 10 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company immediately prior to that day.
share options are granted under the Phytopharm share Option Plan 2007 and the Phytopharm save As You earn Plan 2007, which are open to all 
employees. t he Phytopharm share Option Plan 2007 complies with the tax favoured enterprise management incentive l egislation. w here possible 
the Company will grant tax advantaged options. t he Remuneration Committee determines the level of awards. to provide maximum flexibility, the 
Committee has discretion to make awards up to an annual 400% of salary individual limit although the Committee would only envisage making an 
award at such a level in very exceptional circumstances. Performance share awards will normally vest three years after the date of grant subject to 
continued employment and the extent to which a performance target has been satisfied. 
t he vesting of a share option under the above schemes will depend on total shareholder return (“t sR”) performance conditions being met. 
t he Company’s ts R will be compared to that of the companies making up the Ft se smallCap index at or within three months of the vesting date. 
no option or award can be exercised for below median performance.
t he Committee considers ts R to be the most appropriate method of measuring performance at this stage of the Group’s development where 
income streams have not stabilised and the Group has not yet made a profit. t he Committee seeks independent verification of the ts R conditions 
before confirming that a share option has vested.
t he Phytopharm save As You earn Plan 2007 is an HmRC approved scheme and the first offer was made to employees and executive Directors on 
13 August 2007 and vests on 30 september 2010. Details of the executive Directors’ interests in this plan are specified in the table on page 28.
During 2010, shareholders approved the 2010 Directors’ Reward Plan to enable the Group to recognise the input of the non-executive Directors 
to the success of the Group in the previous twelve months. Options granted under the plan will vest at the end of three years and no performance 
conditions will apply. As a condition of exercise, Directors will be required to enter into an agreement under which they agree not to dispose of 
any shares acquired on exercise for a period of at least one year from the date of exercise.
l ong-term incentives
t he Group operates the Phytopharm l ong term incentive Plan 2007 under which performance share awards can be made to selected senior 
managers of the Group and its subsidiaries. t he Committee determines the level of awards to provide maximum flexibility. t he Committee has 
discretion to make awards up to an annual 400% of salary individual limit although the Committee would only envisage making an award at such 
a level in very exceptional circumstances. Performance share awards will normally vest three years after the date of grant subject to continued 
employment and the extent to which a performance target has been satisfied. 
t he Committee’s policy is that the same ts R performance condition as described above for share options will apply to the vesting of performance 
share awards. t his is for the same reasons as given above. t he relevant distinction is that the grant of share options depends on annual performance 
whereas it is envisaged that performance share awards will be granted each period in order to ensure that there is a continual and material long 
term incentive element to the executive Directors’ remuneration packages.

share purchase scheme
t he Group also operates an HmRC approved share incentive Plan which is open to all employees who may purchase Partnership shares up to the 
value of £125 each month and are awarded one matching share for each Partnership share purchased. t he shares are held in trust for a minimum 
of three years and are not subject to performance criteria. Details of the executive Directors’ interests in this plan are specified in the table on page 28.
Pensions
t he executive Directors have money purchase pension schemes to which the Group contributed 12.5% of basic salary.
Fees retained for non-executive directorships in other companies
t he Committee recognises that executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships and that these can broaden the 
experience and knowledge of the Director, from which the Group would benefit. Accordingly, subject to Board approval, they may accept 
non-executive appointments, as long as they are not likely to lead to a conflict of interest. t hey are also allowed to retain any fees paid under such 
appointments. mr t sharpington serves as a non-executive director of Clinical Force l imited for which he does not receive a fee.
Performance graph
t he following shows the Company’s performance, measured by ts R compared with the performance of the Ft se smallCap index also measured 
by ts R. ts R looks at the value at 30 september 2010 of £100 invested in the Company on 1 september 2005 compared with the value of £100 
invested in the Ft se smallCap index over the same period. t his index has been selected for this comparison because, in the opinion of the 
Directors, it is the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of the Company should be measured.
t he graph looks at the value, by 30 september 2010, of £100 invested in Phytopharm on 31 August 2005 compared with the value of £100 invested 
in the Ft se smallCap index. t he other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends.
executive Directors’ contracts
it is the Group’s policy that executive Directors have contracts with an indefinite term but which provide for a maximum period of six months’ notice 
to be served by the Company or by the Director. 
t he appointment of mr A D morrison as Acting Chief executive Officer was made on 14 november 2008. t his appointment was made on a consultancy 
basis and provides for a maximum of one month’s notice to be served by the Company or by mr A D morrison. Following the appointment of the 
Chief executive Officer, mr A D morrison has returned to his position as non-executive Director.

Code. A copy of the uK Corporate Governance Code is available at the FRC’s website: www.frc.org.
t he principles set out in the uK Corporate Governance Code cover four areas: the Board, Directors’ remuneration, accountability and audit 
and relations with shareholders. w ith the exception of Directors’ remuneration (which is dealt with separately in the Remuneration Report) the 
following section sets out how the Board has applied such principles.
Board 
t he Board is chaired by mr A H taylor and met for regular business seven times during the year under review. All meetings were attended by 
all the Directors appointed at the time of the meeting. in addition, further meetings are held when circumstances and urgent business dictate.
t he Board has agreed a schedule of items that are specifically reserved for its consideration, which is reviewed on an annual basis. t his schedule 
includes business strategy, financing arrangements, material acquisitions and divestments, approval of budgets, major capital expenditure projects, 
risk management, treasury policies, and establishing and monitoring internal controls. t he Board is responsible for the overall direction and strategy 
of the Group and for securing the optimum performance from Group assets. At each meeting, the Board reviews strategy and progress of the 
Group towards its objectives, particularly in respect of research and development projects, and monitors financial progress against budget.
t he Group’s policy is that the Board of Directors would normally consist of two executive and three independent non-executive Directors. 
Dr P R Blower is the senior non-executive Director. At the 2010 AGm shareholders approved the 2010 Directors’ Reward Plan together with the 
grant of share options to mr A H taylor, mr A D morrison and Dr P R Blower. t he grant of options to the non-executive Directors of the Company 
reflected their input to the success of the Company during 2009 and the Board considers that due to the one off nature of the option grant 
together with no performance conditions being attached to the options, there is no impact on the independence of the non-executive Directors.  
t he value of the options granted was equal to their 2010 annual Director’s fee.
Biographies of the Directors are set out on page 16. Details of the Directors’ shareholdings are shown on page 26.
All Directors are required to retire and submit themselves for re-election at the first AGm after appointment and, thereafter, at least every three 
years. subject to their re-election and Companies Act provisions, the non-executive Directors are appointed for specified terms. see page 26.
t here is clear separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief executive Officer on terms which have been agreed and set out in writing by the 
Board and which are reviewed on an annual basis. t he Chairman is responsible for overseeing the running of the Board, encouraging all Directors 
to participate fully in discussions with the aim of reaching a consensus and ensuring that the non-executive Directors are properly briefed on 
matters. t he Chief executive Officer has responsibility for implementing the Board’s strategy and managing day to day business activities of the 
Group with the executive Directors and senior managers. t he Company secretary, through the Chairman, is responsible for advising the Board 
on all governance matters.
t he Board has agreed procedures to allow individual Directors to seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense for the 
furtherance of their duties and all Directors have access to the services of the Company secretary. t he Company secretary is accountable to the 
Board through the Chairman on governance matters. it is the responsibility of the Company secretary to ensure that Board procedures are followed 
and all rules and regulations are complied with. newly appointed Directors receive a comprehensive, formal and tailored introduction to the Group’s 
business as well as information on their responsibilities and roles as a Director of the Company.

t he Remuneration Committee met four times during the year under review. All meetings were attended by all members. During the year ended

t he Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and reviews its effectiveness at least annually and the 
Board confirms that this process has been in place up to the date of the approval of the financial statements. However, the Board acknowledges 
that such a system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, as it is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.

internal Control Guidance for Directors on the uK Corporate Governance Code (turnbull Guidance 2005) issued by the Financial Reporting Council.

Committee given the size of the Group. t he executive Directors’ active involvement in the activities of the Group allows the Board to continually 
monitor and assess significant business, operational, financial, compliance and other risks and to review the effectiveness of internal control. t he 
executive Directors provide regular management reports covering inter alia research and development activities, shareholder relations, financial 
management and commercial activities.
t he Group’s key internal control procedures include the following:

clear lines of reporting and responsibility. Regular research and development programme reviews are held to review progress against plans for each 
programme. t he information from these meetings is reported on a regular basis to a management group comprising the executive Directors and 
key senior managers to compare progress against plans for the business as a whole. Overall control of the business rests with the Board of Directors.
Risk identification and evaluation
Regular assessments of ongoing risks facing the business are undertaken as part of the operational reviews and regular management group 
meetings in the key areas such as management of working capital, compliance, legal and operational issues.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 30 september 2010
1 Accounting policies and basis of preparation
Phytopharm plc is a public limited company incorporated in england and w ales and domiciled in the uK with a listing on the l ondon stock 
exchange. t he address of its registered office is l akeview House, 2 l akeview Court, ermine Business Park, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire Pe29 6uA.
t he principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. t hese policies have been consistently 
applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
Basis of preparation
t hese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international Financial Reporting standards (“iFRss”) as adopted by the eu, 
iFRiC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under iFRs. t he financial statements have 
been prepared on a historical cost basis.
Going concern
At 30 september 2010, the Group had cash resources (being cash and cash equivalents and money market investments) of £23,608,171.
After making enquiries and taking into account management’s estimate of future expenditure, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will have adequate financial resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
Basis of consolidation
t he acquisition by the Company’s subsidiary, Phytotech l imited (formerly Phytopharm l imited), of Phytodevelopments l imited on 21 march 1996 
has been accounted for as a merger in the consolidated financial statements and all transactions between the two companies have been eliminated.
On 3 April 1996 the Group structure was reorganised and a new holding company established by way of a share exchange. t his has been 
accounted for as a merger in the consolidated accounts, and all transactions within the Group have been eliminated.
t here has been no change to the basis set out as a result of the implementation of iFRs, as permitted by iFRs1, ‘First time adoption of international 
Financial Reporting standards’.
Accounting developments
a) t he following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 October 2009.
iFRs 8, ‘Operating segments’ (effective 1 January 2009). iFRs 8 replaces iAs 14, ‘segment reporting’. it requires a ‘management approach’ under 
which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. management considers that there is only 
one reportable segment: research and development programmes, including pharmaceutical products and residual functional foods.
iAs 1 (revised), ‘Presentation of financial statements’ (effective 1 January 2009). t he revised standard prohibits the presentation of items of income 
and expenses (that is ‘non-owner changes in equity’) in the statement of changes in equity, requiring ‘non-owner changes in equity’ to be 
presented separately from owner changes in equity. All ‘non-owner changes in equity’ are required to be shown in a performance statement. 
entities can choose whether to present one performance statement (the statement of comprehensive income) or two statements (the income 
statement and statement of comprehensive income). t he Group has presented a statement of comprehensive income prepared under the revised 
disclosure requirements. 
iFRs 2 (amendment), ‘share-based payment’ (effective 1 January 2009). t he revised standard deals with vesting conditions and cancellations. 
it clarifies that vesting conditions are either service or performance conditions only. Other features of a share-based payment would need to be 
included in the grant date fair value calculation for transactions with employees and others providing similar services; they would not impact the 
number of awards expected to vest or valuation thereof subsequent to grant date. Prior to the adoption of the amendment to iFRs 2, any 
cancellations made by employees under the Group’s save As You earn Plan resulted in the reversal of all charges to date. t he amendment requires 
that cancellations are treated as accelerated vestings and all remaining charges are immediately recognised in the income statement with the 
credit recognised in equity. t here have been no cancellations of options under the save As You earn Plan and therefore there is currently no 
impact of the amendment to this standard.

iFRs 7 (amendment), ‘Financial instruments – Disclosures’ (effective 1 January 2009). t he amendment increases the disclosure requirements about 
fair value measurement and reinforces existing principles for disclosure about liquidity risk. t he amendment introduces a three-level hierarchy for 
fair value measurement disclosure and requires some specific quantitative disclosures for financial instruments in the lowest level in the hierarchy. 
in addition, the amendment clarifies and enhances existing requirements for the disclosure of liquidity risk primarily requiring a separate liquidity 
risk analysis for derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities. see note 22 for further details.
t he amendment has not had a significant impact on the disclosures about fair value measurement as the Group does not have any derivative 
financial instruments.
iAs 23 (revised), ‘Borrowing costs’ (effective 1 January 2009). A result of the joint short-term convergence project with the FAsB, this new standard 
requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of 
the cost of that asset. t he option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs has been removed. t his is currently not relevant to the Group.
iFRs 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’ (effective 1 July 2009). t he revision to this standard changes accounting for business combinations. w hile 
the acquisition method is still applied, there are significant changes to the treatment of contingent payments, transaction costs and the 
calculation of goodwill. t his is currently not relevant to the Group.
iAs 27 (revised), ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’ (effective 1 July 2009). t his revises the accounting for transactions with 
non-controlling interests. t his is not relevant to the Group as it does not have any non-controlling interests.
Amendment to iFRs 1, ‘First time adoption of iFRs’ and iAs 27, ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’ (effective 1 July 2009). t his allows 
first-time adopters to use a deemed cost of either fair value or the carrying amount under previous accounting practice to measure the initial cost 
of investment in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates in the separate financial statements. t he amendment also removed the 
definition of the cost method from iAs 27 and replaced it with a requirement to present dividends as income in the separate financial statements 
of the investor. t his is currently not relevant to the Group.
Amendment to iAs 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’, and iAs 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’ (effective 1 January 2009). t his 
amendment requires entities to classify the following types of financial instruments as equity, provided they have particular features and meet 
specific conditions:
Ì Puttable financial instruments; and
Ì  instruments, or components of instruments, that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net 
assets of the entity only on liquidation. 
t his is not relevant to the Group.
iAs 39 (amendment), ‘Financial instruments; Recognition and measurement on eligible hedged items’ (effective 1 July 2009). t he amendment 
makes two significant changes. it prohibits designating inflation as a hedgable component of a fixed rate debt. it also prohibits including time 
value in the one-sided hedged risk when designating options as hedges. t his does not currently impact the Group. 
iFRiC 15, ‘Agreements for construction of real estates’ (effective 1 January 2009 but eu-endorsed from 1 January 2010). t he interpretation clarifies 
which standard (iAs 18 or iAs 11) should be applied to particular transactions and is likely to mean that iAs 18 will be applied to a wider range of 
transactions. t his is currently not relevant to the Group.

iFRiC 16, ‘Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation’ (effective 1 October 2008 but eu-endorsed for use from 1 July 2009). t his 
interpretation clarifies certain areas in respect of net investment hedging. t his is currently not relevant to the Group.
iFRiC 17, ‘Distributions of non-cash assets to owners’ (effective 1 July 2009). t his interpretation clarifies how an entity should measure distributions 
of assets, other than cash, when it pays dividends to its owners. t he interpretation states that; 1) a dividend payable should be recognised when 
appropriately authorised; 2) it should be measured at the fair value of the net assets to be distributed; and 3) the difference between the fair value of 
the dividend paid and the carrying amount of the net assets distributed should be recognised in profit or loss. t his is currently not relevant to the Group.
(b) Forthcoming accounting standards
t he following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 October 2010:
iFRiC 18, ‘transfer of assets from customers’ (effective 1 July 2009 but eu-endorsed for use from 31 October 2009);
Annual improvements 2009 (effective 1 January 2010);
Amendment to iFRs 1, ‘First time adoption’ on additional exemptions (effective 1 January 2010);
Amendment to iFRs 2, ‘share-based payments’ on group cash-settled transactions (effective 1 January 2010);
Amendment to iAs 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’ on classification of rights issues (effective 1 February 2010);
Amendment to iFRs 1, ‘First time adoption’ on ‘Financial instrument disclosures’ (effective 1 July 2010);
iFRiC 19, ‘extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments’ (effective 1 July 2010);
Amendment to iAs 24, ‘Related party disclosures’ (effective 1 January 2011);
Annual improvements 2010 (effective 1 January 2011, although not yet eu-endorsed);
Amendment to iFRiC 14, ‘Prepayments of minimum funding requirement’ (effective 1 January 2011);
Amendments to iFRs 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’ on derecognition (effective 1 July 2011, although not yet eu-endorsed); and
iFRs 9, ‘Financial instruments’ on ‘classification and measurement’ (effective 1 January 2013, although not yet eu-endorsed).
t he Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group when 
they come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 October 2010.
Critical accounting judgements
t he preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. t he main accounting judgements relate to the 
determination of the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries and the share option charge and the underlying assumptions. t he Directors have 
assessed the carrying value of the investments and the inputs to the share option charge calculation and there is not considered to be a 
reasonable change to a metric that would result in a material adjustment to the carrying value of the investments or the share option charge.
t he estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under 
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. t he estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, 
or in the year of revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.

Revenue
Revenue, which excludes value added tax, represents the invoiced value of goods and services supplied, net of certain promotional activity. 
Revenue from sales of products is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer and is stated net of value added tax.
Amounts received or receivable in respect of research and development contracts, collaborative research agreements, licence fees or milestone 
payments are recognised as revenue when the licence rights are granted or the specific conditions stipulated in the agreements have been 
satisfied and provided that there are no future obligations. t hese amounts are shown gross of any withholding tax. 
Other income
Other income, which excludes value added tax, represents amounts received or receivable from charitable organisations.
Cost of sales and operating expenses
Cost of sales comprises the proportion of milestone and royalty income earned by the Group and due to third parties under licence agreements 
and the direct cost of goods sold, including distribution costs. 
Research and development expenditure
All research and development costs, whether funded by third parties under licence and development agreements or not, are included within 
operating expenses and classified as research and development costs.
All on-going development expenditure is currently expensed in the year in which it is incurred. Due to the regulatory and other uncertainties 
inherent in the development of the Group’s products, the criteria for development costs to be recognised as an asset, as prescribed by iAs 38 
‘intangible assets’, are not met until the product has been submitted for regulatory approval, such approval has been received, and it is probable 
that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. t he Group does not currently have any such internal development costs that qualify for 
capitalisation as intangible assets.
exceptional items
exceptional items represent significant items of income or expense which due to their nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise 
to them, are presented separately on the face of the income statement to give a better understanding to shareholders of the elements of financial 
performance during the year. t his disclosure will facilitate comparison with prior years and enable the reader to better assess trends in financial performance.
share-based payments
t he Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to its employees and Directors. equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant and are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award. At each balance sheet date, the Group 
revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. t he share-based payment charge/(credit) is allocated to 
research and development expenses and administrative expenses on the basis of staff numbers, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
employee benefits
All employee benefit costs, notably holiday pay and contributions to Group or personal defined contribution plans, are charged to the income 
statement on an accruals basis. t he Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. t he assets of this scheme are held separately from 
those of the Group in independently administered funds. t he Group does not offer any other post retirement benefits.
Operating leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation. t he cost of property, plant and equipment is its 
purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property, plant and 
equipment, less its estimated residual value, on a straight line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
t he principal rates used for this purpose are:
Plant and machinery 20% 
Computer equipment 33% 
Fixtures and fittings 20% 
motor vehicles 25%
l easehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the asset’s useful economic life. 
t he assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if necessary at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within the operating loss.
intangible assets
intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amount of 
its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss.
impairment of assets
non-current assets are reviewed for impairment both annually and when there is an indication that an asset may be impaired (when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable). An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the 
amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. t he recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost 
to sell and value in use.
investments in subsidiary
investments in subsidiary undertakings are carried at cost less any impairment provision. such investments are subject to an annual review, and 
any impairment is charged to the income statement. t he fair value of the options granted after 7 november 2002 by Phytopharm plc to the 
employees of Phytotech l imited which had not vested by 1 september 2005 is also included in the value of the investment.
inventory
inventory, including raw materials, work in progress and finished goods is stated on a first in first out basis at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost represents direct materials and, where applicable, production overheads. w here necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving 
or defective inventory.
trade and other receivables
trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are initially stated at their fair value, as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
money market investments
money market investments have fixed maturities that the Group’s management has the positive intention to hold to maturity. t hese investments 
include short-term investments with an original maturity date of more than three months.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, bank deposits repayable on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities at inception of 90 days or less.

Foreign currency translation
items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). t he consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling (“£”), which is the 
Company’s functional and presentation currency.
transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling, being the functional currency of the Group, at actual rates of exchange 
ruling at the date of transaction. monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange 
ruling at the end of the financial year. All foreign currency exchange differences are taken to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
Current tax
Current tax represents uK tax recoverable and is provided at amounts expected to be recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with iAs 12, ‘income taxes’. Deferred tax is not accounted for 
if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available 
in future years to utilise the temporary difference.
trade and other payables

Ordinary shares and share premium
equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Deferred taxation
t he Group and Company have the potential deferred tax assets shown below, which are not recognised due to uncertainty as to the timing of their utilisation.

A number of changes to the uK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget statement. t he Finance Bill 2010–2011 (enacted 
in July 2010) includes legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
Consequently, potential deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences expected to reverse prior to 1 April 2011 have been measured at 
28% and potential deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences expected to reverse after 1 April 2011 have been measured at the tax 
rate of 27%, as this is the tax rate that will apply on reversal.
22 Financial instruments
t he Group’s financial instruments comprise primarily cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables, 
which arise directly from its operations. t he Group does not enter into derivative transactions.
t he Group’s ongoing objectives in using financial instruments are to maximise the returns on funds held on deposit, while investing only with 
institutions with high credit ratings, to minimise exchange rate risk where appropriate, and to generate additional cash resources through the 
issue of shares when market conditions are appropriate. in addition, the Group has from time to time conserved cash resources by entering into 
financing arrangements for the acquisition of major capital assets. 
t he balance sheet positions at 30 september 2010 and 30 september 2009 are not representative of the positions throughout the years as cash 
and short-term investments fluctuate considerably depending on when significant receipts have occurred and on the timing of share issues. 
Risk in relation to the use of financial instruments
Capital risk
t he capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to owners of the parent, comprising issued capital, 
reserves and accumulated losses. t he Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern 
and to ensure that the Group has sufficient capital available to meet future funding requirements. t he Group does not typically utilise debt financing.
l iquidity risk
t he Group’s policy throughout the year regarding liquidity has been to maximise the return on funds, but to minimise the associated credit and 
liquidity risk by placing funds in low risk cash deposits and short term cash deposits. t he Board monitors the level of cash and money market 
investments on a regular basis and management monitors the level on a daily basis to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid funds to meet 
its commitments as they fall due. 
t he Group and Company holds cash deposits at call or with a maturity of up to twelve months. 
trade payables are normally payable within the terms specified by the supplier.

Risk in relation to the use of financial instruments continued
Credit risk
Other than trade receivables, the financial instruments that subject the Group to a potential credit risk comprise principally cash and money 
market investments. t he Group’s policy is to minimise the risks associated with cash and money market investments by placing these deposits with 
institutions with a recognised high rating (typically A or above) or with one of the major clearing banks. trade receivables are largely with highly 
reputable, creditworthy trading partners.
t he table below shows the rating of the financial institutions that the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and money market deposits are held with:

t he Group disclosure above does not include cash in hand amounting to £628 (2009: £640).
interest rate risk 
t he Group holds all cash, bank and held-to-maturity investments in sterling (“GBP”), euros (“euR”), united states dollar (“usD”) and south African 
rand (“ZAR”) accounts. interest rates on current accounts are floating and are based on l ondon interbank Bid Rate (“l iBiD”), while interest rates on 
term deposits are fixed for the duration of deposit.

t he weighted average interest rate of the Company’s money market investments at 30 september 2010 was 1.73% (2009: 0%).
t he Group does not have any committed borrowing facilities. Consequently, there is no material exposure to interest rate risk in respect 
of financial liabilities.
Foreign currency risk
t he Company’s principal functional currency is GBP. However during 2010 and 2009, the Group had income and expenditure in us D. t he Group’s 
policy is to maintain natural hedges, where possible, by matching us D revenue with us D expenditure. t he Group also incurred minimal 
expenditure in other foreign currencies and the strengthening of GBP against those currencies is not considered to have a material impact 
on the net loss for the year. Consequently, there is no material exposure to foreign currency rate risk.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
t here is no material difference between the fair value and the carrying values of the financial instruments referred to above, because of the 
short maturity period of these financial instruments or their intrinsic size and risk.

notes to assumptions
(a) expected term
 i)  40% of participants exercise after three years if a gain of 40% is available. if this gain is not available, these individuals hold on to their shares 
until such a gain can be made.
 ii)  25% of the remainder exercise from the third anniversary onwards using a reducing balance methodology, providing that a gain of 20% 
is available. if this gain is not available, these individuals refrain from exercising until such a gain can be made.
 iii)  15% of the total participants are “good leavers”. A good leaver is an employee who ceases to be an employee due to redundancy or other 
circumstances outside their control.
 iv)  5% of the participants exercise per annum on a reducing balance methodology, providing that the options are “in the money” (irrespective 
of the level of gain) to allow for leavers in these years. 
 v)  any remaining options are exercised at maturity providing that they are “in the money” (i.e. the share option price is less than the market

(d) expected volatility
expected volatility is the measurement of the amount by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. t he expected volatility has 
been calculated using the standard approach of calculating the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of historical share price movements. 
Certain periods where there has been inactivity followed by substantial increases in price and volume have been excluded from this calculation due 
to specific events creating a volatility that would not be representative of the potential future volatility.
A reconciliation of share option scheme movements for the years ended 30 september 2010 and 30 september 2009 is set out below:

Our Business at a Glance It gives me great pleasure  
to be addressing you for  
the first time as Chairman  
of your Company, at what  
is a time of significant 
opportunity for ENRC.  
I have been an independent Director of 
ENRC since the initial public offering in 2007 , 
and the Board appointed me as Chairman 
following the resignation of Dr Johannes 
Sittard in early February 2012. I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank him, on behalf 
of the Board, for his extensive and lasting 
contribution to the Company, first as Chief 
Executive Officer and then as Chairman. 
Your Company greatly benefited from his 
commitment, vision and clear strategic 
perspective. We wish him all the best  
in his future endeavours.
Against a turbulent economic backdrop  
and a volatile commodity pricing 
environment, ENRC performed solidly,  
owing to the underlying strengths of the 
Group, notably the quality of its tier one 
assets in Kazakhstan. These world-class 
assets remain the bedrock on which our 
expansion programme is based. Following 
significant acquisitions in preceding years, 
management focus in 2011 was very much 
on the development of assets in order to 
unlock value for our shareholders.
Progress in the development of our assets  
in Africa has reinforced the Group’s confident 
view on the future of our business in the 
region. We are well positioned in Africa to 
progress our projects and increase 
production. Notably we have finalised the 
acquisition of some high quality copper 
assets in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (‘DRC’) and completed a legal 
settlement with First Quantum Minerals 
Limited (‘FQM’). Through our assets in the 
DRC we are set to become a significant 
global copper producer over the next five 
years. The suite of our African assets in other 
commodities represents a solid platform for 
the Company’s future growth. 
In line with international best practice,  
we have improved our reporting on fatalities 
to provide additional information to reflect 
on-site non work-related fatality cases,  
which includes contractors. We are rolling 
out best practice safety initiatives across  
the Group. We will continue to do all we can 
to improve the safety of our operations with 
the aim of achieving a zero-fatality result on  
a long-term basis. 
ENRC is committed to fulfilling the highest 
standards of corporate responsibility and 
governance. We made significant important 
steps this year, notably completing our 
corporate governance review in September 
2011. This established a stronger Board 
structure in line with UK corporate 
governance best practice, with a 
composition and expertise that will best 
support the Group through the next phase  
of its growth. However, this is not an area in 
which we can stand still. We have continued 
to review Board composition, mindful of the 
need to progressively refresh the Board,  
with a view to affording it with talented and 
dedicated Directors exhibiting, amongst 
other qualifications, domain knowledge,  
long experience of best-in-class corporate 
governance practices, as well as corporate 
finance and strategy. It is our intention that 
the ENRC Board, representing your interests, 
maintains a clear value-focused strategy  
and exercises pronounced duty of care and 
oversight over the execution of such strategy 
4 Unlocking Value
Chairman’s Statement
Mr Mehmet Dalman, Chairman by your management team. I will lead this 
effort and I will be in a position to report  
back to you on our progress in the not  
too distant future.
We are also continuing to ensure that our 
internal compliance controls are robust and 
we now have dedicated regional heads of 
compliance in Kazakhstan, Africa and Brazil. 
We will issue our first comprehensive 
Sustainable Development Report in 2012 
detailing our activities in this area.
During 2011 we saw the departure of Mr 
Eduard Utepov, Mr Abdraman Yedilbayev,  
Sir Richard Sykes and Mr Kenneth Olisa.  
I thank them all for their commitment to the 
Company and for the contribution they  
have made. We also welcomed Mr Terence 
Wilkinson to the Board. Mr Wilkinson has  
a strong mining background with particular 
experience in Africa and, as an independent 
non-executive Director, is already providing  
a strong contribution. 
We are pleased to recommend to 
shareholders a final dividend of US 11 cents 
per ordinary share to be paid on 21 June 
2012 to all shareholders on the register on  
30 March 2012. 
In my role as Chairman I will lead the Group’s 
strategy which will be focused in 2012 on  
the development of our assets and unlocking 
their value. We anticipate a consistently 
strong operational performance across our 
diversified range of commodities in 2012 
and, while the market remains volatile and 
the pricing environment uncertain, we have  
a compelling mix of a low-cost production 
base coupled with diverse world-class 
assets which leaves the Group well placed 
going forward.
ENRC employs over 70,000 people 
throughout its operations. We are 
committed to maintaining a safe  
working environment for each and  
every one of them.

Strategic Messages
/  A business with tremendous assets  
and an established track record
/    Dynamic and growing business with  
the capacity for continued growth
/    Specialist in emerging markets
/    Commitment to corporate social 
responsibility and sustainable development 
www.enrc.com The Group was able  
to maintain its low-cost 
position compared  
to our peers despite 
increasing inflationary 
pressures on our  
input costs
ENRC has delivered a solid operational  
and financial performance in 2011. The 
competitive advantage of our low-cost 
operations has underpinned our growth as  
a leading natural resources group, allowing 
us to continue our commodity-led expansion 
strategy, through the diversification of our 
asset base and the development of our 
product portfolio. 
The continued successful development of 
our strategic projects and expanding asset 
base has been a core focus for management 
in 2011. In Kazakhstan we have made good 
progress with our new Aktobe ferroalloys 
plant, with first production expected on 
schedule in the second half of 2013. We 
foresee that the highest demand growth  
in the industry over the next five years will 
come from speciality steels and foundries 
which require high quality high-carbon 
ferrochrome. Due to the planned production 
growth in our Ferroalloys Division, ENRC  
will be well-positioned to meet this  
increased demand. 
In order to further enhance our integrated 
model and maintain our advantageous cost 
curve position within the region, progress 
has continued in the Energy Division with  
the construction completed of a 325 MW 
power unit at Aksu in Kazakhstan. Work  
has also begun on the reconstruction of  
an additional 325 MW power unit. With rising 
transport costs in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States we have made every 
effort to increase our self-sufficiency within 
the Logistics Division, acquiring an additional 
2,517 wagons and 1,215 containers in 2011. 
In the African copperbelt we have been 
focused on the development and 
consolidation of our world-class assets and 
we have seen significant increases in both 
copper and cobalt production in 2011. 
A considerable amount of resource was 
spent in 2011 on resolving the dispute  
with First Quantum Minerals Ltd (‘FQM’) 
regarding the licence for the Kolwezi Tailings 
project. The agreement reached with FQM  
in January 2012 and finalised in March  
has put a period of uncertainty behind us 
and allowed us to acquire FQM’s processing 
plants at both Kolwezi and Frontier. We are 
now well-positioned to meet our strategic 
goal of becoming a significant global  
copper producer over the next five years. 
In Mozambique the feasibility study for 
Licence 871 in the Tete Province is set to 
complete in H1 2012. This is a substantial 
long-term growth opportunity, with the 
potential to strengthen our position in the 
energy sector and allow us to diversify into 
the coal export market.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
We remain confident in the 
outlook for our diversified 
mix of commodities due  
to sustained growth in 
emerging markets.
Felix Vulis, Chief Executive Officer Our operations in Brazil provide us with the 
opportunity to become one of the leading 
global iron ore players, providing us with 
entry to the seaborne iron ore market. During 
2011 we have built a considerable presence 
in the region, with a 175-strong team of 
employees based in Salvador, Ilhéus, Belo 
Horizonte, Caetité, Aritagua and Salinas.  
The location of the port has been moved to 
Aritagua so as to minimise its environmental 
impact and the focus in the latter part of 2011 
was on resubmitting our application for the 
port preliminary licence. We are currently 
awaiting feedback on our submission.
In 2011 we initiated a major programme  
to better understand and improve the  
quality of our key non-financial performance 
indicators and we have engaged 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to provide 
assurance on selected indicators. Work  
is underway to present our first standalone 
Sustainable Development Report in 2012. 
Developing our non-financial reporting is a 
long-term undertaking and our intention is  
to deliver high quality data in line with global 
reporting practices and standards.
In October 2011 we announced our intention 
to exercise the Group’s option to acquire the 
outstanding shares in Shubarkol Komir JSC 
(‘Shubarkol’) for a purchase price of US$600 
million. The General Meeting to vote on this 
related-party transaction was subsequently 
adjourned in November. After considerable 
engagement with shareholders, we 
reconvened the General Meeting for 2 April 
2012 to vote on the acquisition
1
. ENRC firmly 
believes that the acquisition of this high 
quality asset will enhance our position as  
one of Kazakhstan’s leading coal producers 
and further our strategic aims in the region. 
We are determined to deliver value to all  
of our shareholders. To this end, we will 
continue to look at all aspects of our 
business, including expansions, joint 
ventures and spin-offs.
On behalf of the Group’s management  
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
our employees for their hard work and efforts. 
Safety 
The total number of work-related injuries, 
including fatalities, to employees in 2011 was 
63 (2010: no comparable data). The Group 
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (‘LTIFR’)  
for 2011 was 0.49 (0.45 in Kazakhstan and 
Russia; 0.72 in Africa). A Group LTIFR was 
not calculated in 2010 as numbers across 
the Group were not prepared on  
a comparable basis. As with fatalities, our 
LTIFR reporting currently adopts Kazakhstan 
classifications across the Group and reflects 
cultural conditions in Kazakhstan. This  
leads to a lower number of reported lost  
time injury cases compared to international 
practice. This remains an area of focus 
through our work with DuPont looking at 
safety culture and behaviours.
We have improved our reporting to provide 
additional information to reflect on-site  
non work-related fatalities, which includes 
contractors for 2011. This is a key step 
towards adoption of international best 
practice reporting on fatalities. We will 
continue to take steps to align our 
classification process to international 
standards. The on-site work and non 
work-related fatalities numbered 13 in 2011 
(2010: no comparable data available). There 
were six work-related fatalities in 2011 (five  
in Kazakhstan and Russia; one in Africa), 
while in 2010 there were seven fatalities all  
of which were in Kazakhstan and Russia.  
We express our condolences to the families 
involved. Our safety programmes will 
continue to focus on understanding causes 
and eliminating fatalities.

  At that meeting, shareholders gave their approval to proceed with the transaction. On 16 April 2012 the Group purchased the outstanding ordinary shares of Shubarkol for  
a total consideration of US$600 million.
ENRC will produce its first Sustainable 
Development Report in 2012. Our 
intention is to deliver high quality data  
in line with global reporting practices  
and standards.

2011 production performance
The Group’s key Divisions, Ferroalloys and 
Iron Ore, were impacted during the year  
by unscheduled equipment repairs, while 
production at the Alumina and Aluminium 
and Energy Divisions reflected full available 
capacity. Copper and cobalt production  
at the Other Non-ferrous Division showed 
strong growth against the prior year, in line 
with our expansion plans for these assets. 
•	 Ferroalloys: Ore extraction amounted  
to 4.59 Mt (2010: 4.82 Mt), whilst gross 
ferrochrome production was 1.37 Mt 
(2010: 1.39 Mt), of which 1.23 Mt (2010: 
1.26 Mt) was high-carbon ferrochrome; 
total gross ferroalloys production was  
1.77 Mt (2010: 1.80 Mt). The modest 
reduction in production related to two 
separate fires at Aktobe, the emergency 
stoppage of furnace 63 at Aksu and the 
suspension of production at Tuoli due  
to market conditions. ENRC plans  
to divest its share of Tuoli in 2012.  
All other operations have returned to  
effective full capacity.
•	 Iron Ore: Ore extraction amounted to 
43.21 Mt (2010: 43.61 Mt). Saleable 
concentrate production was 8.46 Mt 
(2010: 8.94 Mt) and saleable pellet 
production was 7 .65 Mt (2010: 8.02 Mt). 
Production was impacted primarily by 
temporary technical problems with the 
pelletisers, which are now back at effective 
full capacity. 
•	 Alumina and Aluminium: Bauxite  
extraction reached a record 5.50 Mt  
(2010: 5.31 Mt). Production of both 
alumina and aluminium were also at  
record levels of 1.67 Mt (2010: 1.64 Mt) 
and 249 kt (2010: 227 kt) respectively. 
•	 Other Non-ferrous: Total copper contained 
production was 29.61 kt (2010: 20.27 kt), 
whilst that of cobalt reached 11.42 kt 
(2010: 9.65 kt).
Financial performance
The Group continued to deliver a solid 
financial performance in 2011 in a 
challenging economic environment. Revenue 
rose 16.7% and Underlying EBITDA was  
up 6.9% reflecting higher sales volumes at 
the Other Non-ferrous and Alumina and 
Aluminium Divisions and higher commodity 
prices. However profitability was reduced 
due to increased cost pressures. The Group 
was able to maintain its low cost position 
compared to our peers despite increasing 
inflationary pressures on our input costs, 
primarily raw materials, energy and labour. 
Excluding the impact of the one-off gain 
arising on the acquisition of a joint venture  
in 2010, EPS increased by 4.6%. Basic EPS 
fell to US 153 cents per share (2010: US 170 
cents per share) as a result of this gain in 
2010. A more detailed discussion of the 
financial performance is contained in the 
Chief Financial Officer’s Review.
Capital expenditure
In 2011 we made considerable progress  
with our capital expenditure programme, 
with record capital expenditure of US$1.9 
billion (2010: US$1.2 billion), further 
developing our pipeline of high quality 
projects which underpin the Group’s growth 
strategy. Strategic reviews and project 
re-evaluations have nevertheless resulted  
in some delays in the realisation of capital 
expenditure projects in the Other 
Non-ferrous and Iron Ore Divisions. 
2011 was a successful year in which we 
completed the expansion of alumina 
production, the commissioning of Power Unit 
2 (a 325 MW turbine at Aksu) and continued 
the expansion of our railway fleet. Key 
projects across the Group’s Divisions include 
the following:
•	 Ferroalloys: Progression with the new 
Aktobe ferroalloys plant;
•	 Iron ore: Development of mine expansion 
projects;
•	 Alumina and Aluminium: Commissioning 
of alumina expansion and on-going 
construction of the anode plant; 
•	 Other Non-ferrous: Further development 
and review of the copper expansion 
strategy;
•	 Energy: Commissioning of Power Unit 2 
and reconstruction of Power Unit 6 at 
Aksu; and
•	 Logistics: Railway fleet expansion in 
Kazakhstan.
10 Unlocking Value
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement continued In 2012, capital expenditure is expected to 
amount to approximately US$2.7 billion of 
which US$0.8 billion relates to sustaining 
capital expenditure. The Group’s total capital 
expenditure programme for its expansionary 
projects is US$10.9 billion.
Acquisitions
In July 2011 the Group completed the 
acquisition of 100% of the ordinary shares  
of Dezita Investments Limited (‘Dezita’) for a 
total consideration of US$195 million. Dezita 
owns Exploitation Permit Number PE 1284 in 
the DRC, a potentially significant copper and 
cobalt resource. This asset is immediately 
adjacent to and contiguous with the permits 
held by the Group’s Camrose joint venture 
and its purchase is consistent with the 
Group’s strategy of consolidating resources 
in areas proximate to existing Group 
operations in the region.
In December 2011 the Group completed 
the acquisition of Rubio Holdings Limited 
(‘Rubio’), which indirectly holds 74% of Amari 
Manganese (Pty) Ltd (‘Amari’), for a total 
consideration of US$295 million. Amari’s  
key asset is the Kongoni Manganese Project 
in the Kalahari Manganese Field in South 
Africa. This acquisition further strengthens 
our position in a commodity which we 
believe has very attractive long-term 
fundamentals.
In January 2012 the Group announced that  
it had reached a settlement with FQM to 
acquire its residual assets and settle all 
claims in relation to its DRC operations for  
a total consideration of US$1.25 billion. This 
deal subsequently completed in March 2012. 
Risk and compliance
Through 2011 senior management and  
the Board have had regular dialogue on  
key risks relating to the Company’s strategic 
objectives. We know that some of the 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates 
pose particular and often heightened risks 
that need to be managed appropriately. We 
are open for dialogue with shareholders and 
other stakeholders to communicate our 
position openly and effectively.
The Group continues to enhance its 
approach to risk management and internal 
controls, and is committed to the further 
development of policies, processes and 
procedures.
The Group is acutely aware of its obligations 
regarding compliance with all applicable laws 
and regulations, as well as our corporate 
value for fair dealing. We now have 
compliance officers across our operations. 
We have completed the first stage of ethics 
training, delivered online by an independent, 
internationally-recognised ethics training 
provider, and have trained hundreds of 
senior managers face-to-face. ENRC has 
also launched a whistleblowing hotline, 
independently administered by the same 
ethics training provider, which operates 24 
hours a day, 365 days a year, in five 
languages. We have a robust investigations 
policy and we are now able to effectively and 
thoroughly investigate whistleblowing reports 
and other issues, and take appropriate 
corrective action. 
Outlook
Although the volatility in global markets 
persists in 2012, particularly concerning the 
sovereign debt crisis in Europe, we remain 
confident in the outlook for our diversified 
mix of commodities due to sustained growth 
in emerging markets. Our operations are 
expected to perform at full available capacity 
in 2012 to meet this demand, with increased 
copper production in the Other Non-ferrous 
Division as we continue to grow volumes  
in the DRC. We expect that inflationary cost 
pressures will be evident across the Group 
again in 2012 but we will make every effort  
to continue to focus on cost saving initiatives 
to ensure that our relative low-cost position 
and competitive advantage is maintained.

Boss Mining Luita  
expansion project
Boss Mining was acquired in  
2009 and at that time produced 
approximately 10,000 tpa of grade B 
copper cathode via a heap leach and 
electro-winning facility. 
We investigated expanding the facility  
to 40,000 tpa grade B copper cathode  
to accommodate the Group’s copper and 
cobalt expansion plans, take advantage  
of increased copper prices and benefit 
from reduced costs arising from 
economies of scale. A feasibility study was 
undertaken which identified a capital cost 
of US$83 million and utilised five additional 
heap leach pads and three additional 
electro-winning bays. The project was 
approved in 2010 and was completed in 
December 2011; it is now operational.
The electro-winning circuit has a potential 
capacity of 70,000 tpa grade A copper  
but to achieve this will require the addition 
of a solvent extraction facility. This will  
be reviewed as part of a potential  
further expansion.

EPS tells us how much profit is attributable  
to each shareholder which may then be 
available for distribution. The fall in 2011  
is a result of the one-off gain arising on the 
acquisition of BMBV in 2010 which increased 
reported profits. If this gain is excluded EPS in 
2011 is 5% higher than in 2010.

ROCE measures how efficiently the Group’s 
capital is being used. The decrease in the 
year reflects the growth in capital employed 
and the increased percentage of early stage 
exploration projects in the business.
This is a measure of the underlying profitability 
of the Group. In 2011 the increase to 
Underlying EBITDA continued to be driven  
by strong commodity prices, however higher 
costs of production partially offset this impact.

This measure records the rate of accidents 
involving employees that cause more than one 
day/shift of lost time per 1,000,000 working 
hours. The 2011 data programme shows that 
the basis for authorising lost time in Kazakhstan 
tends to include only more serious injuries.  
This may result in recording less lost time cases 
than other international mining companies. The 
2011 LTIFR data reflects the combined rate for 
operations in Kazakhstan, Russia and Africa. 
Improved consistency in the definitions allows

Costs per tonne increased during  
2011 primarily due to strong inflationary 
pressures which pushed up purchase 
prices for materials and services and  
also resulted in increased labour costs 
and electricity tariffs. Increased 
depreciation and amortisation and MET 
also had a negative influence on the 
Group’s unit costs. In order to mitigate 
these factors the Group has continued 
with a number of cost saving initiatives 
and optimisation programmes resulting  
in production process improvements, 
reduction of some consumption rates  
and increased fuel efficiency.
ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 17
www.enrc.com The Group produced 
robust results for the year 
with Revenue and 
Underlying EBITDA 
showing solid growth 
despite challenging market 
conditions, rising by 16.7% 
and 6.9% respectively. 
Dr Zaure Zaurbekova, Chief Financial Officer
Commodity prices have generally been 
favourable which has been a key driver of 
revenue growth. However our cost inputs 
have been under strong pressure resulting  
in some decline in margins. 
Of the increase in our total operating costs, 
36% resulted from macro-economic factors, 
primarily inflation and to a lesser extent the 
strengthening of the Kazakhstani tenge and 
the Russian rouble and Mineral Extraction 
Tax (‘MET’) growth (influenced by higher 
commodity prices). In order to mitigate  
these factors the Group has continued  
with a number of cost saving initiatives  
and optimisation programmes resulting in 
production process improvements, reduction 
of some consumption rates and increased 
fuel efficiency.
In addition, 28% of total operating cost 
increases (including depreciation) were 
driven by the expansion of our operations 
and exploration in the Other Non-ferrous 
Division. We also continued to support our 
local communities through social investment 
which has added a total of 10% to the 
Group’s total operating cost increases 
(including a US$98 million payment to the 
Nazarbayev Fund in Kazakhstan to support 
the development of university education in 
that country).
The Group has continued its growth 
programme with its significant organic capital 
expenditure plans and these programmes 
will continue to be key projects for the Group 
in 2012 and beyond. Set out later in this 
review is a summary of our expenditure in 
the year and the total expected future cost  
of our capital expenditure projects.
In addition, the Group made two  
acquisitions during the year and subsequent 
to the balance sheet date completed the 
transaction with FQM as detailed in the  
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement. We  
intended to exercise our call option over 
Shubarkol and to that end reconvened a 
General Meeting to seek shareholder 
approval for this acquisition. At that meeting, 
shareholders gave their approval to proceed 
with the transaction. On 16 April 2012 the 
Group purchased the outstanding ordinary 
shares of Shubarkol for a total consideration 
of US$600 million.
To ensure the Group has access to sufficient 
funding to finance the capital expenditure 
and acquisitions referred to above, we have 
secured additional liquidity from a number  
of sources. Three bank facilities were entered 
into during 2011 providing committed 
funding of US$1.7 billion. At the end of the 
year US$1.6 billion of this remained undrawn. 
Since the year end we have signed an 
additional committed funding facility for a 
further US$2 billion. The existing US$3 billion 
Euro Medium Term Note programme signed 
in 2010 has not been utilised, although we 
continue to consider the programme as an 
integral part of our future funding strategy. 
Although the funding environment is a 
challenging one at present, with the Group’s 
credit rating having recently been 
downgraded by both Standard & Poor’s  
and Moody’s, lenders’ confidence in the 
underlying strength of ENRC is reflected  
in the Group’s ability to raise US$3.7 billion  
of facilities since the beginning of 2011.
Income statement
Revenue
Revenue increased 16.7% in the year to 
US$7 ,705 million (2010: US$6,605 million), 
which reflected higher commodity prices  
for all of our key products (iron ore and  
coal prices reaching all-time highs) and 
stable market demand. US$948 million 
(86.2%) of revenue growth was attributable 
to higher prices, US$115 million (10.4%)  
due to higher sales volumes and US$37 
million (3.4%) reflected an increase in sales  
of other goods and services. The Ferroalloys 
Division accounted for 39.9% of the Group’s 
third party revenue, the Iron Ore Division 
31.8% and the Alumina and Aluminium 
Division 14.6%. 
Gross margin
Gross margin declined slightly during the 
year to 54.4% (2010: 56.9%) as strong 
inflationary pressures pushed up purchase 
prices for materials and services and also 
resulted in increased labour costs and 
electricity tariffs. Increased depreciation and 
amortisation and MET also had a negative 
influence on the Group’s cost of sales. In 
order to manage the impact of these cost 
increases the Group continued to maintain 
strict cost control and introduced a number 
of cost saving programmes and productivity 
initiatives, resulting in unit costs growth for 
key products being in line with our 
expectations for the year.

Chief Financial Officer’s Review Distribution costs
The increase in distribution costs was 
primarily due to a US$15 million rise in 
transportation costs as a result of increases 
in railway tariffs and longer delivery routes  
to more distant customers.
General and administrative costs
The most significant change in general and 
administrative expenses was an increase in 
sponsorship and social investment costs of 
US$93 million mainly as a result of the 
support to the Nazarbayev Fund. In addition 
we incurred increases to staff costs of 
US$37 million. 
Exploration expenses
Exploration costs increased by US$57 million 
primarily relating to the Other Non-ferrous 
Division.
Net other operating expenses
Net other operating expenses increased 
US$14 million primarily as a result of foreign 
exchange losses.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs increased US$79 million  
as a result of increased interest expenses 
and foreign exchange losses. The increase  
in our interest expense was due to our 
increased levels of debt throughout the year.
Share of profits of joint ventures and 
associates
The net share of profits of joint ventures and 
associates amounted to US$2 million (2010: 
US$13 million). This includes a US$14 million 
profit contribution from the Group’s interest 
in Shubarkol, and losses of US$8 million  
and US$4 million from our interests in 
Camrose Resources Limited and Taurus 
Gold Limited respectively mainly as a result 
of exploration and similar expenses in these 
early stage investments.
Taxation
The Group’s income tax expense for the  
year ended 31 December 2011 was US$769 
million (2010: US$780 million), an Effective 
Tax Rate (‘ETR’) of 27 .9% (2010: 26.2%).  
The main drivers behind the ETR being 
higher than the 20% corporate income tax 
rate in the Republic of Kazakhstan, where 
the majority of the Group’s operations are 
located, included excess profits tax charges 
in Kazakhstan, which increased the ETR  
by 3.8 percentage points, and withholding 
taxes, mainly relating to the repatriation of 
dividends from Kazakhstan, which added 
1.6 percentage points.
In future periods, as the Group starts to 
develop its greenfield projects, we would 
expect the Group’s ETR to increase as 
compared with its current level. This is mainly 
due to the significant expenditure which  
will be undertaken in jurisdictions where 
revenues are not yet being generated.  
The Group’s ETR also remains sensitive  
to prices and market conditions.
Balance sheet
The Group’s net book value of property, 
plant and equipment at 31 December 2011 
was US$9,891 million (2010 as restated: 
US$8,146 million), an increase of 21.4%. 
Goodwill and other intangibles at 31 
December 2011 totalled US$1,410 million 
(2010: US$1,371 million), an increase of 2.8%.
An analysis of additions in the year arising 
from the Group’s capital expenditure projects 
in 2011 is set out in the capital expenditure 
section below.
The Group also purchased Dezita (copper/
cobalt) for US$195 million and Rubio 
(manganese) for US$295 million during the 
year. The result of these transactions is an 
increase in property, plant and equipment 
(primarily mineral rights). Goodwill arose in 
respect of the Rubio transaction primarily  
as a result of the recognition of deferred tax 
under IFRS.
Subsequent to the year end the Group 
completed the acquisition of FQM’s residual 
claims and assets in respect of the Kolwezi 
Tailings project, the Frontier and Lonshi 
mines and related exploration interests, all 
located in the Katanga Province of the DRC, 
for total consideration of US$1.25 billion. 
Further detail can be found in the Chief 
Executive Officer’s Statement and in note 38  
to the Consolidated financial statements.
During the year, the Group completed the 
measurement period analysis of the 
businesses acquired in 2010, the result of 
which is the reallocation of certain assets 
and liabilities and a restatement, as required

operating activities (2010: US$2,303 million). 
Working capital requirements increased 
during the year by US$410 million (2010: 
US$300 million) primarily as a result of 
increases in inventories due to lower demand 
from Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works 
OJSC in Q4 2011, transport limitations in 
Kazakhstan, increases in raw material costs 
and increases in trade receivables due to 
revised letters of credit payment terms with 
several of our ferroalloys customers in China. 
Net cash used for investing activities
During the year the Group utilised a total  
of US$2,656 million for investing activities 
(2010: US$2,368 million). The primary use  
of these funds was for the acquisition of 
property, plant and equipment (2011: 
US$2,121 million, 2010: US$1,245 million)

payment of US$120 million for the acquisition 
of MIBA and MPB as detailed in note 5 and  
a returnable deposit in relation to the 2012 
FQM acquisition of US$125 million.
Net cash flow used for financing 
activities
The Group used cash resources of US$448 
million (2010: US$826 million inflow) in its 
financing activities during the year ended  
31 December 2011. This comprised: US$100 
million drawn from unsecured term loan 
facilities, US$54 million drawn from various 
export credit facilities, less repayment of 
borrowings of US$154 million and cash 
outflows for dividends of US$448 million 
(2010: US$248 million).
Funding and liquidity
During the year the Group did not utilise  
the US$3 billion Euro Medium Term Note 
programme signed in 2010 and as at  
31 December 2011 there were no issues 
under the programme. The programme is 
still considered to be an integral part of the 
Group’s future funding strategy. 
The Group secured additional liquidity  
during the year with the signing of three bank 
facilities: an unsecured term loan facility for 
US$1 billion with Russian Commercial Bank 
(Cyprus) Limited (part of the VTB group), an 
unsecured senior US$500 million revolving 
credit facility supported by a group of 
international banks and an export credit 
facility in the amount of €185 million as 
detailed in note 26.
At the end of 2011 and 2010, the average 
maturity of outstanding debt was more  
than five years, and net gearing at 31 
December 2011 was 8.2% (2010: 0.4%)  
as detailed in note 36.
Since the year end, the Group has continued 
to raise additional facilities to support the 
continuing growth of the business as detailed 
in note 38. On 1 February 2012, the Group 
entered into an unsecured five year US$2 
billion facility with Sberbank of Russia which 
is available in quarterly tranches of US$500 
million during the first year of the agreement. 
On 16 February 2012, the Group signed an 
amendment to the existing revolving credit 
facility reducing the amount to US$467 
million but extending the maturity until 2014. 
Capital expenditure 
In 2011, the Group’s capital expenditure 
amounted to US$1,921 million (2010: 
US$1,187 million), an increase of US$734 
million, or 62%. 
The geographic split of capital expenditure  
in 2011 was Kazakhstan US$1,563 million, 
Africa US$238 million, Brazil US$82 million 
and Other US$38 million.

Chief Financial Officer’s Review continued ENRC is a global diversified mining 
company and operates through six 
Divisions supported by a central sales 
and marketing department. Five of 
these Divisions are predominantly 
based in Kazakhstan with the Other 
Non-ferrous Division based in Africa.
Ferroalloys Division
The Ferroalloys Division primarily produces and sells 
ferrochrome, as well as other ferroalloys, for use as alloying 
products in the production of steel, whilst manganese and 
chrome ore are sold to third-party producers of ferroalloys as 
well as the chemical industry. ENRC is the largest ferrochrome 
producer in the world by chrome content and the lowest  
cost producer of high-carbon ferrochrome. The Ferroalloys 
Division is vertically integrated, having its own chrome ore  
and manganese ore mines feeding its ferroalloy production in 
Kazakhstan and Russia. In addition to its own ore, the Division 
also benefits from competitively priced electricity supplied by 
the Energy Division, as well as having a gas-fired power station 
at its Aktobe plant. ENRC plans to fully divest of its shares in 
Xinjiang Tuoli ENRC Taihang Chrome Co. Ltd. (‘Tuoli’), its 
Chinese ferroalloy plant, during 2012.

Iron Ore Division
The Iron Ore Division consists of producing assets in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan and exploring and developing assets  
in Brazil. In Kazakhstan the Iron Ore Division produces and sells 
iron ore concentrate and pellets primarily to steel producers  
and on the basis of full year 2011 data, is a material exporter  
of iron ore and in the lowest quartile of the global cost curve. 
Kazakhstan-based operations include iron ore mines, crushing, 
beneficiation and pelletising plants and a thermal power station. 
In Brazil, the Division is focused on the development of a 
high-quality iron ore deposit in the Caetité region in the State  
of Bahia, as well as two early stage exploration projects, both 
located in the State of Minas Gerais.

Divisional Overview Logistics Division
The Logistics Division provides transportation and logistics 
services to the Group’s principal Kazakhstani operating 
Divisions, as well as to third parties. The Division’s operations 
include freight forwarding, wagon repair services, railway 
construction and repair services and trucking. The availability  
of these services within the Group mitigates many of the risks 
associated with the supply of raw materials and delivery of 
products to customers. In addition, the Division operates a 
railway transfer and reloading terminal on the Kazakhstan/China 
border, facilitating the Group’s access to the Chinese market.

and cobalt and processes the ore through Boss Mining Sprl. 
ENRC’s copper and cobalt operations also include a 50.5% 
share of Camrose Resources Limited; processing capacity at 
Kolwezi and at the Frontier mine (both acquired in 2012); and  
the Chambishi smelter located in Zambia. In addition, the  
Other Non-ferrous Division includes a number of development 
prospects: Mozambique – coal; Mali – bauxite; Zimbabwe – 
platinum; and South Africa – fluorspar, coal and manganese. 
The Group’s African logistics and trucking business, SABOT, 
operates in Central and Southern Africa. 
Energy Division
The Energy Division is one of the largest electricity providers  
in the Republic of Kazakhstan, accounting for approximately 
16.3% of the country’s recorded electricity production in 2011 
(2010: 16.6%). Taking into account all of the energy generation 
facilities of ENRC, including SSGPO, the alumina refinery 
(‘Aluminium of Kazakhstan’) and the Aktobe ferroalloys smelter 
(‘Kazchrome’), the Group’s share of Kazakhstan’s energy supply 
was 22.5% in 2011 (2010: 22.6%). The Energy Division provides 
a cost-effective energy supply to the Group’s other principal 
Kazakhstani operating Divisions, with internal consumption of 
71.5% (2010: 73.9%) of the electricity produced in 2011, as well 
as producing a surplus for sales to third parties in Kazakhstan.

Divisional Overview The Ferroalloys Division 
maintained its competitive 
position by continuing  
to benefit from its vertical 
integration and the value 
of its high quality ore 
deposits. Cost push 
pressures for a 
consecutive year again 
impacted South African 
ferrochrome producers 
as they faced a 25% 
increase in energy  
costs, further enhancing 
our position relative to  
our peers.
Competitive position 
The Division was able to again benefit from 
its diverse customer base leveraging the 
stronger fundamentals in the engineering 
and alloy steel sectors where the high 
chrome content and low residuals are in 
demand for the critical benefits they afford 
these steel grades. The Division continued  
to produce at close to full capacity  
utilisation in its operations in high-carbon, 
medium-carbon and low-carbon 
ferrochrome within Kazakhstan and Russia. 
Production at the Group’s Chinese 
ferrochrome plant Tuoli was shut in 2011. 
This was due to the relatively high production 
costs at Tuoli and declining market 
conditions in China. Long-term contract 
sales continued to grow reflecting the level  
of service, quality and reputation within the 
global market. The Group continued its 
policy of diversifying its customer base in 
readiness for the next phase of expansion, 
upon the completion of the new Aktobe 
ferroalloys plant in 2013. 
Production
In 2011, the Ferroalloys Division produced: 
3,567 kt of saleable chrome ore (2010: 3,574 
kt); 1,009 kt of saleable manganese ore 
concentrate (2010: 996 kt); and 1,766 kt  
of ferroalloys (2010: 1,803 kt), including  
1,226 kt (2010: 1,258 kt) of its primary 
product, high-carbon ferrochrome. In 2011 
226 kt (2010: 216 kt) of ferroalloys were 
consumed internally. 
Supply and demand
The first quarter of 2011 saw strong  
demand for ferrochrome return as Western 
consumers restocked, leading to a bullish 
outlook for global stainless production of 
approximately 34 million tonnes for the year. 
The demand for ferrochrome was further 
buoyed by strength in engineering and alloy 
steels, as well as the automotive sectors.  
The strong fundamentals early in the year 
encouraged additional ferrochrome capacity 
to be brought online, particularly in China. 
However, demand from stainless steel mills 
declined going into the traditionally slower 
third quarter and any meaningful recovery 
was impacted by concerns over Eurozone 
liquidity and the domino effect this might 
ultimately have on overall global demand. 
With a depreciating rand and winter 
electricity tariffs having disappeared, 
production in South Africa picked up in the 
fourth quarter, resulting in excess supply  
by the year end of approximately 200 kt  
of ferrochrome, with more than 400 kt  
of annualised capacity offline. The usual 
destocking by consumers at year end was 
again prevalent, magnified by economic 
concerns emanating from Europe.

Operational Review Sales and pricing 
Excess capacity at the end of 2010 resulted 
in a US 5 cents drop in the European 
ferrochrome benchmark price in Q1 2011,  
to US$1.25 per pound of chrome. However, 
the better than expected demand in the first 
quarter from all steel segments and as a 
result a reduction in stocks as well as 
continued cost pressures in South Africa led 
to a US 10 cent increase in Q2 2011. Key 
market features going into Q3 2011 included 
concerns over nickel pricing, excess 
stainless capacity in China and the sovereign 
debt crisis in Europe. These features in 
conjunction with strong ferrochrome 
production levels globally meant that prices 
declined by US 15 cents in the third quarter, 
to US$1.20 per pound of chrome. With no 
positive signs of recovery at the end of Q3, 
prices remained unchanged for Q4 2011. 
Ferrochrome market conditions continued  
to weaken through the fourth quarter in line 
with the weakening of the global economy.
In H1 2011, the demand for medium- and 
low-carbon ferrochrome increased due  
to associated strong demand in the 
engineering, alloy and speciality steel sectors, 
with prices increasing by between US 30  
to 40 cents per pound of chrome. In H2 the 
demand slowed and prices correspondingly 
declined as the general economic mood 
became increasingly negative over the 
Eurozone crisis. By the end of the year prices 
had decreased by approximately US 30 
cents from their peak in April-May. 
The price of chrome ore showed a  
13% increase during H1 2011, reflecting 
improvements in the ferrochrome market. 
However during H2 2011 these gains were 
relinquished as demand slowed. China is the 
largest consumer of chrome ore and through 
H2 there was a large build-up of stock at 
Chinese ports as the fall in demand resulted 
in the price of chrome ore declining almost 
35% from its peak earlier in the year.
The year began with high stock levels of 
manganese alloys and ores and despite an 
initial encouraging start, prices soon declined 
as carbon steel production was slower than 
expected in China and margins at Western 
steel mills came under pressure. The decline 
in ore prices due to high stock levels fed 
through to subsequent lower pricing for 
manganese alloys as the year progressed.
In 2011, the geographical mix of sales saw 
marked declines to China, South Korea and 
the Far East compared to last year. These 
were offset by a marked increase in the 
proportion of sales to Japan and a more 
modest increase in the share of sales to 
Western markets. Sales to all other regions 
were broadly similar to the previous year. 
Results for the year
The Ferroalloys Division contributed 
US$1, 169 million, or 34.2%, of the Group’s 
Underlying EBITDA in 201 1 (2010: US$1,403 
million; 43.9%); a decrease of US$234 million 
as the Division faced both considerable 
inflationary pressure and challenging  
market conditions. 
The Ferroalloys Division achieved another 
record level of ferroalloys sales of 1,542 kt, 
improving on the previous year’s sales by 
0.9%, which compensated for weaker sales 
of chrome ore (11.5% down year-on-year). 
High-carbon ferrochrome volumes increased 
0.3%, whilst other ferrochrome products 
experienced more substantial growth rates 
against 2010 levels. 
Total revenue for the Division increased 
US$88 million (2.9%), of which US$71 million 
was due to higher commodity prices,  
US$13 million reflected higher sales volumes 
and US$4 million was added from increased 
sales of goods and services to other Group 
Divisions. High-carbon ferrochrome sales 
contributed US$45 million (US$32 million 
due to higher prices and US$13 million  
due to higher sales volumes), or 51.1%,  
of the increase in the Division’s revenue.

Operational Review American markets, which were more 
favourable in terms of prices, also positively 
impacted revenue. 
The decline in gross margin was due to the 
cost pressures being experienced with unit 
cost of sales for ferroalloys 17% above that 
of 2010. 
A US$247 million increase in cost of sales 
comprised a US$245 million increase in unit 
cost of sales and US$2 million cost growth 
from higher sales volumes. The main factors 
affecting the unit cost of sales growth were 
higher input material prices, particularly for 
reductants and fuel along with increased 
electricity tariffs and wage rates. 
Within these increases in cost of sales 
depreciation and amortisation increased by 
US$10 million. MET totalled US$173 million 
(2010: US$172 million) for the year.
The US$35 million increase in distribution 
costs was mainly attributable to increased 
transportation costs as a result of increased 
railway tariffs and the higher volumes of  
sales to more distant customers such as 
North America, Japan and Western Europe, 
instead of China. 
General and administrative expenses 
increased US$60 million primarily as a result 
of additional social investments (primarily  
in respect of the Group’s contributions to  
the Nazarbayev Fund), depreciation and 
amortisation and staff costs. 
Capital expenditure 
The construction of the new Aktobe 
ferroalloys plant is the key investment  
project within the Ferroalloys Division,  
which underpins the Group’s growth  
strategy in ferroalloys. Four direct current 
(‘DC’) furnaces with capacity of 440 ktpa  
are being built. 
In 2011 the project progressed significantly, 
with the completion of the pits and 
foundations for all four furnaces, the 
installation of air pipes for all of the furnaces 
and the construction of the furnace covers. 
The commissioning date and total cost of 
this project remain unchanged at H2 2013 
and US$750 million respectively. 
Operational Review Ferroalloys continued
The Ferroalloys Division achieved  
a record level of ferroalloys sales  
of 1,542 kt in 2011.
Aktobe ferroalloys plant
26 Unlocking Value Aktobe ferroalloys 
plant, Kazakhstan
The construction of the new  
Aktobe ferroalloys plant is one of  
the Group’s key investment projects  
in Kazakhstan. The US$750 million 
project, which commenced in 2010 
and is due to be completed in 2013, 
will incorporate four direct current 
furnaces with a total capacity of 440 
ktpa of high-carbon ferrochrome. 
During 2011, the Group designed  
the layout of the workshops, laid the 
foundations of the furnaces and installed 
the air ducts. The Group also signed 
agreements with a number of leading 
international manufacturers for the supply 
of production equipment, building 
materials and structural steel for the 
construction of the smelting workshops. 
The mounting of the furnace shells is 
currently in progress. 
The investment into DC furnace 
technology will enable the Group to 
achieve significant cost savings compared 
to existing low cost alternating current 
technology. It will allow the Company to 
substitute lump coke with cheaper coke 
fines, use cheaper anthracite fines as  
the reductant, and increase the chrome 
content from 75% to 90%.

Revenue US$2,449 million
Competitive position 
In particular, the Group’s facilities are located 
within 340 kilometres of its largest customer, 
Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works OJSC 
(‘MMK’), and this proximity provides 
significant logistical and cost advantages. 
Secondly, the Division operates large-scale 
iron ore mines and processing plants with  
a relatively low production cost. This cost 
advantage is largely driven by the relatively 
low cost of electricity, due to the Group’s 
own power generation capacity.
Production
In 2011, the Iron Ore Division mined 43,212 
kt of iron ore (2010: 43,614 kt). This was 
processed into 17 ,636 kt of primary iron ore 
concentrate (2010: 17 ,702 kt), with saleable 
concentrate production of 8,459 kt (2010: 
8,937 kt). The balance was used to produce 
7 ,648 kt (2010: 8,017 kt) of pellet. 
Supply and demand
The market for iron ore is primarily regional, 
as iron ore is a bulk commodity and, relative 
to its value, is expensive to transport. China, 
Brazil and Australia are the largest producers 
of iron ore, accounting for respectively 43%, 
14% and 17% of global output in 2011, based 
on crude ore. Other significant producers 
include the Commonwealth of Independent 
States (‘CIS’) and India. Despite a decrease in 
production late in 2011, steel production was 
strong throughout most of the year, resulting 
in the global production of iron ore increasing 
8.1% compared with 2010, to 2.8 Mt.
Sales and pricing 
Although the annual total crude steel 
production during 2011 increased by 6.8% 
compared to 2010, global steel production 
declined in H2 2011. During H2 2011 the 
industry capacity utilisation rate fell below 
80% (H1 2011: 82%). Spot iron ore prices fell 
dramatically during September and October 
2011, decreasing approximately 35% and 
subsequently hovering in a narrow range  
of US$130-140 per dry metric tonne through  
to the year end. Any slowdown in steel 
production generally has the additional effect 
of reducing the demand for pellet relative  
to concentrate, as a focus on throughput  
is replaced by an emphasis on low cost raw 
materials. This trend has been evident in the 
CIS since the end of Q2 2011. 
In 2011 MMK accounted for 63.4% (2010: 
63.6%) of the Iron Ore Division’s revenue  
and 10.1 million tonnes of saleable product. 
The MMK contractual price was determined 
based on Platts publications on a quarterly 
basis from February up to December 2011. 
In December 2011 the quarterly pricing 
mechanism was reviewed to reflect monthly 
conditions and a 15% discount is to be 
applied for 2012 against the formula used  
in 2011. In Q4 2011, 421 kt of iron ore 
concentrate was sold to Mechel and Evraz 
after MMK sharply decreased demand from 
September 2011.
The Iron Ore Division has 
significant strategic 
advantages over its major 
competitors. Firstly, the 
location of the Group’s 
large-scale iron ore 
reserves in Northern 
Kazakhstan provides 
access to the important 
customer base of steel 
production plants in 
Russia, China and 
Kazakhstan with relatively 
low transportation costs.

Operational Review
Results for the year
In 2011, the Iron Ore Division contributed 
44.1%, or US$1,505 million (2010: US$1,133 
million; 35.5%) of the Group’s Underlying 
EBITDA. Underlying EBITDA margin  
also continued to improve reaching 61.4% 
(2010: 60.4%). 
Revenue rose by US$576 million, or 30.7%, 
primarily as a result of high prices for iron ore 
which reached an all-time high in the first half 
of the year. Selling prices increased 37% 
compared to 2010 giving additional revenue 
of US$655 million. By contrast, weaker sales 
volumes reduced the Iron Ore Division’s total 
revenue by US$84 million. The 4.4% decline 
in volumes sold reflected decreased sales  
to Chinese customers and the lower demand 
from MMK. The sales mix did not change 
significantly with higher priced iron ore pellet 
representing 48.1% of the total iron ore sales 
(2010: 48.3%), contributing US$299 million  
to the Division’s revenue growth (US$349 
million received owing to favourable prices 
was partially offset by US$50 million 
decrease as a result of lower sales volumes). 
An increase in concentrate prices added 
US$303 million to the Division’s revenue, 
offset by a US$34 million decrease due to 
decline in sales volumes. 
The Division’s gross margin increased to 
72.7% (2010: 68.5%) underpinned by the 
strong selling price performance although 
the Division also experienced pressure on 
unit costs which increased 18.4% compared 
to 2010. 
A US$101 million increase in cost of sales 
resulted from higher unit cost of sales, which 
was partially offset by a US$23 million 
decrease in costs resulted from lower sales 
volumes. The unit cost of sales growth was 
in line with our expectations resulting from 
higher prices of input materials, fuel, 
electricity, higher wage rates and higher MET.
Depreciation and amortisation increased 
cost of sales by US$12 million. In total, a 
higher MET of US$114 million (2010: US$93 
million) was incurred in the year resulting 
from higher realised prices. 
A US$27 million increase in distribution costs 
resulted from higher railway tariffs. This 
increase was partially offset by proportionally 
more products being shipped to Russia and 
Kazakhstan, which had lower tariffs in 
comparison with rail transportation to China.
General and administrative expenses 
increased by US$112 million, including 
increases of US$73 million in social 
investments (primarily in respect of the 
Group’s contributions to the Nazarbayev 
Fund), US$15 million in staff costs and 
US$11 million in professional services 
(primarily relating to the BMSA project). 
Capital expenditure 
The expansion strategy of the Iron Ore 
Division in Kazakhstan includes an increase 
in ore mining volumes, as well as expanding 
the product portfolio with three new 
products: high quality concentrate, high 
quality pellets and hot briquetted iron (‘HBI’). 
This will increase total saleable volumes to 
approximately 23 Mtpa. 
•	 Mine expansion: Work has commenced  
to secure the required ore feed for the 
ENRC aims to increase its saleable 
volumes of iron ore products by 
approximately six million tonnes  
in the next three years.

www.enrc.com Alumina and 
Aluminium
Revenue US$1,122 million
Competitive position 
The Group’s bauxite reserves guarantee an 
on-going low cost supply of raw materials of 
alumina production. Alumina and aluminium 
production benefit from the ability to buy low 
cost energy from internal Group sources and 
they have some electricity producing 
capacity themselves. As a result, ENRC’s 
alumina and aluminium are both at the lower 
end of the industry cost curves.
Production
In 2011, the Alumina and Aluminium Division 
mined 5,495 kt of bauxite (2010: 5,310 kt) 
and produced 1,670 kt of alumina (2010: 
1,640 kt) and 249 kt (2010: 227 kt) of 
aluminium.
Supply and demand
In 2011 global alumina production is 
estimated to have been approximately 89 
million tonnes (2010: 82 million tonnes) and 
consumption approximately 87 million tonnes 
(2010: 81 million tonnes). Global aluminium 
production in 2011 is believed to have been 
45 million tonnes (2010: 41 million tonnes) 
and consumption 44 million tonnes (2010:  
39 million tonnes). China has become an 
even more important player in the aluminium 
industry; in 2011 the country had a balanced 
aluminium industry, with production and 
consumption both having been 
approximately 18 million tonnes (40% of 
global production and 41% of consumption). 
Aluminium premiums, an indicator of the 
metal’s physical availability, in Q2 2011 rose 
to record levels for deliveries in Europe, 
Japan, and the USA. In Q4 2011 premiums 
around the world came down but stayed 
close to their historical highs. 
Aluminium inventories, tied up under 
financing deals in London Metals Exchange 
(‘LME’) approved warehouses, rose to an 
all-time high of almost 5 million tonnes  
by the end of 2011. High inventories were 
supported by a prevailing contango, 
on-going low interest rates and available 
warehousing options. The attractive returns 
of the financing deals combined with 
physical limitations of removing metal from 
warehouses meant that industry stocks in 
2011 had limited impact on the supply – 
demand balance and on LME aluminium 
prices and premiums.
Sales and pricing 
The LME aluminium price drives pricing of 
the Group’s alumina and aluminium. The 
LME aluminium price in 2011 showed high 
volatility with a prevailing downward trend for 
most of the year except for Q1. A high of 
US$2,772 per tonne was recorded in late 
April 2011 and a low of US$1,945 per tonne 
in late December. Primary aluminium is used 
to make aluminium semi-finished products, 
for example sheet and plate, extrusions, 
forgings, and castings. Demand for these 
products was strong in all key applications, 
The Division’s focus  
on cost control, with  
the implementation  
of several cost-reduction 
programmes in 201 1, 
enabled ENRC to  
retain its competitive  
cost position.

Operational Review for example transportation, packaging, 
building and construction, and across all 
geographical markets in the first half of 2011. 
The second half of the year showed a 
marked slowdown in demand particularly  
in Russia an important market for the 
Group’s aluminium.
In 2011 the Group delivered 1,170 kt (2010: 
1,176 kt) of alumina to United Company 
RUSAL (‘RUSAL ’) under a long-term contract 
with a minimum delivery volume of 1,164 
ktpa. This contract expires at the end of 
2016. The pricing under this contract is 
linked as a percentage to the LME price of 
primary aluminium. In 2011 RUSAL, the 
Division’s single largest customer, accounted 
for 38.1% (2010: 42.3%) of the Division’s 
sales revenue. The balance of the alumina 
production is consumed by the Group in  
its own aluminium smelter, Kazakhstan 
Aluminium Smelter (‘KAS’).
In 2011 the Group shipped 251 kt (2010: 222 
kt) of primary aluminium. The 13.1% increase 
in volumes reflects KAS producing 100% of 
its design capacity for the first full calendar 
year. Deliveries to Russia in 2011 accounted 
for 104 kt (2010: 50 kt) of the total aluminium 
sales volume. The remainder of the 
aluminium was sold to Glencore, by way of a 
distribution agreement, to customers in Asia 
and Europe, which represented 28.7% (2010: 
39.8%) of the Division’s revenue in 2011. 
Results for the year
The Alumina and Aluminium Division 
continued to deliver strong results benefiting 
from favourable prices and additional 
aluminium sales. The Division contributed 
US$332 million, or 9.7%, to the Group’s 
Underlying EBITDA (2010: US$267 million; 
8.4%).
The Division’s revenue increased US$219 
million or 23.7% compared to 2010. Higher 
prices increased revenue by US$153 million 
whilst additional aluminium sales volumes 
contributed US$64 million and sales of other 
goods and services added US$2 million. 
The Division’s gross margin was stable 
although this was influenced by higher 
revenue off-set by alumina unit costs 
increasing by 22.9%.
Cost of sales increased US$150 million with 
the rise in unit costs amounting to US$109 
million and higher sales volumes adding 
US$41 million. Unit cost of sales increases 
were mainly due to higher prices of certain 
input materials such as fuel, coal and soda 
ash, as well as increased depreciation, wage 
rates and electricity tariffs. 
Depreciation and amortisation added US$9 
million to these cost increases. MET totalled 
US$15 million (2010: US$13 million).
Distribution costs increased US$3 million, or 
5.8%, to US$55 million (2010: US$52 million), 
mainly reflecting higher sales volumes. 
General and administrative expenses 
increased 18.2% to US$52 million (2010: 
US$44 million) primarily due to higher  
staff costs.
Capital expenditure 
The expansion of alumina production project 
was commissioned in July 2011. 
Completion of a 136 ktpa anode plant will 
allow ENRC to produce high quality anodes, 
reduce our dependence on third party 
suppliers and provide sufficient volumes for 
the Group’s increased aluminium production 
capacity. In 2011 the framing for the anode 
smelting case and the kiln lining were both 
completed. Start up and adjustment works 
have begun at the supporting facilities. The 
commissioning date and total estimated cost 
are both unchanged at H2 2012 and US$240 
million respectively.

Operational Review Other Non-ferrous
Revenue US$657 million
Competitive position
The Other Non-ferrous Division has a 
number of strategic advantages as it 
integrates newly acquired businesses within 
the DRC and Zambia.
The DRC contains a significant portion of  
the world’s copper resources outside of 
Chile, which have some of the highest 
copper grades available. Extensive drilling 
programmes are under way to increase the 
confidence levels of previously delineated 
resources. The additional capital expenditure 
on several projects will enable the capacity of 
copper production to grow very substantially 
ahead of the current production capacity of 
approximately 40 ktpa. The combination of 
increased scale and high copper grades will 
allow the Division over time to have a cost 
position in the lower half of the cost curve.
The DRC contains the world’s largest cobalt 
reserves, almost half of the world’s supply, 
with some of the highest ore grades available.
A significant advantage is that the cobalt 
production is independent of copper 
production and manufacture. The cobalt 
grades and ‘impurity loadings’ in the ore 
enable high quality cathode to be produced. 
Over time this will facilitate a bottom-quartile 
cost position and greater protection against 
price volatility. 
Exploration
In the DRC, the extensive drilling programme 
continued through 2011 with the completion 
of an additional 136,130 metres (2010: 
103,200 metres). Since the acquisition  
of Central Africa Mining and Exploration 
Company PLC (‘CAMEC’) drilling at Boss 
Mining has totalled 239,330 metres. The 
Boss Mining technical team is currently 
analysing this data. In conjunction with our 
joint venture partner, the drilling programme 
continued at Camrose in 2011, with 28,340 
metres completed on the Mashitu deposits 
and 3,760 metres completed on the Kii and 
Kalukundi deposits. Camrose aims to define 
Probable Reserves during 2012 to accelerate 
development of these assets. 
In South Africa, there are two separate 
exploration programmes underway focusing 
on manganese and fluorspar. The Kongoni 
Manganese Project is located in the Kalahari 
Manganese Field (‘KMF’) and comprises 
primarily the mineral rights to Kongoni 311, 
which were acquired in December 2011 
(acquisition of Rubio Holdings Limited).  
The KMF has historical total Indicated and 
Inferred Resources amounting to 147 Mt at 
35.7% manganese and 5.9% iron. Further 
exploration is in progress, with the objective 
of completing a bankable feasibility study in 
H2 2012. The fluorspar project is situated in 
the North West province of South Africa and 
was acquired as part of CAMEC in 2009. 
The current drilling programme is focused  
on proving the substantial shallow open cast 
resources to indicated category. 
Drilling in Mozambique on the Group’s coal 
licences on the north shore of Cahora Bassa 
(Licences 869 and 870) commenced during 
the year. Material coal was discovered in 
mineable blocks on these licences and a 
JORC-compliant statement will be 
completed in Q2 2012. The feasibility study 
on Project Estima (Licence 871) is due for 
completion Q2 2012.
Integration of ENRC’s 
copperbelt assets 
continues to be focused 
on exploration, resource 
delineation, mine 
planning, operational 
efficiency, processing 
methodologies and 
recoveries. Emphasis  
has currently been placed 
on expanding copper 
production capacity 
through the Boss Mining 
copper oxide expansion  
project and the 
development of the 
Camrose Mashitu 
operation.

Operational Review Mining
Copper was sourced mainly from Kabolela 
North mine at an average strip ratio of 3.2 
bank cubic metres (‘BCM’) of waste per 
tonne of ore, while Mukondo Mountain 
continued to supply cobalt ore at a strip  
ratio of 10 BCM of waste per tonne of ore.  
A total of 1.06 million tonnes of cobalt ore 
was mined from Mukondo while copper  
from Kabolela North amounted to 1.45 million 
tonnes with the balance sourced from 
Mukondo. During 2011 pre stripping 
commenced at Kabolela South for  
mining in 2012.
Production: Copper
Production volumes increased by 48.7%  
at Boss Mining’s heap leach operations, 
compared with 2010, due to higher capacity 
from additional heaps as well as additional 
electrowinning capacity from three extra 
tankhouses. The sixth tankhouse was 
commissioned in December 2011. Lower 
copper mining volumes were offset by an 
increased mining grade of 3.0% (2010: 2.3%).
Production: Cobalt
At Boss Mining, cobalt production increased 
during 2011 due to a higher mined grade  
of 1.39% (2010: 1.29%). Cobalt concentrate 
produced at Boss Mining increased by  
9% against the comparable period. Cobalt 
volumes at Chambishi increased by 49%, 
however 2010 reflected only nine months  
of full production. 
Supply and demand
Copper mine supply has historically 
under-performed expectations, with 2011 
being no exception. Forecasts for 2011  
mine production made in late 2010 estimated 
an increase of around 3% year on year. 
Estimates in early 2012 have suggested that 
201 1 mine supply in fact fell by 3% to 15.6 Mt. 
The reasons for the 1.05 Mt expected supply 
short-fall in 2011 include slower than 
expected ramp ups, technical issues and 
unexpected declines in grade. Fuelling the 
shortfall has been a number of high profile 
strikes, affecting some of the world’s  
largest operations.
It is estimated that global copper 
consumption growth slowed during 2011  
to approximately 4%, from more than 10%  
in 2010. The main contributor to global 
copper demand growth has been China, 
where consumption rose by 8% year on year 
to around 7 .8 Mt in 2011, accounting for 
almost 40% of the global growth in copper 
demand. Chinese copper demand growth 
slowed in the latter months of 2011, due 
mainly to fiscal tightening and a drawdown  
of copper inventories. 
Within China, power infrastructure projects 
continue to account for the majority of new 
demand, while residential construction linked 
to the social housing projects and demand 
related to consumer goods have both 
remained strong.
It is estimated that total global demand for 
cobalt increased to 67 kt in 2011, roughly  
a 9% increase against 2010. Global supply  
of cobalt is estimated to have increased  
to around 79 kt, which is a 10% increase 
compared to supply in 2010. 
Sales and pricing: Copper 
Despite price declines over the course of 
2011, the average full year price for copper 
as traded on the LME was the best on 
record and 17% higher than in 2010. This 
was due to concerns regarding copper 
supply, causing a strong price rally in H1 
2011. After spending most of the first nine 
months of 2011 trading within a US$9,000  
to US$10,000 per tonne range, the LME 
copper price collapsed in October to a low  
of US$6,635 per tonne, as a result of the 
debt crisis in Europe, destocking and credit 
tightening in China and a faltering US 
economic recovery. The copper price 
recovered in late 2011, rebounding to  
end the year at US$7 ,554 per tonne.
Contracts are typically negotiated annually, 
fixing a premium, discount or ‘refining 
charge’ (for varying quality and delivery 
locations) alongside the period of which the 
LME price is fixed. During H1 201 1 premiums 
for higher grade copper and discounts for 
lower grades were well below 2011 annual 
contract terms due to a slowdown in physical 
spot purchases given the record price levels. 
During Q3 and in particular Q4, low 
consumer stocks and lower LME prices 
attracted buyers back to the market. Coupled 
with reduced scrap availability and major 
mine-supply disruption, premiums increased 
notably and refining charges to treat lower 
grade cathode reduced significantly.
Sales and pricing: Cobalt 
The cobalt metal price stood at US$17 .75  
per pound at the start of 2011, peaking at 
US$18.30 per pound in early March 2011

Operational Review Mozambique coal
Through the acquisition of CAMEC  
in 2009, the Group acquired 12 coal 
exploration licences in the Tete 
Province of Mozambique covering 
over 240,000 hectares of land. 
Mozambique is recognised as one of 
the world’s largest undeveloped coal 
basins, conveniently positioned to 
play an important role in meeting the 
increased needs of the emerging 
Indian and Chinese markets.
With these licences in the Tete basin,  
the Group has an in-house indicated and 
measured resource estimate (non-JORC 
compliant) of up to 2.8 billion tonnes of 
coal including a full feasibility on Project 
Estima (Licence 871) (1.34 billion tonnes 
indicated and measured – JORC 
compliant) which will be completed in the 
first half of 2012. With Project Estima and 
our other licences we have the potential to 
develop significant coal production up to 
20 million tpa, over a life of mine of more 
than 30 years. 
The Group is in an excellent position to 
deliver on its diversification strategy in the 
export coal market, with the combination 
of world class coal resources, an 
achievable logistics solution and proximity 
to the world’s major emerging consumers 
of coal.

Operational Review Other Non-ferrous continued •	 Expansion of copper (oxide) production: 
Phases 1 and 2 of the expansion project 
have been completed. Leaching and 
electrowinning capacity has increased  
at Luita with the addition of five heap  
leach pads and three new tankhouses, 
increasing production to 40 ktpa of 
copper. The total current project cost is 
estimated at US$150 million, a reduction 
from the US$280 million previously 
reported due to the removal of the acid 
plant from the project scope (US$60 
million); the reduction of the Luita 
Expansion Phase 1 scope, with five heap 
leach pads planned instead of 10 and 
three tankhouses planned instead of five 
(reduced throughput); and the exclusion  
of a new crusher circuit (not required due to 
the reduced throughput). A further phase 
to increase capacity up to approximately 
50 ktpa is currently being assessed.
•	 Expansion of copper (sulphide) production: 
The construction of a 70 ktpa contained 
copper sulphide/oxide flotation 
concentrate plant (30 ktpa sulphide and 
40 ktpa oxide) is being considered at an 
estimated cost of US$465 million with 
anticipated completion in 2013.
•	 Chambishi copper plant (LME grade A): 
Construction of a new solvent extraction 
and electrowinning ‘SX/EW’ plant at 
Chambishi is scheduled to be completed 
in 2012 and will increase capacity to 55 
ktpa from the existing 24 ktpa of grade B 
copper cathode. The project entails 
installing two new copper solvent 
extraction circuits as well as modifying and 
upgrading the existing electrowinning 
tankhouse to produce grade A copper 
cathode product. The total projected cost 
is US$80 million.
•	 Oxide cobalt SX/EW plant: Construction  
of the cobalt SX/EW plant was partially 
completed and Phase 1 (copper solvent 
extraction) has been commissioned. 
Phase 2 was suspended pending a review 
of the economic viability of the project.
and reaching a low of US$13.45 per pound 
at the close of December 2011. The average 
for the year was US$16.00 per pound. The 
decrease in price in 2011 was mainly due to 
oversupply of material and slowing demand 
from China. 
Results for the year
The Other Non-ferrous Division contributed 
US$74 million, or 2.2%, to the Group’s 
Underlying EBITDA (2010: US$67 million; 
2.1%). In 2011, the primary revenue and 
Underlying EBITDA generating businesses of 
the Division continued to be the copper and 
cobalt operations in the DRC and Zambia. 
The Division’s revenue increased by US$175 
million which was mainly attributable to 
higher cobalt and copper sales volumes 
contributing US$68 million and US$62 
million respectively with favourable metal 
prices contributing a further US$30 million. 
Sales of other goods and services (primarily 
SABOT’s transport services) contributed an 
additional US$15 million. 
The Division’s gross margin percentage fell  
to 16.9% from 20.1% primarily as a result  
of increased cost of sales. The increase in 
cost of sales was predominantly due to the 
increase in production volumes and higher 
non-cash depreciation and amortisation 
charges of US$55 million of which US$25 
million is attributable to mineral rights.
Although the overall unit cost of copper 
increased to US$5,123/t (2010: US$25/t),  
the unit cost (excluding depreciation, 
amortisation and by-product credits) 
decreased by US$593/t in 2011. The 
increase in the overall copper unit cost was 
attributable to an increase in non-cash cost 
of US$1,043/t coupled with a significant 
decrease in cobalt concentrate by-product 
credit on a per tonne basis. Cobalt unit costs 
decreased by US$5,467/t due to the Division 
achieving economies of scale and improving 
operational efficiencies at the Chambishi 
plant. Unit cost (excluding depreciation, 
amortisation and by-product credits) 
decreased by US$5,631/t.
Distribution costs increased primarily as a 
consequence of the higher sales volumes. 
General and administrative expenses 
increased US$17 million, or 27 .4%, to US$79 
million (US$62 million in 2010). This increase 
is primarily due to the provision for the 
impairment of trade receivables  
(US$11 million) and increases in staff costs 
as a result of recruiting additional technical 
professionals to strengthen the management 
team of the rapidly expanding business.
The increase in exploration cost of US$53 
million is a result of the Division focusing on 
the delineation of greenfield copper and 
cobalt deposits to increase current resources. 
Exploration activities also continued in the 
Division’s coal and fluorite deposits. 
Net other operating income increased to 
US$12 million primarily relating to gains 
arising from the lower than provisioned 
settlement of a legal dispute at Chambishi 
and the transfer of exploration interest to  
the Taurus joint venture.
The results for 2010 have been restated to 
reflect the transfer of the SABOT business 
from the Logistics Division as detailed in  
note 3.
Capital expenditure 
In order to fully utilise synergies arising from 
the late 2011 and 2012 acquisitions in Africa, 
the Group is undertaking a review of its 
growth strategy for the Other Non-ferrous 
Division. As this continues, the Group may 
consider a number of necessary 
amendments to the previously announced 
investment programme. 
ENRC spent more than US$70 million on 
exploration in Africa during 2011, drilling 
more than 136,000 metres in the DRC.

Revenue US$248 million
Production
Coal extraction was broadly flat at 20, 1 10 kt 
(2010: 20, 102 kt). In addition to sales of 
surplus electricity, the Energy Division also 
sold 6,260 kt of coal to third parties (2010: 
6,964 kt), which represented 31. 1% of total 
coal mined (2010: 34.6%). 
Sales and pricing: Coal
Strong demand from the industrial and power 
sectors resulted in coal output in Kazakhstan 
increasing 4.5% in 201 1. The Energy 
Division’s total sales of coal to third parties 
nevertheless fell 10. 1% in 201 1, due to growth 
in the Group’s internal consumption. In 
Kazakhstan, ENRC sold 2. 1 million tonnes of 
coal to third parties (2010: 3.0 million tonnes), 
at an average sales price of KZT1, 155 
(US$7 .9) per tonne (2010: KZT934 (US$6.3) 
per tonne), an increase of 23.7% in local 
currency terms. The 0.9 million tonne 
reduction in coal sales reflected the decision 
to divert some coal sales to higher margin 
Russian customers. Russian utilities 
increased their steam coal imports from 
Kazakhstan, which was prompted by a rise in 
electricity generation in Russia in response to 
the improving economy and a rise in industrial 
demand. The Energy Division sold 4.2 million 
tonnes of coal to Russia (2010: 3.9 million 
tonnes) at an average sales price of US$28.4 
per tonne (2010: US$24.9 per tonne). 
Sales and pricing: Electricity
Total electricity generation in Kazakhstan 
grew 3.7% to 85.8 billion kWh (2010: 82.7 
billion kWh). Energy Division sales of 
electricity to third parties increased 14.7% in 
201 1. The average sales price to third parties 
in local currency increased 19.9% to KZT5.6 
(US 3.82 cents) per kWh (2010: KZT4.67 (US 
3. 17 cents) per kWh. This increase was in  
line with the State regulated tariff price cap 
increase set in Kazakhstan.
Results for the year
The results of the Energy Division were 
significantly affected by higher sales prices, 
including electricity which were in line  
with the State regulated annual price cap 
increases in Kazakhstan. The Division 
contributed US$360 million, or 10.5%,  
to the Group’s Underlying EBITDA (2010: 
US$308 million; 9.6%).
The Energy Division’s third party revenue 
increased 24.0% to US$248 million (2010: 
US$200 million) reflecting a shift towards third 
party sales of electricity as a result of reduced 
demand from the Ferroalloys and the Iron Ore 
Divisions. Higher prices increased total 
revenue by US$35 million and higher sales 
volumes by US$13 million. The Division’s 
sales to other Group entities increased 
US$28 million, or 8.2%, to US$370 million 
In 201 1, the Energy 
Division produced 13,993 
GWh (2010: 13,71 1 GWh), 
of which 71.5% (2010: 
73.9%) was used by 
other Divisions internally 
within the Group.

Operational Review (2010: US$342 million), as a result of 
increased electricity consumption for 
aluminium production (the launch of Phase 2 
of the aluminium smelter) and increased 
demand for coal from the Alumina and 
Aluminium, Iron Ore and Ferroalloys Divisions.
The Division’s gross margin fell to 62.9%  
from 64.8% primarily as a result of increased 
unit costs.
Cost of sales increased 19.9% to US$229 
million (2010: US$191 million) driven by 
increased sales volumes of electricity (US$2 
million), depreciation and amortisation (US$15 
million) and higher unit costs of sales added 
US$21 million. The main factors leading to 
the increase in depreciation were the 
commissioning of Power Unit 2 at Aksu  
and the replacement of equipment. 
The unit cost increase was affected by a  
rise in purchase prices for materials and 
spare parts, particularly for explosives and 
fuel along with higher material consumption 
at coal mining operations due to increased 
stripping volumes. In addition, increased 
wage rates and higher ecological payments 
also affected the unit cost of sales growth.
Distribution costs increased 15.5% to US$67 
million (2010: US$58 million), due to increases 
in transportation tariffs and more volumes of 
coal were shipped to more distant Russian 
customers (compared to Kazakhstani 
customers).
General and administrative expenses 
reduced US$7 million, or 21.9%, to US$25 
million (2010: US$32 million), principally due 
to lower sponsorship and donations during 
the year.
Capital expenditure 
The new Power Unit 2 at Aksu, with a 
capacity of 325 MW, was commissioned  
in June 201 1.
In April 201 1 Power Unit 6 was taken offline 
for reconstruction and in H2 201 1 the  
Power Unit was completely disassembled. 
Foundation works for the turbine have been 
completed and construction and installation 
works are advancing due to the early delivery 
of equipment. The commissioning date for 
this project remains unchanged and it is 
expected to be delivered in 2013 at a total 
estimated cost of US$265 million.
ENRC increased its power generating 
capacity with the commissioning of the 
new Power Unit 2 at Aksu in June 2011.

Results for the year
The Division contributed US$95 million,  
or 2.8%, to the Group’s Underlying EBITDA 
in 2011 (2010: US$68 million, 2.1%).
The Division’s third party revenue increased 
slightly to US$149 million, or 0.7%, (2010: 
US$148 million). Sales to other Group 
Divisions increased US$78 million, or 67 .8%, 
to US$193 million (2010: US$115 million) due 
to providing wagons rented from third parties 
to transport ferroalloys and aluminium.
Cost of sales increased US$44 million, or 
23.9%, to US$228 million (2010: US$184 
million) mainly driven by increased costs of 
wagon rental due to a shortage of availability.
General and administrative expenses went 
up 88.0% to US$47 million (2010: US$25 
million), principally due to an expense relating 
to the valuation at fair value less cost to sell 
of assets held for sale.
The results for 2010 have been restated to 
reflect the transfer of the SABOT business  
to the Other Non-ferrous Division as detailed

The Logistics Division plans to expand its 
railway fleet to improve the self-sufficiency  
of the Group in the transport of its own 
materials. ENRC’s railway fleet has expanded 
significantly in 2011, with the purchase of 
2,517 wagons and 1,215 containers. In 2012 
it is envisaged that the Group will purchase 
approximately 2,330 additional wagons. The Logistics Division

Operational Review This review presents the 
headlines of our progress 
and performance in 201 1 
in the key areas that 
support and enable us to 
achieve high standards of 
corporate responsibility. 
Further information will  
be presented in our first 
Sustainable Development 
Report, to be issued later 
in 2012. 
Governance of Sustainable 
Development (‘SD’) 
In 2011 we have taken steps to achieve 
stronger Group level leadership and to 
establish greater accountability within  
our operational Divisions to go beyond  
regulatory compliance. 
We recognise the importance of including 
SD risks into our strategic and operational 
decisions, in capital expenditure 
programmes, and leadership remuneration. 
We also understand the need for formal 
processes and controls to ensure internal 
accountability in environmental, social and 
economic performance.
We appointed Professor Dr Dieter Ameling 
as the Board sponsor for SD. This, coupled 
with the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) 
chairing the Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community (‘HSEC’) Committee, ensures 
independent expertise and leadership 
respectively. The Chief Financial Officer 
(‘CFO’) is now responsible for the 
development of SD reporting, including  
data systems and controls.
We have established the role of Group  
SD Manager reporting to the CFO and  
with direct liaison with the Board sponsor.  
The embedding of SD into our business 
management processes is driven through 
the operational review meetings which  
are conducted four times per year. These 
meetings are chaired by the CEO and 
attended by Presidents and General 
Directors. An SD working group with 
divisional representation provides support  
to the management on the implementation  
of SD initiatives. The Africa business is now 
included in the governance structures  
for HSEC.
Performance summary
We have started a data improvement 
programme to enhance the quality and 
scope of the HSEC data we use as a 
business. As part of this programme, in  
2011 we sought external assurance for  
the first time. The Assurance Report from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP can be found 
on page 70. Our HSEC Reporting Principles, 
which provide the basis for our reporting,  
are available at www.enrc.com/en-GB/
Media1/Reporting. As a result of this 
programme we are using the 2011 data as 
our baseline data set and have not included 
prior year data on the basis that it is not 
directly comparable.
Key activities and progress in 2011
Safety
Safety is a top priority for the Group,  
and it continues to be one of the core 
fundamentals of our growth strategy.
Our recording of fatalities and lost time 
incidents is based on the definitions set  
out in Kazakhstani regulations. We 
acknowledged in 2011 that the scope of our 
reporting was not consistent with recognised 
international practices. As a result fewer 
incidents are reported as work-related.  
For example fatalities that occur as a result  
of an employee’s failure to follow procedures, 
or due to alcohol, are not included. In the 
case of lost time injuries, lost time tends 
mostly to be authorised only for severe 
cases, for example fractures and breaks.  
We are working towards gathering more 
comprehensive data for 2012 but recognise 
that it will take time to change practices.
Kazakhstani standards also do not require 
reporting of contractor cases. Going beyond 
these requirements we have included 
contractor fatalities reported to us for the  
first time this year. We are starting to capture 
contractor lost time cases for internal 
reporting in 2012. 
Any fatality occurring as a result of work 
activities is unacceptable. We investigate all 
cases to understand the causes of fatalities 
and lost time events and take steps to reduce 
their occurrence throughout the Group.

Sustainable Development Review Community Social Investment (‘CSI’)
Most of our CSI is made into Kazakhstan 
through the Komek Foundation which was 
established in 2008. The Komek Foundation 
is governed through a board of trustees and, 
from 2011, has been chaired by the CEO. 
The Komek Foundation’s long-term focus  
is on the implementation of programmes 
aimed at supporting the Group’s own 
employees as well as providing finance  
for investment in the development of cultural, 
education, sport and health facilities. 
In addition to our established CSI activities, 
we made US$98 million contributions to  
the Nazarbayev Fund to support the 
development of university education in 
Kazakhstan. This is done as part of the 
Global Strategic Leadership Programme, 
which is central to the Group People Strategy.
We intend to review our Group CSI strategy 
in 2012/13. This may alter the way in which 
investment decisions are made to ensure 
improved alignment to our business needs 
including in particular an emphasis on skills 
development and creating economic 
capacity. We are also putting in place new 
procedures and controls for CSI management 
aimed at mitigating legal and compliance risks 
and to be able to report on the actual use of 
funds that we provide. This approach will also 
be adopted in Africa and Brazil where CSI 
programmes are just being established.
Employees 
We employed 74,989 people at the end of 
2011 across the majority of our operations 
and including all those where there is a high 
labour force (our average employee number 
covering all the Group operations through 
2011 was 77 ,441). Recognising the growth  
of the Group and continued global 
diversification, we are in the process of 
developing a new Group People Strategy 
which will be launched in 2012. This will 
include development of policies and 
procedures as well as further developing 
functional responsibilities and capabilities.
We encourage employee engagement 
through established systems of 
remuneration, training, employee 
committees, collective agreements and 
consultations. We believe that all our people 
should be treated equally with respect and 
dignity. Our commitment to equality is 
supported through giving full and fair 
consideration to applications for employment 
by disabled persons, having regards to their 
particular aptitudes and abilities; as well as 
continuing the employment of, and arranging 
appropriate training for, employees who have 
become disabled during their employment.
All our employees have the right to enter  
into a collective agreement and join a  
union. The majority of our employees in  
the Republic of Kazakhstan and Russia  
are members of trade unions. The  
industrial agreements signed in 2010 at  
our Kazakhstani and Russian operations 
continue to be in place. In Brazil, our  
people may voluntarily join unions.  
Our operations in Africa also maintain 
cooperative relationships with the unions. 
We have established internal policies 
addressing human rights as well as a Group 
Code of Conduct which has been updated 
in 2011. We are committed to uphold the UN 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
do not tolerate any form of discrimination or 
unfair treatment. Our whistleblowing hotline 
is one of the methods by which potential 
human rights concerns are identified; 
incidents raised through the hotline are 
investigated and reviewed. No cases of  
child labour and forced labour have been 
identified through the management 
processes we have in place. Investment in 
healthcare and medical facilities has been  
a major part of our employment packages 
over a number of years. 
Water
Almost all the Group’s operations are  
located in water-stressed areas and we 
expect ever-rising demand and competition 
for water resources. We are committed to 
maximising water use efficiency as we are 
conscious of the risks of water scarcity.
In 2011 the Group withdrew 1,926 million 
cubic metres of water. Almost all of the water 
withdrawn is used as cooling water for EEC. 
This water is taken from the Irtysh River 
under permit and goes through cooling 
towers; all of this water, except a small 
amount lost in use, is returned to the river. 
Strict control is established over the quality  
of the water returned back to the natural 
source. Absence of water pollution  
is checked, monitored and confirmed by  
the Kazakhstani State authorities. 
Water use is subject to annual planning by 
the environmental and finance teams using 
established processes according to legal 
requirements. In Kazakhstan and Russia 
monthly reporting to the State regulator  
on water withdrawn and discharged is 
mandatory. In Africa our operations are also 
subject to strong regulatory control over 
water use and discharge. In 2012 we will 
review our definitions for reporting water use 
and extend our reporting on water recycled 
and re-used enabling more comprehensive 
analysis and priority setting.
Ethics and conduct
The Group’s compliance programme 
to ensure adequate procedures has 
included the development, roll-out and 
completion of a first cycle of ethics 
training and Code of Conduct training. 
The Group has implemented web-based 
ethics training and Code of Conduct 
training modules, ‘Trust but Verify’, which is 
mandatory for selected employees. The 
selection process involved identifying 
predominantly senior employees in key 
functions, for example procurement, 
finance and marketing, who work with third 
parties and execute financial transactions. 
The selection exercise was completed  
by the regional heads of Human Resources 
and reviewed by the Global Compliance 
Department. This training has been 
implemented with support from Global 
Compliance Inc., an international and 
widely respected provider of compliance 
solutions. Allied to this, the Group 
Compliance Department has conducted 
face-to-face training in Kazakhstan on  
the same topics. Face-to-face training  
has also been provided on competition  
law and international trade and sanctions 
compliance to each sales and  
marketing office. 
The Global Compliance Department in 
London is also working with Global 
Compliance Inc. to fine tune its training 
programmes to make the various learning 
modules more immediately relevant. In 
order to do this, we are incorporating some 
of the scenarios which have emanated from 
our whistleblowing hotline. We expect 
these refreshed case studies to be 
presented in the second cycle of the 
programme, which should be rolled out 
during 2012. 
Global Compliance Inc. has also  
assisted the Group in implementing  
and independently administering the 
whistleblowing hotline and communications 
programme. This is staffed 24 hours a day, 
every day, and is available in five different 
languages. This has been in place since 
May 2011. 
The Global Compliance Department has 
also engaged Forensic Risk Alliance since 
April 2011 to conduct a ‘books and records 
review’ across the Group. This is helping us 
to identify areas where we can improve our 
systems and controls, and ensure we are 
aligned to meet our corporate values of fair 
dealing and legal compliance.

Sustainable Development Review continued Healthcare at ENRC 
sites in Africa
Within the Group, we understand the 
important role that global businesses 
can play in the rapid intervention to 
stop the spread of disease amongst 
employees and members of our 
communities. The spread of HIV/AIDS 
in Africa is a major public health issue 
and a significant risk to our 
employees. There are also serious 
threats of tuberculosis and malaria  
in some African countries.
In 2011 we have taken steps to improve the 
quality of occupational healthcare available 
for our workers in Africa. As public health 
issues in Africa are important for our 
current and future employees we provide 
significant medical services to employee 
dependants and community members.
We have worked closely with local 
communities to develop an effective HIV/
AIDS programme based on preventive 
care, detection, support and treatment.  
At Chambishi in Zambia, the Group 
provides voluntary counselling and testing 
and a successful active treatment 
programme in conjunction with support  
for the government HIV/AIDS programme. 
In the DRC, the Group runs a hospital  
with 110 beds and three clinics with 
approximately 30 beds. These facilities 
support the entire population of Kakanda 
as there is no other medical service 
available in this area. 
In Zambia, the Group runs a 16 bed 
hospital which treats approximately  
330 people per month. The hospital 
provides testing for tuberculosis and has  
a well-established voluntary counselling  
and testing and HIV treatment support 
programme.

Sustainable Development Review continued Energy and climate 
change
Energy consumption is a major factor 
in the Group’s operations, amounting 
to 293,300 terajoules of energy in 2011. 
Of this, 83% was sourced from coal. 
A greenhouse gas inventory for 2011 
has been prepared for all operations. 
The total greenhouse gas emissions 
associated with direct and indirect 
energy consumption amounted to 
26.9 million tonnes CO 2 equivalent.
Our production-related energy 
consumption accounts for the largest part 
of our greenhouse gas emissions and this 
remains the focus of our efforts to reduce 
CO 2 emissions. In 2011 we launched a 
Group-wide energy efficiency programme 
that should enable us to develop new,  
and consolidate existing, efforts aimed  
at reducing energy dependency and 
developing our response to the climate 
change problem.
The programme consists of four key 
streams of work: 
•	 Implementing proper performance 
management processes and systems;
•	 Identifying feasible projects to improve 
energy use in existing equipment and 
facilities;
•	 Integrating energy efficiency into capital 
investments toll gating requirements; and
•	 Investing in research and development  
of energy-efficient technologies.
Implementation of the programme  
should help deliver better management 
decisions and contribute to reducing 
carbon-related risks.

Sustainable Development Review continued Risk and the Board of Directors
The Board is ultimately responsible for maintaining a sound risk management and internal control system. Our system of risk management 
and internal control is designed to identify, manage and mitigate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. The system provides 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
There are ongoing processes in place for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting on the significant risks faced by the Group. 
These processes are in place for the year under review up to, and including, the date of the approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
In the Annual Report and Accounts for the preceding year, we reported on 10 principal risks. These risks were reviewed during the course  
of the current year by the Executive Committee, which determined that our risk environment had changed:
Positively as a result of:
•	 Continued enhancement of our risk reporting and compliance framework driving further accountability and where necessary additional 
remediation plans;
•	 Greater focus on ‘tone from the top’ to enhance our risk culture; and
•	 Implementation of key risk management action plans.
Negatively as a result of:
•	 Downgrade of the Company’s credit rating;
•	 Increased competition for high calibre mining talent; and
•	 Increased external scrutiny.
Accordingly, the principal risks to the execution of the Group’s business strategy are shown in the rest of this section. We have explained  
the nature of each risk, identifying the possible impact and the associated strategic priorities. In addition, we have described the mitigating 
activity to address those risks, as well as our plans for further enhancements.

Liquidity
Context
Over the last three years the Group executed a number of 
acquisitions and purchased businesses in Africa and Brazil.  
The Group has also approved a number of large scale greenfield 
and brownfield projects in Brazil and Africa that will require 
significant additional financing. The Group has recently been 
downgraded by both Standard and Poor’s (‘S&P’) and Moody’s 
credit rating agencies. The Group’s credit ratings are now BB-  
with S&P and BA3 with Moody’s, with both ratings on a negative 
outlook. It is possible that as a result of this action the Group’s 
access to future sources of debt finance may be restricted.
Risk
Failure to arrange or provide sufficient financing for the Group’s 
operating, investment and mergers and acquisitions activities.
Possible impact
Inability to meet payment obligations and restriction of the Group’s 
ability to raise finance, or inadequate funds available to complete 
projects and make further acquisitions.

Our Governance Structure continued
50 Unlocking Value Our Governance Structure continued
The Board’s role is to lead 
the Company by ensuring 
good management from 
the top downwards and 
there is a formal schedule  
of matters reserved for 
the Board. 
These include:
• Setting values and standards that shall  
be used to guide the affairs of the 
Company;
• Setting the long-term objectives and 
commercial strategy of the Company;
•  Agreeing policies and processes to guide 
the affairs of the Company; 
•  Responsibility for the overall management 
of the Group; 
•  Agreeing any changes to the Company’s 
structure and capital; 
•  Responsibility for financial reporting and 
controls; and
•  Approving major capital projects.
The ENRC Board takes its responsibility 
under the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Code’) very seriously and considers 
that, during the 2011 financial year, it 
complied with the Code in all respects  
with the exception, albeit temporarily, of 
Code Provision A.4.1 regarding the 
appointment of a Senior Independent 
Director (‘SID’). See further information on 
the role of the SID on page 53.
During 2011 ENRC addressed various 
governance challenges including revising the 
composition of the Board, strengthening its 
compliance function and investigating certain 
of its operations. It set up an Anti-bribery and 
Corruption Steering Committee to coordinate 
the Group’s activities to combat bribery, 
fraud and other corruption and initiated a 
comprehensive review of its bribery risk. 
These issues are dealt with in more detail  
in this report.
Board composition
At the start of 2011 the Board comprised 14 
Directors. In addition to the Chairman, who 
was not considered independent, there were 
10 non-executive Directors, seven of whom 
were regarded as independent by the Board.
At the start of the year, Mr Felix Vulis decided 
to step down from the Board for personal 
reasons. He agreed to remain as Director 
and Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) until a 
successor could be found. The Nomination 
Committee retained an external consultant  
to search for a replacement. 
Immediately before the AGM on 8 June 2011, 
two non-independent Directors, Messrs 
Abdraman Yedilbayev and Eduard Utepov, 
stood down. Further to the vote at the AGM 
two independent non-executive Directors, 
Mr Kenneth Olisa and Sir Richard Sykes, 
ceased to be Directors.
Following the corporate governance review, 
which is detailed below, a further 
independent Director, Mr Terence Wilkinson, 
was appointed on 28 September 2011. Also 
on 28 September 2011, Mr Vulis withdrew  
his resignation and remains as a Director  
and CEO and Mr Mehmet Dalman was 
appointed as SID.
At the year end, the Board comprised  
11 Directors, of whom six were considered 
by the Board to be independent.
On 3 February 2012, Dr Johannes Sittard 
tendered his resignation as non-executive 
Director and Chairman of the Board. The 
Nomination Committee recommended the 
appointment of Mr Dalman as Chairman to 
the Board and he assumed that role with 
effect from 3 February 2012, at the same 
time relinquishing his role as SID.
The changes made to the Board during the 
year are summarised in the table below.
Board evaluation and corporate 
governance review
Towards the end of 2010 the Company 
invited ICSA Board Evaluation to carry out  
an independent evaluation of the Board.  
This process was comprehensive and 
exacting and the results were discussed  
by the Board and Nomination Committee 
during the spring and summer of 2011.  
The evaluation addressed Board balance, 
how members of the Board interacted and 
the perceived challenges of operating an 
international, emerging markets Company 
with a London listing. The key conclusion  
of the evaluation was that the Board needed 
to review its composition to ensure that it 
continued to be effective. 
The Board then initiated a full corporate 
governance review (the ‘Review’) to help 
address the issues raised through the 
evaluation process. The Chairman asked 
ICSA Board Evaluation, who had had no 
other relationship with the Group when  
it was appointed to assist with the Board 
evaluation, to help with the initial stages  
of the Review. 
The Review was led by the Chairman  
and the results discussed by the  
Nomination Committee which then made 
recommendations to the Board. The 
Chairman held discussions with each 
Director, with major shareholders and  
with the Founder Shareholders to gather 
their views on Board representation. 
The Nomination Committee reviewed the 
output of the Chairman’s various discussions 
and recommended to the Board that its 
optimum size was 11 Directors, six of whom 
should be independent non-executive 
Directors. It also identified the need to 
enhance the mining experience on the 
Board, particularly in the context of the 
Group’s move into Africa. An external 
consultant was therefore instructed to search 
for appropriate candidates to join the Board 
to address the need for operational and 
African mining expertise.

All ad hoc.
Following the search by an external 
consultant, the Nomination Committee 
recommended the appointment of  
Mr Wilkinson to the Board. He has 
operational mining experience and prior 
involvement in listed companies. The 
Nomination Committee also recommended 
the appointment of Mr Dalman as SID.  
When Mr Vulis offered to withdraw his  
earlier resignation as CEO, the Nomination 
Committee recommended to the Board  
that the withdrawal of the resignation  
be approved. 
The Nomination Committee was 
strengthened with the addition of the SID 
and it was renamed the ‘Nomination and 
Corporate Governance Committee’ to reflect 
the extension of its remit to include oversight 
of corporate governance arrangements and 
compliance with the Code.
Board independence and balance
Throughout the year, the Board has 
maintained a balance of independent and 
non-independent Directors such that at least 
half the Board has comprised independent 
Directors.
Mr Beketayev is not considered by the Board 
to be independent as he is a representative 
of The State Property and Privatisation 
Committee of the Ministry of Finance of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan. Mr Utepov, who 
served on the Board until 8 June 2011, was 
also a representative of The State Property 
and Privatisation Committee of the Ministry 
of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
and consequently not independent. 
Under a relationship agreement with the 
Company, each of the Founder Shareholders 
of the Company has a right to appoint one 
Director to the Board, subject to them using 
reasonable endeavours to ensure that there 
is a majority of independent non-executive 
Directors on the Board, provided his 
shareholder group controls at least 10%  
or more of the voting rights exercisable  
at general meetings of the Company.  
Mr Ibragimov exercised this right and his 
representative, Mr Yedilbayev, served on  
the Board until 8 June 2011. Following the 
Board changes on 8 June 2011, none of the 
Founder Shareholders has a representative 
on the Board. 
The table below shows the composition of 
the Board, and the Board balance at various 
times during the year.

Board processes 
Twenty-two Board meetings and three Board 
sub-committee meetings were held during 
the year. Eight of the Board meetings were 
regular scheduled meetings, and 14 were 
called to deal with specific issues. 
The ad hoc meetings were held to discuss 
the following:
•  B o a r d c o mp o si t i on ;
• Financing;
• Approval of the shareholder circular  
for Shubarkol; and
• Adjournment of the General Meeting to 
approve the exercise of the Shubarkol 
option.
Where a Director was unable to attend  
a meeting, he was still supplied with the 
papers before the meeting and was able  
to discuss the business with the Chairman  
or CEO.
The schedule below shows the Directors’ 
attendance at scheduled Board and 
Committee meetings. 
The Company recognises that supplying  
the Board with good information is essential 
to good corporate governance. Board 
members are sent hard copy Board packs  
at the very latest by the weekend before each 
scheduled Board meeting. In addition, they 
each have access to the packs electronically. 
For ad hoc meetings, the practice differs 
depending on the nature of the business  
to be discussed and the urgency of the 
meeting. The Company Secretary is 
52 Unlocking Value
Corporate Governance Report continued responsible for ensuring good information 
flows between the Board and its Committees 
and between senior management and the 
non-executive Directors. 
The Board frequently receives presentations 
and updates from senior managers below 
Board level; not only does this give the 
Directors the opportunity to question 
employees about the running of the 
business, it also gives senior managers  
the chance to meet the Directors and gain  
a better understanding of their concerns.  
In 2011, these presentations included:
•  Regular updates from the Head of Investor 
Relations and the Global HR Director;
• Regular updates on business and project 
development from the Head of Mergers 
and Acquisitions;
• A detailed presentation on the 
developments at SSGPO by the General 
Director and Finance Director of that 
business; and
• An update on the development of 
operations at Brazil from the CEO of Brazil.
Situational conflicts
All situational conflicts are reviewed annually 
by the Nomination and Corporate 
Governance Committee which then makes  
a recommendation to the Board on whether 
such situational conflicts should continue  
to be approved. Where a Director has a 
situational conflict he is not entitled to vote on 
the issue in question, although he is entitled 
to engage in any debate on the issue. 
Chairman and CEO
The roles of the Chairman and CEO are 
separate and their responsibilities are clearly 
defined in writing. The Chairman is 
responsible for leading the Board and 
ensuring that it functions effectively. This 
includes setting the agenda for Board 
meetings, ensuring that the Board receives 
accurate, timely and clear information, and 
facilitating communication with shareholders. 
Dr Sittard was Chairman throughout the  
year under review. Following his resignation 
for personal reasons on 3 February 2012,  
Mr Dalman was appointed Chairman of the 
Board. Mr Dalman was considered by the 
Board to be independent on appointment. 
In April 2011, the non-executive Directors 
met without management present and the 
SID led the evaluation of the performance  
of the Chairman.
The CEO is responsible for the operational 
management of the Group and the execution 
of the Group’s strategy. He is responsible for 
optimising the use of the Group’s resources, 
managing the Group’s risk profile and 
appointing senior management.
The CEO has established an Executive 
Committee (the ‘ExCom’) to assist him in 
discharging his responsibilities for running 
the Group’s businesses. This committee  
has no decision-making powers but reviews 
Group performance and capital projects.  
Its members are identified on page 50.
Senior Independent Director
Sir Richard Sykes was the SID and 
non-executive Deputy Chairman until leaving 
the Board on 8 June 2011. As SID, Sir 
Richard was responsible for addressing any 
shareholder concerns that could not or 
should not be channelled through the 
Chairman or the Executive Directors. He was 
also responsible for ensuring that the 
Chairman’s performance evaluation was 
carried out.
Mr Dalman was appointed SID on  
28 September 2011. During the period 
between the AGM and the completion of the 
Board Review on 28 September 2011, there 
was no SID. The Board recognised that this 
was non-compliant with the Code and it 
discussed the merits of the appointment  
of a SID soon after the AGM to ensure 
compliance or waiting until the Review was 
completed. It agreed that, on balance, the 
appointment should wait until the completion 
of the Review so that any new independent 
Director could be considered for the post. 
During this period, the remaining 
independent Directors liaised as required 
with institutional shareholders.
Mr Dalman relinquished the position of  
SID on his appointment as Chairman  
of the Board. The Board is currently not 
compliant with the Code and it will make  
a further announcement on this position  
in due course.
Company Secretary
The appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter reserved  
for the Board. Ms Victoria Penrice, who  
is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered 
Secretaries and Administrators, was 
appointed Company Secretary in June 2011.
Advice to the Board
All members of the Board are entitled to  
take legal advice at the Company’s expense.  
All the Directors have access to the 
Company Secretary for support and advice. 
She is responsible for advising the Board  
on all corporate governance issues and for 
ensuring that all applicable legislation and 
Board procedures are followed. 
Training and development
In conjunction with the Chairman, the 
Company Secretary is responsible for 
ensuring that the Board and Committee 
members receive appropriate training and 
development. During 2011 this included:
• Providing a Board induction for  
Mr Wilkinson;
• Detailed presentations to all the Directors 
on the UK Bribery Act 2010; and
•  Providing various updates on corporate 
governance, data security and risk.
Board committees 
The Board has established five principal 
Board Committees: Audit Committee, 
Remuneration Committee, Nomination and 
Corporate Governance Committee (formerly 
the Nomination Committee), Investment 
Committee (formerly the Mergers and 
Acquisitions Committee) and the Health, 
Safety, Environment and Community 
Committee (the ‘HSEC Committee’, formerly 
the Health, Safety, Environment and 
Sustainability Committee). The Company 
Secretary is secretary to each of these 
Committees. The terms of reference of each 
of these Committees are available on the 
Company’s website.
The composition of the Board Committees  
is as shown on page 54.
Nomination and Corporate Governance 
Committee (the ‘NaCG Committee’)
Under its terms of reference, the NaCG 
Committee is required to meet at least twice 
a year to consider, among other issues:
• The size, structure and composition of  
the Board, taking into account the skills, 
knowledge and experience of the 
Directors and to recommend to the Board 
any new candidates; 
• Whether non-executive Directors have 
sufficient time to devote to the proper 
performance of their duties; 
• Making recommendations in relation to  
the retirement and re-election of Directors 
at the Company’s AGM; 
• Succession planning; and
• Any departures from the Code, ensuring 
explanations are given to shareholders  
as to how actual practices are consistent 
with good corporate governance.
Dr Sittard chaired the NaCG Committee 
during 2011. The other Committee members 
were Mr Gerhard Ammann, Mr Marat 
Beketayev, Sir Richard Sykes (until 8 June 
2011) and Mr Roderick Thomson. Sir Paul

Judge was appointed to the Committee  
on 21 June 2011 and on 28 September 2011  
Mr Mehmet Dalman, in his capacity as SID, 
was appointed to the Committee. The 
Company has complied with the Code 
recommendations regarding membership  
of the NaCG Committee throughout the  
year. The Committee held four scheduled 
meetings and four ad hoc meetings in 2011.
The main focus of the NaCG Committee 
during the year has been Board 
restructuring, reviewing the size of the Board 
along with the output of the Board evaluation 
process carried out by ICSA Board 
Evaluation. The results of the corporate 
governance review are discussed above. 
The NaCG Committee also reviewed the 
composition of the Board Committees  
and recommended during the year the 
appointments shown in the table below,  
all of which were approved by the Board.
Subsequent to the year end, on 3 February 
2012, Dr Sittard tendered his resignation 
from the Board for personal reasons.  
The NaCG Committee reviewed the position 
of Chairman and agreed to recommend  
to the Board the appointment of Mr Dalman 
in this role. Dr Sittard did not participate in 
this discussion.
Other areas addressed by the NaCG 
Committee during the year included:
• Situational conflicts 
  The Committee reviewed all existing 
conflicting situations and recommended 
that the Board reconfirmed its approval  
of these. It also reviewed all new conflicting 
situations and recommended their 
approval to the Board.
• Terms of reference
  The Committee reviewed its terms of 
reference to bring them into line with best 
practice and to reflect the extension of the 
Committee’s remit to include oversight  
of corporate governance and compliance 
with the Code and recommended the 
changes to the Board. 
• Annual re-election of Directors
  The NaCG Committee discussed the 
annual re-election of Directors and 
recommended to the Board that this be 
adopted from the 2011 AGM onwards.
• Diversity
  The NaCG Committee discussed Board 
diversity in light of the recommendations  
of Lord Davies of Abersoch and 
recommended that diversity be included 
as an element of the Review.
The NaCG Committee makes 
recommendations to the Board on the 
continuation in office of each Director every 
year, taking into consideration the Director’s 
effectiveness and commitment to the role.
Audit Committee
Mr Gerhard Ammann chairs the Audit 
Committee. Mr Ammann has had over  
30 years’ experience as an auditor including 
being Chairman of Deloitte in Switzerland 
until 2007 . The Board therefore considers 
that he has had recent and relevant financial 
experience. The Audit Committee members 
during the year were Sir Paul Judge,  
Mr Kenneth Olisa (until 8 June 2011),  
Mr Roderick Thomson and Mr Terence 
Wilkinson (from 9 December 2011), all of 
whom were regarded by the Board as 
independent non-executive Directors and 
each of whom has extensive business 
experience. 
The Company complied throughout the year 
with the Code recommendations regarding 
membership of the Audit Committee.
Under its terms of reference, the Committee 
is required to meet at least four times a year 
to consider, among other issues:
• The integrity of the Company’s financial 
reporting;
• The internal controls and risk management 
systems;
• The effectiveness of the internal audit 
function; and
• The relationship with the external auditors.
The Audit Committee meetings are  
aligned with the corporate reporting cycle  
to enable the Committee to discharge its 
duties effectively. In particular the Audit 
Committee schedules its meetings to  
enable it to review and comment on key 
financial announcements before making 
recommendations to the Board for  
their release.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
reports verbally to the Board on the actions 
of the Committee and updates the Board on 
any issues which require further investigation, 
action or improvement.
Whilst only members of the Committee are 
entitled to attend meetings, the Chairman 
invites the CFO, the CEO, the General 
Counsel, and the Chairman of the Board  
to attend. In addition, he invites the Head  
of Internal Audit to every meeting and he  
also invites the Group Head of Risk and the 
54 Unlocking Value
Corporate Governance Report continued Group Global Head of Compliance to attend 
where necessary to update the Committee. 
The external auditors are also invited to each 
meeting of the Audit Committee and they 
meet separately with the Committee 
members, without management being 
present, at least once a year.
The Audit Committee held five scheduled 
meetings and four ad hoc meetings in 2011. 
During the year the following items were 
reviewed:
• Accounting policies, estimates and 
judgements including methodology and 
results of the Group’s annual impairment 
review;
• Confirmation of the ability of the Group  
to continue as a going concern;
• The Preliminary and Half Year Results 
announcements, financial statements  
and Annual Report and Accounts;
• All internal audit reports and investigations;
• Investigations into whistleblowing 
allegations, including presentations from 
external forensic investigators;
• Internal controls and risk management;
• Compliance; and
• All external audit reports.
The Committee also received regular 
updates on the progress of Project Arrow,  
an ongoing programme to improve the 
efficiency of the reporting systems.
The Audit Committee also received 
presentations from the Group Head  
of Risk on the Group’s approach to risk 
management. It also received a  
presentation from Deloitte on the progress 
made in ensuring preparedness for the 
implementation of the UK Bribery Act 2010.
External audit
The Audit Committee reviews the overall 
performance of the auditors annually and  
is responsible for making formal 
recommendations each year to the Board  
on the continuation of the external auditors  
in office. The Audit Committee is responsible 
to the Board for ensuring that the external 
auditors remain independent of the 
Company in all material respects and that 
they have adequate resources available to 
them to enable the delivery of an objective 
audit to the shareholders. 
In order to ensure good corporate 
governance, the Audit Committee 
recommended that the provision of external 
audit services be put out to tender towards 
the end of 2011. This was driven by the fact 
that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) 
had been the Company’s auditors since 
before it was listed on the London Stock 
Exchange in December 2007 . Following  
a transparent and competitive tender, 
including presentations from all candidate 
firms and discussions with management,  
the Audit Committee recommend to the 
Board of Directors that PwC be reappointed 
as auditors.
However, as the external auditors are 
required to rotate the Group audit partner 
every five years, the current lead partner  
will stand down during 2012. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied that this is sufficient  
to preserve PwC’s independence.
The Audit Committee also reviews the level 
and nature of any non-audit work to be 
performed during the year and considers 
whether it is appropriate for this work to  
be carried out by the external auditors.  
The Audit Committee maintains a policy 
regarding acceptable non-audit work, which 
incorporates authority levels for approving 
such work. The auditors are precluded from 
engaging in non-audit services that would 
compromise their independence and 
objectivity or violate any laws or regulations 
affecting their appointment as auditors.  
Note 33 to the financial statements shows 
the value of the non-audit work carried out 
by PwC during the year.
Internal audit
The Head of Internal Audit is invited to attend 
each Audit Committee meeting where he 
provides assurance, independent of the 
assurance provided by the CFO, that internal 
control activities, which have been subject  
to audit by his team, are operating effectively. 
The Group has an Internal Audit Charter 
which states that the Head of Internal Audit  
is accountable to the Audit Committee and  
is to provide ENRC Group management with 
the following:
• An independent, objective, positive 
assurance on effectiveness of internal 
controls; and
• A value-adding consulting service 
designed to improve the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the Group’s operations and to 
safeguard both the assets and the integrity 
of the Group. 
During 2011, the Internal Audit function 
carried out a programme of planned reviews 
covering, among other items, procurement, 
capital project management, disposal of 
assets, inventory management and 
post-acquisition reviews, and integrated 
reviews of certain business units. In addition, 
ad hoc reviews included related party 
contracts, readiness for the UK Bribery Act 
2010, and a significant loan review.
Also during 2011 Internal Audit started  
two dedicated assurance programmes 
specifically addressing major risks faced  
by the Group:
• Capital Expenditure Assurance 
Programme, which is being developed 
with assistance from KPMG; and
• Health and Safety Audit Programme, 
which is being developed with assistance 
from DuPont.
Whistleblowing
The Audit Committee reviews the 
arrangements by which employees can  
raise any concerns they may have about 
workplace fraud or mismanagement with 
local management on a confidential basis. 
Whistleblowing incidents are taken very 
seriously by the Audit Committee. 
Complaints are investigated in the first 
instance and a decision taken about further 
steps. Feedback is provided to the person 
making the complaint. In 2011, the 
whistleblowing procedure was upgraded with 
the introduction of an external whistleblowing 
hotline, available in five languages.
Towards the end of 2011 the new 
Whistleblowing and Investigation Policy (the 
‘Policy’) made Internal Audit responsible for 
running an Internal Investigation function.  
A new structure staffed with skilled 
professionals is in the process of being 
established worldwide, which should ensure 
sufficient capacity to respond quickly and 
effectively to any allegation of wrongdoing 
reported according to the Policy.
Remuneration Committee
Sir Paul Judge was appointed Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee on 11 August 
2011, replacing Sir Richard Sykes who 
chaired the Remuneration Committee until 
he left the Board on 8 June 2011. The other 
members during the year were Mr Dalman, 
Mr Olisa (until 8 June 2011), Mr Thompson 
(from 11 August 2011) and Mr Wilkinson 
(from 9 December 2011). Throughout the 
year, all members of the Committee were 
independent non-executive Directors.  
The Company has complied with the Code 
recommendations regarding membership  
of the Remuneration Committee throughout 
the year. Whilst only the members of the 
Committee are entitled to attend its 
meetings, the CEO is also invited by the 
Committee Chairman to attend its meetings, 
but he does not attend on matters relating  
to his own remuneration.
Under its terms of reference the Committee 
is required to meet at least twice a year and, 
among other issues, it determines and 
recommends to the Board the broad policy 
for the remuneration of Executive Directors 
ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 55
www.enrc.com and members of the senior management 
team.
The remuneration of the non-executive 
Directors is a matter reserved for the Board. 
The non-executive Directors do not review 
their own remuneration.
During 2011 the Remuneration Committee 
met six times, four meetings were scheduled 
meetings and two were ad hoc meetings.
Further details are included in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, which is set out on 
pages 59 to 64.
A resolution to approve the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report will be proposed  
at the forthcoming AGM.
Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community Committee (the ‘HSEC 
Committee’)
Mr Vulis chairs the HSEC Committee.  
The other members during the year were 
Professor Dr Ameling, Mr Beketayev,  
Mr Victor Hanna, Mr Patrice L ’Huillier,  
Dr Sittard, Mr Utepov (until 8 June 2011)  
and Mr Yedilbayev (until 8 June 2011).  
Dr Sittard stood down from the Committee 
on his resignation from the Board on  
3 February 2012.
Under its terms of reference, the Committee 
is required to meet at least twice a year and, 
among other things, it considers:
• Health, safety, environment and 
community risks;
• The Group’s compliance with applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements 
associated with health, safety, environment 
and community matters; and
• The Group’s performance in relation to 
health, safety, environment and 
community impact and monitoring 
sustainable development initiatives. 
In addition it is responsible for the inclusion  
of a report by the HSEC Committee in the 
Annual Report and Accounts and has 
overseen the development of a standalone 
Sustainable Development Report for 2011.
The HSEC Committee met four times  
in 2011. 
During the year the Committee discussed 
the implementation of second-party health 
and safety audits, energy efficiency and  
the impact of Kazakhstan’s climate  
change legislation. 
The HSEC Committee recommended to  
the Board that a non-executive Director be 
responsible for championing HSEC issues 
and the Board agreed that Professor  
Dr Ameling take on this role.
Further details on HSEC are set out in the 
Sustainable Development Review on pages 
39 to 42 and in the Sustainable Development 
Report (to be published separately).
Investment Committee (formerly the 
Mergers and Acquisitions Committee) 
Mr Mehmet Dalman chairs the Investment 
Committee. The other members during  
the year were Professor Dr Ameling,  
Mr Beketayev, Sir Richard Sykes (until  
8 June 2011) and Dr Zaure Zaurbekova  
(from 9 December 2011).
Under the Investment Committee’s terms  
of reference, the Committee is required to 
meet at least twice a year and, among other 
things, it:
• Reviews and discusses with management 
the necessary due diligence required on 
prospective mergers and acquisitions 
projects;
• Receives detailed analyses of prospective 
mergers and acquisitions projects; and
• Oversees the structuring and 
implementation of mergers and 
acquisitions projects.
The Investment Committee met five times  
on an ad hoc basis during 2011 and 
recommended to the Board the extension  
of the option to acquire a 75% interest in 
Shubarkol Komir JSC, the exercise of that 
option and subsequently approval of the 
shareholder circular, and the acquisition  
of a 100% interest in Rubio Holdings Ltd, 
which owns manganese assets and  
licences in South Africa. The Committee met 
in 2012 to discuss and recommend to the 
Board the acquisition of certain assets in  
the DRC from FQM and the settlement  
of related legal matters.
Risk management and internal control
Risk management
The Board is ultimately responsible for 
maintaining a sound risk management and 
internal control system to ensure compliance 
with the requirements of the Code and the 
Turnbull Guidance on internal control and  
risk management. 
In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance  
a review of the effectiveness of the risk 
management system and internal control is 
undertaken annually by the Audit Committee 
on behalf of the Board. 
Executive Committee
The ExCom has specific responsibility as  
the risk management committee for the 
Group’s system of risk management. It 
reviews the Group’s significant risks and 
subsequently reports to the Audit Committee 
on material changes and the associated 
mitigating actions. 
Enterprise-wide risk management
The ExCom considers the careful and 
appropriate management of risk as an 
important management role. Managing 
business risk to deliver opportunities is a key 
element of all the Group’s business activities. 
The significant business risks are understood 
and documented. The business context 
determines in each situation the level of 
acceptable risk and controls.
The main features of the Group’s system  
of risk management include:
• Group statements on strategic direction;
• Clear business objectives and business 
principles;
• A clear risk strategy;
• A clear risk policy;
• A Company risk management manual;
• Annual review of key business risks;
•  A continuing process for identification  
and evaluation of principal risks to the 
achievement of business objectives;
•  An annual review of internal control;
• Management processes to mitigate 
significant risks to an acceptable level;
• On-going monitoring of significant risks 
and internal and external environmental 
factors that may change the Group’s risk 
profile; and
• A review by the Group of both the type 
and amount of external insurance that the 
Group buys, bearing in mind the availability 
of such cover, its cost and the likelihood 
and magnitude of the risks involved.
In addition to the annual review of principal 
risks, there is a process of regular reporting 
to the Board through the Audit Committee 
on the status of the risk management 
process. 
Risk management system evolution
The Group continues to develop its risk 
management and internal control systems 
and this includes:
• A clear strategy to further enhance the 
Group’s approach to risk management, 
internal control and insurance;
• The recruitment of additional high calibre 
risk and internal control specialists at a 
Group and regional level;
• An established Group risk framework;
• A significantly improved scope and 
robustness of the annual review of internal 
control process;
• Further evolution of our insurance strategy;
• Continued development of in-country risk 
and internal control capabilities; and
56 Unlocking Value
Corporate Governance Report continued • Further refinements to the ExCom Group 
risk review process.
An enhanced ‘top-down’ risk management 
approach is in place focusing on the key 
risks to the execution of the Group’s 
business strategy, which complements our 
regional and entity level risk reviews. This 
complemented the current ‘bottom-up’ 
aggregation methodology. To further 
enhance the Group’s approach to risk 
management at a business unit level, the 
principles of the international standard for 
risk management ISO 31000 are being 
adopted where appropriate.
Internal control
The Turnbull Guidance sets out best practice 
on internal control for UK-listed companies  
to assist them in assessing the application  
of the Code principles and compliance with 
the underlying provisions with regard to 
internal control.
The Group’s systems of internal control are 
designed and operated to support the 
identification, evaluation and management  
of risks affecting the Group, including in 
relation to the financial reporting process  
and the preparation of consolidated accounts, 
and the business environment in which the 
Group operates. The systems of internal 
control are subject to continuous review as 
circumstances change and new risks emerge. 
Features of the systems of internal control 
include:
• The risk management system described  
in the preceding section;
• Documented policies and procedures 
within the Group’s businesses;
• An annual review of key internal controls; 
and
• Minimising operating risk by using 
appropriate infrastructure, controls, 
systems and people throughout the 
businesses.
The key policies employed in managing 
operating risk involve the segregation of 
duties, transaction authorisation, monitoring, 
financial, managerial and comprehensive 
reporting and analysis against approved 
standards and budgets.
Group Treasury operations manage 
exposure to counterparty risk, liquidity risk 
and currency transaction risks and Group 
Treasury coordinates the activities of Group 
companies in this area. The treasury policies, 
risk limits and monitoring procedures are 
reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee 
on behalf of the Board.
Group Tax manages risks associated with 
tax compliance, reporting, planning and 
transfer pricing. The Group Tax function 
monitors tax risks and implements strategies 
and procedures to control these risks.
Assurance on compliance with systems of 
internal control and on their effectiveness is 
obtained through:
• Regular management reviews;
• Annual testing of key internal controls; 
• Internal audit reviews; and
• Testing of certain aspects of the internal 
financial control systems by the external 
auditors during the course of their statutory 
examinations with regular reports to the 
Audit Committee by the external auditors.
The Audit Committee considers the results 
of the reviews to confirm that controls are 
functioning. Any material breakdowns and 
remedial actions are reported to the Board. 
Risk management and internal control 
systems in relation to financial reporting
The main features of the Group’s systems of 
risk management and internal control in 
relation to financial reporting, other than the 
general principles referred to above, are:
• Control environment – communication  
of key principles and policies, and reports 
on compliance;
• Risk management – identification of key 
financial risks and appropriate responses;
• Control activities – management utilises  
a range of preventative and detective 
controls to minimise errors; and
• Monitoring – ongoing monitoring of the 
above.
The systems of risk management and 
internal control are designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. In 
reviewing these, the Board has taken into 
account the results of all the work carried  
out by internal and external auditors.
Annual review of internal control
The Group continues to improve its process 
for reviewing the systems of internal control. 
For this year’s annual review of internal 
control, the Group significantly increased  
the scope and robustness of the review  
and testing process.
Review of effectiveness
The Board and the Audit Committee have 
reviewed the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control system, 
including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management, 
in accordance with the Turnbull Guidance  
to the date of approval of this Annual Report 
and Accounts. 
If significant internal control failings are 
identified, the Board confirms that necessary 
actions will be taken to address them and 
these will include:
• Reports to the Audit Committee and the 
Board; and
• If necessary, further investigations 
implemented by the Audit Committee.
Remedial action plans will be monitored by 
the Audit Committee, with regular updates 
on progress to the Board.
Compliance 
The Global Compliance Department is 
creating a framework to ensure responsibility 
within the Group for:
• The prevention of bribery and corruption;
• The prevention of financial crime including 
money laundering and fraud;
• The prevention of anti-competitive 
behaviour;
• Engagement with Sales and Marketing 
and Procurement departments to ensure 
compliance with national and international 
regulations;
• Monitoring of payments for corporate 
social responsibility purposes; and
• Monitoring of government and international 
sanctions regimes.
The UK Bribery Act 2010 came into force  
on 1 July 2011. This is a substantive piece  
of legislation which has impacted a wide 
range of businesses and industries, including 
the extractive industry as a whole. All of the 
Group’s core compliance policies have been 
reviewed to ensure consistency with the 
anti-corruption regimes under which the 
Group operates and the Global Compliance 
Department has been actively involved in 
delivering anti-bribery training to Board  
and senior management, which included  
a workshop presented by Hogan Lovell  
and attended by the Board and senior 
management and face-to-face training  
in Kazakhstan.
During 2011, ENRC conducted a 
comprehensive bribery risk review of the 
global business in conjunction with external 
legal and other advisors. That review is 
ongoing, but the Group has already begun 
the process of ensuring that its compliance 
policies are targeted at minimising the key 
risk areas that have been identified. In 
addition, the Global Compliance Department 
has continued to coordinate with worldwide 
business units to help ensure they are 
operating pursuant to ENRC’s clearly 
established procedures. 
ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 57
www.enrc.com As part of this effort, the Global Compliance 
Department has recently revised the  
Group’s Code of Conduct to make it more 
accessible. The revised version, together 
with a set of explanatory notes, is now 
available on the ENRC website and is being 
translated into the main languages used 
within the Group. These translations will also 
be made available on the ENRC website 
once they have been finalised.
The Global Compliance Department also 
introduced online ethics training in 2011. This 
covers the Group’s Code of Conduct and 
global anti-corruption measures. The online 
training has been deployed to a substantial 
number of current senior employees who are 
employed in an ‘at risk’ position, for example 
those working in finance, procurement  
and sales and marketing. Undertaking this 
training is also now a requirement for all new 
starters in relevant positions. The Global 
Compliance Department also provided 
face-to-face training on competition law 
issues to the majority of employees in the 
Sales and Marketing function during the year.
The website was updated during the year  
to set out the Group’s resolute opposition  
to bribery and corruption and its policy on 
combatting this, along with its commitment 
to complying with all laws and regulations  
in the countries where it operates. The 
Group regards this as an important step  
in ensuring that all employees and all third 
parties with which it deals are aware of  
the Group’s zero-tolerance approach to  
bribery and corruption.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Steering 
Committee (the ‘ABC Committee’)
The Group established the ABC Committee 
during 2011, which meets on a monthly basis 
and is chaired by the Group General 
Counsel. In addition to the Group General 
Counsel, the CFO, Group Head of Risk, 
Group Global Head of Compliance, Head  
of Internal Audit and the Head of Strategic 
Planning and Investment Analysis are also 
members. The Committee invites other 
parties to report and participate in the 
meetings on a regular basis, including other 
employees whose work touches anti-bribery 
and corruption issues and external advisors 
who are able to provide valuable input. The 
ABC Committee coordinates the Group’s 
approaches to bribery and corruption issues 
across core departments to ensure that  
the work carried out to prevent and detect 
corruption is consistent and effective.
Meetings with the Serious Fraud Office 
(the ‘SFO’) 
During 2011, ENRC was the subject of 
various press stories including the purchase 
of certain DRC assets and the subsequent  
civil dispute, which has now been settled.  
As with other companies in this sector, 
ENRC regularly liaises with authorities, 
including the SFO. 
The SFO has been very clear that its doors 
are always open to companies that want  
to discuss issues relating to anti-corruption 
and compliance. ENRC has engaged with 
the SFO to brief them about the Company’s 
anti-corruption, corporate governance  
and compliance efforts, and to provide 
information about the internal Audit 
Committee investigations. 
The Board of ENRC takes corporate 
governance and compliance very seriously 
and is committed to ensuring that ENRC 
complies with laws relevant to its business 
wherever it operates.
Interaction with shareholders
During 2011 the Group met with a large 
number of shareholders and prospective 
investors, mainly based in the United 
Kingdom, continental Europe and the United 
States of America, as part of a regular 
schedule of meetings and roadshows. The 
Group has an active and extensive Investor 
Relations programme (the ‘IR programme’) 
although its free float is currently only around 
18%. Management also met with the 
Founder Shareholders and Kazakhmys PLC, 
who together hold around 70% of the 
Company’s shares. The Government of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan, which has Board 
representation, is frequently and closely 
involved with the Group’s deliberations  
and the executive management. 
As part of its IR programme, the Group aims 
to provide a high level of transparency and 
communication to investors and analysts  
on a timely basis, through announcements, 
meetings and seminars. The Group seeks to 
develop a regular dialogue with investors and 
analysts and to respond to their challenges 
and understand their sentiments and 
concerns. The Group has a comprehensive 
IR section on its website, which has 
up-to-date information available to all 
shareholders and investors. Shareholders 
have the opportunity to attend and raise 
questions at the Company’s AGM.
The Group aspires to have an IR programme 
that is ranked highly amongst its peers for its 
accessibility, responsiveness and disclosure. 
The CEO, CFO and CCO between them aim 
to meet all major shareholders at least twice  
a year and, along with other senior 
management, to meet with a wide range  
of shareholders and prospective investors 
during the year. In 2011 these discussions 
focused on the financial and operational 
results and development of the Group’s 
businesses and also sought to understand 
any concerns held by investors. The Group 
frequently meets with sell-side analysts to 
raise the Group’s profile and to build the 
research coverage.
Information on IR activity and analysts’ and 
brokers’ reports are regularly circulated to 
the Board. The Chairman, along with other 
non-executive Directors if appropriate, 
annually conducts a number of investor 
meetings focused on corporate governance. 
This was particularly relevant during 2011  
as the Group completed its corporate 
governance review. On an annual basis the 
Group undertakes meetings on sustainable 
development and corporate social 
responsibility with relevant executives and 
interested parties.
The fifth AGM is due to be held on Tuesday, 
12 June 2012 and the Board welcomes the 
opportunity to answer questions put to it by 
shareholders of the Company.
Share capital
The Company’s share capital is described 
on page 66.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with those factors likely to affect future 
performance, are set out in the Business 
Review on pages 4 to 47 .
In assessing the Group’s going concern 
status the Directors have taken into account 
the factors set out in the Business Review, 
including the financial position of the Group 
and in particular its significant balances  
of cash, cash equivalents and liquid 
investments, the borrowing facilities in place 
and their terms, medium-term cash flow and 
liquidity projections, the current commodity 
prices and market expectations in the 
medium term, the Group’s expected 
operating cost profile and its capital 
expenditure and financing plans.
After making enquiries, the Directors have 
reasonable expectations that the Group  
has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.

Committee discusses issues relating to their 
own remuneration. 
Role of the Committee 
The Committee is a formal committee of  
the Board. Its remit is set out in terms of 
reference formally adopted by the Board in 
2007 and which were reviewed in December 
2011. The terms of reference are designed  
to enable the Committee to comply with the 
requirements relating to remuneration policy 
set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. A copy of the terms of reference can 
be found on the Company’s website.
The principal responsibilities of the 
Committee are:
• To determine and recommend to the 
Board the framework for the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors, the Chairman, 
the Company Secretary and other senior 
executives of the Group;
• To monitor the appropriateness and 
relevance of the Group’s remuneration 
policy;
• To approve the design and performance 
targets of any performance-related pay 
schemes operated by the Group and to 
approve the total annual payments made 
under such schemes; and
• To review the design of share-based 
incentives and determine the level and 
extent to which awards are made during 
the year.
The Committee met six times during the 
year, four of which were scheduled and two 
were ad hoc. It considered and agreed, 
amongst other matters:
• Annual bonus performance and payments 
for the financial year ended 31 December 
2010;

(the ‘LTIP’) performance condition for 2011;
• Framework of executive total remuneration;
• Committee terms of reference; and
• Structure of this report for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2011.

In order to carry out its duties, the 
Committee seeks advice from various 
sources, including Kepler Associates 
(‘Kepler’) who were retained by the 
Committee as independent advisors. Kepler 
does not have any other relationship with  
the Group. In addition, during the year, the 
Committee also received advice from the 
former Group Head of Human Resources, 
Business Performance and Transformation, 
the Global HR Director, the former Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary 
and the Company Secretary.
As reported last year, a detailed review of 
remuneration was carried out in 2011, 
resulting in the establishment of the DSP and 
revisions to the performance condition for 
the LTIP . Following the appointment of Sir 
Paul Judge as Chairman of the Committee, 
further work was carried out to ensure that 
the balance between fixed and variable pay 
was appropriate and to ensure a clear 
alignment with shareholders’ interests.  
A summary of these changes is shown  
in the table overleaf.
Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy is to  
provide a level of remuneration which 
attracts, retains and motivates Directors  
and senior executives of sufficient calibre  
to achieve the Group’s strategic goals and 
enhance shareholder value, whilst ensuring 
that remuneration is consistent with best 
practice and provides an appropriate 
alignment with personal and business 
performance. 
There is a competitive market for successful 
executives with experience in the mining 
industry and the provision of appropriate 
rewards for superior performance is 
important for the continued growth of the 
business. Therefore in applying the 
remuneration policy the Committee assesses 
relevant benchmark data from sources such 
as international mining companies, other 
FTSE 100 companies of a similar size and 
complexity and the market generally. The 
Committee aims to set basic salary broadly 
in line with the market median. Over the 
longer term, superior performance should 
result in a pay and benefits package in the 
upper quartile. In setting remuneration within 
this framework, the Committee aims to give 
senior executives every encouragement to 
enhance the Group’s performance, without 
taking unacceptable risks, whilst ensuring 
that they are fairly and responsibly rewarded 
for their personal contributions.
Components of Executive Directors’ 
remuneration 
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually by  
the Committee. In deciding salary levels,  
the Committee takes account of relevant 
benchmark data, pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group, the 
broader market context, as well as the 
individual’s role and performance. In doing 
this, the Committee recognises that the 
Company seeks to reward all employees 
fairly according to the nature of their role, 
prevailing market conditions and individual 
performance. The Executive Directors’ 
salaries were increased by 3% in 2011,  
in line with salary increases across the  
Group and have been frozen for 2012.
Annual bonus
For the year ended 31 December 2011,  
the annual bonus continued to be based:
• 75% on Group financial performance; 
• 15% on health and safety performance; 
and
• 10% on personal performance. 
75% of the Group’s financial performance 
target is based on Underlying EBITDA and 
25% on basic EPS. These key performance 
indicators are described on page 16 and 17 . 
Financial performance is measured relative 
to budget, with 50% of the maximum 
opportunity payable for performance in line 
with budget, and full payment only if 
performance equals or exceeds 120% of 
budget. In assessing performance, the 
Committee takes into account actual 
financial performance as reported to 
shareholders and adjusted performance, 
taking into account actual and adjusted 
commodity prices and other uncontrollable 
events to make the bonus outcome less 
sensitive to volatility in commodity prices, 
uncontrollable costs compared to budget 
and significant exceptional unbudgeted 
items. The bonus payable is based 50/50  
on actual and adjusted financial performance 
compared to budget.
Specific targets have not been disclosed  
as they are considered to be commercially 
sensitive and therefore confidential. However 
the Committee recognises the need to 
provide targets that are appropriately 
challenging and which will pay out in full only 
for exceptional performance. Budgets are 
set taking account of both internal and 
external expectations, while health and 
safety and personal performance are 
measured against predetermined objectives. 
The performance measures are regarded as 
appropriate to align management and 
shareholder interests, and to reward delivery 
of the Group’s strategy whilst cultivating 
greater health and safety awareness within 
the organisation. 
The Committee reviewed the performance 
measures during the year to ensure the 
continued alignment with the Group’s 
strategy, and agreed that the maximum 
bonus potential for 2011, to include both  
the cash element and the deferred shares 
element, should continue to be set at 300% 
of base salary for the CEO, and 250% of 
base salary for the CFO and for the CCO. 
The actual bonus achieved for 2011 is 
165.7% of base salary for the CEO and 
138.1% of base salary for the CFO and CCO. 
One third of this will be deferred into shares 
for the CEO and CCO and 30% will be 
deferred into shares for the CFO.

For 2012, the annual bonus structure will 
remain unchanged for Executive Directors 
(including the maximum bonus opportunities). 
The element based on actual profits will pay 
out on a scale of 80% to 120% of budget; the 
element based on budgeted profits will pay 
out on a scale from 90% to 110% of budget.
Deferred Share Plan
At the 2011 Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders approved the introduction  
of the DSP . The DSP will be used in 2012  
to defer into shares at least 30% of the 
CFO’s total 2011 bonus, and at least one 
third of the CEO’s and CCO’s total 2011 
bonus. These shares will vest after three 
years subject to continued employment.  
The DSP is intended to help support 
retention and strengthen the alignment  
of Executive Directors’ interests with those  
of shareholders. Dividends will accrue on 
deferred share awards over the three-year 
holding period.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
It is the Committee’s policy to align ‘at risk’ 
remuneration with the long-term success of 
the Group. The LTIP enables the Committee 
to award participants a conditional right  
to receive shares in the Company for nil 
consideration. Awards will normally vest  
on the third anniversary of grant subject to 
the satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions. The LTIP rules allow for 
immediate pro-rated vesting of the awards, 
subject to achievement of the performance 
conditions, on a change of control. 
No LTIP awards were possible in 2011, due 
to extended close periods, but it was always 
the Committee’s intention to make such  
awards when practicable. The Committee  
 
 
 
therefore intends to make two awards in 
2012, one with reference to 2011 and having 
a performance condition measured from  
1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013 (the 
‘2011 award’) and the second with reference 
to 2012 and having a performance condition 
measured from 1 January 2012 to 31 
December 2014 (the ‘2012 award’). Both  
the 2011 and 2012 awards will be based on 
200% of base salary for the CEO, 175% of 
base salary for the CFO and 150% of base 
salary for the CCO based on the average 
market value of shares over the five days 
preceding the date of grant.
The Board will seek shareholder permission 
at the 2012 AGM to allow the 2011 award  
to vest (subject to the satisfaction of the 
performance condition) following the 
announcement of the results to 31 December 
2013. This is in line with the timetable for 
vesting had the 2011 award been made at 
the usual time, immediately after the end of 
the year end close period in 2011. The 2012 
award will vest, subject to the satisfaction  
of the performance condition described 
above, following the announcement of 
results in 2015.
LTIP performance condition
The vesting of LTIP awards is based on 
ENRC’s relative TSR performance, which  
the Committee considers to be the most 
appropriate measure of long-term Company 
performance, providing an alignment of 
interests between senior management and 
shareholders. This is a key performance 
indicator for the Company and is described 
in more detail on page 16. For the purposes 
of the LTIP , TSR is calculated in common 
currency and using three-month share  
price averaging (for the 2010 LTIP award)  
and six-month share price averaging (from 
2011 onwards).
2008, 2009 and 2010 awards
There was no vesting of the 2008 or 2009 
LTIP awards in the light of the Company’s 
share price performance against the 
comparators. For awards made in 2010,  
the extent to which awards may vest will  
be subject to TSR performance over a 
three-year period relative to the TSR 
performance of a specified comparator 
group of companies. These share awards 
will vest based on performance, as shown 
on the table on page 60. 
2011 award
In early 2011 (and relating to the 2011 LTIP 
award that was subsequently delayed),  
the Committee decided to amend the  
TSR performance condition by introducing  
a second TSR benchmark. 50% of the 
delayed 2011 award will vest on ENRC’s 
outperformance of the MSCI Metals & Mining 
Index. The remaining 50% of the 2011 award 
will vest subject to ENRC’s relative TSR 
ranking against a tailored TSR comparator 
group revised to focus more on diversified 
and emerging markets miners and other 
relevant comparators such as steel 
companies. The Committee believes  
this group will provide a more relevant 
benchmark, and therefore be a better 
indicator of management performance.  
The vesting schedule for the delayed 2011 
award is shown in the table on page 60. £0

ENRC
FTSE 100
2012 award
The 2012 LTIP award will vest on ENRC’s 
TSR performance relative to that of the  
FTSE 350 Mining Index. This revision in the 
TSR performance condition follows the 
Committee’s review of executive incentive 
arrangements in 2011. The FTSE 350 Mining 
Index is felt to be an objective benchmark  
of ENRC’s TSR performance that balances 
relevance, simplicity and robustness to 
mergers and acquisition activity. The 
Committee also recognises that the FTSE 
350 Mining Index is readily accessible and 
thus the participants in the LTIP can more 
clearly see progress against the benchmark.
Vesting
No LTIP awards vested in the 2011 financial 
year as reported overleaf. The Committee 
has also determined that the 2009 LTIP 
award, which was based on TSR 
performance to 31 December 2011, will not 
vest and will therefore lapse in April 2012. 
Performance graph
The Company’s TSR performance is shown 
below. ENRC became a constituent of the 
FTSE 100 Index on 26 March 2008 and  
this index is considered to be the most 
appropriate. The graph below charts the 
total cumulative shareholder return of  
ENRC compared with the FTSE 100 since  
12 December 2007 (being the first date of 
trading for ENRC shares). Also shown below 
is a comparison of ENRC’s performance 
against the FTSE 350 Mining Index.
Pensions and benefits
The Executive Directors are members of  
the ENRC Personal Pension Plan (the ‘Plan’), 
a defined contribution pension scheme.  
As part of the overall review of Directors’ 
remuneration in 2011, the Committee agreed 
to increase the employer contribution to  
the Plan, with effect from 1 January 2012,  
to 30% of base salary. The increase broadly 
aligns ENRC’s pension provision with UK 
market practice for companies of similar  
size and was agreed in light of a review  
of the competitiveness of the total ENRC 
remuneration package.
In 2011, an employer contribution of 10%  
of base salary was made to the Plan on 
behalf of each Executive Director. For the 
year ended 31 December 2011 amounts  
of £105,000 and £68,000 and £67 ,000 were 
paid into the Plan in respect of the CEO,  
the CFO and the CCO respectively.
Benefits comprise life assurance, private 
healthcare, travel insurance and income 
protection insurance. Both Mr Vulis and  
Dr Zaurbekova received accrued annual 
leave payments, as required under 
Kazakhstani employment law, of £116,000 
and £67 ,000 respectively.
Balance of the components of 
Executive Directors’ remuneration 
Remuneration packages are structured to 
provide an appropriate balance between 
fixed and variable elements, such that 
performance-related elements represent  
the majority. The main components of the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration for 2012 
and the percentage of each element as part 
of the total package are set out in the table 
on page 63.
Directors’ contracts
Executive Directors
Each Executive Director has a service 
agreement which can be terminated by 
either the Company or the Executive Director 
giving 12 months’ notice. Under the terms  
of the contracts, the Company reserves the 
right, in its absolute discretion, to terminate 
an Executive Director’s employment by 
making a payment in lieu of notice. In the 
event of a contract being terminated, the 
Committee would determine the level of  
any compensation to be paid, normally by 
reference to fixed elements of remuneration 
and the notice period. Any annual bonus 
payment or vesting of shares under the LTIP 
and DSP would be at the discretion of the 
Committee. Payments would normally be 
subject to the satisfaction of the performance 
conditions under which the awards were 
granted and pro-rated to the date of 
cessation of employment.
The Board supports the recommendation in 
the Code that all Directors should be subject 
to annual reappointment and accordingly 
each Executive Director will stand for 
appointment at the 2012 AGM.
The Board recognises that experience 
gained outside the Group can be valuable  
in terms of director development. Subject  
to Board approval, Executive Directors are 
permitted to accept outside appointments 
on external boards or committees so long  
as these are not considered to interfere

with the business of the Company. Both  
Mr Cochrane and Mr Vulis have external 
directorships, as disclosed on pages 48  
and 49. Any fees in respect of those 
appointments may be retained by the 
Executive Directors concerned. During 2011, 
Mr Cochrane was paid 80,000 rupees and 
was entitled to 6,833 rand in respect of his 
other directorships. The rupees have been 
paid to a charity of his choice.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors do not have service 
contracts with the Company, but each has  
a letter of appointment. Each non-executive 
Director is required to stand for election at 
the AGM following appointment. In addition 
and in accordance with the Code’s 
recommendation that all Directors should  
be subject to annual reappointment, each 
non-executive Director will stand for 
reappointment at the 2012 AGM, as they  
did in 2011. Over and above this, the 
appointment may be terminated by either 
party giving six months’ notice. 
Copies of all Executive Directors’ service 
agreements and the letters of appointment  
of the non-executive Directors are available 
for inspection during normal business hours 
at the Registered Office of the Company.
Non-executive Directors’ fees
The remuneration of the non-executive 
Directors (other than the Chairman) is a 
matter for the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors (the ‘non-conflicted Directors’). 
Fees are designed to ensure that the 
Company attracts and retains high calibre 
individuals. They are reviewed on an  
annual basis and account is taken of the 
level of fees paid by other companies of  
a similar size and complexity. Non-executive 
Directors do not participate in any annual 
bonus plan, long-term incentive plan or 
pension arrangements. The Company 
repays the reasonable expenses that 
non-executive Directors incur in carrying  
out their duties as Directors. 
The fees payable to the Chairman are 
determined by the Committee and the  
level of fees remained unchanged in 2011.  
In February 2012, the Group announced  
that Mr Mehmet Dalman would succeed  
Dr Johannes Sittard as the Company’s 
Chairman. Mr Dalman will be paid a fee  
of £550,000 pro rata per annum.
The base fee for non-executive Directors  
in 2011 was £100,000 per annum. The base 
fee was reviewed by the non-conflicted 
Directors on the Board in 2011 and was 
increased, with effect from 1 January 2012, 
to £105,000.
Additional fees of £20,000 per annum  
were payable to Mr Ammann as Chairman  
of the Audit Committee and to Mr Dalman  
as Chairman of the Investment Committee. 
Additional fees of £150,000 pro rata per 
annum were paid to Sir Richard Sykes  
in respect of his chairmanship of the 
Remuneration Committee, his role as SID 
and as Deputy Chairman until 8 June 2011. 
Sir Paul Judge received an additional fee  
of £20,000 pro rata per annum with effect 
from 11 August 2011 for chairing the 
Remuneration Committee, and Mr Dalman 
received an additional fee of £50,000 pro 
rata per annum from 29 September for  
the role of SID. Following the review of fees 
by the non-conflicted Directors, this fee 
increased to £52,500 with effect from  
1 January 2012.
As a member of the Kazakh Government,  
Mr Marat Beketayev is not permitted to 
receive his fee personally. The fee for  
Mr Beketayev will be donated to a charity  
of his choice. Mr Eduard Utepov, who was  
a Director until 8 June 2011, was also not 
permitted to receive his fees personally  
as a member of the Kazakh Government.  
Mr Utepov’s fee will be donated to a 
charitable organisation.

The 2012 AGM will be held on Tuesday,  
12 June 2012 at The Lincoln Centre (18 
Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London WC2A 3ED).  
A separate circular containing the Notice  
of Meeting, together with an explanation  
of the items of special business, is enclosed 
with this Annual Report and Accounts.
Directors
Details of the current Directors of the 
Company and their biographies are set out 
on pages 48 and 49.
On 28 September 2011 Mr Terence 
Wilkinson was appointed as an independent 
non-executive Director. On the same day,  
Mr Mehmet Dalman was appointed Senior 
Independent Director (‘SID’) and Mr Felix 
Vulis agreed to withdraw his resignation and 
continue as Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’). 
Subsequent to the year end, on 3 February 
2012, Dr Johannes Sittard resigned as 
Director and Chairman of the Company  
and Mr Dalman was appointed as Chairman 
with immediate effect. Details of all changes 
to the Board during the year are shown on 
page 51.
In accordance with the Articles of 
Association, all Directors are subject to 
election at the first AGM after their 
appointment and to re-election at intervals  
of no more than three years. At the 2012 
AGM Mr Wilkinson, having been appointed 
since the previous AGM, will offer himself  
for election. The UK Corporate Governance 
Code, effective from June 2010, requires  
that all directors of FTSE 350 companies 
stand for re-election annually. The Company 
is committed to maintaining high standards  
of corporate governance and accordingly 
Prof Dr Ameling, Mr Ammann, Mr Beketayev, 
Mr Cochrane, Mr Dalman, Sir Paul Judge,  
Mr Thomson, Mr Vulis and Dr Zaurbekova 
will stand for re-election at the 2012 AGM,  
as they did in 2011.
Directors are appointed and may be 
removed in accordance with the Articles  
of Association of the Company and the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 65
Directors’ Report The Board believes that each Director 
seeking re-election is an effective member  
of the Board and demonstrates commitment 
to their respective roles. Further details  
can be found in the Notice of Meeting 
accompanying this document and on  
pages 48 and 49.
Details about Board processes, including 
training and development, are included  
on pages 52 and 53. 
The Board has put in place a procedure 
whereby all Directors have access, through 
the Company Secretary, to independent 
professional advice at the expense of the 
Company. The Company also maintains an 
appropriate level of Directors’ and Officers’ 
(‘D&O’) liability insurance. A qualifying third 
party indemnity provision has been in  
place since 2008 for the benefit of current 
Directors and officers of the Company  
and those of its subsidiaries to enable the 
Company to fund the costs incurred by 
Directors in defending certain claims against 
them in relation to their duties as Directors 
and officers. The indemnity operates only  
to the extent that the D&O liability insurance 
does not afford protection.
Directors’ interests
The number of ordinary shares of the 
Company in which the Directors were 
beneficially interested at the date of this 
report is shown on the table on page 65.
Share capital
As at 31 December 2011 the Company’s 
authorised share capital was 
US$400,000,000 divided into 2,000,000,000 
ordinary shares of US 20 cents each.  
The issued share capital of the Company  
at 31 December 2011 was 1,287 ,750,000 
ordinary shares of US 20 cents each. The 
ordinary shares are listed on the London 
Stock Exchange and the Kazakhstan  
Stock Exchange.
The rights and obligations attaching to  
the Company’s shares, in addition to those 
conferred on their holders by law, are set  
out in the Articles of Association, a copy  
of which can be obtained from the Company 
Secretary at the Company’s Registered 
Office. The holders of ordinary shares are 
entitled to receive all shareholder documents, 
to attend and speak at general meetings of 
the Company, to appoint proxies, to exercise 
all voting rights and to participate in 
distributions of income or capital.
At the 2011 AGM shareholders gave the 
Directors authority to allot shares up to an 
aggregate nominal value of US$25,755,000, 
representing 10% of the issued share capital 
of the Company as at 18 April 2011. This 
authority will expire on the earlier of the 2012 
AGM or 8 September 2012. No shares were 
allotted during the year.
Also at the 2011 AGM shareholders 
authorised the Company to make market 
purchases of up to 128,775,000 ordinary 
shares, representing 10% of the issued share 
capital of the Company as at 18 April 2011. 
This authority will expire on the earlier of the 
2012 AGM or 8 September 2012. No market 
purchases of shares were made during  
the year. 
At the forthcoming AGM the Board will again 
seek shareholders’ approval to renew the 
annual authorities for the Company to allot 
shares and to make purchases of its own 
shares through the market.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders 
restricting the voting rights or the right to 
transfer shares in the Company.
Major interests in shares
The table overleaf shows those shareholders 
who have been notified to the Company as 
holding major interests in shares amounting 
to more than 3% of the issued share capital 
of the Company, as at the date of this report.
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Articles of 
Association of the Company, the Board is 
permitted to consider and, if it sees fit, to 
authorise situations where a Director has  
an interest that conflicts, or may possibly 
conflict, with the interests of the Company. 
The Board has a formal system in place for 
Directors to declare any conflicts or potential 
conflicts and for these to then be considered 
for authorisation. The Nomination and 
Corporate Governance Committee takes 
responsibility for ensuring that a schedule  
of conflicts is maintained and that the Board 
reviews this schedule on an annual basis and 
updates authorisations where necessary.
Amendments to the Articles of 
Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may 
only be amended by a special resolution at  
a general meeting of the shareholders.
Relationship agreements
On 7 December 2007 the Founder 
Shareholders, Messrs Chodiev, Ibragimov 
and Machkevitch, entered into separate 
relationship agreements with the Company 
to regulate the ongoing relationship between 
each Founder Shareholder and the 
Company. The principal purpose of the 
relationship agreements is to ensure that 
transactions and relationships between the 
Group and the Founder Shareholders are at 
arm’s length and on a normal commercial 
basis. Under the terms of the relationship 
agreements, each Founder Shareholder has 
a right to appoint a Director to the Board as 
detailed in the Corporate Governance Report 
on page 52. None of the Directors currently 
on the Board has been appointed by the 
Founder Shareholders.
Employees
Information about employees is disclosed  
in the Sustainable Development Review  
on pages 39 to 42, which should be read  
in conjunction with the Sustainable 
Development Report to be published 
separately.
The Group understands that the success of 
every global business depends on its ability 
to maintain diversity within its workforce.  
The Group works hard on promoting 
diversity in all of the countries where it 
operates. The recruitment process in the 
Group is based on skills and experience. 
Implementation of a Global Diversity and 
Equality Policy will make sure that the 
employment process is free of discrimination 
on grounds of age, religion, marital status, 
disability, gender, sexual orientation and 
social background.
As a global Group, we realise the 
significance of promoting and protecting 
human rights in the workplace. In 
accordance with the Group’s Code of 
Conduct any form of discrimination or unfair 
treatment is not tolerated.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy is to agree terms of 
trading with suppliers in advance and to 
make payment in accordance with these 
terms. The Group does not follow any 
specific published code or standard on 
payment practice. Suppliers in Kazakhstan 
and Africa often require prepayment and the 
average number of creditor days outstanding 
for the Group as at 31 December 2011 was 
40 (2010: 40). The average number of 
creditor days outstanding as at 31 December 
2011 for the Company was nil (2010: nil).
Events after the balance sheet date
Shubarkol Komir JSC
In October 2011 the Group announced its 
intention to exercise the option to acquire the

included interests in the Kolwezi Tailings 
project, the Frontier and Lonshi mines and 
related exploration interests, all located in the 
Katanga Province of the DRC, for a total 
consideration of US$1.25 billion.
The total consideration comprises US$750 
million which was paid on closing, together 
with a deferred consideration of US$500 
million in the form of a 3-year promissory 
note with an interest coupon of 3% which  
is payable annually in arrears.
In connection with the transaction, FQM, 
ENRC and the DRC Government have also 
resolved all disputes relating to the 
companies being sold, and their assets and 
operations in the DRC, and have released 
one another in respect of all claims and 
judgements relating to the foregoing or to 
any other matters arising in the DRC on or 
before the date of closing.
Funding arrangements
On 1 February 2012, the Group entered into 
a credit facility agreement with Sberbank of 
Russia for US$2 billion. The facility has an 
applicable interest rate of LIBOR plus 6.3% 
and is repayable in five years. The facility  
is available as follows: 25% of the facility  
is available on 1 February 2012; 50% after 
three months; 75% after six months and 
100% after nine months. The facility will be 
used for general corporate purposes.
On 16 February 2012, the Group signed the 
refinancing of the US$500 million revolving 
credit facility. The amount of the facility was 
reduced to US$467 million and has been 
arranged on a club deal basis with Credit 
Agricole acting as the coordinating bank. 
This is a two year facility and bears an 
interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%. 
Tuoli
On 10 January 2012, the Group entered  
into an agreement with Hebei Taihang Jiye 
Mineral Resources Co. Ltd. (‘Hebei Taihang’) 
which will result in the transfer of its shares in 
Tuoli for consideration of US$1 subject to the 
satisfactory receipt of outstanding trade 
receivables. The investment represents 50% 
of the issued capital of Tuoli. The balance of 
this capital is already held by Hebei Taihang. 
The first payment under this agreement was 
received on 15 March 2012 and operational 
control transferred to Hebei Taihang at  
this date.
2011 Final dividend 
For 2011 the Board has recommended a 
final dividend of US 11 cents per share, 
amounting to US$142 million, to be paid on 
21 June 2012 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 30 March 2012.

investment amounted to US$156 million, 
including a US$98 million payment to the 
Nazarbayev Fund in Kazakhstan to support 
the development of university education  
in that country (2010: US$63 million).

investment is included in the Sustainable 
Development Review on page 40 of this

with the Sustainable Development Report,  
to be published separately.
Financial instruments

management, objectives and policies, 
together with details of financial instruments 
are described in note 32 to the Consolidated 
financial statements on pages 120 to 125.
Significant agreements
The following represent significant 
agreements and other potential legal 
impediments which may entitle the 
counterparties to exercise termination or 
other rights in the event of a change of 
control of the Company.
Article 13 of the Kazakhstan 
Subsurface Law
The Republic of Kazakhstan may be entitled 
to exercise pre-emptive rights over certain 
issuances or sales of ordinary shares or 
assets shared by the Group. Article 13 of the 
Kazakhstan Law on Subsoil and Subsoil Use 
provides that the Republic of Kazakhstan 
has pre-emptive rights to purchase certain 
subsurface use rights or indirect or direct 
interests in companies having subsurface 
use rights for sale. This pre-emptive right 
permits the Republic of Kazakhstan to 
purchase any such subsurface use rights or 
equity interests being offered for sale on no 
less favourable terms than those offered by 
other purchasers.
Euro Medium Term Notes
On 13 May 2010 the Group established a 
Euro Medium Term Note (‘EMTN’) 
programme for up to US$3 billion. Subject to 
relevant laws and regulations, notes can be 
issued in a variety of forms and for a range of 
maturity periods. Proceeds from any issues 
under the programme may be used for the 
Group’s capital expenditure programme, 
potential future acquisitions and for general 
corporate purposes. There were no issues 
outstanding under the programme as at  
31 December 2011.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control, 
the holder of any note under the EMTN 
programme will have the right to require the 
issuer to purchase such note at a purchase 
price in cash equal to 101% of the nominal 
amount together with (if appropriate) interest 
accrued to the date of purchase.
For these purposes, ‘change of control’ 
means the occurrence of any of the 
following:
• The direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, 
conveyance or other disposition (other 
than by way of merger, amalgamation  
or statutory plan of arrangement or 
consolidation) of all or substantially all of 
the assets of ENRC PLC to any person or 
group (other than to ENRC PLC, one of its 
subsidiaries or one or more Permitted 
Holders); or
• The consummation of any transaction 
which results in any person other than a 
Permitted Holder or a group (other than a 
group that includes one or more Permitted 
Holders) becoming the beneficial owner 
directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of 
the combined voting power of the issuer’s 
voting stock.
A ‘Permitted Holder’ is any of: 
•  Messrs Chodiev, Machkevitch and 
Ibragimov and any related person or trust; 
or
• The State Property and Privatisation 
Committee of the Ministry of Finance  
of the Republic of Kazakhstan (and any 
successor entity thereto).

Directors’ Report continued Structured Trade Finance Facility
On 5 October 2010 the Group entered into  
a US$500 million structured trade finance 
facility with a group of international lenders. 
The facility has an applicable interest rate  
of one month LIBOR plus 3.37% and is 
repayable over three years. As at 31 
December 201 1 US$367 million of the facility 
was outstanding (2010: US$500 million).
Revolving Credit Facility 
On 18 March 2011, the Group entered into

2.25% per annum. At 31 December 2011 
US$50 million of the facility was drawn down. 
Export Credit Facility 
On 7 February 2011, the Group entered into 
an ECA Facility agreement for the amount of 
€185 million. The agreement has an 11 year 
draw down facility and bears an interest rate 
of six month EURIBOR plus 1.2% per 
annum. Euler Hermes Kreditversicherungs 
AG has provided credit insurance to support 
the facility. At 31 December 2011, US$43 
million of the facility was outstanding (US$65 
million less transaction fees amounting to 
US$22 million).
Russian Commercial Bank (Cyprus) 
Limited (part of the VTB Group) 
On 30 September 2011, the Group entered 
into a US$1,000 million loan agreement with 
Russian Commercial Bank (Cyprus) Limited 
(part of the VTB Group). The loan has an 
applicable interest rate of 6.1% per annum 
and is repayable initially in three years by 
bullet repayment with a two-year term-out 
option. No security has been pledged as 
part of the agreement and US$40 million  
of the facility was outstanding at 31 
December 2011 (US$50 million less 
transaction fees amounting to US$10 million). 
Change of control
The Structured Trade Finance Facility, the 
Revolving Credit facility, the Export Credit 
Facility and the US$1,000 million loan 
agreement with Russian Commercial Bank 
(Cyprus) Limited have broadly similar change 
of control provisions described below.
If at any time a change of control occurs and 
if the majority lenders so require, any lender 
may decline to fund a draw down and may 
cancel its commitment under the facility and 
require that its portion of any outstanding 
loan, together with accrued interest, be due 
and payable in full by giving not less than  
10 days’ notice.
For these purposes, ‘change of control’ 
means any person or group of persons 
acting in concert who gains direct or indirect 
control of the Company and ‘control’ means 
the power (whether by way of ownership of 
shares, proxy, contract, agency or otherwise) 
to cast more than one half of the maximum 
number of votes that might be cast at a 
general meeting of the Company as 
applicable or appoint or remove all, or the 
majority of, the Directors or give directions 
with respect to the operating and financial 
policies of the Company.
Auditors and disclosure of information 
to auditors
The Group’s external auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have 
indicated their willingness to continue in office 
and a resolution seeking to reappoint them 
will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Each of the Directors at the date of approval 
of this report confirms that so far as the 
Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware; and the Directors have taken all 
the steps that they ought to have taken as 
Directors to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Group’s auditors are aware of the 
information. The confirmation is given and 
should be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.

The Group’s statement on corporate 
governance is included in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 51 to 58 of 
this Annual Report and Accounts.

Directors’ Report continued Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are 
responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Report 
and the financial 
statements in accordance 
with applicable law  
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as 
adopted by the European Union, and the 
Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period.  
In preparing these financial statements,  
the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• State whether IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union and applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in  
the Consolidated and Parent Company 
financial statements respectively; and
• Prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Company will continue in 
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and the Group  
and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Remuneration Report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Consolidated financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 48 and 49 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• The Consolidated financial statements, 
which have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Group;
• The Parent Company financial statements, 
which have been prepared in accordance 
with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Company; and
• The Directors’ Report and Business 
Review contained in pages 65 to 68 
include a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and  
the position of the Group, together with  
a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

Directors’ Report continued Independent Assurance Report to the Directors  
of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC
We have been engaged by the Directors  
of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation 
PLC to perform an independent limited 
assurance engagement in respect of the 
information set out below and included in  
the Annual Report and Accounts for the  
year ended 31 December 2011.
We planned and performed our work, 
summarised below, to obtain the evidence 
we considered necessary to reach our 
assurance conclusions on the Selected 
Data. The scope of our work was restricted 
to the Selected Data for the year ended  
31 December 2011 and does not extend  
to information in respect of earlier periods  
or to any other information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts 2011.
What we are assuring (‘Selected Data’)
The Selected Data as set out in the Annual 
Report and Accounts 2011 on page 39 
consists of:
• Workforce – employees;
• Fatalities (work-related);
• Fatalities (contractors and non 
work-related);
• Lost time injuries – employees;
• Lost time injury frequency rate;
• Community social investment;
• Energy consumed (production only);

Understanding reporting and 
measurement methodologies
There is not yet a generally established 
practice for evaluating and measuring the 
Selected Data performance information.  
The range of different, but acceptable, 
techniques used can result in materially 
different reporting outcomes which may 
affect comparability with other organisations. 
It is therefore important to read and 
understand the Reporting Principles that  
the Group has used to evaluate and prepare 
the Selected Data.
Work done by our independent and 
multi-disciplinary team of sustainability 
and assurance specialists

We performed the following activities: 
• Making enquiries of relevant ENRC 
management;
• Evaluating the design of the key processes 
and controls for managing, recording and 
reporting the Selected Data. This did not 
extend to testing that the controls operated 
as intended for the period under review;
• Limited substantive testing on a selective 
basis of the Selected Data documentation 
and management information. This 
included conducting site visits in 
Kazakhstan, Africa and corporate head 
office in London; and
• Checking disclosures in relation to  
the Selected Data for accuracy and 
consistency.
ENRC’s responsibilities
The Directors of ENRC are responsible for:
• Designing, implementing and maintaining 
internal controls over information relevant 
to the Selected Data; 
• Establishing objective assessment and 
Reporting Principles for preparing the 
Selected Data;
• Measuring the Group’s performance 
based on the Reporting Principles; and
• The content of the Annual Report and 
Accounts 2011.
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
• Forming independent conclusions, based 
on our limited assurance procedures; and
• Reporting our conclusions to the Directors 
of ENRC.
Our conclusions
As a result of our procedures nothing has come 
to our attention that indicates the Selected 
Data for the year ended 31 December 2011 
has not been prepared in all material 
respects with the Reporting Principles at 
www.enrc.com/en-GB/Media1/reporting
This report, including our conclusions, has 
been prepared solely for the Directors of 
ENRC PLC as a body in accordance with 
the agreement between us, to assist 
the Directors in reporting the Group’s 
sustainability performance and activities.

We have audited the Consolidated financial 
statements of Eurasian Natural Resources 
Corporation PLC for the year ended  
31 December 2011 which comprise:  
the Consolidated Income Statement; 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income; Consolidated Balance Sheet; 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement; 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity; and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied  
in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities  
of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 
69, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Consolidated financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility  
is to audit and express an opinion on the 
Consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK  
and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been 
prepared for and only for the Company’s 
members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, 
in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown  
or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior  
consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and  
the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information  
in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Consolidated financial 
statements: 
•	 Give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 
and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended; 
•	 Have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union; and 
•	 Have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the information given in  
the Directors’ Report for the financial  
year for which the Consolidated financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with 
the Consolidated financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of  
the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 Certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are  
not made;
•	 We have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit; 
or
•	 A Corporate Governance Statement has 
not been prepared by the Parent 
Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required  
to review: 
•	 The Directors’ Statement, set out on page 
69, in relation to going concern; 
•	 The part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified 
for our review; and
•	 Certain elements of the report to 
shareholders by the Board on Directors’ 
remuneration.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the Parent 
Company financial statements of Eurasian 
Natural Resources Corporation PLC for the 
year ended 31 December 2011 and on the 
information in the Remuneration Report that 
is described as having been audited.

The above Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes.
ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 77
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 1. Principal accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC (the ‘Company’) was incorporated and registered under the laws of England and Wales on  
8 December 2006. The address of the Company’s registered office and domicile is 16 St. James’s Street, London, SW1A 1ER, United Kingdom.  
The Consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2011 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) 
and the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates.
The accounting policies used in preparing these Consolidated financial statements (‘financial statements’) are described below and are based on 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’), the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom’s (‘UK’s’) 
Financial Services Authority (‘FSA’), the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and Article 4 of the European Union 
IAS Regulation. These standards are subject to interpretations issued from time to time by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (‘IFRIC’). These Consolidated financial statements have also been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified for the 
revaluation of certain assets and liabilities as further explained in the respective accounting policies.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also necessitates 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 2.
The financial statements have been drawn up on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2010 except where new policies have been applied. New accounting policies and pronouncements and the effects of 
these policies have been outlined below. 
Where the Group has changed the presentational format of these Consolidated financial statements to further improve the comparability of its 
results, comparative figures have been changed accordingly. This occurred in respect of the presentation of the mineral rights in property, plant 
and equipment as detailed in note 16. As detailed in note 5, the Group has also revised and/or completed the measurement period in respect of  
a number of acquisitions which has resulted in the restatements of the following: Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2010 and the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year ended 31 December 2010. 
As a result of a significant increase in the Group’s exploration costs, the Group now separately analyses these expenses in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. Additionally, costs amounting to US$4 million classified as an Other operating expense in 2010 have been reclassified to 
Exploration costs in the 2010 comparative. Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment amounting to US$13 million has been reclassified to 
Other operating income from Other operating expense in the 2010 comparative. Other taxes amounting to US$10 million classified as a prepaid 
expense in 2010 have been reclassified to Other taxes in the 2010 comparative. 
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’ (amendment) Effective 1 January 2011. The amendment clarifies that an entity will present an  
analysis of other comprehensive income for each component of equity, either in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes to the financial 
statements. As the amendment results in changes in the presentation, there is no impact on the Group’s financial result. 
IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosure’ (revised) Effective 1 January 2011. The standard amends the definition of a related party and modifies certain 
related party disclosure requirements for government related entities. As the change only impacts disclosure, there is no impact on the Group’s 
financial result (refer to note 4).
IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments’ Effective 1 January 2011. The amendment emphasises the interaction between quantitative and qualitative 
disclosure about the nature and extent of risks associated with financial instruments. As the change only impacts disclosure, there is no impact  
on the Group’s financial result.
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2011 and not  
early adopted
IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ (amendment) Effective 1 January 2013. 
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ Effective 1 January 2013. 
IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ Effective 1 January 2013. 
IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ Effective 1 January 2013. 
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ Effective 1 January 2013. 
IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ Effective 1 January 2013. 
IFRIC 20, ‘Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine’ Effective 1 January 2013. 
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the above listed amendments and new standards on its financial statements. 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
78 Unlocking Value 1. Principal accounting policies continued
b) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic 
benefits from its activities, generally accompanying, directly or indirectly, an interest of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company (acquisition date) and are de-consolidated from the 
date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between subsidiaries are eliminated. Accounting policies  
of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. The Group recognises any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate 
share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
c) Joint ventures 
Joint ventures are all entities over which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for 
strategic financial and operating decisions. The Group has elected to use the equity method to account for interests in jointly controlled entities, 
which are disclosed as joint ventures in the financial statements and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment in joint ventures 
includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The Group’s share of its joint ventures’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are 
adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the 
joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred.
d) Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between  
20% and 50% of the voting rights.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under  
the equity method, the Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of 
post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements 
are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the 
associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Investments in associates are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost as adjusted 
for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment  
and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred.
e) Functional and presentational currency
All amounts in these financial statements are presented in millions of US$, unless otherwise stated.
The functional currency of the significant operating entities is either the Kazakhstani tenge (‘KZT’), or the Russian rouble (‘RUB’) or Brazilian real 
(‘BRL ’), whilst for the Sales and Marketing entities and significant African operations it is the US dollar (‘US$’). The functional currency for major 
entities in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. The following additional factors are 
considered in determining the functional currency of a foreign operation:
•	 Whether the activities of the foreign operation are carried out as an extension of the reporting entity, rather than being carried out with a 
significant degree of autonomy;
•	 Whether transactions with the reporting entity are a high or a low proportion of the foreign operation’s activities;
•	 Whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation directly affect the cash flows of the reporting entity and are readily available  
for remittance to it; and
•	 Whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation are sufficient to service existing and normally expected debt obligations without 
funds being made available by the reporting entity.

f) Foreign currency translation
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated to the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions and the translation of monetary assets and 
liabilities are taken to the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. 
g) Translation from functional to presentational currency
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentational currency are translated into 
the presentational currency as follows: 
•	 Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; 
•	 Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the 
dates of the transactions);
•	 All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity; and
•	 Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate at the date of acquisition. When a subsidiary is disposed of through sale, liquidation, repayment of share capital  
or abandonment of all, or part of, that entity, the exchange differences deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement. 
h) Revenue recognition 
A significant portion of production is sold under contracts of sale of goods. Revenue from sales of goods is only recognised on individual 
shipments when persuasive evidence exists that the following criteria are satisfied:
•	 The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have been transferred to the buyer. If it is arranged that the goods are transported 
to a specified location, revenue is recognised when the goods are passed to the customer at the destination point. The revenue from sales of 
many products is subject to adjustment based on an inspection of the product by the customer. In such cases, revenue is initially recognised on 
a provisional basis using the Group’s best estimate of the quantity/quality of the product. Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of 
quantity/quality of the product is recorded in revenue once they have been determined;
•	 Neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold has 
been retained;
•	 The amount of revenue and respective costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably; and
•	 It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will flow to the Group.
80 Unlocking Value 1. Principal accounting policies continued
Revenues from sales of services are recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered by reference to the stage of 
completion of the specific transaction, assessed on the basis of the actual services provided, as a proportion of the total services to be provided. 
Revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. When the fair value of goods or services received in a barter 
transaction involving dissimilar items cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or service given up. 
Revenues are shown net of VAT and discounts.
i) Finance income and cost
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and gains and income on investment and trading securities. Finance costs comprise 
interest expense on borrowings, the accumulation of interest on provisions, interest expense from the unwinding of discount on provisions for asset 
retirement obligations and losses on the revaluation and disposal of investments designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Finance income and costs include foreign exchange gains and losses that relate mainly to loans receivable, borrowings and term deposits (more 
than 3 months).
Interest income and expenses are recognised on a time proportion basis, using the effective interest method. All interest and other costs incurred 
in connection with borrowings are expensed as incurred as part of financial expenses unless incurred on borrowings to finance the construction of 
property, plant and equipment in which case they are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its 
intended use. 
j) Income tax
The income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity. Kazakhstan Excess Profits Tax, being a tax on income, forms part of the income tax expense.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year. It is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. 
Deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the Consolidated financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred assets to be utilised. 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
branches, associates and interests in joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is disclosed in the financial 
statements.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same 
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
k) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on the 
balance sheet date. Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or when declared after the balance 
sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
l) Exploration and evaluation 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure related to an area of interest are written off as incurred until the management conclude that it is probable 
that future costs will be recovered through successful development and exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively through its sale, from 
which point they are carried forward as an asset in the balance sheet and are included as a component of property, plant and equipment at cost 
less impairment charges.
Capitalised costs include costs directly related to exploration and evaluation activities in the relevant area of interest. General and administrative 
costs are allocated to an exploration or evaluation asset only to the extent that those costs can be related directly to operational activities in the 
relevant area of interest. All capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is assessed for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that 
impairment may exist.
ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 81
www.enrc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
The following facts and circumstances, among others, indicate that exploration and evaluation assets must be tested for impairment:
•	 The period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the period or will expire in the near future, and is 
not expected to be renewed;
•	 Substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor planned;
•	 Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral 
resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area; or 
•	 Sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and 
evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, the exploration and evaluation assets subject to testing are grouped with existing cash-generating units 
of operating mines that are located in the same geographical region. Where the assets are not associated with a specific cash-generating unit, the 
recoverable amount is assessed for the specific exploration area.
Any impairment loss is recognised as an expense in accordance with the policy on impairment of non-financial assets.
Identifiable exploration and evaluation assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised as assets at their fair value at the date  
of acquisition. 
m) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Cost includes the original 
purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Depreciation is recorded 
over the useful life of the asset, or over the expected remaining life of the mine if shorter, as follows:
•	 Buildings (including mining premises): 20 to 50 years on a straight-line basis; 
•	 Mining assets (including mineral rights): on a units of production basis;
•	 Plant and equipment: 4 to 15 years on a straight-line basis; and
•	 Motor vehicles: 5 to 15 years on a straight-line basis.
Land is not depreciated.
The residual value of an asset is nil if the Group expects to use the asset until the end of its physical life. 
Estimates of residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually, and any change in estimate is taken into account in the determination of 
future depreciation charges.
The individual significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment (components), whose useful lives are different from the useful life of the 
asset as a whole, are depreciated individually, applying depreciation rates reflecting their anticipated useful lives. The cost of replacing major parts 
or components of property, plant and equipment items is capitalised and the replaced part is retired. 
Subsequent costs are included in an asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Specialised spare parts and servicing equipment with a significant initial value and a useful life of more than one year are recognised as items of 
property, plant and equipment. Other spare parts and servicing-related equipment are recognised as inventories and accounted for in the income 
statement on utilisation.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, in accordance with the 
impairment policy below.
i) Mining assets
Once a project has been established as commercially viable, capitalised expenditures are transferred from ‘exploration and evaluation’ to ‘mining 
assets’. In addition, mining assets include mineral rights, expenditure incurred to establish or expand productive capacity, costs to conduct 
mining-construction and mining-capital works, as well as costs arising from mining preparation works during the development or mine 
reconstruction phase.
Development expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the Group is accumulated separately for each area of interest in which economically 
recoverable resources have been identified. Such expenditure comprises costs directly attributable to the construction of a mine and the related 
infrastructure, including the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
When further development expenditure is incurred in respect of a mining asset after the commencement of production, such expenditure is carried 
forward as part of mining assets when it is probable that additional future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. 
Otherwise such expenditure is recognised as a cost of production.
82 Unlocking Value 1. Principal accounting policies continued 
Once a project has been fully commissioned, depreciation is charged using the units of production method, based on proved and probable 
reserves, with separate calculations being made for each area of interest. The units of production basis results in a depreciation charge 
proportional to the depletion of proved and probable reserves. 
Mining assets are included within the category ‘Buildings and mining assets’ of property, plant and equipment.
ii) Assets under construction
Assets under construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. Self-constructed assets include the cost  
of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of allocated overheads.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category. Assets under construction are not depreciated. Depreciation 
commences on the date when the assets are available for use.
iii) Stripping costs
Stripping costs comprise the removal of overburden and other waste products from a mine. Stripping costs incurred in the development of mines 
and open pits before production commences are capitalised as part of the cost of constructing the mines and open pits, and depreciated using 
the unit of production method over the lives of the mines or open pits.
Stripping costs incurred during the production phase of operations are treated as a production cost that forms part of the cost of inventory.
n) Impairment 
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and all other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if facts and circumstances 
indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in accordance with paragraph 99 of IAS 36 for Cash Generating 
Units (‘CGU’) where there has been significant headroom in the preceding assessment.
In other CGUs, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of ‘value in use’ (being the net present value of expected future cash 
flows of the relevant cash generating unit) and ‘fair value less costs to sell’ (the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset or CGU in an arm’s 
length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal). Where there is no binding sale agreement or active market, 
fair value less costs to sell is based on the best information available to reflect the amount the Group could receive for the CGU in an arm’s length 
transaction and based on Net Present Value (‘NPV’) of expected future cash flow of relevant CGUs. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of 
assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
The estimates used for impairment reviews to determine ‘value in use’ are based on detailed mine plans and operating budgets, modified as 
appropriate to meet the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Future cash flows are based on:
•	 Estimates of the quantities of the reserves and mineral resources for which there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction;
•	 Future production levels;
•	 Future commodity prices; and
•	 Future cash costs of production, capital expenditure related to construction in progress and development projects that are not yet completed, 
close down, restoration and environmental clean up.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income 
statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the conditions that originally resulted in the impairment. This reversal is recognised  
in the income statement and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been 
recognised in prior years. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
o) Business combinations and goodwill
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations. 
The Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis, to measure non-controlling interests at the value of their proportion of identifiable assets 
and liabilities or at full fair value. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the acquiree, represents goodwill. ‘Bargain purchase gain’ is recognised immediately in profit and loss. 
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, with contingent consideration recognised at fair value as part  
of that consideration transferred. The obligation to pay contingent consideration is classified as a liability or equity on the basis of the terms and 
conditions of the contingent consideration. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement  
is accounted for within equity. In a business combination achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured at  
its acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in conjunction with a business 
combination are expensed as incurred. 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to those cash-generating units or groups of CGUs that are expected to 
benefit from the business combination. These CGUs or groups of CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored 
for internal management purposes and these groups are not larger than the Group’s operating segments, which are its product groups.

1. Principal accounting policies continued
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in accordance with the impairment policy described in the note above. Goodwill is initially measured as 
the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed. Subsequently, goodwill is measured at cost initially recognised less accumulated impairment losses.
p) Intangible assets 
Intangible assets, which are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value when the fair value can be measured reliably on initial 
recognition. Intangible assets are tested for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, in accordance with the 
impairment policy described above.
Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives not exceeding 20 years.
q) Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: loans and receivables, financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets and held-to-maturity financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the 
financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
i) Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are unquoted non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and 
receivables comprise mainly ‘loans receivable’, ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the balance sheet.
ii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
iii) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other 
categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance 
sheet date.
iv) Held-to-maturity financial assets
Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Group’s 
management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Group were to sell other than an insignificant amount of held-to-maturity 
financial assets, the whole category would be reclassified as available-for-sale.
Recognition and measurement
Purchases and sales of financial instruments are recognised on the relevant settlement date, which is the date that an asset is delivered to or by the 
Group. The change in value between the trade date and settlement date is not recognised for assets carried at cost or amortised cost. The change 
in value between the trade date and settlement date is recognised in the income statement for financial assets as ‘at fair value through profit or loss’. 
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, loans and receivables are stated at amortised  
cost using the effective interest method. Where a loan is provided at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is re-measured at origination 
at its fair value, which is represented by future interest payments and principal repayments discounted at market interest rates for similar loans.  
The difference between the fair value of the loan at origination and its cost (fair value of the contribution to the borrower, net of transaction costs) 
represents an origination gain or loss. The origination gain or loss is recorded in the income statement within finance income/costs unless it 
qualifies for recognition as an asset, liability or a charge to equity in accordance with the substance of the arrangement. Subsequently, the carrying 
amount of the loans is adjusted for amortisation of the origination gain or loss and the amortisation is recorded as finance income/costs using  
the effective interest method.
Available-for-sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit  
or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Available-for-sale financial assets and 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Changes in fair value of available-for-sale financial assets, other than impairment losses and foreign currency differences on available-for-sale 
monetary items, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in  
equity is transferred to the income statement.
Interest on available-for-sale securities calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement. Dividends on 
available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.
Held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
84 Unlocking Value 1. Principal accounting policies continued
The Group derecognises financial assets when: (i) the assets are redeemed or the rights to cash flows from the assets have otherwise expired;  
(ii) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets; or (iii) the Group has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership but has not retained control. Control is retained if the counterparty does not have the practical 
ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party without needing to impose additional restrictions on the sale.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. 
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one 
or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future 
cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that 
the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, when it 
becomes probable that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, where observable data indicate that there is a measurable 
decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults, and prolonged decline 
in the value of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale.
i) Assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments carried at amortised cost has  
been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated  
future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The  
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of loss is recognised in the income statement. If, in  
a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the 
impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting an allowance account.
ii) Assets classified as available-for-sale
The decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in other comprehensive income. When there is objective  
evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity  
to the income statement as a reclassification adjustment even though the financial asset has not been derecognised. The amount of the  
cumulative loss that is reclassified from equity to the income statement is the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any principal 
repayment and amortisation) and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income  
statement. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale  
are not reversed through the income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale 
increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement,  
the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in the income statement.
r) Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of inventory is determined on a weighted average basis.
Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Cost for raw 
materials, consumable stores and other inventories is purchase price or extraction cost and for work in progress and finished goods is the  
cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation and overheads based on normal operating capacity, but excluding 
borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to 
completion and disposal.
s) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method  
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not  
be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the 
carrying amount and the recoverable amount, which is the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
The movement in the provision from the previous reporting period is recognised in the income statement. Significant financial difficulties of the 
debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered 
indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against ‘general and 
administrative expenses’ in the income statement. 
t) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with maturities  
of three months or less. Balances restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date  
are included in other financial non-current assets, while balances restricted for more than three months but less than 12 months after the balance 
sheet date are included in trade and other receivables. Restricted balances are excluded from cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
cash flow statement.
ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 85
www.enrc.com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
u) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference 
between the proceeds net of transaction cost and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings 
using the effective interest method.
Where a loan is obtained at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is re-measured at origination to its fair value, which is calculated  
as future interest payments and principal repayments discounted at market interest rates for similar loans. The difference between the fair value  
of the loan at origination and its cost (fair value of the contribution to the borrower, net of transaction costs) represents an origination gain or loss. 
The origination gain or loss is recorded in the income statement within finance income/costs unless it qualifies for recognition as an asset, liability  
or a charge to equity in accordance with the substance of the arrangement. Subsequently, the carrying amount of the borrowings is adjusted for 
amortisation of the origination gain or loss and the amortisation is recorded as finance income/cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the balance sheet date.
v) Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Where there are  
a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations  
as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations  
may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of  
time is recognised as a part of finance costs.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate 
asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. 
i) Asset retirement obligations and other environmental provisions
An obligation to incur asset retirement costs occurs when environmental disturbance is caused by exploration, evaluation, development or ongoing 
production. Costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan and are subject to regular review. Estimates are based on management’s 
interpretation of compliance with current environmental legislation in the country of operation.
Asset retirement costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to their net present value, are provided 
when the obligation to incur such costs arises and are capitalised into the cost of the related asset. These costs are charged against profits 
through depreciation of the asset and unwinding of the discount on the provision. Depreciation is included in operating costs while the unwinding  
of the discount is included as a financing cost. Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning or site rehabilitation of 
plant and other site preparation work are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset.
w) Employee benefit obligations
Defined benefit plans
The Group provides long-term employee benefits to employees before, on and after retirement, in accordance with labour union agreements  
in Kazakhstan, Russia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The agreement provides for one-off retirement payments, financial aid for 
employees’ disability, significant anniversaries and funeral aid. The entitlement to some benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining  
in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. Such benefits are valued consistent with an unfunded defined 
benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. 
The future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods is discounted to determine the present 
value. Since Kazakhstan, Russia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo do not have an extensive market of high quality corporate bonds,  
the market yields on government bonds are used as a basis for discount rates. The calculation is performed annually internally or by a qualified, 
independent actuary depending on the complexity of computations.
The expected costs of the benefits associated with one-off retirement payments are accrued over the period of employment using the same 
accounting methodology as used for defined benefit post-employment plans. This means that the difference between the fair value of the plan 
assets (if any) and the present value of the defined liabilities obligations is recognised as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. Actuarial gains 
and losses arising in the year are taken to the income statement in the period in which they arise. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses 
comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous 
actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including current service cost, any past service cost and the 
effect of any curtailments or settlements.
86 Unlocking Value 1. Principal accounting policies continued
Defined contribution plans
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. Obligations for contributions 
to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset 
to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Payroll expense and related contributions
Wages, salaries, and social insurance funds, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in 
which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group. On behalf of its employees, the Group pays those statutory pension 
and post-employment benefit amounts prescribed by the legal requirements of the countries in which it operates. These payments are expensed 
as incurred. 
Share-based bonus awards
The Group has equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the Group receives services from qualifying employees as 
consideration for equity instruments. The employee services received in exchange for the grant of the equity-settled payments are measured  
at the fair value of the equity granted and are recognised as expenses, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the awards subject to the Group’s estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, due to the employees 
leaving the Group prior to vesting. The amount recognised in the income statement as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of 
awards that vest. The fair values of equity-settled payments are measured at the dates of grant using a Monte-Carlo pricing model.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market 
vesting conditions. It recognises the impact on the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with corresponding adjustment  
to equity.
If the Group cancels or settles a grant of equity instruments during the vesting period, it treats this as an acceleration of vesting and recognises 
immediately the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period. Any payment 
made to a counterparty on the cancellation or settlement of a grant of equity instruments, even if this occurs after the vesting date, is accounted  
for as a repurchase of an equity interest (i.e. as a deduction from equity), except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value of the equity 
instruments repurchased, measured at the repurchase date. Any such excess is recognised as an expense.
x) Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
y) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction  
from the proceeds.
z) Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for making strategic decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the Group Chief Executive Officer. 
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
a) Taxation
The Group is subject to the taxation requirements in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Significant judgement is required in determining 
the position for income taxes across these jurisdictions owing to the complexity of tax laws, frequent changes in tax laws and regulations, and the 
manner of their implementation. Judgement must also be exercised whilst interpreting the interaction between different taxes and interaction 
between tax rules of different jurisdictions. 
Tax provisions are recognised by the Group in accordance with tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the taxing jurisdictions, and in 
accordance with requirements of the applicable accounting standards.
Note 14 contains information on current period tax charges, prior period adjustments, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities including, 
where appropriate, provisions against uncertain tax positions.

2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued
b) Ore reserve estimates
Ore reserve estimates are calculated based on the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  
of December 2004 (the ‘JORC code’) which requires the use of reasonable assumptions, including:
•	 Future production estimates – which include proved and probable reserves, resource estimates and committed expansions;
•	 Expected future commodity prices, based on current market price, forward prices and the Group’s assessment of the long-term average price; 
and
•	 Future cash costs of production, capital expenditure and rehabilitation obligations.
The Group’s ore reserves are based on its best estimate of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the relevant mining 
properties. Estimates are developed after taking into account a range of factors including quantities, ore grades, production techniques and 
recovery rates, forecast commodity prices and production costs.
Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period. This may impact the Group’s financial results. Changes in these estimates may impact 
depreciation charges (for assets depreciated on a unit of production basis – see note 1(m)), impairment charges on individual assets and CGUs, 
and asset retirement obligation provisions.
The Group’s estimates are normally supported by geological studies by independent mining engineering consultants and drilling samples to 
determine the quantity and grade of each ore body. Significant judgement is required to generate an estimate based on the geological data 
available.
c) Life of mines
Contracts for subsurface use expire between 2012 and 2041. Management expects that the subsurface use contracts will be extended at nominal 
cost until the end of the lives of the related mines, which range between 9 and 49 years. Any change to this assumption may impact the Group’s 
financial results by affecting depreciation charges (for assets depreciated on a unit of production basis – see note 1(m)), impairment charges on 
individual assets and CGUs and asset retirement obligations, as these items have been measured using the assumption that the subsurface use 
contracts will be extended until the end of the mine life.
If the contracts are not renewed at their current expiry dates, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment existing at the expiry date to  
be written off at the date of expiry is US$793 million as at 31 December 2011 (2010: US$923 million).
d) Asset retirement obligations
Provision is made for asset retirement obligations when the related environmental disturbance takes place. Decommissioning and rehabilitation 
expenditure is largely expected to take place at the end of the respective mine lives, which varies from 9 to 49 years. Provisions are measured 
using the net present value of the expected costs as outlined in notes 1 and 27 .
The provision represents management’s best estimate of the costs that will be incurred based on legislative and regulatory requirements. 
Significant judgement is required as many of these costs will not crystallise until the end of the life of the mine. 
Estimates are reviewed annually and are based on management’s interpretation of compliance with current environmental legislation in the country 
of operation. Significant changes in environmental legislation, restoration techniques and estimates of contamination will result in changes to 
provisions from period to period.
The long-term inflation rate currently applied in the calculation is 1.2%-9.0% as at 31 December 2011 (2010: 2.8%-5.8%) being the estimate of the 
rate of inflation over the mine lives. The discount rate currently applied in the calculation is 7 .9%-15.4% at 31 December 2011 (2010: 7 .9%-9.0%) 
being the estimate of the risk-free pre-tax interest rates for long-term government securities.  
e) Impairment of assets (financial and non-current)
As stated below, the Group considers, at least annually, the recoverability of the values of goodwill recognised in its financial statements.  
The Group also at the reporting date considers the recoverability of all assets if there have been any indications of impairment.
Financial assets
The recoverability of the value of financial assets is addressed through the Group’s usual procedures (refer note 1), for example the assessment  
of counterparty default risk, both customer and financial counterparties, and is not part of this impairment review.
Non-current assets and goodwill
Note 1 outlines the Group’s policy for impairment of long-term non-financial assets and goodwill. Significant judgement is used to determine the 
present value of cash flows used (including the estimated quantum and timing) in the Group’s impairment models. Judgement is also employed in 
the assessment of the value of an asset or group of assets prior to the receipt of a confirmed offer as well as for the estimation of future cash flows 
required to determine value in use.
88 Unlocking Value 2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued
If an impairment indicator exists, the Group’s approach is to consider the ability of its groups of CGUs, which have no goodwill in their financial 
statements, to generate future economic benefits which exceed the value of the related tangible assets in the financial statements.
In measuring the value in use for each CGU the Group based cash flow projections on the entities’ most recent business plans. Cash flow 
projections in these business plans are extrapolated until the last year of the life-of-mine applicable for each CGU. Cash flows have been projected 
for a maximum of 36 years as of 31 December 2011. The long-term US inflation rate has been used as the assumed growth rate in the preparation 
of these cash flows.
The key assumptions which formed the basis of forecasting future cash flows in the models as of 31 December 2011 are:
•	 Commodity prices, which are based on internal forecasts by the management of the Group’s sales and marketing business. These internal 
forecasts are compared to the forecasts of industry market researchers;
•	 Long-term costs are set in line with current operational performance, as adjusted for future inflation rates in countries of operation and, where 
applicable, the expected movements in key input costs;
•	 The successful extraction, processing and sale of the reserves in accordance with the quantities described in the report on Ore Reserves and 
Mineral Resources on pages 140 to 147 and companies’ long-term mine plans;
•	 The long-term US inflation rate will average 2.2% per annum, in line with external forecasts; and
•	 In determining the discount rate to be applied to the future cash flows the Group based its computation on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital 
for the Group, which is adjusted for the country risk premium for each CGU accordingly. The rates used were in the range of 10.81%-12.32%.
Please refer to note 17 for the results of impairment testing.
f) Business combinations 
Though not on the same scale as in the prior year the Group has made one acquisition during the year. Acquisition accounting requires 
judgements and estimates to be made as part of the measurement of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and the consideration 
transferred. Where necessary, the Group hired external valuation consultants to review the underlying records, make appropriate comparisons  
and ultimately advise on the likely fair value and economic useful lives of the acquired assets. Where external consultants are not used the values 
are estimated internally.
Notes 5 and 17 provide further details on the Group’s policy regarding business combinations and accounting for goodwill.
For groups of CGUs that were allocated goodwill the Group’s most recent business plans were used to calculate discounted future cash flows 
(‘Value in Use’ per IAS 36) and thus assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the goodwill. Cash flows in these business plans were 
extrapolated until the last year of life-of-mine applicable to each CGU as this period properly reflects the long-term nature of the Group’s assets.
The key assumptions which form the basis of forecasting future cash flows are the same as listed in section 2(e) above.
Please refer to note 17 for the results of impairment testing.
g) Contingent liabilities
The Group exercises judgement in measuring and recognising the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation or other 
outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities (see note 
35). Judgement is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range 
of the financial settlement. Because of the inherent uncertainty in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally 
estimated provision. 
3. Segment information
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed and used by the Group Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’)  
to make strategic decisions. The CEO considers the business from a products and services perspective and assesses the performance of the 
operating segments based on the measure of Underlying EBITDA (refer note 36).
The amounts provided to the CEO with respect to segment assets and segment liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the 
financial statements. These assets and liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment and their physical conditions.
Segment Underlying EBITDA, assets and liabilities includes items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated  
on a reasonable basis. Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and trade and other 
receivables, and mainly exclude investments in joint ventures and associates, other financial assets, loans receivable, unallocated term deposits 
and deferred and current income tax assets. Segment liabilities comprise primarily trade and other payables and mainly exclude borrowings and 
deferred and current income tax liabilities. Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for 
commencing, expanding or sustaining production.

3. Segment information continued
The Group is organised on the basis of six (2010: six) operating segments:
•	 Ferroalloys – comprises the extraction and sale of chrome ore as well as the production of ferroalloys from chromium and manganese ores;
•	 Iron Ore – comprises exploration, extraction, processing and manufacturing of iron ore products; 
•	 Alumina and Aluminium – comprises extraction and processing of bauxite and limestone, and smelting of alumina and aluminium;
•	 Other Non-ferrous – comprises the exploration and extraction, processing and manufacturing of copper and cobalt products, and the 
exploration of other minerals in Africa. Includes also the logistics and trucking operations throughout Southern Africa;
•	 Energy – comprises coal mining and power generation; and
•	 Logistics – Kazakhstan’s main freight forwarder and railroad operator, providing international logistics for all Eurasian based Group operations; 
also rail construction and repair services for the Kazakhstani state rail company. 
Internal charges between segments have been reflected in the performance of each operating segment. The Group has a number of activities  
that exist principally to support the metals operations including power generation, coal mining and transportation. Inter-segment transfers or 
transactions are entered into under a cost-plus pricing structure. The revenue generated from third parties reported to the CEO is measured in  
a manner consistent with that in the consolidated income statement. The identified operating and reportable segments of the Group are the  
same as those that applied to the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 with the exceptions noted below.
The management of the SABOT logistics business was transferred during 2011 to the Other Non-ferrous Division from the Logistics Division. As a 
result of this transfer the segment classification of the SABOT business changed, which has resulted in a restatement of the information for the year 
ended 31 December 2010. The impact of the SABOT restatement is a transfer of revenue of US$70 million, Underlying EBITDA of US$6 million, 
Segment assets of US$90 million and Segment liabilities of US$19 million from the Logistics Division to the Other Non-ferrous Division. In addition, 
the 2010 Segment assets and liabilities of the Iron Ore and Other Non-ferrous Divisions were restated as detailed in note 5 to reflect the completion 
of the fair value measurement period for Enya, Comit, SMKK, CCC, BMBV, MIBA and MPB.
On 30 December 2011 the Group acquired Rubio Holdings which is now included within the Other Non-ferrous operating segment.

Shubarkol Call Option Extension 
On 31 January 2011, the Group announced the extension of a call option (the ‘Call Option Extension’) originally granted in conjunction with the 
acquisition of a 25% interest in Shubarkol Komir JSC (‘Shubarkol’) in February 2009 (the ‘Call Option’). The Call Option gives the Group the right  
to acquire the outstanding 75% of the ordinary shares of Shubarkol for a consideration of some US$600 million. The Call Option Extension, which 
was granted for nil consideration, extended the expiry date of the Call Option by up to 12 months, to 31 January 2012. All other significant terms  
of the Call Option were unchanged. Shubarkol, one of Kazakhstan’s largest thermal coal producers, is majority owned by Eurasian Industrial 
Company JSC (‘EIC’), a private company beneficially wholly owned by the Founder Shareholders of the Group.
In October 2011 the Group announced its intention to exercise this option as described in note 38.

5. Business combinations
Acquisition of Rubio Holdings Limited (‘Rubio’)
On 30 December 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary shares of Rubio Holdings Limited (‘Rubio’) from Erste Resources SA (‘Erste’), 
which indirectly holds 74% of Amari Manganese (Pty) Ltd S.A. The total consideration for the acquisition was US$295 million. This is comprised  
of the following:
•	 An initial payment of US$36 million which was made in December 2011;
•	 The assignment of US$144 million of loans which were previously receivable by the Group from the parent company of Erste, Project Mining  
and Development SA; and
•	 Deferred consideration of US$115 million which is payable contingent on the successful completion of a bankable feasibility study. 
The main asset of Amari Manganese is the Kongoni Manganese project in the Kalahari Manganese Field of South Africa.
The provisional fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Rubio as at the date of acquisition are set out below:

The goodwill recognised on acquisition is the result of the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability on the acquired mineral rights (within 
property, plant and equipment). None of the recognised goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The accounting treatment 
to recognise this transaction as a business combination is provisional. 
In May 2011 the Group acquired a 25% interest in Project Mining and Development SA (parent company of Erste) for the value of US$25 million.  
On 30 December 2011 Project Mining and Development repurchased these shares for US$25 million, which was received in January 2012. 
Acquisition costs of US$0.3 million have been expensed and included in general and administrative expenses in the income statement. The Group 
has chosen to recognise the non-controlling interests for this acquisition based on their proportionate share of the identifiable net assets of the 
acquiree. 
The acquired businesses contributed revenue of US$nil and loss after income tax of US$nil from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2011.  
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the impact to the Group’s revenue would have been an additional US$nil whilst the 
impact to profit after income tax would have been an additional loss of US$nil. 
Dezita, previously reported in the Half Year Results as a business combination, has now been determined to be an asset purchase (see note 16).
Prior period acquisitions – restatement of consolidated balance sheets 
The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of certain acquisitions as at the date of acquisition were provisionally estimated and disclosed 
in the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010. The Group has now completed or updated the measurement 
of these fair values and made final adjustments. The following tables set out the adjustments to the provisional fair values previously reported and 
the final fair values at acquisition date.
These adjustments have been recorded as a prior period restatement of the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Group at 31 December 2010.  
There is no impact to the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Further detail regarding the individual restatements is set out later in this note.

Mineração Minas Bahia SA (‘MIBA’) and Mineração Peixe Bravo (‘MPB’)
On 18 October 2010 the Group announced the acquisition of 100% of Mineração Minas Bahia SA and of 51% of Mineração Peixe Bravo SA.  
The total payments in respect of the acquisition were US$304 million which included: 
•	 US$250 million payable to the shareholders of MIBA and MPB; and
•	 Up to US$54 million payable to Steel do Brasil Participações SA (‘Steel do Brasil’).
Of the US$304 million payments, a total of US$60 million (including all amounts paid to Steel do Brasil) was expensed as acquisition-related costs 
in the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 as it did not form part of the acquisition consideration under 
IFRS. In addition the Group held a 3-year option to purchase the remaining 49% of MPB from its shareholders for a further US$50 million. 
At 31 December 2010 amounts totalling US$144 million (undiscounted) remained payable to the vendors and the option for US$50 million was not 
exercised. As a result of further review of the assets acquired, the Group agreed with the vendors of MIBA and MPB that the consideration would 
be revised. This revision included the option for the remaining 49% of MPB. On 3 August 2011 the Group paid US$120 million as a full and final 
settlement of all outstanding amounts to acquire 100% of the interests in MIBA and MPB. This payment represents a reduction in the total potential 
consideration of US$74 million (including the original option of US$50 million for the remaining interest in MPB). 
Full details regarding the acquisition can be found in the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010. The impact 
of this change in the consideration has been recorded as a prior year restatement of the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Group as at  
31 December 2010. There is no impact to the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2010.

31 December 2010.
Congo Cobalt Corporation Sprl (‘CCC’)
With effect from 1 July 2010 the Group acquired CCC, a legal entity registered in the DRC that provides mining contracting services to Boss Mining 
Sprl and SMKK. Following the fair value finalisation of the entity’s assets and liabilities, goodwill of US$11 million has been recognised in respect of 
this acquisition arising from adjustments to trade and other payables, current income tax liability and property, plant and equipment. 
Fair value estimates
The provisional values of assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition are their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Accounting 
standards permit up to 12 months for provisional acquisition accounting to be finalised following the acquisition date if any subsequent information 
provides better evidence of the item’s fair value at the date of acquisition.
For all business combinations, the Group either undertook or is in the process of finalising its review of the fair value of assets and liabilities 
recognised at the date of acquisition. Such reviews may include engaging third party advisors to determine the fair values of the cash-generating 
units of the entities acquired.

Factors affecting future tax charges
Future tax charges are affected by changes to the applicable laws and regulations in, as well as profit mix from, the jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates. Given that the Group is subject to Excess Profits Tax in the Republic of Kazakhstan, future tax charges are also affected by product 
prices and profitability levels achieved on subsurface use contracts in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The applicable rate of Corporate Income Tax in the UK was reduced from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011. A reduction to 25% with effect 
from 1 April 2012 was enacted on 19 July 2011. In March 2012, a further reduction in the applicable rate of Corporate Income Tax to 24% with 
effect from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted. A proposal to reduce the rate to 23% from 1 April 2013 and to 22% from 1 April 2014 has also 
been announced.

Total carrying amount of goodwill 1,373 1,348
Goodwill is allocated to the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) expected to benefit from the business combination. Typically this is in accordance with  
the Group’s operating segments. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy disclosed in note 1. As at 31 December 2011, a US$7 million (2010: US$nil) 
impairment charge has been recognised in relation to the goodwill generated on the Tuoli acquisition in October 2008. 
Sensitivity of recoverable amounts
Management believes that, currently, there are no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions that would lead goodwill to be 
impaired for the majority of its businesses. The exception is in the CGU in the Alumina and Aluminium Division, as described below.
At the end of 2011, the analysis of recoverable amounts for Aluminium of Kazakhstan JSC (‘AoK’) resulted in headroom that necessitated a review 
of sensitivities to the main assumptions used. The impairment test for this CGU is particularly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, discount 
rate and operating costs.
Whilst the Directors remain confident in the assumptions used in the value in use computations, adverse changes in assumptions as described 
below could result in impairment charges.

Shubarkol Komir Joint Stock Company (‘Shubarkol’)
On 16 February 2009 the Group acquired a 25% interest in Shubarkol, a major semi-coke and thermal coal producer incorporated in Kazakhstan, 
for a cash consideration of US$200 million.
Shubarkol is majority owned by Eurasian Finance-Industrial Company JSC (‘EFIC’), a company controlled by the Founder Shareholders.
At 31 December 2011 the Group had exercised its option to acquire the outstanding shares in Shubarkol with the completion of this transaction 
being subject to shareholder approval. Further details regarding the approval of this transaction can be found in note 38. As the acquisition of 
Shubarkol remained subject to shareholder approval at 31 December 2011 the Group consider that it did not have control over Shubarkol and 
therefore continued to treat it as an associate. At 31 December 2011, the fair value of the option was US$nil.

Acquisitions 
Camrose Resources Limited (‘Camrose’)
In August 2010, the Group purchased 50.5% of the issued share capital of Camrose and formed the Camrose joint venture. The interest in 
Camrose was purchased from Cerida, Silvertide Global Limited and Zanette Limited, which are owned by the Gertler Family Trust. Camrose’s 
primary assets, held through its subsidiaries, are high quality copper and cobalt exploitation licences located in the DRC. The consideration for the 
acquisition was US$175 million. The Group paid US$50 million in cash and issued promissory notes totalling US$125 million which mature between 
9 months and 24 months (refer to note 26). As part of the acquisition, the Group provided Camrose with a US$400 million shareholder loan facility. 
The loan has been made available to Camrose for the purposes of satisfying existing payment obligations on the part of the Highwind Group (as 
defined below), repaying committed loans previously undertaken by Camrose, funding working capital, commencing feasibility studies, as well as 
mine planning and development. The Group also provided a guarantee to secure repayment of US$155 million by Cerida of outstanding debt. 
Camrose, through its subsidiaries, primarily holds interests in five copper and cobalt exploitation licences situated in the DRC by way of:
•	 45,400,000 common shares of Africo Resources Limited (‘Africo’), representing approximately 64% of the issued share capital of Africo, which is 
listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Africo owns a 75% interest in the exploitation licence for the Kalukundi property in the Kolwezi District of 
Katanga Province in the southeast of the DRC. The remaining 25% is owned by Gécamines;
•	 A 56% indirect interest in La Congolaise de Mines et de Développement (Comide Sprl) (‘Comide’) of which Gécamines holds a 25% interest in 
Comide. Comide holds the exploitation licences for Kii, Mashitu and Pangalume, which are contiguous to Africo’s Kalukundi property; and
•	 The entire share capital of Highwind Properties Limited, Pareas Limited, Interim Holdings Limited and Blue Narcissus Limited (together, the 
‘Highwind Group’). Under the terms of a joint venture agreement dated 7 January 2010, between the Highwind Group, the DRC Government, 
Gécamines and Simco Sprl, an entity associated with Gécamines, the Highwind Group holds a 70% interest in Treatment of Kingamyambo 
Tailings Company (‘Metalkol’) which owns the tailings exploitation licence (PER 652) covering the Kolwezi Tailings Site (otherwise known as the 
Kingamyambo Musonoi Tailings, otherwise known as Kolwezi Mine Tailings (‘KMT’)), a licence site located in the Kolwezi District of Katanga 
Province in the southeast of the DRC. Development of the site is subject to feasibility studies being completed. Metalkol has not acquired any 
infrastructure or equipment at the Kolwezi Tailings Site.
The acquisition is complementary to the Group’s existing operations in the DRC. The Camrose assets held by Camrose and its subsidiaries are 
contiguous to the Group’s existing assets held in the DRC. These proximate homogenous ore bodies have the potential to share power allocation 
and logistics capacity, with the ability to reduce mining costs through the optimisation of mining methods and enhanced scale of processing facilities.
The Group has a 50.5% interest in Camrose and exercises day-to-day operational control. This is accounted for as a joint venture due to certain 
reserved matters in the shareholders’ agreement governing this relationship.
The Group announced on 2 March 2012 that it has completed the acquisition of First Quantum Minerals Limited’s (‘FQM’) residual claims and assets 
in respect of the Kolwezi Tailings project, the Frontier and Lonshi mines and related exploration interests. Further details can be found at note 38.

In accordance with the contracts on subsurface use, the Group makes annual obligatory contributions to form a deposit fund for the closure costs 
which will take effect upon exhaustion of the mineral deposits at the end of respective mine lives, which varies between 9 and 49 years.
The amount of the provision for asset retirement obligations is determined using the nominal prices effective at the reporting dates by applying  
the forecasted rate of inflation for the expected period of the life of the mines. Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes  
in regulatory requirements, decommissioning and reclamation alternatives and the level of discount and inflation rates.

31. Share-based payments
The Group has established a Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) and a Deferred Share Plan (‘DSP’) with a view to attracting, retaining and motivating 
the Executive Directors and selected senior management. 
The LTIP share awards are equity settled share-based payment transactions which vest on the third anniversary of the grant date subject to 
achievement of performance targets. The LTIP performance target is based on the Group’s total shareholder return, ranked against a comparator 
group of other international mining companies over a three year period. Further information on the LTIP is disclosed in the Remuneration Report  
on pages 59 to 64.
The DSP was approved at the 2011 General Meeting. It is expected that participants of the DSP will receive awards over ordinary shares of the 
Company in the form of rights to acquire a specified number of ordinary shares either by issue or transfer of ordinary shares at the end of the 
vesting period or rights to call for ordinary shares at the end of vesting period and for a predetermined period thereafter. 
In circumstances where an employee ceases to be employed prior to the vesting date for these schemes for reasons except dismissal, the Board 
has the discretion to allow the employee’s award to vest to the extent they deem the performance target would have been satisfied if pro-rated to 
the date of cessation of employment.
In 2011, no awards were made under either of these schemes, however certain cash-settled awards were made in lieu of these share-based 
arrangements during December 2011. In 2012 the Remuneration Committee agreed that a proportion of Executive Directors’ annual bonus  
be deferred into shares. Further details are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 59 to 64.
Details of grants and assumptions in the calculation of fair value under the LTIP are set out in the table below:
 Grant 3 Grant 2 Grant 1
Grant date 26 April 2010 20 April 2009 07 May 2008

   The Group’s estimated share price volatility is based on the historical average annualised volatility of the comparator group of mining companies and reflects the assumption 
that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the awards is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. The increase in volatility 
for Grant 2 and Grant 3 was due to the changes in market conditions over one historical period similar to the life of the awards. 
2
   The estimated dividend yield for Grant 2 and Grant 3 was based on the Group’s historical dividend payments. For Grant 1, the expected dividend yield was deemed to be the 
average of the comparator group of mining companies as the Group had not paid any dividends prior to the grant date of Grant 1.
3
   The risk free interest rate is a government bond rate over a period similar to the life of the awards. 
ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 119
www.enrc.com 31. Share-based payments continued
The estimated fair value of each share granted under the LTIP is calculated by applying a Monte Carlo simulation model. At 31 December 2011  
and at 31 December 2010 the median benchmark comparator was not met. As a result Grant 1 did not vest and Grant 2 will not vest. 
Recognition of services received
An expense of US$8 million (2010: US$8 million) for share-based payments was recognised during the year ended 31 December 2011 within 
employee benefit expense in the income statement. During 2011 payments of US$nil (2010: US$nil) were made to LTIP participants.  
The expense in respect of the cash-settled schemes for 2011 is not material.
The table below sets out the movement in shares granted under the LTIP:

The weighted average remaining life of share options outstanding at the year ended 31 December 2011 was 273 days.
32. Financial risk management 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk (including foreign currency risk, interest rate  
risk and commodity price risk). The Group may use derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
Financial risk management is the responsibility of the treasury function which identifies, evaluates and, if appropriate, hedges financial risks in close 
cooperation with the Group’s operating divisions. The Treasury Policy outlines principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies 
covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments, and investment of 
excess liquidity.
Credit risk 
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets. The Group has credit insurance for the majority of its sales. Credit limits are set 
by the Group in accordance with limits provided by the credit Insurance company.
The development of the Group’s relationship with its two largest Russian customers, MMK and RUSAL, is described in the Operating Review. 
The Group undertakes rigorous credit control procedures which are closely monitored by the Chief Commercial Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer. These procedures are regularly reviewed in light of the limited availability of credit insurance. As a general rule, for those sales to non-major 
customers where credit insurance is not available, the Group operates a policy of ‘cash on delivery’ and ‘letters of credit’.
The Group has established relationships with a number of international and domestic banks in the areas in which the Group operates. Individual 
credit limits are assigned to each counterparty according to an analysis of financial strength or published credit rating. Limits and exposures to 
each counterparty are regularly monitored and reported at each Board meeting. During the year a mixture of bank deposits and liquidity funds 
were used within the Group’s investment portfolio.
Our policy is to invest surplus funds with good quality banks or liquidity funds. Individual counterparty exposure limits are based on entity credit 
ratings published by at least one of the major credit rating agencies. In some areas where the Group operates it is necessary to deal with 
counterparties that do not have the required credit rating as prescribed by the policy. In these cases a counterparty limit will be calculated based 
on detailed credit analysis of the individual counterparty. The resulting credit limits are reviewed frequently to ensure that they remain appropriate.

In 2011 the top 10 customers as a proportion of the outstanding balance of the Group’s trade receivables accounted for 41% (2010: 42%). Based 
on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment review is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due by up to 60 days.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by 
delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet 
its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions. This is achieved by a combination of producing regular cash forecasts and 
ensuring that either adequate cash reserves or bank facilities are in place to meet future liabilities. 
The following table summarises the Group’s non-derivative financial assets and liabilities which will be settled on a gross basis into relevant maturity 
groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the tables are the 
contractual undiscounted cash flows, translated at balance sheet date exchange rates.

Foreign currency risk
The majority of the Group’s production costs are denominated in Kazakhstani tenge (KZT), Russian roubles (RUB) and South African rand (ZAR) 
while the majority of sales are denominated in US dollars (US$). The Group is therefore exposed to the risk that movements in exchange rates will 
affect both its operating profit and cash flows. The Group may enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge part or all of these risks.
The Group does not hedge translation risk as it considers the economic value of the Group’s assets to be US dollars rather than the currency in 
which they are accounted for locally.
The Group’s foreign currency exposure arises from: 
•	 Highly probable forecast transactions (sales/purchases) denominated in foreign currencies; and 
•	 Monetary items (mainly intercompany receivables, payables and borrowings) denominated in foreign currencies.

Interest rate risk
The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates. These assets and liabilities are exposed to  
fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk depending on whether they are subject to fixed or floating rates of interest. 
The objective of interest rate risk management is to manage and control interest rate risk exposures within acceptable parameters. The Group’s 
policy is to maintain a balance between fixed and floating interest rate risks. This is principally achieved by using a mix of fixed and floating interest 
rate borrowings or if necessary, entering into derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate of the debt portfolio. The Group’s 
significant interest bearing assets and liabilities are as follows:

Effect of a 1% increase in interest rates on profit before tax n/a 4 n/a 4
As shown above the impact on profit before tax of a 1% increase in interest rates would be a US$4 million decrease in profit before tax  
(2010: US$4 million increase) with an equal opposite effect if interest rates decreased by 1%. The US$4 million profit before tax decrease  
(2010: US$4 million increase) is entirely attributable to cash flow risk (floating rate interest) as the Group does not re-measure fixed rate financial 
assets and liabilities to fair value.
The impact on equity is the same as the impact on income. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign exchange rates, 
remain constant.
Commodity price risk 
The Group generates most of its revenue from the sale of commodities primarily ferrochrome, chrome ore, iron ore, alumina, aluminium, cobalt  
and copper. Historically, the prices of these products have been volatile and have fluctuated widely in response to changes in supply and demand, 
market uncertainty, the performance of the global or regional economies and cyclicality in industries that are end users of these products. 
Prices may also be affected by government actions, including the imposition of tariffs and import duties, speculative trades, the development of 
product substitutes or replacements, recycling practices, an increase in capacity or an oversupply of the Group’s products in its main markets. 
These external factors and the volatility of the commodity markets make it difficult to estimate future prices.
A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices would materially and adversely affect the Group’s business and the financial results and 
cash flows of operations. The Group does not hedge its exposure to the risk of fluctuations in the price of its products.

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group intends to maintain a capital structure in line with industry’s norms and practices which will be achieved over a period of time, taking  
into account investment opportunities and availability of debt finance.
The Group considers the following balances as a part of its capital management:
   As at 31 December

  7,643 6,492
Total capital 12,494 11,379

  Reserves include retained earnings, translation reserve, hedge reserve, and revaluation reserve of financial assets available for sale.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to manage its debt level. Reconciliations of the Group’s gearing and net debt position can be found  
in note 36.
The Group has recently been downgraded by both Standard and Poor’s (‘S&P’) and Moody’s credit rating agencies. The Group’s credit ratings  
are now BB- with S&P and Ba3 with Moody’s with both ratings on a negative outlook. It is possible that as a result of this action the Group’s 
access to future sources of debt may be restricted.
In order to ensure the Group has access to sufficient funding to finance capital expenditure and any future acquisitions, the Group has entered  
into new borrowing agreements subsequent to 31 December 2011, please refer to note 38 for further details. In addition to the new facilities, the 
Group can also issue notes under its US$3 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (‘EMTN’) programme.
Fair value of financial instruments
In determining fair value of financial instruments the Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and to verify assumptions that are 
mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date, as well as obtaining fair value measurements from other parties. 
For the financial instruments measured on the balance sheet at fair value, the Group has adopted the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in the active market is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. These instruments 
are included in level 1. As of 31 December 2011 and 2010, the Group’s available-for-sale financial assets (note 19) are included in level 1 of  
the hierarchy. 
As of 31 December 2011 and 2010, the Group did not hold financial instruments that are included in level 2 or 3 of the hierarchy. 
The fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost is based on expected cash flows discounted at prevailing interest rates for  
new instruments with similar credit risk and maturity.

Shubarkol Call Option Extension
In October 2011 the Group announced its intention to exercise the option to acquire the outstanding shares in Shubarkol Komir JSC for a purchase 
price of US$600 million. The General Meeting to vote on this related party transaction was subsequently adjourned in November. The Group 
posted an updated Circular and Notice of Adjourned General Meeting to shareholders on 21 March 2012 to seek approval for this acquisition at  
a reconvened General Meeting on 2 April 2012. At this meeting, the shareholders gave their approval to proceed with the transaction.
On 16 April 2012 the Group purchased the outstanding ordinary shares of Shubarkol for a total consideration of US$600 million. The accounting  
for the business combination is incomplete due to the timing of the acquisition and therefore has not been disclosed.
First Quantum Minerals Limited
The Group announced on 2 March 2012 that it had completed the acquisition of First Quantum Minerals Limited’s (‘FQM’) residual claims and 
assets in respect of the Kolwezi Tailings project, the Frontier and Lonshi mines and related exploration interests, all located in the Katanga Province 
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (‘DRC’), and settled all legal matters relating to these interests for total consideration of US$1.25 billion  
(a returnable deposit was paid in relation to the acquisition on 30 November 2011 of US$125 million). 
The total consideration comprises US$750 million which was paid on closing, together with a deferred consideration of US$500 million in the form 
of a 3-year promissory note with an interest coupon of 3% which is payable annually in arrears.
In connection with the transaction, FQM, ENRC and the DRC Government have also resolved all disputes relating to the companies being sold, 
and their assets and operations in the DRC, and have released one another in respect of all claims and judgements relating to the foregoing or to 
any other matter arising in the DRC on or before the date of closing.
Funding arrangements
On 1 February 2012, the Group entered into a credit facility agreement with Sberbank of Russia for US$2 billion. The facility has an applicable 
interest rate of LIBOR plus 6.3% and is repayable in 5 years. The facility is available as follows; 25% of the facility is available on 1 February 2012; 
50% after 3 months; 75% after 6 months and 100% after 9 months. The facility will be used for general corporate purposes.
On 16 February 2012, the Group signed the refinancing of the US$500 million revolving credit facility. The amount of the facility was reduced to 
US$467 million and has been arranged on a club deal basis with Credit Agricole acting as the coordinating bank. This is a two year facility and 
bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%. 
Tuoli
On 10 January 2012, the Group entered into an agreement with Hebei Taihang Jiye Mineral Resources Co. Ltd. (‘Hebei Taihang’) which will result  
in the transfer of its shares in Tuoli for consideration of US$1 subject to the satisfactory receipt of outstanding trade receivables. The investment 
represents 50% of the issued capital of Tuoli. The balance of this capital is already held by Hebei Taihang. The first payment under this agreement 
was received on 15 March 2012 and operational control transferred to Hebei Taihang at this date.
2011 Final Dividend 
For 2011 the Board has recommended a final dividend of US 11 cents per share, amounting to US$142 million, to be paid on 21 June 2012 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 30 March 2012.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 69, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those

Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that  
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition,  
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

with the Parent Company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
•	 Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
•	 The Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
•	 Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
•	 We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Parent Company’s profit and loss account has not been included in these financial 
statements. The Company had no recognised gains or losses during the year other than the profit for the year and therefore, no separate 
statement of total recognised gains and losses has been presented.
The financial statements on pages 132 to 136 were approved by the Board of Directors on 16 April 2012 and were signed on its behalf by:

132 Unlocking Value
Parent Company Balance Sheet as at 31 December 201 1
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC
(Registered number 6023510) 1. Principal accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation
These financial statements represent the individual Parent Company. 
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom. The Directors have reviewed the Company’s existing accounting policies and 
consider that they are consistent with last year. The principal accounting policies are set out below.
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is US dollars. At 31 December 2011, the exchange rate was £1 = US$1.5418  
(2010: £1 = US$1.5477) and the average rate for the year was £1 = US$1.5620 (2010: £1 = US$1.5451).
b) Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairment. Investments are tested for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. An impairment 
loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the higher of net realisable value and the discounted future 
earnings from the investment.
c) Financial assets and liabilities
Amounts owed by Group companies, which are interest bearing, are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently remeasured at amortised  
cost using the effective interest method.
Amounts owed to Group companies and term borrowings, which are interest and non-interest bearing, are initially recorded at fair value, net of 
transaction costs incurred, and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance income and expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. 
d) Financial guarantees
Financial guarantees are contracts that require the Company to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of the guarantee for a loss  
it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. 
Financial guarantees are initially recognised at their fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of  
the guarantee. Financial guarantees are recognised when a premium is paid or in the case of premium-free guarantees (such as intra-group 
guarantees) when the borrower receives the money from the financing entity. When the Company issues a premium-free guarantee or a  
guarantee at a premium different from market premium, fair value is determined using valuation techniques (e.g. market prices of similar 
instruments, interest-rate differentials, etc). 
The fair value of premium-free guarantees issued by the Company in respect of its subsidiaries’ borrowings are accounted for as capital 
contributions and recognised as an increase in the cost of investment in the subsidiaries.
Financial guarantee liabilities are amortised on a straight line basis over the life of the guarantees with respective income presented within other 
operating income. At each reporting date, the guarantees are measured at the higher of (i) the unamortised balance of the amount at initial 
recognition and (ii) the best estimate of expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. 
e) Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
f) Taxation including deferred tax
Current tax in respect of the taxable profit or loss for a period is provided using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted  
by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except where 
otherwise prescribed by the financial reporting standards. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised in respect of all timing differences  
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which  
the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance  
sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised on an undiscounted basis. 
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the profit and loss account for the period except to the extent that it is attributable to a gain or a loss 
recognised directly in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, in which case tax attributable to that gain or loss is also recognised 
directly in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. 
ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 133
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 
31 December 2011 1. Principal accounting policies continued
g) Share-based payments
The Company has adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) designed to reward senior management employees of the Group for achieving the 
Group’s strategic objectives and provide an appropriate level of long-term performance related pay. Each year, participants will receive conditional 
awards of shares in the Company which will normally vest three years after they are awarded. This is subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions, measured over a three-year performance period and continued service. 
The share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the Company’s financial statements and is measured at fair value of the equity 
instruments at the date of grant. The fair value was calculated by applying a Monte Carlo model.
In accordance with FRS 20, where a Parent Company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based 
compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the Consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an 
expense for such compensation with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent. Consequently, in the 
financial statements of the parent, the Company is required to record an addition to the Company’s investment in subsidiaries, with a corresponding 
increase recognised in other reserves, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. Failure to vest as a result of market 
conditions is not reversed.
Further details on the share-based payments can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report section of this Annual Report and notes to the 
Consolidated financial statements. 
h) Dividends
Dividends payable are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on 
the balance sheet date. Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or when declared after the balance 
sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue. 
2. Cash flow statement, related party and financial instruments disclosures 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from presenting financial instruments disclosures under the terms of FRS 29. The Company 
has not prepared a cash flow statement as a consolidated cash flow statement has been presented in the Consolidated financial statements of the 
Company. 
In accordance with exemptions under FRS 8 ‘Related party disclosures’, the Company has not disclosed transactions with wholly owned 
subsidiaries. 
3. Directors’ Report, Directors’ emoluments and employee information
The Directors’ Report including Directors’ Responsibilities Statement has been set out on pages 65 to 69.
The Company had 3 employees in 2011 (2010: 3 employees), who were also Directors of the Company. Emoluments of all the Directors are borne 
by ENRC Management (UK) Limited. Full details of the remuneration and share interests of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2011 are 
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report section of this Annual Report. 
4. Taxation including deferred tax
As at 31 December 2011, the Company has not recognised deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses of US$14 million (2010: nil) and other 
deductible timing differences of US$4 million (2010: US$4 million) on the basis of insufficient evidence of taxable profits being available against 
which the deferred tax asset may be utilised. The unrecognised deferred tax asset will be recognised in periods in which losses are utilised against 
taxable profits.
The main UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011. A further reduction to 25% with effect from 1 April 
2012 was enacted on 19 July 2011. On the basis the Company does not have any recognised deferred tax assets or liabilities at the balance sheet 
date, no remeasurement of these balances is necessary.
In March 2012, a further reduction in the applicable rate of corporation tax to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted,  
and further reductions in the applicable corporation tax rate to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 and to 22% with effect from 1 April 2014  
were announced. These changes have not been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

136 Unlocking Value
Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 
31 December 2011 continued SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd. (‘SRK’) has reviewed and restated in line with the 2004 Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves (the ‘JORC Code’) as published by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and 
Metallurgy, the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves for the various mining assets of ENRC. For the Kazakhstan assets this involved reviewing  
the GKZ ‘reserve’ statements as prepared in accordance with the local regulatory requirements of Kazakhstan, as of 31 December 2011. SRK  
has modified and translated ENRC’s GKZ ‘reserve’ statements and restated these as Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the 
terms and definitions given in the JORC Code, without recourse to fundamental recalculation.
Since preparing an independent Mineral Expert’s Report (‘MER’) on the mining, processing, smelting and power generating assets of ENRC in 
2007 , SRK has prepared annual updates of the JORC Code compliant Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves with site visits being undertaken  
on a two to three year basis. Site visits to Kazchrome’s Donskoy GOK chrome operations and Zhairemsky GOK’s manganese and iron-manganese 
operations were undertaken in February 2009 and February 2012. Site visits to Eurasian Energy Corporation’s (‘EEC’) Vostochny open pit coal  
mine and the SSGPO iron ore mines were undertaken in February 2010, and Aluminium of Kazakhstan’s (‘AoK’) KBRU and TBRU bauxite mines 
were most recently visited in February 2011. The team that visited Zhairemsky GOK in February 2012 also visited Kazchrome’s Kazmarganets 
manganese mining operations. The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Statements as of 31 December 2010 form the basis for the current update.
In addition to the Kazakhstan assets, Mineral Resource and, where appropriate, Ore Reserve statements have been reviewed and restated  
for Bahia Mineração SA’s (formerly known as BML) Pedra de Ferro and Jurema iron ore projects in Brazil and several of Boss Mining/SMKK’s 
copper and cobalt assets in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (‘DRC’). The dates of these statements relied on the data availability and are 
therefore not necessarily stated as per 31 December 2011. For BMSA, in line with the BFS Upside Assessment Report (‘UAR’) statement, the 
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are stated as of 1 June 2011. For the Boss Mining and SMKK assets, the date of the Mineral Resource 
statement is as of 30 June 2011 for the Kakanda South and North deposits, as of 31 December 2011 for the Mukondo Mountain and Kabolela 
deposits, and as of 1 March 2012 for the Kavundi, Taratara, Saafi and Chimbedia deposits. Site visits to the DRC assets were most recently  
carried out in February 2012.
SRK has reviewed the Ore Reserve statements in conjunction with ENRC’s price forecasts. The long-term prices used to support the current  
Ore Reserve declarations are: 
•	 Chromite at US$294/tonne and HCFeCr at US$2,418/tonne;
•	 Manganese concentrate products between US$103/tonne (low grade) and US$215/tonne (high grade) and iron-manganese concentrate 
products of US$53/tonne; 
•	 SSGPO iron ore at US$77/tonne for 66% concentrates, US$83/tonne for 69% concentrates, US$108/tonne for 63.5% pellets, US$117/tonne  
for 67% pellets, and US$381/tonne for HBI briquettes;
•	 BMSA Blast Furnace product at US$55/tonne, and US$68/tonne for direct reduction product, as per the Upside Assessment Report statement, 
dated 1 June 2011;

SRK has relied on ENRC and its technical representatives to ensure all technical information provided to SRK is accurate. A detailed information 
request list was submitted by SRK, and ENRC provided data during January and February 2012. 
The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve statements are based on the assumptions, assessments, recommendations and material changes  
as stated below.
Ferroalloys Division
Kazchrome
Donskoy GOK (Chrome ore)
In 2011 Donskoy produced 4.4 Mt of run of mine ore. Molodezhnaya underground mine produced 2.4 Mt and has a mine life of 11 years, producing 
between 1.7 and 2.4 Mtpa for the next ten years. The 10th Anniversary underground mine produced 1.9 Mt and has a mine life of 44 years, with an 
average 1.7 Mtpa from Phase 1 for the next 20 years. The deeper Phase 2 commences production in 2020, with production building up to around 
4.9 Mtpa in 2031, continuing to 2055. A significant portion of the Ore Reserves is dependent on successful application of new mining methods for 
both near surface and deposits at depth. Whilst studies have been carried out for these, the methods have not been trialled and will be at a higher 
cost than the current method being utilised. Due to the integrated structure of the Donskoy mines with the Aksu and Aktobe smelters, this higher 
mining cost will not negatively impact on the current Ore Reserve statement. Yuzhny open pit mined a minimal 0.03 Mt in 2011 and is due to 
produce 2.5 Mt of ore between 2013 and 2018, at a high stripping ratio. The Mineral Resource has decreased in line with depletion from the 2011 
production. The Ore Reserves have decreased both in line with depletion due to production and due to reclassification of portions of the Donskoy 
GOK’s mine plans in line with the requirements of the JORC Code, the latter amounting to only 2.6% of the Ore Reserve total. The investments 
required to sustain the current operations and to provide for planned expansions and improvements at the 10th Anniversary mine and the Aktobe 
smelter have been adequately allowed for.

Independent Expert Ore Reserves Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2011 Ferroalloys Division continued
Kazmarganets (Manganese ore)
The Ore Reserves for Tur are based on a life of mine plan ending in 2020. The current mining contract for Tur expires on 7 October 2021.  
The Vostochny Kamys Ore Reserves are based on a life of mine plan ending in 2013. The current mining contract for Vostochny Kamys expires  
on 28 June 2018. No operational changes are planned. Kazmarganets product is consumed by the Aksu smelter, and the Ore Reserves have 
therefore been stated on the basis that they are part of the integrated Kazchrome operations. During 2011 the mines combined produced 1.0 Mt  
of manganese ore.
Overall comment on Kazchrome 
The production levels planned for the chrome mines, process plants and smelters, and the respective operating costs, are considered to be realistic. 
The 10th Anniversary mine and the Aktobe smelter have substantial expansion plans and these appear to have been adequately investigated, planned 
and costed. The Ore Reserves for Donskoy and Kazmarganets are supported by the overall profitability of Kazchrome. Whilst minor recommendations 
have been made to ENRC, SRK finds all other requirements to be in place, including the mining contracts.
Zhairemsky GOK (Manganese and Iron-Manganese ores)
The Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves at Zhairemsky GOK have reduced by 2.6 Mt and 1.4 Mt respectively as a result of mining activities and 
stockpile depletion. The majority of production has been sourced from the Ushkatyn III open pit manganese operations (1.11 Mt), with additional 
manganese ore sourced about equally from the Ushkatyn III underground mine (0.30 Mt) and Zhomart open pit (0.31 Mt). Minor iron-manganese ore 
mining has taken place during 2011 (120 kt). There have been no material changes to the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves for Zhairemsky GOK 
outside of mining depletion activities in 2011. The current mining contract for Ushkatyn III expires in June 2015 and for Zhomart in June 2013. The Ore 
Reserves for the Zhairemsky GOK deposits are based on a life of mine plan to the end of 2031. SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the understanding 
that Zhairemsky GOK can extend these mining contracts under similar terms for periods that match their life of mine plans. In addition to the manganese 
and iron-manganese Mineral Resources at Zhairemsky, additional polymetallic Mineral Resources are also stated in the Annual Report and Accounts 
this year. 
Iron Ore Division
SSGPO (Iron ore)
In 2011 SSGPO produced 43.2 Mt of iron ore at 32.3% iron, from four open pits and one underground mine. The current mining contract expires in 
May 2015. SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the assumption that SSGPO will apply for, and be granted, at least one 25 year extension of this 
contract until 2040 under similar terms and conditions. The Ore Reserves are based on an overall life of mine plan for SSGPO until 2040. Currently 
no Ore Reserves are stated for the Sorsky and Shagyrkulsky deposits, but technical studies are currently being completed for the Sorsky deposit, 
which could potentially support full or partial conversion of the Indicated Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves. The Mineral Resources can support 
operations continuing beyond 2040. 
BMSA (Iron ore)
The Statement is in line with the Pedra de Ferro (‘PdF’) project BFS Upside Assessment Report Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve statement as 
issued at 1 June 2011. The Mineral Resources for PdF have been derived from those mineral rights licence areas that are attributable to BMSA as at 
this date, namely 870.830/2004, 870.283/2005, 81 1.466/1973, 292/1958, and 5247/1958. At the planned annual production rate for the UAR of 19.5 Mt 
of product, the life of mine will be 16 years. SRK however notes that construction for the UAR project has not yet started and plans are likely to change. 
If ENRC decides to proceed with an alternative development plan for the PdF project, it is very likely the Ore Reserves will be affected. In addition to 
the Mineral Resources for PdF, BMSA also has reported Mineral Resources for Jurema (Blocks 1 & 4), dated as at 9 January 2009. 
Alumina and Aluminium Division – AoK (Bauxite)
In 2011 the two divisions of AoK produced 5.5 Mt of bauxite: 5.11 Mt from nine operating open pits in three areas of KBRU and 0.4 Mt from three 
operating open pits at TBRU. The TBRU mining contract expires on 21 January 2017 , the mining contract for KBRU’s Vostochno-Ayatskoye expires 
on 26 July 2031 and the mining contract for the remaining KBRU deposits Ayatskoye, Belinsky and Krasnogorsky has recently been prolonged 
until 21 January 2042. SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the understanding that AoK can extend these contracts under similar terms for 
periods that match their life of mine plans. The Ore Reserves are based on an overall life of mine plan for AoK to the end of 2045. SRK notes that 
the economic viability of TBRU is dependent on the production from KBRU.
Energy Division – EEC (Coal)
Vostochny open pit coal mine produced 20.1 Mt of coal in 2011. The current mining contract expires on 18 March 2022. The Coal Reserves are 
based on a life of mine plan up to 2046 and on the understanding that EEC can extend the contract under similar terms for a period that matches 
the life of mine plan. The Coal Resources can support operations continuing beyond 2046.

Independent Expert Ore Reserves Report for the year 
ended 31 December 2011 continued Other Non-ferrous Division – Boss Mining and SMKK (Copper/Cobalt ores)
In line with last year’s Annual Report, SRK has reviewed four of ENRC’s copper-cobalt deposits located in the DRC, which ENRC acquired  
through its majority shareholding in Central African Mining and Exploration Ltd (‘CAMEC’) in 2009 and through the acquisition of Société Miniére  
de Kabolela et Kipese Sprl (‘SMKK’) in 2009 and 2010. The deposits reviewed and visited by SRK in February 2012 are: Kakanda North, Kakanda 
South, Mukondo Mountain and Kabolela. The original estimates were undertaken by international mining consultants, Coffey Mining. Mineral 
Resources for four additional deposits are included in this year’s statement: Saafi, Chimbedia, Kavundi and Taratara. The original estimates for 
these deposits were undertaken by Deswik. No Ore Reserves are stated for any deposits and current production is undertaken according to an 
internal mine plan. SRK notes, that whilst mining takes place on the Mukondo Mountain and Kabolela deposits, the current resource models are 
effectively exploration models. Because of this, as well as challenges regarding grade control, reconciliation with production figures is problematic. 
This is a significant issue which ENRC is engaged in resolving in the short term through:
•	 Upgrading the resource models, starting with Kakanda. The services of AMEC have been secured in this regard; and
•	 Improving grade control and metal accounting.
All Mineral Resources are presented on a 100% attributable basis.

A concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic 
interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, quality and quantity 
that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics 
and continuity of a mineral resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. 
Mineral resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological 
confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured categories.
Ore 
The naturally occurring material from which a mineral or minerals  
of economic value can be extracted profitably or to satisfy social or 
political objectives. The term is generally but not always used to refer 
to metalliferous material, and is often modified by the names of the 
valuable constituent, e.g. iron ore.
Ore reserves 
The economically mineable part of a measured and/or indicated 
mineral resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for 
losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate 
assessments and studies have been carried out, and include 
consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining 
metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social  
and governmental factors. These assessments demonstrate at the 
time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified. Ore 
reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into 
probable ore reserves and proved ore reserves.
Overburden 
In an open pit mine, the unwanted material that must be stripped 
away to reveal the ore beneath.
Pelletising 
The process of agglomerating fine product and moulding it into the 
shape of a pellet (a ball of 8 to 16 mm in diameter), which is more 
favourable in size and strength for more efficient downstream 
processing than the original fines.
Plant 
Commonly used as general term for fixed or moveable equipment 
required in the process of winning of raw material and downstream 
processing, including crushers, mills, smelters.
Platinum
Chemical element with the chemical symbol Pt.
Polymetallic
Composed of a combination of different metals.
Probable ore reserves
The economically mineable part of an indicated, and in some 
circumstances, a measured mineral resource. It includes diluting 
materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the 
material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been 
carried out, and include consideration of and modification by 
realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, 
legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. These 
assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction 
could reasonably be justified. A probable ore reserve has a lower 
level of confidence than a proved ore reserve but is of sufficient 
quality to serve as the basis for a decision on the development  
of the deposit.
Product cost per tonne
The total operating costs (as per the Consolidated income 
statement) over the volume of product sold.
Proved ore reserves
The economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource.  
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which  
may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments 
and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of  
and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, 
economic, marketing, legal environmental, social and governmental 
factors. These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting 
that extraction could reasonably be justified. A proved ore reserve 
represents the highest confidence category of reserve estimate.  
The style of mineralisation or other factors could mean that proved 
ore reserves are not achievable in some deposits.
Reductant 
A reducing agent; a reactant that donates electrons to other 
reactants during a redox reaction.
Refinery 
An electrolytic or chemical facility producing pure metals or metal 
compounds.
Resource delineation
Analysis by a qualified professional that determines the resource 
boundary.
Return On Capital Employed or ROCE
Profit before interest and taxation and exceptional items over 
average capital employed (borrowings and total equity, including 
minority interests).

or coal, prior to individual processing steps. Any heap of material 
formed for loading or other purposes.
Stripping ratio

be removed during open pit mining. 
Sulphide ore
A sulphur bearing ore containing appreciable levels of metals that 
ideally can be extracted and recovered profitably through various 
process techniques.

Dividends
As noted in the Directors’ Report on page 67 , and in the AGM Notice, the Board proposes a final dividend of US 11 cents per share, subject to 
shareholder approval being given at the AGM to be held on 12 June 2012. If the proposed final dividend is approved, it will be paid on 21 June 2012 
to all ordinary shareholders on the register of members on 30 March 2012. 
As the Group’s financial results are reported in US dollars, the dividend will be paid in US dollars. Registered shareholders may elect to receive  
their dividend in pounds sterling by submitting a currency election form to the Registrars. Shareholders who have not submitted a currency election 
form, but who wish to do so, may lodge their form at any time. However, in order for the submission to be effective for the next dividend payment, 
the form must be lodged with the Registrars by the close of business on the day immediately preceding the date of the dividend announcement. 
For the final dividend 2011, this date was 20 March 2012.
Any currency election form lodged with the Registrars will remain in force until such time as the instruction is amended. 
Dividend payment to your bank account

payment should contact the Registrars.

Forward-looking statements
This Annual Report includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, ‘forward-looking statements’. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of 
forward-looking terminology, including the terms ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, ‘plans’, ‘projects’, ‘anticipates’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’, ‘may’, ‘will’, or ‘should’ or, in each case, their negative 
or other variations or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy, plans, objectives, goals, future events or intentions. These forward-looking statements include 
matters that are not historical facts or are statements regarding the Group’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, the Group’s results  
of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, and the industries in which the Group operates. Forward-looking statements are based on current 
plans, estimates and projections, and therefore too much reliance should not be placed upon them. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, most of which  
are difficult to predict and generally beyond the Group’s control. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events  
and circumstances. The Group cautions you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that if risks and uncertainties materialise, or if the 
assumptions underlying any of these statements prove incorrect, the Group’s actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry  
in which the Group operates may materially differ from those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. In addition, even  
if the Group’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which the Group operates are consistent with the forward-looking 
statements contained in this Annual Report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in future periods. A number of factors could cause 
results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, general economic and business 
conditions, industry trends, competition, commodity prices, changes in regulation, currency fluctuations, changes in business strategy, political and economic uncertainty. 
Subject to the requirements of the Prospectus Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules or any applicable law or regulation, the Group expressly 
disclaims any obligation or undertaking publicly to review or confirm analysts’ expectations or estimates or to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking 
statements contained herein to reflect any changes in the Group’s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such 
statement is based. Nothing in this Annual Report should be construed as a profit forecast. The forward-looking statements contained in this document speak only as at the 
date of this document.

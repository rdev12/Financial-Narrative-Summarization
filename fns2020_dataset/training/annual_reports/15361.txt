Toolkit – local level marketing
Toolkit is T angent’s proprietary marketing tool developed 
for marketeers seeking to empower local level branch 
managers while retaining central core brand values.
The system runs completely online and is hosted, 
developed and owned by Tangent. 
Customers tend to be large organisations that recognise 
that throughout the UK their customers’ habits and buying 
preferences differ from town to town; however the people 
who are best positioned to know which product to offer 
a local audience are often the local managers.
Toolkit allows the central marketing department to retain 
control around the brand and even the different messages 
the branch manager can choose from; but ultimately it 
is the branch manager who chooses from the options 
available which promotion to run at a local level. 
In the year ended February 2007 the volume of orders 
generated through Toolkit increased by 65% against the 
same period in the prior year. Orders included point of 
sale, direct mail, merchandise and email. 
Customers include Greene King, Next, Procter and Gamble 
and Wolseley.

our services
Tangent Marketing Services – direct marketing
Tangent harnesses together multiple digital platforms 
to offer a complete targeted marketing solution to its clients. 
T angent aims to turn insight into more effective campaigns.
Our delivery involves a piece of customised and personalised 
marketing collateral, ranging from an email, a web 
page, a SMS message to a digitally printed mail piece.
The creative element is optimised to take the customer 
data into consideration and varies in content and imagery 
on a person by person basis. This ensures the campaign 
is aligned to customer behaviour and is more likely to 
result in higher conversion and response rates.
Each response can be measured independently, providing 
insight for future communications. For Sainsbury’s 
the redemption rate increased from 17% to 54% for 
one campaign when data on previous buying habits 
was used to optimise the creative process.
Customers include Creston, Sainsbury’s, TBWA and 
Virgin Mobile.

chairman’s statement
Tangent Labs’ sales run rate increased 
100% post acquisition
Ravensworth had the busiest month 
in the company’s history in April 2007, 
the first full month of ownership
Tangent’s financial performance in the year ended 28 February 2007 
showed strong growth in all the key performance indicators. Adjusted 
basic earnings per share before exceptional items increased by 16% to 
0.95p and net cash inflow from operations more than doubled to £1.18m. 
We acquired C360 UK Ltd (now re-named Tangent Labs) in July 2006 
which greatly enhanced our ability to provide customised marketing 
services across the internet, mobile and print media. Since taking 
ownership, Tangent Labs’ sales run rate has increased by over 100% 
by developing and selling its proprietary technology to an increasing 
customer base, including T angent clients. The company now plays a central 
role in creating the group’s value-add and in differentiating our 
client proposition.
In March 2007, subsequent to the year end, we acquired 
Ravensworth Digital Services for £5.85m, mainly funded by the issue 
of 46.6m shares placed at 13p. Ravensworth is a digital marketing 
business serving the property sector and has focused on installing its 
software and web based ordering system within estate agents and 
providing them with an overnight print and delivery service for their 
marketing materials. In its financial year ended 31 December 2006, 
turnover was £6.9m with adjusted operating profits of £1.1m. Based 
in Newcastle, in a modern, purpose built facility, the Ravensworth 
management team is quickly demonstrating how its customers 
and the plant utilisation can benefit from Tangent’s technology and 
marketing. We are currently ahead of budget in achieving anticipated 
phase one cost savings. 
The positive momentum has continued into the current 
financial year and each area of our business has started the 
year ahead of budget.

chairman’s statement
Tangent Marketing Services continued to grow and in November 2006 
we announced the launch of the Wolseley branch marketing Toolkit 
site which immediately exceeded our usage expectations and continues 
to expand across a number of other individual brands which use the site. 
prospects
The positive momentum has continued into the current financial year 
and each area of our business has started the year ahead of budget.
As it is the executives and all our employees who deliver the revenues 
and profits that drive shareholder value, I feel able to congratulate 
and thank them for a year of excellent achievements and for a lot 
more hard work below the surface working on potential opportunities. 
Finally, following his appointment in March 2007, I would also like to 
welcome Paul Murray to the board. Paul brings significant corporate 
experience coupled with a great understanding of the marketing 
services and technology sectors.

Menu Builder
The Menu Builder project enables 
Greene King pubs to build bespoke menus 
from a database of menu choices populated 
by CyberChef. 
The data includes the menu title, description, 
cost price, suggested retail price and the 
corresponding gross profit margin. Constructed 
within the tool is an online recipe card 
illustrating how products should be cooked 
and what equipment is needed. During 
the process of building a menu the tool 
automatically generates hints which offer 
the publican choices which complement 
their proposed menu.
Menu Builder also provides a detailed online 
analysis of the selected menu covering gross 
profit, which aids the publican when forecasting 
profits from food sales.

The fastest growing team within Tangent 
is our programming resource, now with 
over 20 full time people
Toolkit saw a 65% increase in order 
volume during the year
In the year ended 28 February 2007, Tangent increased its 
performance in each of its internal key performance indicators. 
Turnover increased by 30% to £8.61m, adjusted operating margin 
increased by 2.9% points to 12.4%, adjusted operating profits 
increased by 71% to £1.07m and cash flow from operations for the 
year increased from  £0.54m to £1.18m. 
technology
Marketing departments are increasingly looking to technology to 
improve the effectiveness of their campaigns. However they often 
do not have the tools to extract information from their databases. 
This is where Tangent’s services come in to play. 
Technology sits at the heart of our business strategy and last year we 
took a significant step in increasing our capabilities through the acquisition 
of C360 UK (now Tangent Labs) with its proprietary engine TaoBase. 
Furthermore we continued our investment into Toolkit, our proprietary 
web tool. Today, through TaoBase and Toolkit we can offer our clients 
a range of technology-driven services which include:
• database management, construction and integration;
• website design and build;
• build of local marketing applications;
• targeted email marketing with optimising tracking capabilities;
• SMS and MMS marketing services; and
• display, point of sale and direct mail communications.
The group currently employs over 20 full time programmers 
focused on client requirements and increasing the scope of 
Tangent’s digital services.

market development
Orders generated via Toolkit, Tangent’s proprietary online ordering 
system increased by 65% year on year and by 225% over a three year 
period. This is in part due to the increased functionality but primarily 
due to the increase in customer numbers and willingness to change the 
way in which marketing collateral is created and used. The retail market 
is the primary target sector for Tangent’s online marketing tool. 
Online marketing continues to grow at significant rates. Tangent is 
now firmly established as a company capable of building complex 
and innovative web solutions which culminated in April 2007 with 
Tangent being selected via a competitive pitch to build the new 
website for the Labour Party. Tangent won against competition 
with larger, more developed agencies within larger network groups. 
Tangent believes that its success derives from being a younger, more 
innovative business, well positioned to participate in technological 
developments in the market, including the introduction of Web 2.0. 
The directors believe that this firmly sets the foundation for Tangent 
to grow this side of our business.
Market researchers predict that marketing applications are one of 
the fastest growing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 
areas in the IT sector and T angent expects to benefit from the continued 
migration of marketing budgets from offline to online.
financial control
Margins have now improved each year since Tangent was formed 
in July 2005. Despite parts of the business operating in what is sometimes 
perceived as a competitive market place, Tangent’s value-add and focus 
on technology services have allowed the group to increase its margin 
year on year. 
Cash conversion also remains at the heart of our business practice and 
this year operating cash more than doubled. The group’s strong cash 
position allows it to retain a strong negotiating stance with suppliers, 
clients and acquisition targets and cash generation will continue to 
remain a core focus going forward. 
chief executives’ review New Look
In January 2007 Tangent launched a 
Toolkit site for New Look which provides 
over 700 stores with an online environment 
for recruitment.
Emma Conway, New Look Recruitment 
Manager, explains “Toolkit is a fantastic 
resource that allows us to be more consistent 
and up-to-date with our advertising and 
recruitment materials. It is easy to use, 
allowing us to send materials to stores 
at the click of a button – essential when 
working in the fast paced environment 
of New Look.”

Ravensworth
The acquisition of Ravensworth was completed in March 2007 and 
brings a significant number of different opportunities to the group. 
As a stand alone business Ravensworth’s sales grew by 15% last year 
on a net margin of 16%. Over 365 new clients were won in the last 
six months of 2006. 
Ravensworth is the leading supplier of full colour marketing literature 
to the UK property sector. The company operates from a purpose 
built 23,000 sq. ft. digital production facility housing the latest 
in digital printing equipment. From a client list of over 2,500 estate 
agency branches, Ravensworth receives over 2,000 orders per day 
producing over 7m full colour A4 pages a month.
Ravensworth’s experience and unique understanding of its core 
market have led to the continued growth in all areas of business 
with customer numbers increasing by 24% in the last twelve 
months. It now accounts for approximately 20% of the UK market 
and is more than three times the size of its closest competitor. 
Having established a market leading position, we are confident 
in its ability to continue expanding its core market together with 
offering further value added services to its current customer base.
Tangent’s expertise in direct mail represents a great opportunity 
when applied to the Ravensworth client base. Within Tangent’s 
existing business we have witnessed a great take-up from property 
clients looking to increase new customers via targeted direct mail. 
This new approach will be sold by the Ravensworth team to its client 
base which has not previously used Ravensworth for this service. 
It is also our intention to launch a web portal which will enable every 
estate agent in the UK to create, personalise, proof and order online, 
a targeted direct mail campaign.
It is probable that new government legislation will mean that a 
Home Information Pack (HIP) will have to be created and produced by 
the vendor with each property sold via the estate agent. Ravensworth 
took part in the trials for the creation of HIPs. If the legislation is enacted, 
we expect Ravensworth to benefit, having signed indicative agreements 
with most of the HIP providers in the UK. The directors have not 
included any contribution from this opportunity into the management 
budget, however if legislation is enacted we believe the opportunity 
will be significant.

Ravensworth has over 2,500 individual branches using its 
software to generate digital orders on a daily basis.

outlook
The new financial year, beginning March 2007, has begun with all group 
areas ahead of budget. The integration of Ravensworth and transfer 
of work from London to Newcastle are currently ahead of schedule 
and the company is on track to realise annual savings of in excess 
of £100,000. This leaves the company in a strong position to begin 
examining phase two of the work transfer process. Ravensworth 
experienced its strongest ever months in March and April 2007 
with new client revenue from the wins in 2006 coming through. 
In the coming year we will integrate TaoBase with Toolkit, creating a 
unified technology platform within Tangent, which will provide clients 
with increased functionality within a central operating environment. 
Finally we would like to thank the team for working so hard to 
help us achieve our objectives. It is their passion, creativity and ability 
to deliver client exceeding results that continues to fuel Tangent’s 
growth. We look forward to building on Tangent’s strong 
performance in the year ahead.

chief executives’ review continued Labour Party
Tangent provides the Labour Party with 
a wide range of services, all powered by 
TaoBase and Toolkit. The services range 
from Labour’s national website to a system 
for reporting loans and donations from 
around 700 accounting units to Head Office. 
We provide a secure intranet system which 
allows Labour members to converse in a 
closed environment, or publish their own 
blogs and websites to the general public. 
This system integrates with Labour’s 
membership database, to allow members 
to manage their personal details online, 
and to allow the party to deliver tailored 
communications to each member.
Tangent created personalised, digitally 
printed postcards which were sent to 
voters ‘from’ their local candidates, inviting 
the voters to give their views on local issues. 
The candidates each had a login to TaoBase, 
where they could directly follow up with the 
voters. TaoBase automatically selected those 
voters who had not responded and sent 
them follow up materials.This enabled the 
Labour Party, at a national level, to provide 
local campaigners with a customisable 
campaign, which could be driven both 
locally and centrally at a much lower cost 
than traditional campaigns.

technology review
Tangent Labs
Marketing departments continue to face the problem of data being 
in many places, disconnected and unusable. Typically, IT departments 
are stretched with the needs of the finance and operations departments, 
as well as fighting off viruses and making sure everyone’s PC works. 
Tangent Labs’ mission is to provide smart technology to solve these 
problems. More specifically, to deliver quickly and at lower cost. The 
solutions we provide are most valuable to clients when they solve 
‘impossible’ problems – when the IT department, or another supplier, 
has told the client that something cannot be done, or will take many 
months and large sums of money.
Tangent Labs has been developing TaoBase since 2003. It provides 
a highly flexible database system which:
•  connects with other databases easily;
•  connects databases to websites;
•  handles inbound and outbound email;
•  provides inbound and outbound SMS;
•  generates personalised digital direct mail through Tangent’s Toolkit;
•  generates complex websites, including blogging, e-commerce, 
dynamic content and search optimisation;
•  delivers podcasts, news feeds and email bulletins;
•  integrates with Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Word and Adobe;
•  provides realtime reporting and analytics; and
•  is highly customisable with bespoke modules (eg. web spiders, 
microformats, communications planning, etc).
All this allows Tangent Labs to provide technology meeting the widest 
range of needs of a marketing or communications department; quicker 
than other providers and usually at lower cost. This enables us to focus 
effort on actually achieving the client objectives to help deliver 
breakthrough results.

local level marketing and T oolkit – a perfect partnership
Developed in-house and wholly owned by Tangent is our local level 
marketing platform, Toolkit. Last year we witnessed a 65% increase in 
order volume against the prior year. Tangent employs over 20 developers 
and designers who are responsible for the innovations within Toolkit. 
We have a dedicated customer service team that supports the 
thousands of users of our system. 
Tangent identified an opportunity to use the internet to create a 
tool which would empower marketeers to create, proof and order 
marketing collateral which was tailored to a local audience. Today 
Toolkit has expanded its role within marketing departments and 
outlined below are just a selection of the key services it provides 
to its users:
•  a complete solution to provide all marketing products for point 
of sale, direct mail, local press advertising;
•  fully integrated database services to profile, select and filter data 
selections which improve the quality and accuracy of customer 
communications from multiple locations;
•  merchandise pages for retail channel partners to communicate 
offers direct through to store level. This allows the Tangent 
customer to use Toolkit as a market place for suppliers to push 
products directly to the retail outlet. Retail partners fund these 
propositions and have direct information on the display and 
distribution of items sold by the retail partner;
•  platform integration to supply partners for real time pricing 
of offers with the added benefit of margin and profit analysis 
via suggested retail prices;
•  a complete reporting and tracking interface allowing senior 
members of marketing departments to monitor and optimise 
branch marketing spend against sales performance; and
•  additional site functionality for search, blogging and internal 
communication point for best practice management between 
branch managers.
Toolkit has become the de facto intranet for some retailers, allowing 
branch communication and branch marketing within one website,
Customers of Toolkit include Greene King, Peugeot, Citroën, 
Procter and Gamble and Wolseley.

The Tangent Labs business acquired in July 2006 was 
integrated quickly and its profits have grown substantially 
since acquisition.
overview
Tangent achieved growth in turnover, profits, earnings per share and 
cash balances for the year ended 28 February 2007. The Tangent Labs 
business acquired in July 2006 was integrated quickly and its profits 
have grown substantially since acquisition. 
trading performance
We run the Tangent business with a focus on turnover, adjusted 
operating profit, adjusted earnings per share and operating cash 
generation. Adjustments to operating profits and earnings per share 
are to exclude amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items. We 
believe that our focus on these key performance indicators (KPIs) 
will deliver value for shareholders in the medium and long term.
Tangent performed well against each KPI:
• turnover grew by 30% to £8.61m (2006: £6.61m);
•  adjusted operating profit improved by 71% to £1.07m 
(2006: £0.63m) to give an adjusted operating profit margin 
of 12.4% (2006: 9.5%);
•  adjusted basic earnings per share increased by 16% to 0.95p 
(2006: 0.82p); and
•  operating cash generation more than doubled to £1.18m (2006: £0.54m) 
representing 110% (2005: 85%) of adjusted operating profit.
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
Goodwill amortisation increased by £0.2m to £0.39m. The increase 
arose equally from the acquisition of Tangent Labs during the year 
and a full year of amortisation for the prior year acquisition.
The operating exceptional item is a £0.39m charge for the fair value 
of share options in accordance with FRS 20. There is no underlying 
cash flow or financial liability associated with the charge and it 
does not reduce shareholders’ funds.
The costs associated with Tangent’s proposal during the year to make 
an offer for St Ives have been included within normal administrative 
expenses because the directors do not consider them to be sufficiently 
material to be classified as exceptional. The proposal was withdrawn in 
November 2006.
taxation
The taxation charge of £0.09m (2006: £0.02m) represents 28.2% of 
profit before tax. After adding back amortisation of goodwill and 
the share option charge (both are excluded from taxable profits), the 
taxation rate is 8% (2006: 3.6%). The taxation charge is low because 
the group has the benefit of past tax losses. The increased tax rate 
over the prior year is because profits from the businesses acquired 
during the last two years do not benefit from these tax losses, 
so profits from these businesses are taxed without the same relief. 
At the year end the group had £1.16m of tax losses available 
to offset against future profits.
acquisitions
In July 2006 Tangent acquired a marketing technology business 
C360 UK (now named Tangent Labs) for an initial cost of £2.64m 
including expenses. The initial cost was funded by issuing 16.67m 
new shares to the vendors and £0.64m from internally generated 
cash. A further maximum amount of £2m could be due depending on 
profit performance and continuing employment of the vendors over 
the three years following the acquisition. The directors have estimated 
that £1m of this will become due and have accrued this further amount.
In the period since acquisition Tangent Labs contributed £0.26m 
to adjusted operating profit, which is a 27.8% margin on sales of 
£0.93m. The run rates for sales and operating profit are just over 
three times the levels reported in the last audited accounts prior 
to acquisition.

cash flow and net funds
Operating cash generation was strong and after insignificant interest 
and taxation cash flows, there was a net inflow of £1.16m which was 
applied to £0.44m of net capital expenditure and £0.48 of net payments 
in respect of the acquisition. Net funds improved by £0.25m to £1.05m 
(2006: £0.8m).
balance sheet
The year end net assets were £9.84m compared with £6.73m for the 
prior year. The main change arises from the £3.05m net increase in 
goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Tangent Labs.
accounting standards
For the year under review Tangent adopted FRS 20 which deals with 
share-based payments. The fair value of share options granted is spread 
over the period from grant until the date it is anticipated the options 
will become exercisable. The prior year comparative figures have been 
restated in accordance with the new standard. The effect of FRS 20 
was to increase administrative expenses for the prior year by £29,000. 
The group’s net assets and cash flow statement were unaffected. 
For the year ending 28 February 2008 Tangent will adopt 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in accordance with 
the AIM guidelines. The most significant change will be that goodwill 
will not be amortised under IFRS.
treasury, funding and exchange risk
The group finances its operations through shareholders’ funds, 
finance lease borrowings and working capital management. The 
funding structure comprises variable rate borrowings and cash 
balances to maintain a high level of financial flexibility for potential 
acquisitions and investments. Regular reports on cash balances and 
borrowings are provided to the board. 
The majority of trade is conducted in sterling. The directors monitor 
exposure to ensure that foreign currency risk is not material to the group.
subsequent events
On 6 March 2007 Tangent agreed a £1m overdraft facility at a rate 
of 1.25% over base rate secured by cross guarantees and debentures. 
The overdraft remains undrawn but improves the financial flexibility 
of the group.
On 27 March 2007 Tangent acquired a digital marketing business 
Ravensworth Digital Services for consideration of £5.85m plus costs. 
Completion accounts have not been finalised, although we expect 
that the net assets acquired exceed £0.6m and net debt on acquisition 
was below £0.1m, which is significantly lower than the £0.85m limit 
under the purchase agreement. 
To fund the acquisition T angent issued 50m new shares, mostly placed 
with institutional fund managers that invested in Tangent for the first 
time. We consider that the overall broadening of the shareholder 
base, which has resulted in a 60% free float of T angent shares, is 
beneficial for all shareholders.

The directors present their report and audited financial statements of the group for the year ended 28 February 2007.
principal activity and review of the business
The principal activity of the group is the provision of customised marketing services. A review of the business and its future development can 
be found in the chief executives’ review and the financial review.
results and dividends
The consolidated profit for the year amounted to £219,000. The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend. The company 
is currently unable to pay a dividend due to the deficit in its distributable reserves. In the medium to long term the board intends to pursue 
a progressive dividend policy. Further information on the group’s results and financial position is included in the financial review.
company listing
The company continues to be listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange. The market code for the company is TNG.
acquisitions
On 11 July 2006 the company acquired 100% of the share capital of C360 UK Limited (now named Tangent Labs Limited). Maximum total 
consideration is £4.5m, payable in cash and shares. The initial consideration paid was £2m in shares and £0.5m in cash. Further consideration 
to a maximum of £2m is payable dependent upon meeting profits targets and continued employment over three years. The directors estimate 
that £1m of the further consideration will be payable.
changes in share capital
On 11 July 2006, 16,666,667 ordinary shares of 1p each were allotted at 12p per share as part of the consideration for the acquisition 
of Tangent Labs Limited.
subsequent events
On 6 March 2007 Tangent agreed a £1m overdraft facility at a rate of 1.25% over base rate secured by cross guarantees and debentures. 
On 27 March 2007 the company completed the acquisition of Ravensworth Digital Services Limited for a maximum consideration before 
costs of £5.85m, payable as £5.41m in cash and £0.44m in shares. The acquisition was funded by the issue of 50,011,828 shares of which 
46,615,385 shares were placed at 13p per share.
At the date of this report the number of issued ordinary shares is 161,791,835.
employees
The group recognises the benefit of keeping its employees informed of all relevant matters on a regular basis. The group is an equal 
opportunities employer and all applications for employment are considered fully on the basis of the suitability for the job.
supplier payment policy 
It is the group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between the group and its 
suppliers, provided that all trading terms and conditions have been complied with. At 28 February 2007, the group had an average of 72 days’ 
(2006: 87 days) purchases outstanding in trade creditors.
use of financial instruments
Tangent’s financial risk management objectives are to minimise debt, to fund acquisitions through a mixture of equity financing and cash 
and to ensure sufficient working capital for the group’s overhead and capital expenditure commitments. This is achieved by prudent financial 
management and careful management of the group’s cash balances, both short and long term. The financial risk management objectives and 
policies of the group set out in note 20 of the financial statements include the group’s exposure to currency, credit, liquidity and credit risk.
key risks and uncertainties
Outlined below are the key risks to Tangent’s business:
Home Information Pack (HIP)
The government is currently planning to introduce Home Information Packs but the legislation has not yet been finalised. There are risks 
around this product which may influence the performance of Ravensworth short term. If the legislation is passed unamended then in the short 
term, the number of residential properties that are newly listed on the market may be reduced whilst HIPs are introduced. This may, during this 
period, affect the contribution to the group from Ravensworth. However, in this circumstance we expect most of the revenue to be delayed 
rather than lost. The revenue from HIPs long term is expected outweigh any potential shortfall because the group has agreements in place 
with the major HIP providers. 
technology
Technology continues to play an increasing role in Tangent’s positioning and client offering. We continue to invest in the programming and 
development teams but as the business continues to grow and more high profile account work is won, there is a risk that larger companies 
will become more aware of the innovations that Tangent delivers and apply greater resources to Tangent’s market.
paper market
The paper market is concentrated into a few major players and prices have increased in the last twelve months. More price increases may occur 
and, if it cannot be passed on to clients, this will affect margins. To date most price increases have been passed on to clients. 
donations
During the year the group made charitable donations of £1,000 (2006: £1,000) and no political donations.

statement of compliance
Although AIM listed companies are not required to report on the Combined Code, the directors are committed to proper standards of 
corporate governance and will continue to keep procedures under review. 
board and board committees
During the year the board of directors comprised one non-executive director and three executive directors. A second non-executive director 
was appointed after the year end. The full board manages overall control of the group’s affairs by the schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision. These include the approval of financial statements, acquisitions and disposals, authority levels for expenditure, and review of monthly 
and other management reports. The chairman will continue to review the skills and balance of the board as the group grows.
The directors are able to take independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties at the company’s expense and all directors 
have access to the advice and services of the company secretary.
The board considers its non-executive directors to be independent. An independent director is one who has no relationship with the company 
or its management which may undermine independence and who is not dependent on the company or its management for his primary source of 
income, was not within the last three years a senior manager of the company and does not participate in the company’s incentive bonus scheme 
or pension schemes.
The board delegates day-to-day and business management control to the executive directors who are in regular contact with each other. 
Formal decisions are communicated throughout the group. The executive directors are responsible for implementing group policy, 
the monitoring and performance of the business, and reporting to the full board thereon.
The company has an audit committee, whose terms of reference cover the points recommended by the Code. Its duties include monitoring 
internal financial control throughout the group, approving the group’s accounting policies and reviewing the interim and annual financial 
statements before submission to the board. During the year the committee was chaired by Piers Caldecote and the other members were 
Timothy Green and Graeme Harris. On 26 March 2007 the audit committee was reconstituted to include non-executive directors only. 
Paul Murray joined the audit committee as its chairman and Piers Caldecote is the other member.
The company has a remuneration committee, which, during the year, was chaired by Piers Caldecote and the other members were Nicholas Green 
and Graeme Harris. On 26 March 2007 the remuneration committee was reconstituted to include non-executive directors only. Paul Murray 
joined the remuneration committee as its chairman and Piers Caldecote is the other member.
All executive directors have rolling service contracts with the company terminable on twelve months’ notice from the company and by 
six months notice by the director. Non-executive directors agree a letter of appointment terminable on six months’ notice by each party. 
Following their first appointment to the board, the terms of the Articles of Association require all directors to retire and stand for re-election 
at the earliest opportunity. Under the articles of association all directors are required to retire once every three years. 
The nominations committee comprises all directors and is chaired by Piers Caldecote.
relationship with shareholders
The directors consider the clear and timely communication of information to shareholders as an important part of their duties. The chief 
executives’ review and financial review provide a summary of the group’s trading performance and future outlook. The group’s website  
(www.tangentuk.com) also gives shareholders access to additional information. Furthermore, twice a year, the group’s financial results are 
published, in conjunction with briefings for investment managers and institutional analysts following the company’s interim and preliminary 
full year announcements, and at other ad hoc visits.
The board views the annual general meeting as an opportunity to communicate with both institutional and private investors alike and aims 
to comply with all the provisions of the Code relating to the constructive uses of annual general meetings. The directors plan to be present 
and available to answer questions at this year’s annual general meeting.

accountability and financial control
The board has overall responsibility for the systems of financial control. Implementation and maintenance of the financial control systems is 
the responsibility of executive management. The board, through the audit committee, has reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of internal 
financial control for the accounting year, and the period to the date of approval of the financial statements. It should be understood, however, 
that such systems are designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The company has an established framework of internal financial controls, the key features of which are as follows:
control environment
There are clearly defined organisational responsibilities and the board is committed to employing suitably qualified staff so that the 
appropriate level of authority can be delegated with regard to accountability and acceptable levels of risk.
information systems
The group operates a number of separate systems of financial and operational reporting to the board and senior management, based upon 
an annual budget and regular forecasts. Monthly, weekly and other periodic reports of actual results (financial and non-financial) together 
with key performance indicators are produced and discussed by the directors.
identification and evaluation of business risks and controls
Management control is exercised at all levels of the group and is regulated by appropriate limits of authority. The directors have considered 
various areas of business risks and have developed appropriate policies to manage and diffuse those risks. These policies are reviewed in the 
light of known and perceived changes to the risks.
quality and integrity of personnel
The group attaches high importance to the values of trust, honesty and integrity of personnel in responsible positions and operates a policy 
of recruitment and promoting suitably experienced personnel with clearly defined accountabilities. 
investment appraisal
All major capital expenditure is included in the annual budget and is reported on to the board. In addition, all potential and actual acquisition 
opportunities are regularly reviewed by the board, both in meetings and by ad hoc reports.
monitoring
Given the size of the group and the close day-to-day involvement of the executive directors in all of the group’s locations, no formal internal 
audit is considered necessary.

introduction
The policy of the group is to offer competitive remuneration packages that will attract, retain and motivate experienced and talented 
individuals who will enhance the value of the group. The remuneration packages of the executive directors are reviewed and approved by the 
remuneration committee on an annual basis. The remuneration policies aim to incentivise and reward both short term financial performance 
and also shareholder value creation. The remuneration of other employees is the responsibility of the joint chief executives.
remuneration of the directors
Executive directors are paid a basic salary and receive benefits in kind. The remuneration of non-executive directors requires approval by the 
board. Individual directors are not permitted to participate in decisions concerning their own remuneration.
The structure of executive director remuneration was reviewed during the year and, for the year that commenced on 1 March 2007, 
the remuneration elements are as follows:
•  a base salary and benefits in kind are set at a competitive level and reflect the remuneration packages paid by companies of a similar size 
and in similar sectors;
•  an annual cash bonus of up to 50% of basic salary is payable depending upon achievement of challenging financial performance targets 
set at the beginning of each financial year. The purpose is to incentivise on the short term financial performance of the group; and
•  a long term incentive plan (LTIP) under which shares with value up to 50% of basic salary per year are transferred to directors over a three 
year period depending upon the achievement of challenging goals based on total shareholder return (TSR) over the period. The purpose 
is to incentivise delivery of long term value and to align interests with shareholders.
The 2007 LTIP award has not been made as at the date of this report because of regulatory restrictions. The remuneration committee is 
currently determining the best method of implementing the LTIP with effect from 1 March 2007 or determining an alternative scheme that 
most closely meets the objectives of the proposed LTIP .
For the year under review, no share options were granted to directors and a discretionary bonus was awarded to each executive director 
as reward for the increased value delivered to shareholders.
Audited remuneration of directors was as follows:
    Benefits 2007 2006

share options
The company operates three share option schemes by which employees, including executive directors, are able to acquire shares, comprising 
an Inland Revenue approved scheme, an unapproved scheme, and an enterprise management incentive (EMI) scheme.
At 28 February 2007, 5,000 (2006: 5,000) options had been granted to employees under the approved scheme, 9,057,066 (2006: 9,057,066)

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the company and of the group and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the group and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
 
So far as the directors are aware, at the time of approval of their directors’ report:
• there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and
•  each director has taken steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the auditors are aware of that information.

_1_tan_ar07_back.indd   8 20/06/2007   10:13:20 21 tangent communications plc annual report 2007
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements of Tangent Communications plc for the year ended 28 February 2007 which 
comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, consolidated statement of recognised gains and losses, the consolidated and company 
balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, and related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and 
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice) are set out in the statement 
of directors’ responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion, the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the 
financial statements. In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and transactions with the company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. 
This other information comprises the chairman’s statement, chief executives’ review, financial review, corporate governance statement 
and the remuneration report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
financial statements.
opinion
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice, of the state 
of the group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 28 February 2007 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
• the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.

1 accounting policies
basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
in the United Kingdom. The principal accounting policies which the directors have adopted are set out below.
basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and all its subsidiary undertakings from the date 
of their acquisition using acquisition accounting principles. 
No company profit and loss account is presented as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
goodwill
Goodwill is the difference between the amount paid on the acquisition of a business and the aggregate fair value of its separable net assets.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible fixed asset in the year in which it arises and amortised in equal instalments over its estimated useful 
economic life, up to a maximum of 20 years. The directors regard 20 years as a reasonable maximum for the estimated useful life of goodwill. 
If a subsidiary undertaking is subsequently sold, any goodwill arising on acquisition that has not been amortised through the profit and loss 
account is taken into account in determining the profit and loss on sale.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated 
to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its expected useful life at the following rates:
Leasehold land and buildings: Over the term of the lease
Plant and machinery:  three to ten years straight line
Fixtures and fittings:  two to ten years straight line
Computer equipment:  three years straight line
investment in own shares and share-based payments
Investment in own shares held by the employee share ownership trust is deducted from reserves in accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force 38 
(UITF 38).
From 1 March 2006 the group adopted FRS 20 which deals with share-based payments made for services or goods rendered. The fair value of 
share options granted is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expense is spread over the period from the date of grant 
to the date that options vest and are exercisable, based on the company’s best estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The prior year comparative figures have been restated in accordance with the new standard. The effect of FRS 20 was to increase 
administrative expenses for the year ended 28 February 2006 by £29,000. The group’s net assets and cash flow statement were unaffected. 
fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiary companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowances for any obsolete or slow 
moving items. In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion 
of fixed and variable overheads.
foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the 
transaction. All exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account, as incurred.
pensions
The group makes contributions to the personal pension plans of certain employees. Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account 
as they become payable.
operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
finance leases
Assets obtained under finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and depreciated over their useful lives. Obligations under such 
agreements are included in creditors net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. The finance element of the rental payment is 
charged to the profit and loss account so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligation outstanding in each period.
deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full in respect of taxation deferred by timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes. The deferred tax balance is not discounted.
financial instruments
FRS 13 requires information to be disclosed about the impact of financial instruments on the group’s risk profile, how the risks arising from 
financial instruments might affect the entity’s performance, and how these risks are being managed.
The group’s policies include that no trading in derivative financial instruments shall be undertaken for speculative purposes. 
These disclosures have been made in note 20 to the accounts.

For the share options outstanding at 28 February 2007 exercise prices ranged between 1p and 11.75p per share and the weighted average 
remaining contractual life was 8.5 years.
For the options exercised in the year the weighted average share price at exercise was 11p.
The fair value of share options granted in the year was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The exercise price and share price 
of options granted in the year were 11.75p. The volatility, measured as the standard deviation of expected share price return, is based on 
statistical analysis of the FTSE Support Services Index over the past four years which resulted in an assumed volatility of 14%. The risk free interest 
rate has been assumed as 4.55%.
The total share option charge for the year was £388,000 (2006 restated: £161,000) in accordance with the requirements of FRS 20 
on share-based payments. The charge relates principally to the share options granted to directors in September 2005, as disclosed in the 
remuneration report on page 19.

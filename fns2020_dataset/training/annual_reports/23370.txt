Chairman’s Statement
Underlying  
sales growth of
17%
“We have had a solid year with a continued increase in our order 
book and a strong increase in recurring revenues. We have 
invested in our product and it remains the market leader. This lays 
solid foundations for the future and we will continue to work to 
develop our sales and marketing capability to deliver on the clear 
and substantial market opportunity.”
Overview
FY2016 was a year in which eg continued 
to strengthen its market position and 
establish a platform for sustained 
profitable growth. The Group’s Order Book 
continued to grow with the majority of new 
orders based on hosted solutions over 
three years or more. 
Towards the end of the period a number 
of sales did not close as expected, 
resulting in lower than expected revenues. 
Our emphasis continues to be the 
improvement and development of our 
sales and marketing capability in the 
current year. As previously disclosed, 
FY2015 benefited from one-off sales 
totalling approximately £1.1m. Excluding 
these contracts, underlying sales growth 
was approximately 17% over the last 12 
months. Our focus on cost control during 
the year is reflected in a small profit before 
tax for the year compared to the small 
loss originally expected at the start of the 
financial year.
Demand for back office workforce 
optimisation solutions continues to grow 
in line with the global trend of businesses 
looking to improve customer service, 
operational efficiency, cost control and 
risk management. The Group’s products 
deliver guaranteed benefits for its 
customers in each of these key areas 
and we have an enviable track record of 
successful implementations and customer 
retention. This market demand, together 
with our ability to develop and deliver 
products which meet our customers’ 
needs, provides a firm foundation for  
the Group. 
The investments we have made this year 
have further strengthened our market 
position. We invested significantly in the 
Group’s product set, culminating in the 
launch in September 2015 of eg mobile
™
 
and eg forecasting
™
. Both new products 
were well received and have opened up 
a number of new sales opportunities with 
new and existing clients. 
Aspect Software Inc 
(“Aspect”)
In August 2015, Bob Krakauer was 
appointed Non-Executive Director, 
replacing Spence Mallder on the Board as 
a representative of Aspect.
On 9 March 2016, Aspect submitted a 
petition for bankruptcy protection in the 
U.S. Bankruptcy court for the District of 
Delaware in Wilmington (along with four 
related entities). Our current assessment 
is that there will be no impact on earnings 
for the Group.
As set out in our announcement on 
10 March 2016, we will continue to 
monitor developments and make further 
announcements as appropriate.
Capital Reduction & Articles
Taking into account feedback from 
investors and our prospects for future 
profitability, the Board will be seeking 
approval for a proposed reduction in 
capital at the AGM on 17 May 2016. 
We will also be seeking approval for an 
update to our Articles of Association in 
line with the Companies Act 2006.
Current Trading & Outlook
FY2016 has been a year where we have 
made solid progress with growing our 
order book and significantly enhancing 
our product suite, laying the foundations 
for sustainable, long-term profit growth. 
The progress we have made in increasing 
recurring revenues continues in line with 
our objective of significantly improving the 
visibility and quality of earnings.

Chief Executive’s Statement
“We are well placed to support both the digital and omni-channel 
requirements of our customers, enabling them to deliver consistent 
service and optimise performance across all channels.”
Overview
The successful placing in January 2015 
raised £3.2m to continue the investment 
required to earn our place as the global 
leader in the market we pioneered. The 
focus of the remainder of FY2016 was 
then to build on the successes of the 
prior year and increase investment in the 
fundamentals of the business to prepare 
for growth. 
Our growth strategy is based on three 
core objectives:
•	 Increasing recurring revenues to 
provide improved visibility and quality of 
earnings;
•	 Winning new customers in existing and 
new territories and across a range of 
business sectors; and
•	 Retaining our blue chip customer 
base by sustaining the tangible results 
achieved from using our software and 
Operational Management practices.
Our improved balance sheet has enabled 
us to invest for the long-term in additional 
sales resources and marketing activities to 
win new clients both in the UK and in key  
new territories. 
Our order book  
of multi-year contracts 
now stands at
£17.4m
to be recognised over 
next four years
We have also invested in developing  
our Managed Cloud Service proposition, 
including achieving ISO27001 accreditation 
to ensure we meet the information security 
requirements of our customers.
As a result, in-year revenue remained 
similar to the prior year, while recurring 
revenues increased 35% year-on-year. 
Our order book of multi-year contracts 
now stands at £17.4m, up a further 
£0.3m since our trading update in January 
2016. This revenue will be recognised 
over the next four years providing a firm 
foundation for sustained future revenue 
growth. We will continue to focus on sales 
of multi-year contracts.
Customer Base Growth
Multiple contract wins were secured with 
new and existing customers in the UK 
and in new territories. We increased our 
footprint in existing market verticals such 
as financial services and successfully 
developed business in new territories 
through partners and direct sales. Major 
new contracts during the period include:
•	 A licence extension at a major 
European bank to include Collections & 
Fraud teams;
•	 A licence extension at a global bank to 
incorporate commercial & investment 
banking;
•	 Further roll-outs for a major UK third 
party outsourcing company;
•	 Further deployments with an 
international Telecoms provider and 
a new customer win in mortgage 
lending in the USA through the Aspect 
partnership;
•	 Two new banking sector pilots in 
Europe and Australia with significant 
roll-out potential;
•	 Major upgrade for a UK banking 
customer;
•	 Contract win with the insurance division 
of a challenger bank; and
•	 Conversion of perpetual licences for an 
existing client to our Managed Cloud 
Services. 24661   8 April 2016 4:21 PM    Proof One

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
In addition, having secured our first 
contract in Local Government in January 
2015, over the remainder of the year we 
successfully completed deployments 
within 18 local government authorities 
around the UK. 
In December 2015, a strategic review of 
our customer value proposition by third 
party advisors concluded that customer 
satisfaction remains high, with our 
solutions described as “well packaged 
and well executed by great people”. 
Our strategy of providing excellent 
delivery based on guaranteed returns, 
together with significant and sustainable 
operational improvements, continues to 
resonate with our customers.
Market Development
The emerging back office optimisation 
market continues to develop. Businesses 
are seeking to improve the end customer 
experience across multiple channels, 
to optimise their use of resources 
across these channels and to maintain 
compliance with increasingly stringent 
regulatory and security requirements. 
With the increase in digital business, 
customer transactions are shifting from 
the traditional and physical to data-centric 
methods, giving rise to an increase in 
transactions across all channels. At 
the same time, customers now expect 
near or real-time responses, regardless 
of how they transact, and a key driver 
for businesses is to significantly reduce 
complex back office processing time and 
achieve real-time insight into the whole 
customer eco-system. 
Investment in the back office has 
traditionally been a low priority but it 
can no longer be ignored. It is a major 
contributor to the success of the 
customer experience and, according to 
Frost & Sullivan’s recent report, can often 
be the engine that drives organisational 
performance from behind the scenes.
Core functionality within the eg 
operational intelligence
®
 software suite, 
our flagship product, was designed to 
address these requirements:
•	 Multi-channel transaction capture 
to provide a single view of all work 
regardless of channel;
•	 Real-time, multi-level, multi-dimensional 
operational intelligence for customer 
operations and customer experience 
management;
•	 Efficient allocation of work to an 
increasingly disparate, mobile workforce 
wherever it is in the world, together with 
the means to automatically evaluate 
their performance.
As a result, we are well placed to support 
both the digital and omni-channel 
requirements of our customers, enabling 
them to deliver consistent service and 
optimise performance across all channels 
regardless of where their workforce is 
and, at the same time, providing true 
insight into the end-to-end customer 
journey. 
Product Development
Following the placing in January 2015, 
the Group has invested significantly 
in accelerating product development. 
Investment in R&D is up 65% on FY2015. 
We have continued to invest in our 
market-leading software to ensure we can 
continue to meet customer requirements 
“out of the box”. This has always been 
a unique selling point for our product, 
enabling our customers to quickly realise 
benefits and achieve guaranteed return on 
investment. 
As a result of this investment, two 
new products, eg forecasting
™
 
and eg mobile
™
, were launched in 
September 2015. The development of 
eg forecasting
™
 was part funded by 
Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation agency, 
through its Smart Scheme. Innovate UK 
offers funding to small and medium-sized 
enterprises to engage in R&D projects 
in the strategically important areas of 
science, engineering and technology. 
The new eg mobile
™
 product is an 
extension of the eg operational 
intelligence
®
 software suite and was 
launched at The Shard in London on 
23 September 2015. It is designed to 
enable work to be allocated to, and 
the performance monitored of, mobile 
and remote workers. It also provides 
alerts and notifications for operational 
managers on the move on KPIs that affect 
performance, such as approaching SLA 
deadlines and breaches. 
These new developments further 
enhance our product suite with advanced 
forecasting and capacity planning 
capability, as well as extending the 
reach of our software to planning teams, 
mobile workers and remote operational 
managers. 
Our software now ensures work can 
be allocated and performance can be 
optimised regardless of business channel 
and wherever work takes place in the 
world.
People
Employee engagement is also a high 
priority for our business and morale 
continues to be high. During FY2016 we 
were delighted to achieve an Outstanding 
Employer accreditation by workplace 
engagement specialists Best Companies, 
recognising our commitment to employee 
satisfaction and engagement.
The whole eg team worked extremely 
hard during the year to deliver excellent 
results for our customers throughout the 
world. I would like to thank them for their 
contribution and continuing commitment.

Chief Financial Officer’s Statement 
“By maintaining our focus on cost control, the Group achieved  
a profit before tax of £0.01m (2015: £0.41m) compared  
to the loss originally expected”
£3.2m
Net cash as at  
31 January 2016
Financial Results
Revenue for the year ended  
31 January 2016 was £7.60m (2015: 
£7.54m). Software licences, maintenance 
and software services contributed 86% 
of total revenue (2015: 68%) with the 
balance coming from implementation and 
training services. Full year 2015 revenue 
benefited from one-time licence fees 
and one-off support services of £1.06m. 
Excluding these, underlying sales growth 
is approximately 17%.
By maintaining our focus on cost control, 
the Group achieved a profit before tax of 
£0.01m (2015: £0.41m) compared to the 
loss originally expected. Adjusted EBITDA 
(stated prior to share based payments) 
was £0.81m (2015: £1.26m).
During the period recurring revenues 
increased 35% year-on-year. eg’s order 
book now stands at £17.4m to be 
recognised over the next four years. 
This is composed of annually renewable 
maintenance revenues and multi-year 
fixed term hosting contracts, reflecting  
our focus on signing multi-year deals.
Gross margin in the first half of the year 
was 66% but improved to 77% in the 
second half due to the high proportion 
of software licences sold. Overall gross 
margin improved 2% to 72% (2015: 
70%). Administrative expenses increased 
to £5.5m (2015: £4.8m) following 
increased investment in sales and 
marketing.
As at 31 January 2016 net cash was 
£3.2m (2015: £4.3m) following investment 
in research and development of £1.4m 
(2015: £0.85m). £0.08m cash was 
generated from financing activities  
(2015: £3.76m).   
Trade receivables were higher at £1.10m 
(2015:£0.45m) due to the timing of sales 
that were weighted towards the end of 
the year. These amounts have all now 
been received. Cash generated from 
operating activities was £0.27m for the 
period (2015: £1.73m).  
Earnings per share on a basic and 
fully diluted basis was 0.8p and 0.7p 
respectively. In the prior year the basic 
earnings per share was 3.6p and on  
a fully diluted basis 3.5p.
The Group has benefited from the 
favourable tax relief given on development 
expenditure. The tax credit in respect  
of the year was £158k (2015: £134k). 
eg has an existing strategic partnership 
and re-seller agreement with Aspect 
dating back to February 2013. Aspect 
also owns a 9.5% equity interest in eg 
and has a representative on the eg Board.
On 9 March 2016 Aspect submitted 
a petition for bankruptcy in the US 
Bankruptcy Court. Approval is sought 
under the terms of the petition for a 
consensual restructuring of Aspect’s 
debt as well as a fully underwritten rights 
offering of $60m of first-lien debt.  
General unsecured creditors of Aspect 
are to be paid in full in cash, though 
existing debt and equity lines are being 
compromised in whole or in part. It 
is understood that Aspect intends to 
complete the restructuring process by  
the end of June 2016.
Aspect have confirmed that all amounts 
due prior to the bankruptcy petition will 
be paid in full whilst amounts incurred 
post the petition will be paid after the 
restructuring is complete. Aspect believe 
that post the restructuring their balance 
sheet will be substantially stronger and 
they will be better placed in the market. 
Jonathan Kay
Chief Financial Officer
22 March 2016 "This is the best work 
position I've seen in  
5 years. As customers 
make contact with us, 
agents are able  
to provide accurate  
real-time information  
on the status of their 
enquiry. This manages 
the expectation for  
the customer of their 
end-to-end journey  
and has improved 
the overall customer 
experience - including  
a reduction in demand 
on chaser calls"
Case Study 
Optimising the flow of work in the Back Office
The customer needed to deploy the 
software suite into the live environment as 
quickly as possible with as little impact on 
their IT servlces as possible. They chose 
the eg operational intelligence
®
 software 
suite privately hosted in the 'Cloud' 
environment through eg's Managed  
Cloud Services. 
eg also delivered the eg principles 
of operational management
®
 training  
programme over the course of the  
project to ensure best practice use  
of the eg operational inlelligence
®
 
software suite. 
Results 
The customer's target was to increase 
productivity by 20% whifst maintaining  
the same workloads and resources  
- the actual delivered benefit realised was 
30% improvement in productivity, whilst 
reducing over-time. 
The customer used the eg operational 
intelligence
®
 software suite to identify 
spare short-term capacity across the 
business functions. They were able to 
quantify the volume of work, had real-time 
visibility of outstanding work, meaning 
backlogs were cleared and SLAs met. 
There is now more resource sharing and 
a tangible skills matrix in place to aid skills 
utilisation, resulting in multi-skilling people 
across the site according to business 
needs. Investing in their Team Managers, 
by the introduction of the eg principles 
of operational management
®
 training 
programme, resulted in consistency  
in the management of work, resources  
and performance across the business.  
For example, prior to the implementation, 
different departments used different 
methods to log completed work, making 
comparisons difficult. 
This leading UK energy company  
was formed through the privatisation 
of the electricity industry and various 
acquisitions. The company employ 
over 10,000 staff serving 6.5 million 
households and businesses across  
the UK 
Background
The customer needed to optimise 
workflows in the back office to deliver an 
improvement in productivity and reduce 
their 'Cost to Serve'. Key requirements 
included the need to provide real-time 
information to all levels of management 
to monitor productivity against customer 
demands and to monitor and improve 
operational efficiency. 
Objectives
Project deliverables included: 
•	 Establish a consistent methodology 
to enable the development and 
assessment of Team Managers against 
recognised operational management 
best practice.
•	 Equip the Team Managers with  
the relevant skills and knowledge  
to utilise the chosen back office 
workforce optimisation solution;  
the eg operational intelligence
®
  
software suite.
•	 Real-time visibility of progress against 
KPIs and plans.
•	 Consistent management information to 
support process improvement activities.
Solutions
A combination of three core components of 
the eg operational intelligence
®
 software 
suite were delivered: 
•	 Strategic Planrnng & Forecasting
•	 Real-Time Work Management
•	 Reporting & Analytics
A quality framework has now also been 
implemented ensuring that consistency  
is maintained. The customer now has 
visibility, control and improvement of 
the end-to-end customer journey, 
understanding of how individuals and 
teams impact on the organisations 
efficiency and as a result has reduced  
their operating costs and improved 
operational effectiveness .

Our Customers
In an independent survey of our leading customers, conducted by a third party consultancy, we achieved a Net Promoter 
Score (NPS) of 54%. Any score over 50% is generally considered to be excellent, and we will use this result as a 
benchmark for future surveys.
Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a customer loyalty and satisfaction metric, based on the question: “On a 1-10 scale, where 
10 is high, how likely would you be to recommend eg to a friend or colleague?” Customers who respond with a 9 or 10 
are considered “Promoters”, customers who respond with a 7 or 8 are considered “Passives”, and those scoring 6 or 
below are ‘Detractors’. NPS is calculated as the number of Promoters less the number of “Detractors”, expressed as a 
percentage of the total sample. 
Our Global Customers
“eg have a well packaged, well  
executed product and great people.  
I am selling them into our organisation

“The software is definitely good value.  
It gives us what we wanted. It’s robust, reliable and 
easy to use. We couldn’t really take it out, if we did 
we would end up paying much more.”
“We have seen some very big improvements from deploying eg work manager

. Our quality rose from 
88% to 98% because we stopped getting rework. Our response times to customers fell from ten days 
to one day, and we were seeing individual performance improvements from 50% to 100%. It has also 
enabled the business to start developing new financial services products again, where previously we 
couldn’t because of the cost of the operations needed to support those products.” 24661   8 April 2016 4:21 PM    Proof One

Case Study
The eg operational 
intelligence
®
 software 
suite has been an 
enabler in helping 
Geoban UK deliver 
cumulative savings  
in excess of £5m  
over the last 3 years
Case Study 
Geoban, part of the Santander Group
The Command Centre supports all 
operational teams with the following 
services: MI, Planning/Forecasting, eg 
work manager® support and performance 
planning for 10 sites supporting over 
3,000+ staff members. Through regular 
engagement with the operational teams 
all plans are reviewed and maintained 
to enable successful execution to meet 
targets around quality, control and 
productivity.
eg were engaged to optimise the effective 
use of resources within the operational 
teams. This involved a roll-out of the back 
office workforce optimisation solution 
to  a total user base of 2,200+ people. 
This was supported by an operational 
management training framework, based 
on the eg principles of operational 
management® to achieve:
•	 Consistent management practices;
•	 Improved Team Leader capability; and
•	 Measurable improvements in 
performance and capacity.
The Solution
An original pilot project had proved  
that the business could be optimised if 
real-time intra-day work management 
functionality were to be implemented. 
Geoban UK had historically used a basic 
data capture tool and had monthly planning 
models in place for some business areas 
within Geoban, but not 100% coverage and 
not at daily or intraday levels. MI delivery 
was also part of a different team.
Following the initial implementation of the  
eg operational intelligence
®
 software 
suite, the MI team joined the Command 
Centre unit and planning models were  
put in place with 100% coverage across 
Geoban UK.
Background
Geoban is part of Banco Santander 
that manages operational customer 
transactions conducted by the Group’s 
banks and financial institutions in the 
countries where it operates.
Geoban UK – a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Banco Santander and a non-profit plc 
registered in the UK, covers all operational 
activities for Santander UK and all its 
subsidiaries. A few examples are account 
opening, loan or credit card applications, 
national or international payments and/
or transfers, and servicing customer 
accounts for the bank’s retail, corporate, 
investment, cards, insurance and private 
banking customers. To manage these 
diverse and large scale operations 
Geoban UK has established Centres of 
Excellence that provide services for the 
Santander UK entities. 
The Geoban UK culture is dynamic, fast-
paced and constantly evolving; embracing 
the Simple, Personal and Fair values for 
Customers, Employees and Shareholders 
alike. Both the culture and metrics are 
focused on the end-to-end customer 
journey, operating in a continuously 
improving environment and by challenging 
themselves to constantly deliver 1% 
marginal gains in everything they do. 
Objectives
The back office Command Centre 
ensures Geoban UK effectively handles 
all work received via email, work-
flow, telephony and postal channels 
from both customers and front office 
branches within regulatory or contractual 
timescales, to the quality standard 
expected, in a controlled manner.
Using the eg principles of operational 
management
®
 training framework,   
eg worked with Geoban to create an  
in-house “Geoban Principles” framework 
to take into account the specific culture, 
policies and requirements of Geoban.
In the second phase, following 
implementation of the software, the 
Command Centre had fully embraced the 
tool and were delivering the "Flat Back 
Office" concept i.e. working with a similar 
number of resources, irrespective of peaks 
in transactional volume flowing through to 
the operational back office teams.
This was done using eg work manager
®
 
through proactively improving Quality, 
Control and Productivity. 
The specifics included:
•	 Capture of all back office work and 
resource including scheduling of training 
and holidays;
•	 Daily forecast and capacity models 
across all functions;
•	 Strategic work allocation to drive 
optimised performance and processing 
efficiency across functions;
•	 Performance analysis at an individual 
agent and task level to analyse 
variations and therefore optimise 
productivity and resource usage; and
•	 End-to-end SLA management.
Results
The project revolutionised the way the 
Command Centre operated and in 
addition to productivity benefits achieved, 
the measurement, planning and overall 
performance of the Command centre   
is exemplary. 24661    8 April 2016 4:21 PM    Proof One

with revenue of £4.00m, a 13% increase 
on 2015 £3.55m. Our recurring revenues

was 66% compared with 74% in the 
same period for the prior year. The margin 
improved in the second half to 77%, an 
increase of 11% on 2015 of 66%. This 
was due to a high proportion of software 
licences, maintenance and software 
services.
Profit Before Taxation
The Group produced a profit before 
taxation of £0.01m (2015: profit before 
taxation of £0.41m). 
Taxation

favourable tax relief given on development 
expenditure. The effective rate of taxation 
credit is 1756% (2015: effective rate of tax 
credit 33%).
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share on a basic and 
fully diluted basis was 0.8p and 0.7p

new and enhanced software offerings.  
The Group invests in new product 
development and the continual 
modification and improvement of its 
existing products to meet technological 
advances, customer and new market 
requirements.
Future Developments
The Group has embarked upon a 
strategy which will extend its activities 
in financial services into other new UK 
market sectors, in addition to developing 
its activities outside of the UK.  During 
the year the US dormant company was 
activated to support this strategy.
Cash Flow
The Group at 31 January had interest-
earning cash balances of £3.20m and  
no overdraft (2015: interest earning cash 
balances of £4.30m and no overdraft).

Risks and Uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks 
and uncertainties which could have a 
material impact on the Group’s long-term 
performance and cause actual results 
to differ materially from expected and 
historical results. Management seeks to 
identify material risks and put in place 
contingency plans to mitigate the Group’s 
potential exposure.  
Competitor Risk
The market for back office workforce 
optimisation is becoming increasingly 
competitive. To mitigate this risk, 
management works to build strong 
customer relationships and develop the 
Group’s product offering.  
Commercial Relationships
Some of the products utilise interfaces 
with proprietary software licensed 
by independent, third party software 
developers. Any absence of key third 
party products could have a material 
impact on the business.
To mitigate this risk, all key commercial 
relationships and developments in 
technology in the marketplace are kept 
under review. The Group also works with 
a diversity of partners to mitigate the risk 
inherent in working with a single partner.
Operations
The Group’s facilities could be disrupted 
by events beyond its control such as fire 
or other issues.
The Group prepares recovery plans for 
the most foreseeable situations so that 
our business operations would continue 
should these situations occur.

are classified by their size and measured 
in terms of how successfully they comply 
with a range of seven measures. eg are 
accredited with level 4 status (out of 10,  
1 is the highest score). 
Company Charity 
Since establishing a subsidiary in 
Johannesburg in 2007, eg has chosen 
the Doornkop Needy Children’s Centre 
(DNCC) as its Company charity. The 
centre provides safety, shelter, clothing, 
education, love and medical care from 
Monday to Friday for orphaned or fostered 
children aged 0 to 5 years old, some of 
whom are HIV positive. 
eg supports fundraising activities with 
staff and clients, as well as making 
its own financial contributions to the 
charity. The Company organises annual 
educational outings for the children and 
has provided items from a “wish list” 
of educational items using some of the 
funds raised to expand the facilities they 
have available and contribute towards 
the children’s education. Here are some 
of the developments that have been 
made possible from the donations and 
fundraising that has taken place in the last 
12 months: 
•	 Provision of learning materials, books 
and toys;
•	 Educational outings;
•	 Enhanced crèche facilities including  
an outdoor play area;
•	 Ongoing caregiver’s training to improve 
knowledge and skills in caring for the 
children; and
•	 Regular e-pap supplies – epap 
is essential fortified, nutrient rich 
food formulated to address hunger. 
Important Priorities 
Child welfare — providing a safe 
environment for the children who would 
otherwise be left alone and at risk. 
Hunger and malnutrition — providing 
a safe haven and respite for parents, 
ensuring access to food and water to 
support their health. 
Education — engaging the children in 
educational activities such as learning the 
alphabet, numbers, the concept of colour 
and providing access to educational toys. 
eg is the primary sponsor of DNCC and 
ensures that the crèche gets the right 
support to meet their everyday needs. 
eg have donated a minimum of R154k 
(Rand) this year to aid the development of 
the crèche.
“With eg’s continued 
support, we will be able 
to further enhance our 
facilities. The DNCC 
family truly thanks you - 
you are truly a blessing, 
not just to us but every

Corporate Governance
Board Structure 
and Committees
The Board is responsible to shareholders 
for the proper management of the 
Company.  A statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the accounts 
is set out on page 20 of the 2016 annual 
report. The Non-Executive Directors have 
a particular responsibility to ensure that 
the strategies proposed by the Executive 
Directors are fully considered. To enable the 
Board to discharge its duties all Directors 
have full and timely access to all the 
relevant information. There is a procedure 
for all Directors in furtherance of their duties 
to take independent professional advice, if 
necessary at the expense of the Company. 
The Board has a formal schedule of 
matters reserved to it and meets at least 
10 times a year. It is responsible for 
overall strategy, approval of major capital 
expenditure projects and consideration of 
significant financing matters.
The following committees which have 
written terms of reference deal with 
specific aspects of the Company’s affairs:
•	 The Nomination Committee is chaired 
by the Chairman and comprises the 
Board. The Committee is responsible for 
processing candidates for appointment 
to the Board, having regard to the 
balance and structure of the Board.  
In appropriate cases recruitment 
consultants are used to assist the 
process. All Directors are subject to re-
election at least every three years.
•	 The Remuneration Committee 
is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board on the 
Company’s framework on Executive 
remuneration and its cost. The 
Committee determines the contract 
terms, remuneration and other benefits 
for each of the Executive Directors 
and senior employees, including 
performance related bonus schemes, 
share incentive plans, pension rights 
and compensation payments. During 
the year, the Committee has been 
examining the management KPIs used 
in the Company’s performance related 
bonus schemes and share incentive 
plans and will look to introduce revised 
measures, where appropriate, in the 
current financial period. The Board 
itself determines the remuneration 
of the Non-Executive Directors. The 
Remuneration Committee is chaired 
by Mark Brady and is attended by 
Duncan McIntyre and John Brougham. 
Directors’ Remuneration is set out on 
Pages 38 and 39 of the 2016 Annual 
Report and Accounts. 
The Remuneration Committee met three 
times during the year. 
•	 The Audit Committee is chaired by 
John Brougham and is made up of 
two other Non–Executive Directors; 
Mark Brady and Duncan McIntyre. All 
three members of the committee are 
qualified accountants. The meetings 
are also attended, by invitation, by the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer. Its prime tasks are 
to review the scope of external audit, 
to receive regular reports from RSM 
UK Audit LLP , and to review the half 
yearly and annual accounts before they 
are presented to the Board, focusing 
in particular on accounting policies 
and areas of management judgement 
and estimation. The Committee 
is responsible for monitoring the 
controls which are in force to ensure 
integrity of the information reported to 
shareholders. The Committee acts as a 
forum for internal discussion of internal 
control issues and contributes to the 
Board’s review of the effectiveness 
of the Company’s internal controls 
and risk management systems and 
processes. The risk register is reviewed 
and scrutinised by the Committee. The 
Committee also considers the need for 
an internal audit function. It advises the 
Board on the appointment of external 
auditors and on their remuneration for 
both audit and non-audit work, and 
discusses the nature and scope of 
audit with the external auditors. The 
Committee has met five times during 
the year, there is a standing invite 
for the external auditors to attend all 
meetings.
The external auditors also meet privately 
with the Non-Executive members of the 
audit committee at least once a year.
The Audit Committee also undertakes 
a formal assessment of the auditor’s 
independence which includes:
•	 a review of the non-audit services 
provided to the Company and the 
related fees;
•	 discussion with the auditors of a written 
report detailing all relationships with the 
Company and any other parties that 
could affect the independence or the 
perception of independence;
•	 a review of the auditors’ own 
procedures for ensuring the 
independence of the audit firm and 
partners and staff involved in the audit, 
including the regular rotation of the 
audit partner; and
•	 obtaining written confirmation from 
the auditor that, in their professional 
judgement, they are independent.
Internal Control
The Directors are responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and 
reviewing its effectiveness. The Board has 
designed the Group’s system of internal 
control in order to provide the Directors 
with reasonable assurance that its assets 
are safeguarded, that transactions are 
authorised and properly recorded and 
that material errors and irregularities are 
either prevented or would be detected 
within a timely period. However, no system 
of internal control can eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives 
or provide absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the control system in 
operation are:
•	 the Board meets regularly with a 
formal schedule of matters reserved 
to it for a decision. It has put in place 
an organisational structure with clear 
lines of responsibility defined and with 
appropriate delegation of authority;
•	 there are established procedures for 
the planning, approval and monitoring 
of capital expenditure and information 
systems for monitoring the Group’s 
financial performance against approved 
budgets and forecasts; and
•	 the department heads are required to 
undertake a full assessment process 
to identify and quantify the risks that 
face their business and functions, and 
assess the adequacy of the prevention, 
monitoring and modification practices 
in place for those risks. The resulting 
risk register is regularly reviewed and 
scrutinised by the Board. In addition, 
associated control and monitoring 
procedures are reported to the Board 
to enable the Directors to review the 
effectiveness of the systems of internal 
control. The process adopted by the 
Company accords with the guidance 
contained in the document “Internal 
Control Guidance for Directors on 
the Combined Code.” Issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in 
England and Wales.
The Audit Committee receives reports 
from the external auditor on a regular 
basis and from Executive Directors of 
the Company. During the audit period, 
the Audit Committee has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal 
control as described above. The Board 
receives periodic reports from all 
Committees. 24661   8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Directors’ Report
The Directors submit their report and the 
financial statements of eg solutions plc for 
the year ended 31 January 2016.
Principal Activity of the 
Group and Company
The principal activity of the Group is 
that of an IT and software support 
services business delivering guaranteed 
improvements in operational 
management. The Group uses proprietary 
software packages and an operations 
management methodology based on 
production management techniques. The 
Group delivers measurable operational 
improvements in large back office 
environments.
Financial Risk Management 
Objectives and Policies
The main financial risks faced by the 
Group relate to the risk of default to 
financial transactions by customers, 
availability of funds to meet the Group’s 
needs and fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates.
The Group manages these risks through 
an effective risk management programme.  
Exposures to financial risks are monitored 
by management and they are required to 
produce a quarterly risk report comprising 
all risks and an indication of the business 
impact of those risks.
The risk reports are provided to the 
Board of Directors in advance of the 
Board meetings and are discussed by the 
Board to ensure that the risk mitigation 
procedures are compliant with the 
Group policy and that any new risks are 
appropriately managed.
Credit Risk
The objective is to reduce the risk of 
loss arising from default to financial 
transactions by customers. The Group 
has focused on selling to a “blue chip” 
customer base thereby minimising the 
risk of incurring bad debts. The Group’s 
positions with these counterparties and 
their credit ratings are routinely monitored.
Liquidity
At the year end the Group had £3.2m 
in net cash balances and no overdraft. 
The objective is to ensure that operating 
profits are turned into cash balances 
during the year. 
The Group finances its operations through 
retained profits.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to minimal foreign 
currency risk through transactions with 
overseas customers.

Directors’ Responsibilities  
in Preparation of the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Strategic Report, the 
Directors’ Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare the Group and Company financial 
statements for each financial year. The 
Directors are required by the AIM Rules 
of the London Stock Exchange to 
prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
by the European Union (“EU”) and have 
elected under Company law to prepare 
the Company financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted  
by the EU.
The financial statements are required 
by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to 
present fairly the financial position of 
the Group and the Company and the 
financial performance of the Group. 
The Companies Act 2006 provides in 
relation to such financial statements that 
references in the relevant part of that Act 
to financial statements giving a true and 
fair view are references to their achieving 
a fair presentation.
Under Company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing the Group and Company 
financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
b. make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
c. state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs adopted by 
the EU;
d. prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
and the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group 
and the Company and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006.  
They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the eg solutions plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 24661   8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which 
the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are 
required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:

been kept by the Parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
•	 the Parent Company financial 
statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
•	 we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for  
our audit.

The share-based payment reserve is a reserve to recognise a corresponding entry in relation to those amounts recognised  
in retained earnings in respect of share-based payments.
The own shares held reserve shows movements in the shares held in trust by the eg solutions Employee Benefit Trust.
The share premium account contains the aggregate amount of the premiums received on issuing shares after the deduction  
of attributable expenses and commission.
The amount of transaction costs accounted for as a deduction from equity during the year was £nil (2015: £201,000).
Retained earnings include the accumulated profits and losses arising from the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 
excluding foreign exchange differences on translation of foreign operations.
The foreign exchange reserve comprises all exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of overseas 
operations.
Other reserves represent the equity component of the convertible loan notes, which is transferred to retained earnings when  
the instrument is settled or converted. 24661    8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 January 2016
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
eg solutions plc is a public limited company incorporated in England, registered number 02211062, with its registered office  
at Barn 1, Dunston Business Village, Stafford Road, Dunston, Staffordshire, ST18 9AB.
The principal activity of the Group is that of an IT and software support services business delivering guaranteed improvements in 
operational management. The Group uses proprietary software packages and an operations management methodology based on 
production management techniques. The Group delivers measurable operational improvements in large back office environments.
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
as endorsed by the EU (“IFRS”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under (“IFRS”).
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost and going concern basis. The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out below.
The Company made a profit after tax of £0.1m (2015: loss after tax £0.05m) for the financial year. The Directors have taken 
advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and have not presented a Statement  
of Comprehensive Income for the Company.
Going Concern
The Group manages its day-to-day working capital requirements through a combination of cash inflows from sales and tight 
management of expenses.
The Group raised £0.1m in September 2015 through issue and allotment of 112,850 shares of 1p relating to a notice to exercise 
warrants by finnCap Limited. The Group is carrying no debt at 31 January 2016. The Group has a cash balance of £3.2m at  
31 January 2016.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, for a period of not less than 12 months from the date these financial statements have been 
approved, which take account of both positive and negative variations in trading performance, show that the Group has sufficient 
headroom to operate. The Directors currently have no reason to believe that the Group could not obtain other sources of funding  
if that was required.
Having assessed current trading, the strength of customer relationships, the current sales pipeline and the growing demand for our 
product, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Relevant Accounting Standards Issued and Effective
During the year the following relevant accounting standards have been issued and are effective but have not had a material impact

Relevant Accounting Standards Issued but not yet effective
During the year the following relevant accounting standards have been issued but are not yet effective and are not expected to have 
a material impact on the Group:
•	 IFRS 16 Leases expected to be effective 2019
•	 Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses expected to be effective 2017
•	 Amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative expected to be effective 2017

IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” has been issued but is not yet effective. It is expected to be effective 2018.  
The Directors are in the process of reviewing this standard and will report the impact on the Group in due course.
Basis of Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of eg solutions plc and the enterprises controlled by the Group 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 January each year. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and have been rounded 
to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue 
to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent Company and are based on consistent 
accounting policies. All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write each asset down to its estimated residual 
value over its expected useful life, as follows:
Computer Equipment — 25% straight line
Office Equipment — 15% reducing balance
Fixtures and Fittings — 15% reducing balance
Motor Vehicles — 25% reducing balance
Leasehold Improvements — 20% straight line 24661   8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

Impairment of Non-current Assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-current assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent 
from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible 
asset with an indefinite useful life or that has not yet been brought into use is tested for impairment annually.
Intangible Assets
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s software development is recognised only when all of the following 
conditions are met:
•	 an asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes);
•	 it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;
•	 the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably;
•	 the product or process is technically and commercially viable; and
•	 sufficient resources are available to complete the development and to either sell or use the asset.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which it is incurred.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives (6 years). The amortisation is 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date and amortised 
over the estimated life of the asset. These assets include intellectual property relating to the Nuqleus product set and customer 
relationships acquired in 2010 which eg continue to benefit from. These are amortised over their useful economic lives (5 years).
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Retirement Benefits
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the 
Company in an independently administered fund. The amount charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in 
respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments  
at the reporting date. 24661    8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

Foreign Currencies
Transactions in currencies other than sterling, the presentational and functional currency of the Group, are recorded at the rates  
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are 
included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, 
if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s foreign exchange reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as 
income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
The results of overseas operations have been translated into sterling at the monthly weighted average rate of exchange for the 
period. Rand denominated assets and liabilities have been translated at the relevant rate of exchange at the reporting date of  
£1 = R22.9901 (2015: £1 = R17.4986). US Dollar denominated assets and liabilities have been translated at the relevant rate of 
exchange at the reporting date £1 = USD 1.4311.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years 
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled 
based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity,  
in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in equity.
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of provision is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. 24661   8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank and other short-term deposits held by the Group with maturities  
of less than three months.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of the overdraft as these borrowings, 
which are repayable on demand, are an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
Trade Payables
Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
Share-Based Payments
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant where the cost reflects the value of employee 
services or performance related services. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Where 
the cost relates to the cost of raising equity finance the cost is recognised directly in equity in the same manner as issues costs. 
Fair value is measured by use of either the Black–Scholes model or Monte Carlo model where appropriate where the value of the 
service received cannot be measured reliably. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Employee Share Ownership Plans
The Company operates an ESOP trust and has de facto control of the shares held by the trust and bears their benefits and risks. 
The Group records certain assets and liabilities of the trust as its own. Finance costs and administrative expenses are charged  
as they accrue.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The Group has no finance leases.
Grants Received
All costs associated with the relevant grant project are held on the balance sheet awaiting amortisation. The income received is held 
within deferred income awaiting release against the life of the product. As the project goes live, the costs net of the government grant 
are amortised over the life of the asset. The life of the asset is 6 years unless otherwise stated. These assets are presented within 
non-current assets in the balance sheet.
If for any unforeseen circumstance a grant needs to be repaid, this shall be recognised by reducing the deferred income balance 
by the amount repayable resulting in a higher asset value to amortise. The cumulative additional amortisation that would have been 
recognised in profit or loss to date in the absence of the grant shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss. 24661    8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of Group financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires the use  
of accounting estimates and judgements in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. These judgements and 
estimates are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions.
Impairment of Intangible Assets
The Group takes into account the future contracted cash inflows from repeatable revenues and the risk adjusted cash flows from 
pipeline sales expected over the life of the assets under review to determine whether an impairment needs to be made or not. 
Expected cash flows from pipeline sales are adjusted to take into account the probability that they will be realised over a reasonable 
period of time based on historical experience and negotiations that have been held with management at the reporting date.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised when revenue and associated costs can be measured reliably and future economic benefits are probable. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales 
taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Maintenance Contracts
Income in respect of maintenance contracts is invoiced on an annual basis and recognised as earned.
Software Licences
For perpetual licences revenues are recognised once the software has been fully installed.
For subscription licences annual revenues are recognised on the date of installation and in following years on the anniversary  
of the installation date because this is the date the risk and reward passed to the customer.
Hosted Contracts
For any contracts where the Group charges one fee to cover multiple goods/services the contract value is broken down into 
separate components and each component will be recognised separately at its fair value in accordance with the Group revenue 
recognition policy.
Implementation of Software Services
Revenues in respect of implementation and software services are recognised on a percentage of completion basis calculated  
pro-rata on the number of man days completed to the estimated total project man days.
Intercompany Receivable
The Directors assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the intercompany receivable 
balances are impaired.  Where such evidence exists, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. 24661   8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

3. OPERATING SEGMENTS
eg solutions plc provides IT and software support services by operating two distinct companies in the United Kingdom (“EGUK”)  
and in South Africa (“EGSA”). Financial information is reported to the Board for both companies individually with revenue and 
operating profits split by geographic location. Segment revenue comprises of sales to external customers and excludes finance 
income. Segment profit reported to the Board represents the profit before tax earned by each segment.
For the purposes of assessing segment performance and for determining the allocation of resources between segments, the Board 
reviews the non-current assets attributable to each segment as well as the financial resources available. All assets and liabilities are 
allocated to reportable segments. Information is reported to the Board of Directors on a company basis as management believe that 
each company exposes the Group to differing levels of risk and rewards due to local economic conditions. The segment profit or 
loss, segment assets and segment liabilities are measured on the same basis as amounts recognised in the financial statements,  
as set out in the accounting policies.
Transactions between EGUK and EGSA are accounted for on an “arms length” basis.
Segment information about these companies is presented below:

During the year the Group had revenues from two (2015: two) customers in the UK amounting to £3,809,000 (2015: £3,681,000) in 
total that individually made up more than 10% of revenues generated. 
A current eg client uses our software within a number of separate entities on a variety of discrete client contracts. The software is 
embedded in those contracts and consequently risk is spread across these contracts and not concentrated in the ultimate holding 
entity. None of these contracts are individually over 10%. Our second largest customer in the financial services sector has increased 
spend significantly in the year, predominantly driven by a switch to a hosted contract.

Basic earnings per share 0.8p  3.6p 
Diluted earnings per share 0.7p  3.5p 
EPS has been calculated using the following methodology:
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the number of weighted 
average ordinary shares during the period. The number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust (see note  
26 Share-based Payments).
For diluted earnings per share, the number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees.
At 31 January 2016, there were 1,588,463 (2015: 1,641,940) share options outstanding that could potentially dilute basic EPS  
in the future, but are not included in the calculation of diluted EPS because they are anti dilutive for the periods presented. 24661    8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

29. GROUP – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the risk of default to financial transactions by customers, availability of funds  
to meet the Group’s needs and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These risks are managed as described below.
An explanation of the Group’s financial instrument risk management objectives and policies are set out in the Directors’ Report  
on page 19.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures. Any proposed changes will be 
considered by the Board prior to such changes being implemented.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows:
Liquidity Risk
Cash flow is managed on a daily, short-term and longer-term basis and management is therefore able to ensure that the Group  
has sufficient cash to meet all its commitments.
Forecast liquidity is reviewed weekly by management.
Market Risk
Market risk is comprised of Foreign Currency Risk, Interest Rate Risk and Other Price Risk.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is subject to a cross-border transactional currency exposure in respect of trading outside of the Group’s functional 
currency. Where possible, currency receivables and payables are matched, creating a natural hedge. All contracts are assessed  
for the need to hedge using appropriate derivative instruments.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures in the profit and loss account arising from the monetary assets and 
monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in Sterling, its functional currency. The sensitivity analysis below is  
based on a 10% appreciation/depreciation of USD against GBP , applied to the net monetary assets or liabilities denominated  
in this currency at the balance sheet date. 24661   8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and is not considered to be a significant risk for the Group. The only interest 
bearing assets relate to cash and cash equivalents exposed to a floating interest rate. All other assets and liabilities are non-interest 
bearing.
The Group has not prepared an interest rate sensitivity analysis because interest rate risk is not material to the Group.
Other Price Risk
The Group is not materially affected by other price risks due to the following reasons:
•	 No equity instruments are held other than shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust
•	 No commodities are traded
Credit Risk
Credit risk arises primarily from trade and other receivables. Detailed reporting is provided weekly on the debt position. The Group 
focuses on selling to a “blue chip” customer base, thereby minimising the risk of incurring bad debts. The Group’s position with these 
counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored.  24661    8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

Capital Risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and operate 
within current available facilities. This is reviewed by the Board on a monthly basis.
The Group manages its share capital and reserves as its Group capital.

the previous trading history. There is no objective evidence that these amounts will not be collected.

summarised on page 44 as they are considered to be recoverable based on our customer base being largely “blue chip”  
and the previous trading history. There is no objective evidence that the amounts will not be collected. Intercompany receivables 
have been fully impaired as noted in Note 17.
The Directors believe the quality of outstanding receivables which are neither past due nor impaired to be fully collectable.
31. POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
Employees are offered membership of the eg solutions Pension Plan, a defined contribution pension arrangement. The cost of 
contributions to the scheme is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period that they arise. The contributions 
to the scheme for the period amounted to £192,000 (2015: £176,000) representing 1%–10% of pensionable salaries. The amounts 
outstanding at the year end were £23,000 (2015: £15,000). These amounts are included in other creditors.
32. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During the year there was a Director’s loan which was interest free with no specific repayment terms. The maximum amount 
outstanding due to the Company during the year was £40,000 (2015: £42,000).
In the ordinary course of business, sales and purchases of services take place between EGUK and EGSA. Sales of software, 
consultancy and management services from EGUK to EGSA totalled £103,000 (2015: £90,000). Sales of consultancy services  
from EGSA to EGUK totalled £110,000 (2015: £57,000). All transactions are recorded on an intercompany account.
At 31 January 2016 EGUK had a balance receivable from EGSA of £863,000 (2015: £804,000). This inter-company balance is  
interest free and is repayable on demand. A provision for 100% (2015: 100%) impairment was made against the inter-company loan 
due to the uncertainty of recovery.
As at 31 January, EGUK had a balance receivable of £216,000 (2015: £nil) from EGUSA. The balance arose from EGUK supporting 
EGUSA with funds for the salary costs in the year. This inter-company balance is interest free and is repayable on demand. A 
provision for 100% (2015: N/A) impairment was made against the intercompany loan due to the uncertainty of recovery. 
As at 31 January, there is an outstanding loan from the Company to the EBT of £1,518,000 (2015: £1,544,000). The balance  
is interest free and has no set repayment terms.

Notice of Meeting continued
Resolution 8 – Authority to purchase shares (market purchases)
This resolution authorises the Board to make market purchases of up to 2,268,294 ordinary shares (representing approximately 10% 
of the Company’s issued ordinary shares as at at 31 January 2016 being the latest practicable date before publication of this notice). 
Shares so purchased may be cancelled or held in treasury. The authority will expire at the end of the next annual general meeting of 
the Company or 15 months from the passing of the resolution, whichever is the earlier. The Directors intend to seek renewal of this 
authority at subsequent annual general meetings. 
The minimum price that can be paid for an ordinary share is 1p being the nominal value of an ordinary share. The maximum price 
that can be paid is 5% over the average of the middle market prices for an ordinary share, derived from the Daily Official List of the 
London Stock Exchange, for the five business days immediately before the day on which the share is contracted to be purchased.
Resolution 9 – Approval of a reduction in capital
As at 31 January 2016, the Company had a deficit on its profit and loss account of £1.634m. This means that the Company is 
currently unable to pay dividends or make any other form of distribution until the deficit has been eliminated. In order to remedy 
this and to enable the Company to pay dividends in the future, should the Board determine that it is appropriate to do so, it is now 
proposed to eliminate the deficit and create reserves of approximately £6.218m by reducing the Company’s share premium account 
(“Reduction of Capital”) by £7.852m.
The Reduction of Capital is subject to:
(a) approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting by special resolution; 
(b) confirmation by an order of the Court; and 
(c) the Court order being delivered to and registered by the Registrar of Companies.
The resolution to approve the Reduction of Capital is required to be proposed as a special resolution. Prior to confirming the 
proposed Reduction of Capital, the Court will need to be satisfied that the proposal does not adversely affect the position of the 
creditors of the Company. The Company will, if necessary, put into place such arrangements as the Court may require to satisfy it 
in that regard. That may include an undertaking not to make any distributions from the reserve created on the Reduction of Capital 
until all of the creditors of the Company as at the date of the Reduction of Capital taking effect have either been discharged or 
have consented to the Reduction of Capital. The Board intends that an application for confirmation of the Reduction of Capital 
will be made to the Court promptly after the Annual General Meeting provided the Capital Reduction Resolution has been passed. 
Confirmation of the Reduction of Capital is within the discretion of the Court but will generally be granted provided that the Court 
is satisfied that the interests of the Company’s creditors will not be prejudiced. The process takes approximately six to eight weeks 
from the date the application is made.
Resolution 10 – Adoption of new Articles of Association
It is proposed to adopt new Articles of Association (the “New Articles”) as the current articles were adopted on 6 June 2007 and 
have not been updated since the Companies Act 2006 came into force. The principal changes introduced in the New Articles are 
summarised below. Changes of a minor, technical or clarifying nature have not been noted. A copy of the New Articles and a copy 
of the Company’s current Articles of Association (the “Current Articles”) showing changes being proposed by this resolution are 
available for inspection at the registered office of the Company at Barn 1, Dunston Business Village, Stafford Road, Dunston, Stafford 
ST18 9AB from the date of this Notice until the close of the Annual General Meeting. They will be available for inspection during usual 
business hours on any weekday (Saturdays and public holidays excluded). 24661   8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

Notes:
1. Pursuant to Part 13 of the Companies Act 2006 and to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as 
amended), only those members registered in the register of members of the Company at 6.00pm on 15 May 2016 (or if the AGM 
is adjourned, 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned AGM) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM in respect of 
the number of shares registered in their name at that time. In each case, changes to the register of members after such time shall 
be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the AGM. 
2. A member who is entitled to attend, speak and vote at the AGM may appoint a proxy to attend, speak and vote instead of him. 
A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares (so 
a member must have more than one share to be able to appoint more than one proxy). A proxy need not be a member of the 
Company but must attend the AGM in order to represent you. A proxy must vote in accordance with any instructions given by  
the member by whom the proxy is appointed. Appointing a proxy will not prevent a member from attending in person and voting 
at the AGM (although voting in person at the AGM will terminate the proxy appointment). A proxy form is enclosed. The notes 
to the proxy form include instructions on how to appoint the Chairman of the AGM or another person as a proxy. You can only 
appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these Notes and in the notes to the proxy form.
3. To be valid, a proxy form, and the original or duly certified copy of the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it 
is signed or authenticated, should reach the Company’s registrar, Capita Asset Services of The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, 
Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU, by no later than 10.30am on 15 May 2016.
4. In the case of joint holders of shares, the vote of the first named in the register of members who tenders a vote, whether in person 
or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of other joint holders.
5. A member that is a company or other organisation not having a physical presence cannot attend in person but can appoint 
someone to represent it. This can be done in one of two ways: either by the appointment of a proxy (described in Notes 2 to 4 
above) or of a corporate representative. Members considering the appointment of a corporate representative should check their 
own legal position, the Company’s articles of association and the relevant provision of the Companies Act 2006. 
6. Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts with the Company and any of its subsidiary undertakings and letters of 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during the usual 
business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays or public holidays excluded) from the date of this notice to the date of the 
AGM and from 15 minutes prior to and until the conclusion of the AGM.
7. Copies of the New Articles and Current Articles are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company at Barn 1, 
Dunston Business Village, Stafford Road, Dunston, Stafford ST18 9AB during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, 
Sundays and public holidays excluded) from the date of this Notice until the close of the meeting. If the New Articles are approved 
they will be available on the Company website after the close of the meeting. 24661    8 April 2016 5:11 PM    Proof PFP

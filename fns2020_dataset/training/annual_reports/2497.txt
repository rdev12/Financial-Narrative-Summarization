Richard Burrows 
Chairman
From the Chairman 
Dear
shareholder
I am delighted to introduce the Annual 
Report on 2011, which has been a very 
successful year for your Company. While 
economic uncertainty continues, our 
operating environment improved during 
2011. Our results for the year are driven 
by revenue growth, an improved operating 
margin, and growth in market share  
due to our successful brands, enhanced 
by the roll-out of product and  
packaging innovations. 
Market share growth 
Overall, industry volumes continued to 
decline in 2011 but there are signs that 
the rate of decline has moderated. Our 
own volumes were down marginally by 
0.4 per cent and we grew market share 
during the year. These positive results 
were spread across many markets  
around the world. 
The expansion of illicit trade is a 
continuing and growing threat to the 
business. Sharp increases in excise duty, 
pressure on consumers’ disposable 
income, and ill-considered regulation of 
our industry, are all making life easier and 
more lucrative for traders of illicit products, 
both contraband and counterfeit. 
Increasing returns
to shareholders 
Using constant currency exchange rates, 
revenue rose by 7 per cent on an organic 
basis. Adjusted profit from operations 
grew by 11 per cent to £5,519 million,  
or by 10 per cent at constant currency 
exchange rates. 
This is reflected in adjusted diluted earnings 
per share for 2011 improving by 11 per 
cent to 194.6p. 
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 88.4p per share, which will 
be paid on 3 May 2012 to shareholders 
on the register at 9 March 2012. This 
takes the total dividend for the year to 
126.5p, an increase of 11 per cent on last 
year, and maintains our target of paying 
out 65 per cent of earnings in dividends. 
In addition, following the suspension  
of our share buy-back programme in 
2009, the Board approved the resumption 
of the programme in 2011. Between  
the beginning of March and the end  
of December 2011, some 28 million  
shares were repurchased at a value of 
£750 million, excluding transaction costs. 
A continuation of the share buy-back to  
a value of £1.25 billion has been agreed 
by the Board. 
2011 has been a  
very successful year 
for your Company
and we carry 
momentum in
market share
growth and margin 
improvement  
into 2012.   03

Board changes 
Ana Maria Llopis retired from the Board 
after the Annual General Meeting in April 
2011. Ann Godbehere, a Canadian, joined 
the Board as a Non-Executive Director on  
3 October 2011. Paul Adams, former Chief 
Executive, retired at the end of February 
2011 and was succeeded by Nicandro 
Durante who was introduced to 
shareholders in his new role at the AGM. 
Christine Morin-Postel resigned as a 
member of the Audit Committee with 
effect from 21 February 2012 due to a 
personal conflict of interest, details of 
which are set out in the corporate 
governance statement. 
Sustainability 
Over the years we have built a strong 
reputation for corporate social responsibility 
and sustainability and have been 
recognised as leaders in our industry.  
For example, we were the first tobacco 
company to be included in the Dow 
Jones Sustainability World Index and we 
were included again in 2011. This focus 
on running our business responsibly 
helps us create value for our shareholders 
as well as being in the best interests of 
our other stakeholders. 
 
Again this year, we publish our 
Sustainability Report alongside our 
Annual Report at the end of March. You 
will find a summary within this report 
that outlines the sustainability agenda we 
have been developing since 2007 and 
our progress against it in 2011. You can 
find more detail about this progress in 
our full Sustainability Report online at 
www.bat.com/sustainability. 
Continued success 
I express my thanks and appreciation  
to our Chief Executive, Nicandro Durante; 
to my fellow Directors on the Board; to 
management; and, in particular, to all 
our 56,000 colleagues around the world. 
2011 has been a very successful year for 
your Company and we carry momentum 
in market share growth and margin 
improvement into 2012. The economic 
climate around the world is far from 
settled but we remain confident that  
our strategy should continue to generate 
growth for our shareholders in the  
years ahead.

Nicandro Durante 
Chief Executive 
Chief Executive’s review 
Strong growth in
revenue and profit 
Our proven strategy 
continues to deliver 
The strength of our brands, our 
consumer-centric innovative products 
and the quality of our people have 
delivered another year of very good 
earnings growth. The Group increased 
overall market share in 2010 and this 
continued in 2011 despite challenging 
economic conditions in some markets. 
There are signs that the industry volume 
decline seen in recent years is moderating 
but substantial excise-driven price 
increases in a few markets continue to 
affect overall volumes. While industry 
volume declined again in 2011, our  
share improvement ensured that Group 
volumes were virtually unchanged,  
down just 0.4 per cent year on year. 
Our Global Drive Brands and other 
international brands once again achieved 
good growth in 2011. Group revenue 
grew by 7 per cent on an organic basis 
and at constant rates of exchange, driven 
by continued good pricing. The resulting 
increase in adjusted profit from operations 
of 11 per cent has helped us to deliver 
superior returns to shareholders once 
again, with adjusted diluted earnings per 
share up by 11 per cent on last year. 
Strong brands driving 
growth
Our brands, both international and local, 
performed well in 2011. Collectively, our 
four Global Drive Brands (GDBs) – 
Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall – 
achieved volume growth of 9 per cent. 
Kent was up 10 per cent, growing in all 
of its top ten markets; Dunhill volumes 
were slightly higher; Pall Mall continued 
its recent success story with an 11 per 
cent increase in volumes; and Lucky 
Strike grew strongly by 14 per cent. 
We continued to grow market share in 
2011. This growth was driven by the 
launch of product innovations such  
as Click & Roll, Reloc and Convertibles  
in key markets, improved retailer 
relationships and by improving our  
speed to market.  
Productivity
Our productivity continued to improve  
in 2011 as we further addressed our cost 
base through factory rationalisation, 
systems standardisation and productivity 
savings. This helped us achieve a 
substantial increase in operating margin 
from 33.5 to 35.8 per cent. This is well 
ahead of our target of improving overall 
margin by 50-100 basis points per annum. 
Strengthening our business 
In 2011 we grew market share, grew  
our leading international brands in our 
most important markets and achieved 
significant productivity savings. Our 
results demonstrate the strength of our 
companies worldwide but we know we 
can do better. Our tried and tested 
strategy has not changed but we will 
continue to improve how we execute it 
as we seek to grow market share.  
Challenging ourselves to keep improving  
is critical to our continuing success, as we 
seek to grow market share by promoting 
our key brands and bringing market-
leading innovations to market. 
The last year has seen 
considerable success 
for the Group and I 
am excited when I 
look to our strengths. 
We have some great 
brands and our 
marketing is based on 
powerful consumer 
insights, supported  
by superior products 
and market-leading 
innovations.  06

Chief Executive’s review continued 
Sustainable business 
Of course, much of what we do today is 
about preparing for our future. We are 
proud of our record of sustainability 
across our Group operations and 
throughout our supply chain. In 
particular, we are proud of our extensive 
scientific research programme looking at 
modified cigarettes and low-toxicant 
smokeless tobacco products. 
Sustainability for us is about creating 
shared value, which means creating 
economic value for shareholders while 
ensuring our business is run responsibly 
in the interests of all our stakeholders. 
We continue to make progress on our 
sustainability agenda, not just reducing our 
impact on the environment and investing in 
our people but also the way we conduct 
our operations in the marketplace and 
throughout our supply chain. 
Our key challenge for many decades  
to come will be to provide tobacco 
consumers with exciting high quality 
products, taking into account their 
changing preferences and expectations. 
This means continuing to deliver the 
most innovative cigarette products, as we 
do today. It also means developing other 
nicotine products consumers may choose 
in the future. In 2011, we set up 
Nicoventures as a stand-alone company 
to develop and test alternative nicotine 
products. We believe that the debates 
around our product categories should be 
founded on fact-based science and  
we have made a significant commitment  
to this at our Group research and 
development facilities, where the work 
we are doing trying to develop lower 
toxicant products has been recognised  
by several key stakeholders. 
Global outlook 
For the foreseeable future, the world 
market is likely to remain fairly stable at 
around five and a half trillion cigarettes, 
more than 40 per cent of which are sold 
in China. We expect overall market values 
to grow due to changes in the product 
mix and we believe the value of emerging 
markets will grow more quickly. Because 
of this, our geographic diversity and 
strong positions in emerging markets 
remain a key strength. 
Managing risks 
We have identified a core list of potential 
threats that we believe could represent 
significant risks to our business. As can be 
seen from our review of the key Group 
risk factors in this report, we regularly 
monitor their potential impact and 
likelihood and controls are in place to 
ensure that they are carefully managed. 
Tackling illicit trade 
The expansion of illicit trade remains a 
threat globally, driven by sharp excise 
increases and pressure on consumers’ 
disposable income. We support the 
development of the World Health 
Organisation’s Framework Convention 
on Tobacco Control (FCTC) protocol 
aimed at creating an international 
regulatory framework for addressing illicit 
trade. However, we remain critical of 
other measures proposed by the FCTC 
that may drive significant excise 
increases, retail display bans and plain 
packaging – all of these measures could 
play into the hands of organised crime  
by creating ideal conditions for further 
increases in illicit trade. 
Acquisitions and 
competitive landscape 
The tobacco industry remained fairly  
stable during 2011, with little M&A activity 
among the leading industry players. On  
26 May 2011, the Group announced that it 
had agreed to acquire 100 per cent of 
privately-owned Protabaco, the second 
largest cigarette company in Colombia. The 
transaction was completed on 11 October 
2011 and the deal was financed from 
internal resources. 
We continue to monitor acquisition 
opportunities around the world and will 
participate where it makes financial and 
strategic sense to do so.  07

Management Board changes 
2011 saw the retirement of my 
predecessor, Paul Adams, as well as that 
of our long-standing Group Operations 
Director, Peter Taylor. Des Naughton 
replaced Peter, while Giovanni Giordano 
succeeded Rudi Kindts as Group Human 
Resources Director. 
In November 2011, I announced that 
Michael Prideaux, Director, Corporate & 
Regulatory Affairs (CORA), had informed 
the Board of his intention to retire with 
effect from 30 June 2012. At the same 
time, I was pleased to announce the 
appointments of Kingsley Wheaton,  
Dr David O’Reilly and Naresh Sethi to  
the Management Board. Kingsley became 
Deputy CORA Director with effect from  
1 January 2012 and will take the role of 
CORA Director when Michael retires. Also 
from 1 January 2012, David and Naresh 
took on the newly created roles of Group 
Scientific Director and Director, Group 
Business Development, respectively. 
I would like to extend my personal thanks 
to our retiring directors for their excellent 
contributions to our business over many 
years and welcome our new directors. 
Substantial opportunities 
The last year has seen considerable 
success for the Group and I am excited 
when I look to our strengths. 
We have some great brands and our 
marketing is based on powerful 
consumer insights, supported by 
differentiated and superior products. We 
have market-leading innovations – and 
we are getting better at deploying them. 
We have a great business mix, with a 
strong presence in emerging markets and 
a balanced product portfolio across all 
segments. We have a fully integrated 
supply chain and our systems are 
becoming more efficient. We have an 
industry-leading approach to science  
and harm reduction and, importantly,  
we have the people capable of tackling 
the challenges ahead. 
I am confident that we are well placed  
to take advantage of the substantial 
opportunities ahead for our business and 
that we can continue to deliver superior 
shareholder returns.

Global market overview 
Value of the global tobacco 
market continues to grow 
 
Global marketplace 
The global tobacco market is valued at 
around £450 billion and the industry 
produces around 5.5 trillion cigarettes a 
year. While cigarette sales in developed 
countries continue to decline slightly year 
on year, overall global market declines 
are showing signs of moderating. Recent 
trends indicate that individual smokers 
will consume fewer cigarettes each and 
smaller percentages of populations will 
smoke. However, sustained volume 
growth is widely predicted in emerging 
markets, driven by population growth 
and increasing disposable income. 
The biggest single tobacco market is 
China, where the industry is state-owned, 
with some 350 million smokers who 
account for more than 40 per cent of  
the global total consumed.  
 
The four biggest international tobacco 
companies – British American Tobacco, 
Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and 
Philip Morris International – account for 
some 45 per cent of the global market,  
or around three-quarters of the market 
outside China.  
Tobacco companies face an increasingly 
competitive marketplace but the overall 
value of the global market continues to 
grow. This value is expected to exceed 
£500 billion by 2015, despite tighter 
regulation, global economic uncertainty 
and high unemployment levels in 
developed markets. Consumers 
worldwide are increasingly looking for 
and expecting real value, meaning that 
quality and innovation will both play a 
growing role in delivering market share. 
Global tobacco market 
 Estimated value  
of £450 billion 
 Cigarettes account for 
around 95 per cent  
of the total market 
 Around 5.5 trillion 
cigarettes produced 
each year 
 Overall cigarette 
volumes (excluding 
China) declined by 
around 2 per cent  
in 2011 but the 
overall market value 
continues to grow 
 Up to 12 per cent of 
global volume is illicit 
– fake, smuggled or 
local tax-evaded 
British American Tobacco’s total cigarette volume for 2011 was 705 billion. Our estimated share of the 
global market was 13 per cent. 
The breakdown by region was: Asia-Pacific 191 billion; Americas 143 billion; Western Europe 135 billion; 
and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa 236 billion.

Illicit trade 
Cigarettes are among the most 
commonly traded products on the  
black market due to high profit margins, 
the relative ease of production and 
movement, along with low detection 
rates and penalties. It is a widespread 
problem that is made worse by 
regulatory policies in some countries. 
Estimates suggest that up to 660 billion 
illegal cigarettes are smoked every year. 
This has a negative impact on consumers, 
retailers, governments and tobacco 
companies. For consumers, counterfeit 
cigarettes mean no quality controls and 
no health warnings, while smuggled 
genuine products may carry health 
warnings that do not meet local 
government regulations. 
As illegal cigarette sales are effectively 
unregulated, criminals also have no 
qualms with providing anyone with their 
products, including underage smokers. 
It is estimated that governments 
worldwide are losing up to US$40 billion 
a year in excise and other taxes. Tackling 
this illegal trade effectively requires 
cooperation between the industry, 
regulators and enforcement authorities, 
backed up by the establishment of 
appropriate tax policies, strong 
regulation and effective enforcement. 
Increasing regulation 
Much of the tobacco regulation being 
proposed and introduced around the 
world is driven by the World Health 
Organisation’s Framework Convention 
on Tobacco Control (FCTC) protocol. 
However, most of these measures are not 
based on strong evidence that they are 
likely to reduce smoking. Indeed, small 
declines in legitimate companies’ tobacco 
volumes in recent years have been largely 
offset by the increase in illicit trade.  
Extreme regulation often has unintended 
consequences. For example, legislation  
to introduce plain packaging for tobacco 
products in Australia could damage  
the livelihoods of small retailers and  
make criminals’ lives easier. Counterfeit 
products could become easier to produce 
and non-compliant branded illicit 
products could become more attractive 
to consumers. Other measures, such as 
retail display bans and sudden increases 
in excise rates, can distort competition 
among tobacco companies and, in some 
cases, may result in consumers switching 
to cheaper illicit products. 
Overall, demand for tobacco products 
tends to remain fairly stable in the face of 
price rises. Further marketing restrictions, 
combined with existing brand loyalty, 
mean that major changes to the 
competitive landscape in the tobacco 
industry are unlikely for some time.

Deloitte report 
In 2011, British American Tobacco 
commissioned a report by Deloitte to 
examine the intended and unintended 
impacts of packaging regulation. The 
report assessed 27 countries covering 
a period of 14 years and is one of the 
most comprehensive independent 
studies on tobacco packaging 
regulation to date.  
We commissioned the report in the 
absence of any comprehensive global 
studies on the impacts of tobacco 
packaging and we hope governments 
will study it and find it a useful 
contribution to the debate. 
The report revealed that neither 
increasing the size of health warnings 
on packs nor introducing graphic 
images had directly reduced tobacco 
consumption. It also recognised that 
the plainer the pack, the easier it is 
to counterfeit.

Illegal cigarettes – who’s 
paying the price? 
British American Tobacco produced a 
short film in 2011 called ‘This is the 
man’ and made it available on its 
corporate website and via YouTube. 
The film illustrates how the black 
market in tobacco products is 
increasingly dominated by organised 
crime. Law enforcers say some gangs 
are also behind people trafficking, 
prostitution, gun and drug crime. 
They may even have terrorist links. 
Some regulatory policies could see  
an increase in illicit trade, so this  
film asks: Illegal cigarettes – who’s 
paying the price?  10

Our business model  
Our business model is designed to deliver sustainable 
growth in earnings. It is consumer-led and science-based.
How our business works Building sustainable value
Consumers
Our success depends on really understanding the different profiles 
and preferences of our consumers. We invest in gathering 
comprehensive insights into smokers’ preferences and buying 
behaviour. This drives our marketing and allows us to promote  
our products to adult tobacco consumers in ways that satisfy  
their preferences, while responding to stakeholder expectations 
about how we should market our products. 
Science-based R&D 
For over 50 years, we have had an extensive scientific research 
programme. More recently, we have been focusing research on 
modified cigarettes and low-toxicant smokeless tobacco products. 
We are committed to helping develop the scientific and regulatory 
framework we need to deliver a varied portfolio of products in the 
future, including alternative regulatory-approved nicotine products, 
to meet the evolving needs of adult smokers. 
Sourcing
We have a significant interest in tobacco growing and we work directly 
with around 70 per cent of the farmers who supply our leaf. We 
manage our whole supply chain responsibly and work with our 
suppliers to create a shared understanding of our social, environmental 
and economic impacts. This enables us and our suppliers to 
manage risks better, while ensuring that we are agile and flexible,  
so that we can use our resources as effectively as possible. 
Brands
We have a successful brand marketing strategy based on innovation, 
responsibility and consumer choice. We recognise that our business 
starts with our consumers and our brand portfolio is designed to 
meet key consumer needs, especially in our strategic consumer 
segments. Our four Global Drive Brands – Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike 
and Pall Mall – and our other international brands account for more 
than 50 per cent of our total cigarette volumes. 
Production
Manufacturing tobacco products is a large-scale operation and we 
have factories all over the world. We work to ensure that our costs 
are globally competitive and that we use our resources as effectively 
as possible. Our companies have closed or downsized some factories 
and consolidated production elsewhere in recent years. These 
changes enable us to rationalise our machinery and technology  
to establish a more cost-effective operational base for the future. 
Innovative products
We make significant investment in our brands and the development 
of superior, differentiated products to drive growth. Our product and 
packaging innovations, such as Convertibles and Reloc, vary across 
our brands, brand variants and markets and our approach enables 
our companies to adapt their offers flexibly to local preferences.  
Our focus when designing these innovations is on relevance  
to the consumer and potential speed to market. 
Worldwide presence 
Our international reach and well-developed distribution channels  
are critical enablers of our growth strategy, allowing us to roll out 
innovations on a global scale. We continuously review our route  
to market to ensure we remain competitive. This includes our 
relationships with wholesalers, distributors and logistics providers,  
as well as our direct to store sales operation, which is often the most 
effective way of serving retailers and building business partnerships. 
Our people
We employ more than 56,000 people worldwide – from securing 
our leaf supply through production and distribution to our efforts  
to develop reduced-risk products. Our workforce is strongly  
multi-cultural and we have a devolved structure, with each local 
company having responsibility for its operations. We value our 
employees’ talents and diverse perspectives and recognise their 
critical role in achieving the goals we set for our business. 12

Strategic review 
Our strategy
in action 
Our consistent strategy for delivering our vision  
is based on growth, funded by productivity and  
delivered by a winning organisation that acts  
responsibly at all times.  
We continued to achieve sustainable, 
profitable growth in 2011, driven by a 
better deployment of innovations and an 
emphasis on improving the execution of 
our strategy.  
Our Global Drive Brands (GDBs) and 
other international brands continued  
to contribute strongly to our business 
performance. Our balanced portfolio, 
deployed across a wide range of markets 
and segments and driven by innovation, 
continues to provide a successful formula 
for growth.  
In October we completed our acquisition of 
Productora Tabacalera de Colombia, S.A.S. 
(Protabaco) for an enterprise value of 
US$461 million, subject to final agreement. 
Colombia is Latin America’s fourth largest 
cigarette market and the acquisition 
elevates our subsidiary company’s market 
share to almost 50 per cent.  
Strong growth driven
by GDBs 
Overall GDB volume grew by 9 per cent 
in 2011, driven by the expansion of GDBs 
into new markets and the roll-out of 
consumer-relevant innovations, particularly 
capsules. Since 2005, the GDB share of 
our global volumes has increased from 
18 per cent to 32 per cent. 
Kent performed very strongly in 2011 
across all regions. Global volume grew  
by 10 per cent to a record 67 billion 
cigarettes. This robust performance has 
been achieved through share gains in 
many key markets such as Russia, Ukraine 
and other eastern European markets. Kent 
also grew in Japan, Chile and Romania, as 
well as the Middle East and Vietnam.  
Kent Convertibles, the innovative range 
of capsule products launched in nine 
markets in 2010, was rolled out to a 
further 14 markets in 2011. Convertibles 
have played a key role in generating 
volume growth and reinforcing Kent’s 
status as a leader in innovation. 
Packaging improvements implemented 
across our core range strengthened the 
brand and resulted in share gains and 
Kent Nanotek continued to be the fastest 
growing range in the Kent portfolio.  
Lucky Strike delivered global volume 
growth of 14 per cent in 2011 –- a 
significant acceleration and a record  
for the brand. The results were evenly 
balanced between organic growth of 
the existing product range and new 
innovations. The continued global roll-
out of Click & Roll following its launch  
in 2010 more than doubled its annual 
volume, with record market share in 
Brazil, Argentina, France and Chile.  
In 2011, Lucky Strike also added a new 
dimension to the brand with the launch 
of an ‘all-natural’ offer. This has achieved 
segment leadership in Germany within 
one year, and is re-energising the brand’s 
growth in its largest markets. 
Growth  13
British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review
Dunhill, our most prestigious brand, 
delivered strong organic growth in 2011 
across most of our strategic markets, 
driven primarily by innovation. However, 
overall volume performance was 
negatively affected by share loss in South 
Korea due to competitive pricing. Overall, 
Dunhill volume including South Korea 
increased slightly in 2011, following  
18 per cent growth in 2010. Excluding 
South Korea growth was 8 per cent.  
Dunhill has driven premium innovation 
growth through Fine Cut Reloc, Capsule 
Reloc and Kingsize Reloc. Strong growth 
markets in 2011 included Brazil, the Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC), Malaysia, 
Romania, Taiwan, Nigeria, Indonesia, 
Egypt and Serbia. 
Pall Mall, our biggest value-for-money 
brand, delivered volume growth of  
11 per cent in 2011. This was driven 
mainly by significant share growth in 
Pakistan, as well as growth in Germany – 
where Pall Mall is the number one Adult 
Smokers Under 30 (ASU30) brand – 
Canada, Chile and Serbia.  
Local and international 
brands perform well 
Our other international brands include 
Vogue, Viceroy, Rothmans, Kool, Peter 
Stuyvesant, Benson & Hedges, State 
Express 555 and John Player Gold Leaf.  
In 2011 our international brands had 
good successes, such as Kool in Japan 
and Viceroy in Poland. Rothmans, our 
eighth largest brand, broke the 20 billion 
cigarette mark in 2011 with a strong 
performance in Egypt. 
Our international brands, including
our GDBs, accounted for 53 per cent  
of Group volume in 2011. 
Key local brands with high consumer 
loyalty such as Yava in Russia and Derby 
and Free in Brazil continue to play an 
important role in our brand strategy, as 
they help us maintain a broad portfolio.  
Trade marketing and 
distribution
Our Trade Marketing & Distribution 
(TM&D) teams are responsible for the 
selling and delivery of our products to 
retail outlets, the presence of our brands 
at the point of sale and the development 
of mutually beneficial partnerships with 
our retail customers. This includes 
engagement in the prevention of  
youth smoking and illicit trade.  
Our people 
To successfully support our brands and 
innovations in a fast-paced and rapidly 
changing environment, a new ambitious 
programme to train and develop our 
people has been piloted and is being 
rolled out globally. The programme 
provides our people with a competitive 
edge and ensures we continue to meet 
the demands of retailers and consumers. 
Route to market 
Our route to market is critical and allows 
us to roll out innovations faster on a 
global scale as well as to fully meet 
consumer demand at the point of sale.  
Where appropriate, we believe that  
direct to store sales (DSS) are an effective 
way of serving retailers and building 
sustainable business partnerships. DSS 
gives us visibility and control over the 
sales and distribution process, allowing 
us access to both the market and 
consumer information. It also provides  
a direct commercial link to our most 
strategic retail accounts. Half of our 
global volume is sold to retailers through 
our own distribution capability in key 
markets including Canada, Brazil,  
South Korea, Australia, Russia,  
Romania, South Africa and Nigeria.  
In other markets, we work with third 
parties to ensure our products are 
effectively sold and delivered to retailers.  
Customer management 
Building partnerships with retailers is a 
key part of our trade marketing activities. 
We work closely with our retail partners 
to provide support and ensure that at all 
times they can profitably meet the 
expectations of adult smokers with 
regards to availability, pricing and brand 
quality. This includes the development of 
effective trading terms, which are a key 
foundation of a successful partnership. 
In 2011, we further developed joint 
programmes with our global retail 
partners in order to better reach adult 
smokers in key channels such as global 
travel retail and convenience. 
Reloc is Dunhill’s exclusive range of 
packs that deliver the best tobacco at 
optimal freshness. 
We sold over 9 billion 
capsule cigarettes in 
2011, mainly through 
Kent Convertibles, 
Kool Boost, Lucky 
Strike Click & Roll  
and Dunhill Switch.  14

Productivity continues to be an important 
part of our strategy, providing the 
capabilities and resources we need to 
support investment in our brands to 
grow share in our key markets.  
Our globally-integrated supply chain is 
evolving as efficiency and effectiveness 
improves, and we are focused on making 
our operations flexible, agile and truly 
consumer-centric. A supply chain with 
the scale we enjoy must also be capable 
of responding rapidly to changes and 
have the ability to roll out innovative 
products better than competitors.  
This is a key aspect of our Group strategy 
and we will continue to leverage our 
supply chain to further support the 
growth of the business. 
Productivity savings 
Cost management is a focus across the 
business, as is improving our marketing 
efficiency and capital effectiveness.  
This includes reducing unnecessary 
complexity to save costs, and utilising  
our cash and assets more effectively. 
Productivity savings from the supply 
chain, including indirect material 
procurement and overhead savings, 
helped improve our operating margin 
by 230 basis points in 2011. We are 
confident that we can continue to deliver 
efficiencies for the foreseeable future and 
hit growth in operating margin of 50-100 
basis points per annum.  
Optimising resource 
allocation
Our integrated supply chain continues  
to help deliver growth. Innovations were 
successfully rolled out in a number of 
markets across the globe, with notable 
successes such as Convertibles.  
Transparency of demand and supply at a 
global level through sales and operations 
planning continues to improve results. 
Engagement, system and process 
improvements are delivering better  
and faster decision making and  
resource allocation. 
As a result, in 2011 we were able to 
continue to optimise our manufacturing 
footprint. Over the last 10 years we have 
reduced the number of cigarette factories 
from 87 to 46 including acquisitions. In 
2011, we stopped manufacturing at 
Cirebon in Indonesia and announced the 
future closure of our Bremen factory in 
Germany and the downsizing of others.  
Consolidation of factories around the 
Group continues to be undertaken 
responsibly and with care for affected 
employees and local communities.  
Our key factories now generally  
serve multiple portfolios and markets, 
managed through our above-market 
planning capability.  
This has also allowed us to roll out 
innovations faster and implement machine 
technology standards – improving our 
sourcing flexibility, contingency planning 
and capital effectiveness. 
Procurement joint venture 
Our procurement joint venture with other 
multi-national companies continues to 
exceed expectations as it leverages scale 
and builds expertise in indirect spend.  
We expect further benefits as we expand 
its geographic reach and include  
new categories. 
Leaf supply chain 
Our leaf supply chain is the most 
vertically integrated in the industry  
and continues to provide a competitive 
advantage. Through our proven expertise 
in leaf we are in a strong position to 
address new consumer needs and the 
effects of product-based regulation. 
Our leaf footprint ensures sustainability  
of supply and guarantees access to quality 
sources of leaf; it also gives us the ability 
to manage short-term variations in 
pricing driven by external commodity 
pricing pressures. 
Business continuity
Managing risk and having in place 
contingency sourcing plans continue  
to be a key part of our philosophy. The 
strength of our above-market operating 
model was again tested in 2011 with  
the unfortunate events in Japan, but we 
successfully satisfied consumer demand.

We can only maintain a strong workforce 
if we nurture and develop our people. 
We value our employees’ diverse 
perspectives and encourage them  
to perform to their best. 
Training and development 
A range of training programmes was 
rolled out to all of our companies in 2011 
when we launched a new online training 
and development system. This provides 
our people with access to a suite of  
e-learning applications and gives our 
companies a clearer view of the training 
and capability gaps in their operations.  
Recruitment 
Ensuring clear succession plans are in 
place for every senior role remains our 
long-term objective. We continue to 
build robust succession plans at all levels 
and aim to recruit individuals who will 
help strengthen our core capabilities  
and our culture.  
Diversity and equality 
We are dedicated to providing equal 
opportunities to each employee. We do 
not discriminate when making decisions 
on hiring, promotion or retirement on 
the grounds of race, colour, gender, age, 
social class, religion, smoking habits, 
sexual orientation, politics or disability – 
subject to the inherent requirements  
of the role to be performed.  
We are committed to providing training 
and development for people with 
disabilities, tailored where appropriate.  
If a British American Tobacco employee 
becomes disabled while in our 
employment, we will do our best to 
retain them and make appropriate 
adjustments and provisions.  
Our focus on diversity includes having 
greater representation across our senior 
management from both genders and 
across different geographic regions. 
We continue to support the career 
development of our female managers, 
with the aim of increasing the 
proportion of women in senior 
management roles. This includes 
drawing up development plans for our 
senior women and monitoring progress 
against them, assigning mentors and 
encouraging recruitment consultancies  
to draw up gender-balanced candidate 
shortlists when we recruit externally. 
Employee engagement  
British American Tobacco is committed to 
employee engagement throughout the 
business and this includes acting on areas 
identified as needing improvement in our 
employee survey.  
Employees are kept well informed of the 
strategy, performance and objectives of 
the Group through communication 
cascades at key points in the year, which 
involve video broadcasts from the Chief 
Executive, face-to-face presentations and 
Q&A discussions. Global, regional and 
local intranets, web-based meetings and 
presentations, and electronic employee 
magazines also provide important 
information, while feedback is encouraged 
through open forums and Q&A sessions.  
Our Sharesave Scheme, our Partnership 
Share Scheme and our Share Reward 
Scheme are open to all UK employees.  
Employee opinion survey 
Our ‘Your Voice’ employee opinion 
survey is conducted every two years and 
benchmarks our performance against a 
comparator group of Fast Moving 
Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies. 
Our most recent survey was conducted  
in 2010, with 90 per cent of employees 
participating. 
In all 11 categories, employee opinion  
of British American Tobacco was more 
positive than the benchmark for businesses 
in the FMCG sector. We either maintained 
or improved on our 2008 scores in eight 
of the 11 categories.

Responsibility is integral to everything we 
do and is especially important to a business 
such as ours where our products pose real 
risks to health. Our determination to act 
responsibly spans the whole business, from 
our commitment to addressing the issues of 
child labour and working with farmers, to 
looking at how we can help to reduce the 
harm from our products and lessen our 
environmental impact. 
Our Business Principles and our Standards 
of Business Conduct set out what we 
require of our companies and our 
employees in terms of responsible 
corporate behaviour and personal integrity.  
We also support regulation that 
maintains a balance between consumer 
preferences and the interests of society, 
while also enabling our business to 
continue to compete commercially. 
Harm reduction 
As a manufacturer of tobacco products  
we have a responsibility to pursue ways in 
which we might help to reduce the health 
risks of our products. For more information 
on our approach to harm reduction, see 
page 19. 
In 2011, we made progress in our work on 
developing laboratory models of disease 
and we also set up a new research group, 
Predictive and Experimental Toxicology. 
This group is focused on developing the 
science that will enable us to evaluate 
which smoke toxicants are the most 
significant in the development of  
various smoking-related diseases. 
We made good progress this year in 
increasing our understanding of how  
and where smoke particles are deposited  
in the respiratory system. We have also 
reinvigorated our biotechnology research. 
We believe tobacco product regulation 
should be underpinned by sound 
scientific evidence and developed 
through transparent and accountable 
consultation with all relevant 
stakeholders. As such, in 2011 our Chief 
Scientific Officer sat on the expert panel 
of a workshop held by the US Food and 
Drug Administration on developing 
scientific standards for the evaluation  
of modified risk tobacco products.  
Research & development 
Our Group Research & Development 
(R&D) activities are concentrated on  
our harm reduction efforts but also 
encompass the exploration of new 
products and innovative technologies. 
Group R&D also provides guidance  
on the use of ingredients to ensure  
our products comply with national 
legislative requirements and our  
own Group standards.  
Our principal R&D facilities are located in 
Southampton and Cambridge in the UK 
and at Cachoeirinha in Brazil. In 2011, 
investment in Group R&D, including 
Marketing Futures and Nicoventures,  
was £166 million, compared to  
£164 million in 2010. 
Responsible marketing 
We apply a consistently responsible 
approach to marketing across the Group 
by requiring our companies to follow our 
International Marketing Standards (IMS) 
wherever local law is less stringent. Our 
IMS state that our marketing should be 
targeted at adult tobacco consumers  
and not undermine their understanding 
of the health risks.  
Our companies’ adherence to IMS is 
monitored through self-assessments and 
internal company audits. We have now 
introduced additional IMS-specific audits in 
selected markets. In 2011, 21 incidents of 
non-adherence were identified, but we 
believe these to be isolated incidents and 
actions have been taken to address them. 
In Indonesia, we are engaging with  
the Indonesian Government on 
implementing stricter regulations to 
ensure a level playing field and hope  
to bring about an industry consensus.

Environmental performance 
We monitor and reduce our direct impact 
on the environment by making our 
operations more efficient. We also address 
our indirect effects by choosing suppliers 
with strong environmental credentials and 
encouraging our existing suppliers to 
improve their environmental performance. 
We have set targets for our key 
environmental issues, including energy 
consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, 
water use and waste and we met these in 
2011 (see page 25). 
In 2011, we began work to develop new 
targets for our energy, water and waste 
measures, as well as five-year milestones 
to monitor progress towards our 2030 
and 2050 carbon dioxide equivalent 
(CO 2e) targets.  
Agronomy support 
We have around 1,000 leaf managers  
and technicians worldwide who provide 
agronomy support to all our directly 
contracted tobacco farmers. They also 
engage with farming communities in all 
of our tobacco growing locations. Our 
global agronomy centre is at the heart  
of this engagement. 
Working with our contracted farmers in 
this way helps make their farms viable 
and efficient, which protects the security 
and quality of our tobacco leaf supply. 
Our agronomy support covers all areas  
of agricultural practice, not just tobacco 
farming, so it also helps farmers improve 
the quality and yields of food crops, 
making them more self-sufficient. 
Tackling child labour 
Child labour is an important human rights 
issue for any industry with an agricultural 
supply chain and the tobacco industry is 
no exception. We have had a Group-wide 
Child Labour Policy since 2000, and it is  
a key element of our Social Responsibility 
in Tobacco Production (SRTP) programme. 
We were also one of the founding 
members of the Eliminating Child Labour 
in Tobacco Growing (ECLT) Foundation 
in 2001. We continue to play an active 
role in the ECLT Foundation along with 
others in the industry, trades unions and 
the International Labour Organisation.

states our aim to embed biodiversity 
conservation across our business.  
Since 2001, we have worked with three 
NGOs in the British American Tobacco 
Biodiversity Partnership: Fauna & Flora 
International, the Tropical Biology 
Association and Earthwatch Institute.  
The Partnership seeks to address some  
of the challenging issues surrounding  
the conservation and management of 
biodiversity within agricultural landscapes 
and the ecosystems on which we depend. 
External recognition 
We have built a strong reputation for 
sustainability and are recognised as 
leaders in our industry. 
In 2011, we were included in both the 
Dow Jones Sustainability World Index 
(DJSI World) and the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Europe Index (DJSI Europe) 
and we also received a gold rating in the 
2011 Business in the Community 
Corporate Responsibility Index. 
Corporate social 
investment
Our corporate social investment (CSI) 
activities include a range of community 
and charitable projects, centred on 
empowerment (giving people training, 
education and opportunities to help 
them develop), civic life (activities that 
aim to enrich public and community life) 
and sustainable agriculture and environment 
(contributions to local agriculture).  
Our global CSI expenditure in 2011 was 
£13.7 million (2010: £15.4 million) as 
defined by the statutory reporting criteria 
for charitable donations.  
Work environment 
We are committed to providing a  
safe working environment for all our 
employees and contractors, and have  
a Group goal of zero accidents.  
There were 37 serious injuries in  
2011, involving 18 employees and 19 
contractors in 21 countries. Seven were 
fatalities (one employee and six 
contractors), compared to four in 2010 
(three employees and one contractor). 
Four were the result of assaults, two  
were from falls from heights and one  
was the result of a road traffic accident. 
We greatly regret this loss of life and  
have made changes to try to make sure 
accidents like these do not happen again. 
We monitor our Lost Workday Case 
Incident Rate (LWCIR), along with the 
number of serious injuries and fatalities 
for both employees and contractors.  
The Group’s LWCIR in 2011 was 0.26,  
a decrease from the 2010 rate of 0.27. 
Our total number of lost workday cases 
also decreased, from 212 in 2010 to  
204 in 2011.  
In 2011, we implemented our plan to 
reduce vehicle-related injuries in our 
Trade Marketing & Distribution teams. 
Already, we have seen positive results, 
with an 18 per cent reduction in the 
teams’ vehicle-related lost workday cases 
and a reduction in fatalities compared to 
2010. Group-wide vehicle-related 
accidents decreased by nearly 19 per cent 
compared to 2010. Following targeted 
initiatives to address manual handling 
accidents, lost workday cases in this area 
reduced by 53 per cent for the Group.  19

Our sustainability goals
Sustainable business practice is at the heart of the Group’s responsibility strategy. By addressing our social, environmental  
and economic impacts, we build value for the business, for our shareholders and for other stakeholders. 
Our sustainability agenda comprises five goals covering harm reduction, marketplace,  
environment, supply chain and people and culture. You can read about all our 
long-term goals and our work in 2011 in these areas in our Sustainability Report 
2011 online at www.bat.com/sustainability.  
Included on the following pages is a brief summary of how we are trying  
to meet our sustainability goals and achieve a sustainable future through:  
 working towards reducing the risks from our products;  
 supporting regulation based on sound evidence;  
 marketing our products responsibly;  
 promoting sustainable agriculture; 
 investing in our people; and 
 working with others.  
Harm reduction 
Our long-term harm reduction goal:  
We will strive to bring commercially viable, consumer
acceptable reduced-risk products to market.
27
Scientific papers submitted for 
publication in peer-reviewed
journals in 2011 
The greatest negative impacts from our business are the real 
and serious health risks of tobacco products. So developing 
reduced-risk products for those adults who use tobacco is  
a priority. There are many challenges in this: the science is 
complex; collaboration is needed between scientists, tobacco 
companies and regulators; products need to meet consumer 
expectations; and we need a regulatory framework that 
supports tobacco harm reduction. We are committed to 
meeting these challenges.  
We are working on three broad product categories:  
reduced-toxicant combustible tobacco products;  
low-toxicant smokeless tobacco products; and alternative 
regulatory-approved nicotine products.  
How we are preparing for the future  
 Identifying which smoke toxicants pose the greatest health 
risks and inventing new technologies to reduce them. 
 Developing a framework of scientific tests to evaluate the 
likely health impacts of potentially reduced-risk products. 
 Engaging with regulators, scientists and the public health 
community to develop the frameworks needed  
to bring them to market. 
 Nicoventures is exploring the development of and 
commercialisation of regulatory-approved nicotine products.   20

Marketplace 
Our long-term marketplace goal:  
We will take a lead in upholding high standards  
of corporate conduct within our marketplace.
73%
Of our companies run youth 
smoking prevention programmes 
Our aim is to grow our market share but we do this responsibly
through innovative products and packaging. We believe that 
regulation should be shaped in collaboration with all stakeholders, 
including the tobacco industry. With our industry experience  
and expertise, we can be part of developing regulatory solutions. 
The illegal tobacco trade is a widespread problem, made worse 
by ill-considered regulatory policies and particularly by large  
and sudden increases in excise tax that destabilise the market. 
The perpetrators of this trade are criminals, often gangs that  
also traffic drugs, arms and people, and may have ties to 
terrorist organisations. 
How we are preparing for the future  
 Sharing objective evidence to help contribute to the policy 
debate on regulation, as well as supporting regulation for  
the development and sale of reduced-risk products. 
 Updating and strengthening adherence to our International 
Marketing Standards. 
 Collaborating with governments and enforcement 
authorities to help address the illegal tobacco trade and 
working with our competitors to develop new technologies 
to stop the unauthorised sale, re-sale or smuggling of 
tobacco products.  
Environment  
Our long-term environment goal:  
We will actively address the impacts of our business  
on the natural environment.
-7.5%
Energy use per million cigarettes 
equivalent compared to 2010 
Addressing the immediate impacts of our business on the 
environment as well as the likely future pressures involves risk 
assessments, performance management and investment in 
efficient technologies. Environmental problems cannot be solved 
by one company acting alone. They also need flexibility  
– what works in one part of the world might not in another.  
The success of our business now and in the future depends on 
biodiversity. Biodiversity provides resources like clean water, 
healthy soils and timber. Business can have a negative impact  
on biodiversity, as species and communities also depend on 
these resources. 
How we are preparing for the future  
 Using risk assessments and stakeholder dialogue to guide 
our approach to climate change. 
 Developing strategies to reduce our impacts, focusing  
on water, energy and biodiversity. 
 Using biodiversity risk and opportunity assessments to  
guide our approach to sustainable agriculture. 
 Working with external stakeholders on areas of common 
interest, such as the members of our Biodiversity Partnership.  21

Supply chain 
Our long-term supply chain goal:  
We will work for positive social, environmental  
and economic impacts in our supply chain.
443,480
Tonnes of tobacco leaf purchased 
by our companies in 2011 
Our supply chain sustainability strategy covers our own planning, 
manufacturing, logistics and trade marketing operations, but  
the most significant part of it relates to tobacco growing. This is 
where our greatest environmental impact is but where we have 
influence, rather than direct control. 
We believe effective regulation in this area must cover all 
agriculture, not just tobacco. We also believe we have an 
important part to play in developing sustainable agriculture 
solutions, thanks to our experience and our relationships  
with over 140,000 contracted farmers in 19 countries. 
How we are preparing for the future  
 Protecting the long-term security of our tobacco leaf  
supply by encouraging sustainable agriculture, involving 
multi-stakeholder partnerships. 
 Working to help build an objective evidence base on the 
impact of tobacco growing compared to other crops. 
 Listening to our Supply Chain Sustainability Stakeholder 
Panel’s guidance and challenge on our supply chain 
sustainability issues. 
 Reducing the environmental impact of our own operations 
and encouraging our suppliers to reduce theirs. 
 Using our supply chain programmes and partnership 
projects with suppliers and third parties to protect the 
human rights of our suppliers, contracted farmers and  
local communities. 
People and culture 
Our long-term people and culture goal: 
We will work to ensure we have the right people  
and culture to meet our goals.
64
Nationalities represented by 
people working at our global 
headquarters in the UK 
To achieve the goals we set for our business we need a strong 
workforce – from securing our supply of tobacco leaf to developing 
reduced-risk products. We can only strengthen our culture and 
build competitive advantage if we continue to focus on driving 
high performance, encourage greater productivity and build  
on the excellence of our talent. 
Diversity helps us to understand our stakeholders and to meet 
their needs. It takes many forms: gender is one aspect, but it is 
also important to consider nationality and background. We have 
a number of initiatives to improve gender diversity at senior 
management levels and we are committed to improving the 
representation of all nationalities among our senior leaders at 
our headquarters and in our companies worldwide. 
How we are preparing for the future  
 Continuing to build robust succession plans. 
 Establishing clear principles and simple, effective tools  
to manage performance. 
 Embracing the diversity of our workforce to encourage 
creativity and innovation. 
 Improving our approach to the health, wellbeing and  
safety of our people. 
 Streamlining our global practices and eliminating duplication. 
 Strengthening our core capabilities, our values and our culture.  22

Total shareholder return – 
annual % 
The Group’s strategy is to focus on 
increasing shareholder value, which is 
measured using Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) compared to the FTSE 100 Index 
and also to the Fast Moving Consumer 
Goods (FMCG) peer group. The FMCG 
comparator group is reviewed annually 
to ensure that it remains both relevant 
and representative. 
TSR is measured according to the return 
index calculated by Datastream, on the 
basis of all companies’ dividends being 
reinvested in their shares. The return is 
the percentage increase in each company’s 
index over a three year period. 
Earnings per share 
This is our adjusted diluted EPS –  
the detail of the calculation and the 
adjustments made are explained in  
note 7 to the financial statements.

Shareholder value 
We have a wide  
range of measures  
and indicators by  
which the Board 
assesses performance. 
To ensure 
management’s focus is 
aligned with  
the interest of our 
shareholders, our  
KPIs are reflected in our 
management incentive 
schemes. Although our 
other business measures 
are not directly included 
in these incentives, we 
believe they improve 
the quality of our 
business and contribute 
to shareholder value, 
particularly over  
the long term.

Group’s share of key 
subsidiary markets 
This is our retail market share in the 
Group’s Top 40 markets which cover 
around 80 per cent of the volumes of 
subsidiaries. The information used in this 
calculation is based on publicly available 
information and internal company analysis.  
We reduced our measures used in the 
assessment of our performance related 
bonus scheme from six to four in 2011, 
following shareholder consultation in  
late 2010 and in early 2011. While we 
continue to measure both ‘net revenue’ 
and ‘overheads and productivity  
savings’, we no longer include  
these as KPIs in that assessment. 
Using just the four KPIs of ‘Group’s share 
of key subsidiary markets’, ‘Global Drive 
Brand volumes’, ‘adjusted profit from 
operations’ and ‘cash flow from 
operations’ provides a simplified, 
straightforward and transparent set  
of measures. These KPIs still allow 
the Company to assess the vitality, 
sustainability and performance of the 
business while providing clarity for both 
shareholders and scheme participants 
about the required areas of performance.   
Global Drive Brand  
(GDB) volumes 
GDB volumes are calculated as the total 
volumes of the four GDBs – Dunhill, 
Kent, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall – sold  
by our subsidiaries. 
Share growth in key 
segments
This is our overall share of volume in

A specific target is set each year for 
the cash flow from operations. The 
target for 2011 was exceeded. 
Our target is to increase operating 
margin by 50-100 basis points per 
annum. 
Our target is to maintain the 
percentage figure in the mid-80s. 
Our target is to achieve more positive 
scores than the other Fast Moving 
Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies 
in our comparator benchmark group 
in all areas. In 2010, scores in all 
categories were more positive than 
the FMCG benchmark, and we either 
maintained or improved on our 2008 
score in eight of the 11 categories. 
Our global aim is to have an LWCIR of 
not more than 0.2 by the end of 2012.

Chief Operating Officer 
Chief Operating Officer’s review 
A strong Group 
performance 
Against the backdrop of global financial 
uncertainty, generally lower disposable 
incomes and political upheaval in some 
parts of the world, the Group delivered a 
strong performance in 2011, achieving all 
the goals set as part of its long-term 
strategy. Reported revenue grew by over 
3 per cent as a result of continued good 
pricing momentum and stable volumes. 
At constant rates of exchange, revenue 
was up 4 per cent, while on an organic 
basis at constant rates of exchange, it 
increased by 7 per cent.  
The reported profit from operations was 
9 per cent higher at £4,721 million with 
an 11 per cent increase in adjusted profit 
from operations, as explained on page 
34. At constant rates of exchange, the 
adjusted profit increase was 10 per cent. 
All the regions contributed to this good 
profit result. Organic adjusted Group 
profit from operations, at constant  
rates of exchange, also increased by  
10 per cent. 
Group volumes from subsidiaries were 
705 billion, down by 3 billion or 0.4 per 
cent. Organic volumes were also 0.4 per 
cent lower. The Group again grew overall 
market share in its Top 40 markets. 
The four Global Drive Brands achieved 
excellent overall volume growth of 9 per 
cent following the successful launches of 
innovations, resulting in the continued 
improvement in market share. Dunhill 
volumes increased slightly as strong 
growth in Brazil, Romania and the GCC, 
and good performances by Malaysia and 
Russia, were offset by a decline in South 
Korea which was affected by competitor 
pricing. Excluding the volumes in South 
Korea, Dunhill volumes were up 8 per 
cent. Kent was 10 per cent higher with 
increased volumes in Romania, Ukraine, 
Russia, Egypt and Japan. 
Lucky Strike increased volumes by  
14 per cent with growth in Spain, 
Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Chile  
and Brazil. Pall Mall volumes rose by  
11 per cent with strong growth in 
Pakistan, Turkey, Russia and Canada, 
partially offset by lower volumes in 
Mexico and Spain. 
The Group announced at the end of  
2010 that as part of the plans to reduce 
complexity, drive efficiency in 
management structures and achieve a 
better balance in the scale of our regions, 
it had decided to reduce the management 
structure from five to four regions from  
1 January 2011. Markets which 
comprised the Eastern Europe region, 
were merged into the Africa and Middle 
East region and the Western Europe 
region. Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, 
Caucasus and Central Asia form part of 
the new Eastern Europe, Middle East and 
Africa region (EEMEA), while Romania, 
Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania 
and Kosovo form part of the Western 
Europe region. The 2010 information has 
been reallocated on the basis of the new 
regional structure.

Regional review 
David Fell 
Director, Asia-Pacific 
Asia-Pacific
Profit was up £207 million to £1,539 million 
as a result of strong performances in 
Japan, Bangladesh and Taiwan and 
favourable exchange rates in Australia, 
Japan and New Zealand. At constant  
rates of exchange, profit increased by 
£148 million or 11 per cent. Volumes  
at 191 billion were up 2 per cent, with 
increases in Japan, Pakistan and Indonesia 
partially offset by lower volumes in South 
Korea, Australia and New Zealand. 
In Australia, the steep excise increase 
during 2010 impacted industry volumes. 
Profit was up as a result of cost saving 
initiatives, favourable exchange movements 
and higher pricing, partially offset by 
additional costs associated with the 
campaign against plain packaging. 
Market share was slightly lower although 
Pall Mall performed well. In New Zealand, 
volumes decreased following an ad-hoc 
excise increase in January 2011. Profit 
was lower as pricing and favourable 
exchange rate movements were more 
than offset by lower volumes.
Market share grew in Malaysia, driven by 
the strong performances of Dunhill and 
Peter Stuyvesant, although total industry 
volumes were lower following the excise- 
led price increases in 2010. Profit was 
higher, mainly as a result of exchange 
rate movements. 
In Japan, industry volumes were down 
sharply following a significant excise 
increase in October 2010. However, as  
a result of the disruption to domestic 
production following the tragic events in 
March 2011, the Group delivered an 
exceptionally strong growth in profit and 
volumes for the year, with underlying 
market share higher. 
In Vietnam, volumes and market share 
grew but profit was adversely impacted 
by high inflation and an exchange rate 
devaluation, partially offset by higher 
pricing and cost saving initiatives. 
Profit in South Korea was impacted  
by competitor pricing and significant 
marketing investment, following a price 
increase by the Group’s business at the 
end of April 2011, the first in the industry 
in over six years. Lower volumes also led 
to a reduction in market share.  
In Taiwan, significant profit growth was 
driven by higher volumes and improved 
industry pricing. Good performances by 
Dunhill and Pall Mall achieved higher 
market share.  
Volume growth in Pakistan led to a 
strong increase in market share as Pall 
Mall performed well, more than doubling 
its volumes. Profit was stable, adversely 
impacted by higher special excise duties, 
high inflation and severe price competition 
in the low-priced segment. In Bangladesh, 
both market share and volumes grew due 
to the strong performance of Benson & 
Hedges. Profit increased as a result of 
higher volumes, price increases and  
tight control of costs.  
Profit grew in Indonesia following higher 
volumes, price increases and synergies 
resulting from the integration of the 
business units during 2010 which were 
partially offset by higher clove prices and 
marketing investment. Market share was 
marginally lower as the growth of the 
mild kretek brands was more than offset 
by the rationalisation of the brand portfolio.

Americas
Profit rose by £59 million to £1,441 
million, mainly attributable to a strong 
performance from Brazil, Venezuela and 
Mexico and an improved product mix 
across the region. At constant rates of 
exchange, profit rose by £58 million  
or 4 per cent. Volumes were down  
4 per cent at 143 billion, mainly as a 
result of decreases in Mexico, Brazil,  
Chile and Venezuela.  
In Brazil, strong profit growth was driven 
by an improved product mix and higher 
pricing. Market share and volumes were 
slightly lower due to the growth of local 
duty evaded product. However, volume, 
share in the premium segment and share 
compared to international competitors 
continued to grow as a result of the  
solid performances of Lucky Strike, 
Dunhill and Free. 
Industry volumes were lower in Canada as 
a result of increased illicit trade, with 
aggressive price competition in the low-
priced segment fuelling down-trading. 
These factors adversely impacted volumes, 
market share and profit, although du 
Maurier and Vogue maintained their  
share in the premium segment and  
John Player Standard remained the 
number one brand in Canada.  
In Mexico, industry volumes declined 
sharply as a result of excise-led price 
increases at the beginning of 2011, as 
well as increased purchases by the trade 
during December 2010 in anticipation  
of the price increase. Market share was 
marginally down on last year, while
profit was higher, benefiting from 
increased pricing and lower costs.  
In Argentina, market share was lower 
despite the growth of Lucky Strike  
and the successful launch of Dunhill. 
Marketing investment was higher  
with the launch of new brands and 
competitors’ pricing activities, impacting 
profitability. Lucky Strike performed well 
in Chile, and the very strong market share 
was maintained. Volumes were lower, 
following the steep excise-driven price 
increases, adversely impacting profit.  
Profit in Venezuela grew strongly as a 
result of higher pricing, partially offset  
by increased costs and lower volumes, 
although market share rose. Volumes 
were down due to industry declines  
and growth in illicit product. The Group 
acquired Protabaco, the second largest 
cigarette company in Colombia, on  
11 October 2011. Protabaco and British 
American Tobacco Colombia are 
operating from January 2012 as one 
entity with a market share of almost 
50 per cent.

Mark Cobben 
Director, Western Europe 
 Western Europe 
Profit in Western Europe increased by  
£125 million to £1,228 million, mainly as a 
result of strong performances in Germany, 
Switzerland, Italy, France and Romania, 
partially offset by declines in Spain, the 
Netherlands and Greece. At constant rates 
of exchange, profit increased by £101 
million or 9 per cent. Regional volumes 
were marginally lower at 135 billion as a 
result of declines in Germany, Switzerland, 
Italy, Greece and Spain, partially offset by 
an increase in Romania. 
In Italy, volumes and market share were 
slightly lower although the Global Drive 
Brands performed well. Good profit 
growth was the result of the improved 
product mix, price increases and lower 
costs, partially offset by the effect of the 
volume decline.
Profit increased in Germany as a result  
of higher pricing and lower costs. The 
higher organic market share was driven 
by excellent performances by Pall Mall 
and Lucky Strike although volumes 
decreased.  
In France, volumes were higher and market 
share increased which, together with 
improved pricing and lower product costs, 
led to an increase in profit. Lucky Strike and 
Vogue performed well.  
Market share in Spain was up strongly, 
driven by Pall Mall and Lucky Strike. 
Industry volumes were lower as a result 
of the tough economic conditions, 
unemployment and an excise-driven 
price increase at the end of 2010. 
Profit was impacted by a price war in the 
middle of the year and lower volumes. 
Profit in Switzerland grew strongly as  
a result of reduced costs and increased 
pricing. Volumes were lower but 
market share grew through the 
performance of Kent and Pall Mall. 
Volumes and profit in Belgium and the 
Netherlands were lower but market 
share increased in Belgium with Pall Mall 
and Lucky Strike performing well.  
In Romania, excellent increases in profit and 
volumes were achieved as the industry 
benefited from the significant reduction in 
the level of illicit trade following the strong 
action taken by the Government. Market 
share was higher, led by Dunhill, Kent  
and Vogue.  
In Poland, despite an industry volume 
decline, profit, volumes and market share 
increased with the growth of Viceroy and 
Vogue. Market share in Greece was 
higher and Peter Stuyvesant achieved 
leadership in the low-priced segment. 
The partial absorption of excise increases 
by the industry over the last two years 
contributed to a drop in profit. In the 
United Kingdom, Pall Mall performed 
well, resulting in market share growth, 
which, coupled with price increases,  
cost management and higher volumes, 
led to higher profit. 
Profit was maintained in Denmark where 
industry volumes were adversely affected 
by the impact of two significant excise-
driven price increases. Market share was 
recovering by the year end. In Sweden, 
profit improved as a result of lower costs, 
improved pricing and volumes. Market 
share was also higher.

Andrew Gray 
Director, Eastern Europe,  
Middle East and Africa 
Profit in the region increased by  
£144 million to £1,311 million. This was 
principally due to stable volumes and 
price increases, partly offset by the adverse 
impact of exchange rate movements.  
At constant rates of exchange, profit 
increased by £195 million or 17 per cent. 
Volumes at 236 billion were marginally 
higher than last year with the increases in 
Egypt, GCC and Nigeria partially offset by 
the decline in Turkey.  
In Russia, market share grew, driven by 
Kent, supported by Dunhill, Pall Mall and 
Vogue. Total volumes were in line with 
last year. Strong profit growth was the 
result of price increases, an improved 
product mix and lower costs. 
Market share in Ukraine was higher as 
volumes increased in a declining total 
market, resulting in an increase in profit. 
Volumes, profit and market share 
improved in Kazakhstan due to the 
strong performance of Pall Mall.  
In Turkey, the 2010 excise-driven 
contraction of the market continued  
with the government announcing an 
unexpected excise rise in October 2011, 
with a further increase from January 
2013. This, coupled with an increase in 
illicit trade, resulted in a steep drop in 
volumes. Market share declined as a 
result of competitor pricing activities. 
Kent and Pall Mall grew strongly and 
Lucky Strike was launched, partially 
offsetting the volume losses of tail 
brands. Profit reduced despite the 
improved product mix and significant 
savings initiatives. 
In the GCC markets, volumes and market 
share increased and profit grew strongly, 
mainly due to Dunhill’s excellent 
performance in all the markets. In Egypt, 
volumes and market share continued to 
grow strongly despite the political 
instability and a significant excise increase 
in June. Profit was impacted by the 
absorption by manufacturers of some of 
the excise increases of 2010 and 2011. 
Rothmans expanded its leadership position 
among our international brands.  
In Nigeria, volumes were up and market 
share continued to grow. Premium brands 
posted impressive rises with Dunhill, 
Benson & Hedges and Rothmans the main 
contributors. The improved product mix 
and higher volumes led to a strong increase 
in profit. Growth in market share was 
primarily driven by marketing investment. 
Improved government control saw a 
reduction in illicit trade. 
In South Africa, market share strengthened 
due to the good performance of the 
portfolio. There was a significant increase 
in the incidence of illicit trade and down-
trading to the low-priced segment. As a 
result, profit was in line with last year. 
The Group continued its investment in  
new markets, with the launch of Dunhill in 
Morocco after an import and distribution 
licence was approved, while it continued  
to build the business in Algeria.

Another year of 
strong returns 
 
Profit from operations  
The reported Group revenue at  
£15,399 million grew by 3 per cent  
and profit from operations at  
£4,721 million grew by 9 per cent.  
The growth in Group revenue, at 
constant rates of exchange, was  
up 4 per cent to £15,462 million. 
In order to better understand the 
underlying performance of the business, 
it is necessary to adjust for a number  
of items relating, for example, to 
restructuring costs and one-off charges 
and provisions. We call the underlying 
profit after adjusting for these items, 
adjusted profit. These adjustments  
are described further below.  
Adjusted profit from operations was 
£5,519 million, up 11 per cent from 
£4,984 million in 2010. Adjusted profit 
from operations translated at constant 
rates of exchange was up 10 per cent to 
£5,486 million.  
Organic growth  
A number of transactions impacted 
revenue and operating profit in 2011 and 
2010. The impact of these are removed in 
order to calculate organic growth.  
For 2011, revenue growth was slightly 
enhanced by the acquisition of 
Productora Tabacalera de Colombia, 
S.A.S. (Protabaco), which was completed 
on 11 October. The Group’s organic 
revenue growth was also affected by the 
sale of its Belgium distribution business, 
Lyfra NV; its withdrawal from distributing 
phone cards in Brazil and products in 
Norway and the termination of the 
Gauloises licence agreement applicable 
to Germany. Adjusting for these items, 
organic revenue would have been up  
7 per cent to £15,453 million at constant 
rates of exchange. On the same  
basis, adjusted profit from operations 
grew organically by 10 per cent to 
£5,487 million.

Operating margin  
The Group continues to improve its 
operating margin by addressing the cost 
base through factory rationalisation, 
systems standardisation and productivity 
savings. In 2011, adjusted profit from 
operations, as a percentage of net 
revenue, improved to 35.8 per cent 
compared to 33.5 per cent in 2010. More 
details of the Group’s adjusted operating 
performance can be found in the  
regional review.  
Adjusting items  
The adjustments made to profit from 
operations are separately disclosed as 
memorandum information on the face  
of the income statement and in the 
segmental analysis.  
During 2011, the Group continued to 
incur costs which do not relate to the 
day-to-day operations of the business.  
Restructuring costs include a review of 
the Group’s manufacturing operations, 
organisational structure and systems and 
software used. During 2011, we also 
impaired the remaining goodwill relating 
to the acquisition of Tekel in Turkey, by 
£273 million. The total costs of these 
actions, together with other costs, 
including integrating acquired businesses 
into existing operations and the provision 
in respect of Fox River, were £798 million 
in 2011, compared to £666 million  
for 2010. 
As explained more fully in the contingent 
liabilities note 30 to the financial 
statements, the Group made a provision 
of £274 million for a potential claim 
under a 1998 settlement agreement 
entered into by a subsidiary in respect  
of the clean up of sediments in the  
lower Fox River in Wisconsin. 
Restructuring and integration costs  
in 2011 principally relate to the 
continuation of factory closure and 
downsizing activities in Denmark and 
Australia respectively; a voluntary 
separation scheme and closure of the 
printing unit in Argentina; the closure of 
the Jawornik factory in Poland; the Lecce 
factory in Italy and Tire factory in Turkey. 
The costs also cover the social plan and 
other closure activities relating to the 
Bremen factory closure in Germany, 
integration of Productora Tabacalera de 
Colombia, S.A.S. (Protabaco) into existing 
operations, as well as other restructuring 
initiatives directly related to improving 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
Group as a globally integrated enterprise. 
In addition, they also include separation 
packages in respect of permanent 
headcount reductions in the Group. 
The £311 million charge for restructuring 
and integration costs in 2010 arose 
principally in respect of the continuation 
of factory closure and downsizing 
activities and the continued integration of 
Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni (ST), Tekel 
and Bentoel into existing operations,  
as well as some other activities to  
reduce the overheads of the Group. 
Restructuring and integration costs  
in 2010 also included a payment of 
US$21 million to Reynolds American 
relating to the early termination of a 
contract manufacturing agreement. 
The acquisitions of Bentoel, Tekel, ST  
and Protabaco resulted in the 
capitalisation of trademarks which are 
amortised over their expected useful 
lives, which do not exceed 20 years. The 
2011 amortisation charge of £58 million, 
compared to £62 million in 2010, is 
included in depreciation, amortisation 
and impairment costs in the profit from 
operations. 
The balance of goodwill remaining in 
respect of the Tekel acquisition in Turkey  
in 2008 (£273 million) was impaired during 
2011. Although cost saving initiatives in the 
acquisition plan of Tekel have been 
delivered successfully, the impairment 
charges arose from the continued pricing 
competition, significant excise increases 
during 2010 and further increases 
announced in October 2011, resulting in 
the significant growth of illicit trade and  
a loss of volumes. Turkey remains an 
important strategic market for the Group.  
Net finance costs  
Net finance costs at £460 million  
were £20 million lower than last year, 
reflecting the strong cash generation  
of the business.

Associates  
The Group’s share of the post-tax results 
of associates, included at the pre-tax 
profit level under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS), increased  
by £120 million to £670 million, after  
net adjusting income of £11 million 
(2010: £72 million charge). 
In 2011, the Group’s share of the 
adjusted post-tax results of associates 
increased by 6 per cent to £659 million 
(2010: £622 million), or 11 per cent at 
constant rates. 
The adjusting items are explained in  
note 5 of the financial statements. 
Profit before tax 
Profit before tax was up £543 million at 
£4,931 million, reflecting the higher 
profit from operations, lower net finance 
costs and the increased contribution  
from associates. 
Effective tax rate  
The tax rates in the income statement of 
31.6 per cent in 2011 and 28.4 per cent 
in 2010 are affected by the inclusion of 
the share of associates’ post-tax profit 
in the Group’s pre-tax results and 
by adjusting items.  
The underlying tax rate for subsidiaries 
reflected in the adjusted earnings per 
share below was 31.2 per cent in 2011 
and 30.2 per cent in 2010. The increase  
is the result of a change in the mix  
of profits. 
Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share for 2011  
were 157.1p, up 8 per cent (2010:  
145.2p). With the distortions that 
adjusting items can cause in profit, as 
well as the potential dilutive effect of 
employee share schemes, earnings per 
share are best viewed on the basis of 
adjusted diluted earnings per share. The 
calculation of this measure is explained in 
note 7 of the financial statements.  
On this basis, the adjusted diluted 
earnings per share were 194.6p, an  
11 per cent increase over 2010, mainly  
as a result of the strong operating 
performance. 
Dividends 
The Group’s policy is to pay dividends  
of 65 per cent of long-term sustainable 
earnings, calculated with reference to  
the adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Interim dividends are calculated as one-
third of the total dividends declared for 
the previous year.  
Dividends are declared and payable in 
sterling except for those shareholders on 
the branch register in South Africa, whose 
dividends are payable in rand. A rate  
of exchange of £:R = 12.19960 as at  
21 February 2012, the closing rate for 
that day as quoted by Bloomberg, results 
in an equivalent final dividend of 
1078.44464 SA cents per ordinary share. 
With the recommended final dividend  
of 88.4p, the total dividends per share  
for 2011 are 126.5p, up 11 per cent  
on the prior year. Under IFRS, the 
recommended final dividend in respect  
of a year is only provided in the accounts 
of the following year. Therefore, the  
2011 accounts reflect the 2010 final 
dividend and the 2011 interim dividend 
amounting to 119.1p (£2,358 million)  
in total (2010: 104.8p – £2,093 million).

declared in respect of 2011 and 2010.

Treasury operations 
Treasury is responsible for raising finance 
for the Group, managing the Group’s 
cash resources and managing the 
financial risks arising from underlying 
operations. All these activities are carried 
out under defined policies, procedures 
and limits. 
The Board reviews and agrees the overall 
treasury policies and procedures, 
delegating appropriate authority to the 
Finance Director, the Treasury function and 
the boards of the central finance companies. 
The policies include a set of financing 
principles and key performance indicators. 
Clear parameters have been established, 
including levels of authority, on the type 
and use of financial instruments to 
manage the financial risks facing the 
Group. Such instruments are only used if 
they relate to an underlying exposure; 
speculative transactions are expressly 
forbidden under the Group’s treasury 
policy. The Group’s treasury position is 
monitored by a Corporate Finance 
Committee chaired by the Finance 
Director. Treasury operations are subject 
to periodic independent reviews and 
audits, both internal and external. 
It is the policy of the Group to maximise 
financial flexibility and minimise refinancing 
risk by issuing debt with a range of 
maturities, generally matching the 
projected cash flows of the Group and 
obtaining this financing from a wide range 
of providers. The Group targets an average 
centrally managed debt maturity of at least 
five years with no more than 20 per cent of 
centrally managed debt maturing in a 
single rolling 12 months. As at 31 
December 2011, the average centrally 
managed debt maturity was 7.0 years 
(2010: 7.4 years) and the highest 
proportion of centrally managed debt 
maturing in a single rolling 12 month 
period was 18.3 per cent (2010:  
12.5 per cent). 
The Group continues to maintain 
investment-grade credit ratings; as at 
31 December 2011, the ratings from 
Moody’s and S&P were Baa1 (stable 
outlook)/BBB+ (positive outlook) (end 
2010: Baa1/BBB+). The strength of the 
ratings has underpinned the debt 
issuance and the Group is confident of  
its ability to successfully access the debt 
capital markets. 
All contractual borrowing covenants have 
been met and none are expected to 
inhibit the Group’s operations or  
funding plans. 
Liquidity 
In June 2011, the Group established  
a US$2 billion commercial paper 
programme. It is Group policy that  
short-term sources of funds (including 
drawings under both the US$ 
programme and the existing Group 
£1 billion euro commercial paper 
programme) are backed by undrawn 
committed lines of credit and cash.  
At 31 December 2011, £85 million  
of commercial paper was outstanding 
(31 December 2010: undrawn). 
In the year ended 31 December 2011, the 
Group continued with transactions in the 
capital markets. In June 2011, the Group 
repaid a maturing €530 million bond. 
The repayment was financed from Group 
cash balances. In August 2011, the Group 
extended the maturity date of a US$200 
million facility from 2011 to 2016, and 
simultaneously increased the size of the 
facility to US$240 million. The facility was 
drawn to the value of US$225 million at 
31 December 2011. In September 2011, 
the Group repaid a Mexican peso 1,444 
million borrowing which was due in 
September 2011 with a new Mexican 
peso 1,444 million borrowing due 2014. 
In November 2011, the Group issued a 
new €600 million bond with a maturity 
of 2021. 
In December 2010, the Group negotiated 
a new central banking facility of £2 billion 
with a final maturity date of December 
2015. This facility is provided by 22 
banks. The existing central banking 
facility of £1.75 billion, with a final 
maturity date of March 2012 was 
cancelled at the same time. The facility 
was undrawn as at the end of both 2011 
and 2010. There were a number of 
transactions in the capital markets in 
2010 to extend the maturity of bonds, to 
purchase and cancel bonds, and to issue 
new bonds. Details of these transactions 
are provided in notes 24 and 25 on  
the accounts. 
Capital structure 
The Group defines capital as net debt  
and equity. The only externally imposed 
capital requirement the Group has is in 
respect of its centrally managed banking 
facilities, which require a gross interest 
cover of 4.5 times. The Group targets a 
gross interest cover, as calculated under 
its key central banking facilities, of greater 
than five. For 2011 it is 12.5 times (2010: 
11.2 times). The Group assesses its 
financial capacity by reference to cash 
flow, net debt and interest cover. Group 
policies include a set of financing 
principles and key performance 
indicators including the monitoring of 
credit ratings, interest cover and liquidity. 
These provide a framework within which 
the Group’s capital structure is managed 
and, in particular, the policies on 
dividends (as a percentage of long-term 
sustainable earnings) and share buy-back 
are decided.

Cash flow 
The IFRS cash flow includes all transactions 
affecting cash and cash equivalents, 
including financing. The alternative cash 
flow included here is presented to illustrate 
the cash flows before transactions relating 
to borrowings.  
Operating cash flow increased by £286 
million, or 6 per cent, to £5,187 million, 
reflecting growth in underlying operating 
performance partially offset by working 
capital movements. Taking into account 
outflows relating to taxation, which were 
£269 million higher than last year due to 
higher taxable profits and an increase in 
dividends to non-controlling interests, 
offset by higher dividends and other 
appropriations from associates due to the 
Reynolds share buy-back (£71 million in 
2011), the Group’s free cash flow was 
£86 million or 3 per cent higher at 
£3,326 million. 
The ratio of free cash flow per share to 
adjusted diluted earnings per share was 
86 per cent (2010: 92 per cent). 
Below free cash flow, the principal  
cash outflows for 2011 comprise the 
payment of the prior year final dividend 
and the 2011 interim dividend, which 
was £265 million higher at £2,358 
million, as well as a £755 million outflow 
due to the resumption of the on-market 
share buy-back programme in 2011, 
including transaction costs.  
During 2011, the cash outflow from net 
investing activities of £311 million mainly 
relates to the £295 million purchase of 
Protabaco, comprising the purchase price 
less acquired net cash and cash equivalents. 
In addition, there was a cash outflow of  
£10 million for the acquisition of non-
controlling interests in Chile and £6 million 
in respect of the purchase of trademarks. In 
2010, proceeds included cash from the 
disposal of subsidiaries of £12 million which 
arose from the sale of the Group’s Belgium 
distribution business, Lyfra NV, which was 
offset by a cash outflow of £12 million 
arising from the acquisition of non-
controlling interests in subsidiaries. 
The other net flows principally  
relate to the impact of the level of  
shares purchased by the employee  
share ownership trusts and cash flows 
in respect of certain derivative  
financial instruments.

These flows resulted in net cash outflows 
of £191 million (2010: £1,070 million 
inflow). After taking account of other 
changes, especially exchange rate 
movements, total net debt was £87 
million higher at £7,928 million at 31 
December 2011 (2010: £7,841 million).  
Retirement benefit 
schemes  
The Group’s subsidiaries operate around 
175 retirement benefit arrangements 
worldwide. The majority of the scheme 
members belong to defined benefit 
schemes, most of which are funded 
externally and many are closed to new 
entrants. The Group also operates a 
number of defined contribution schemes. 
The present total value of funded scheme 
liabilities was £5,675 million (2010: 
£5,365 million), while unfunded scheme 
liabilities amounted to £346 million 
(2010: £337 million). The schemes assets 
increased from £5,134 million in 2010 to 
£5,200 million in 2011.  
After accounting for minimum funding 
obligations of £2 million (2010: £29 
million) and excluding unrecognised 
scheme surpluses of £75 million (2010: 
£51 million), the overall net liability for  
all pension and healthcare schemes 
in Group subsidiaries amounted to  
£898 million at the end of 2011, up  
from £648 million at the end of 2010. 
Contributions to the defined benefit 
schemes are determined after consultation 
with the respective trustees and actuaries 
of the individual externally funded 
schemes, taking into account the 
regulatory environments.  
Changes in the Group  
On 11 October 2011, the Group 
completed the transaction to acquire  
100 per cent of the privately owned 
Productora Tabacalera de Colombia, 
S.A.S. (Protabaco), for US$461 million. 
The business has been integrated with 
the existing British American Tobacco 
business and from 1 January 2012, it is 
operating as one business. 
In 2010, the Group sold its Belgium 
distribution business, Lyfra NV; withdrew 
from distributing phone cards in Brazil; 
and its Gauloises licence agreement 
applicable to Germany was terminated. 
The Group also terminated an 
arrangement whereby it distributed 
product on behalf of a third party in 
Norway, effective from 1 July 2011. 
Share buy-back programme 
The Board approved the resumption of 
the on-market share buy-back programme 
in 2011 with a value of up to £750 million, 
excluding costs. During 2011, 28 million 
shares were bought at a value of £750 
million, excluding transaction costs 
(2010: £nil). A continuation of the share 
buy-back to a value of £1.25 billion has 
been agreed and will resume after 
publication of the preliminary results. 
Non-GAAP measures  
In the reporting of financial information, 
the Group uses certain measures that are 
not required under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS), the generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 
under which the Group reports. The 
Group believes that these additional 
measures, which are used internally, are 
useful to the users of the financial 
statements in helping them understand 
the underlying business performance. 
The principal non-GAAP measures which 
the Group uses are adjusted profit from 
operations and adjusted earnings per 
share, which is reconciled to diluted 
earnings per share. These measures 
remove the impact of adjusting items 
from earnings.  
Management reviews current and prior 
year segmental adjusted profit from 
operations of subsidiaries and adjusted 
post-tax results of associates and joint 
ventures at constant rates of exchange. 
This allows comparison of the Group’s 
results had they been translated at last 
year’s average rate of exchange. Other 
than in exceptional circumstances, this 
does not adjust for the normal 
transactional gains and losses in 
operations which are generated by 
exchange movements. 
In the presentation of financial 
information, the Group also uses another 
measure, organic growth, to analyse 
underlying business performance. 
Organic growth is the growth after 
adjusting for mergers and acquisitions 
and discontinued activities. Adjustments 
are made to current and prior year 
numbers, based on the current period 
Group position. 
The Group also prepares an alternative 
cash flow, which includes a measure of 
‘free cash flow’, to illustrate the cash 
flows before transactions relating to 
Net debt
The Group defines net debt as borrowings, including related derivatives, less cash and 
cash equivalents and current available-for-sale investments. The maturity profile of net 
debt is as follows:

borrowings. The Group also provides 
gross turnover as an additional disclosure 
to indicate the impact of duty, excise and 
other taxes. 
Due to the secondary listing of the 
ordinary shares of British American 
Tobacco p.l.c. on the main board of the 
JSE Limited (JSE) in South Africa, the 
Group is required to present headline 
earnings per share. 
Accounting developments 
The Group has prepared its annual 
consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS, as adopted by  
the EU.  
The Group has not adopted any new and 
amended IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations 
that have had any significant effect on 
reported profit or equity or on the 
disclosures in the financial statements in 
2011. The next few years, however, are 
likely to see more changes in the financial 
statements given the aims of standard 
setters and regulators. 
Going concern  
Given the Group’s history of growth in 
profit from operations, the high cash 
conversion rate from profit into cash, the 
access to the £2 billion revolving credit 
facility which is used only as a back stop 
and the spread of banks providing the 
facilities, the Group remains confident  
in its ability to access the debt  
capital markets.  
This, together with the maturity profile of 
debt, spread over a long period with only 
limited redemptions scheduled for 2012, 
provides confidence that the Group has 
sufficient working capital for the 
foreseeable future.  
After reviewing the Group’s budget, 
plans and refinancing arrangements, 
the Directors consider that the Group  
has adequate resources to continue 
operating for the foreseeable future. The 
financial statements have therefore been 
prepared on a going concern basis. See 
the corporate governance statement  
for full details.

Key Group risk factors 
This section identifies 
the main risk factors 
that may affect the 
British American 
Tobacco Group. 
The following tables provide a brief 
description of the key risks to which the 
Group’s operations are exposed and 
identify, in each case, their potential 
impact on the Group and the principal 
activities in place to manage the risk. 
Each risk is considered in the context of 
the Group strategy by identifying the 
principal strategic element to which it 
relates, although other elements may  
also be relevant. The Group strategy  
is discussed in detail in the preceding 
pages of this business review. 
It is not the intention to provide an 
extensive analysis of all risks affecting the 
Group but rather to identify only those risks 
and uncertainties which the Directors 
believe to be the principal ones facing the 
business. Not all of the factors listed are 
within the control of the Group and other 
factors besides those listed may affect the 
performance of its businesses. Some risks 
may be unknown at present and other risks, 
currently regarded as immaterial, could 
turn out to be material in the future. 
The risk factors listed in this section and 
the specific activities in place to manage 
them should be considered in the  
context of the Group’s internal control 
framework. This is addressed in detail  
in the section on risk management  
and internal control in the corporate 
governance statement. This section 
should also be read in the context of the 
accompanying cautionary statement 
regarding forward-looking statements. 
Risk registers, based on a standardised 
methodology, are used at Group, regional, 
area and individual market level to identify, 
assess and monitor the key risks (both 
financial and non-financial) faced by the 
business at each level. Information on 
prevailing trends, for example whether  
a risk is considered to be increasing or 
decreasing over time, is provided in relation 
to each risk and all identified risks are 
assessed at three levels (high/medium/low) 
by reference to their impact and likelihood. 
Mitigation plans are required to be in place 
to manage the risks identified and the risk 
registers and mitigation plans are reviewed 
on a regular basis. At Group level, specific 
responsibility for managing each identified 
risk is allocated to a member of the 
Management Board. The Group risk register 
provides the basis for the assessment of the 
key Group risk factors identified below. It is 
reviewed regularly by a committee of senior 
managers chaired by the Finance Director 
and twice yearly by the Corporate 
Committee. In addition, it is reviewed 
annually by the Board and twice yearly by 
the Audit Committee. The Board and each 
such Committee reviews changes in the 
status of identified risks, assessing changes 
in impact and likelihood, and the Audit 
Committee also spends time focusing on 
selected key risks in detail. 
Developments in the 
assessment of Group risk 
The Board’s assessment of the key risks  
and uncertainties facing the Group has 
remained broadly unchanged over the past 
year, particularly with regard to illicit trade, 
excise and tax and financial risk. However, 
as a consequence of the Board’s continuing 
reappraisal of Group risks and the activities 
in place to address them, some risks which 
have in previous years been considered as 
key Group risks are no longer assessed as 
such in terms of their impact and likelihood 
and so are not addressed in the tables 
below. They are nevertheless still addressed 
as Group risks, remain on the Group  
risk register and continue to be reviewed  
in accordance with the Group’s risk 
management procedures. This applies,  
for example, to the loss of confidential 
information or malicious manipulation  
of data, which was included in last year’s 
table but is no longer included this year.  
Climate change, which has previously  
been identified as a Group risk, is no longer 
considered to be a risk factor itself, but 
is treated as a potential cause of more 
specific risks, such as the inability to obtain 
adequate supplies of leaf. It therefore 
continues to be taken into account in the 
assessment of Group risk. Non-compliance 
with environmental, health and safety 
measures is now assessed as a key Group 
risk, having been identified as a significant 
compliance issue facing the Group given 
the complexity and global nature of its 
operations and in light of a number of 
recent incidents involving workplace 
accidents. In addition, increased focus  
on the regulatory risks facing the Group  
has highlighted key areas of risk, now set 
out separately below. This reflects their 
importance in the context of the future 
development of the Group’s business  
and the need to ensure that they are  
each effectively addressed. 
Cautionary statement 
The business review and certain other 
sections of this document contain 
forward-looking statements which 
are subject to risk factors associated 
with, among other things, the 
economic and business 
circumstances occurring from time to 
time in the countries and markets in 
which the Group operates. It is 
believed that the expectations 
reflected in these statements are 
reasonable but they may be  
affected by a wide range of  
variables which could cause  
actual results to differ materially  
from those currently anticipated.  41

Illicit trade
Competition from illicit trade  
Illicit trade in the form of counterfeit products, smuggled genuine products and locally manufactured products on which 
applicable taxes are evaded, continues to represent a significant and growing threat to the legitimate tobacco industry.  
The majority of such illicit products are sold at the bottom end of the market and in contravention of applicable regulatory 
requirements. Increasing excise rates can encourage more consumers to switch to illegal cheaper tobacco products and provide 
greater rewards for smugglers. The risk is exacerbated where current economic conditions have resulted in high unemployment 
and/or reduced disposable incomes. Global volume of illicit trade is currently estimated to be up to 12 per cent of consumption.
In the next 10 years, we believe that the problem is likely to increase, driven by the increased regulatory and compliance burden
for legitimate manufacturers and fuelled by further significant excise increases.
Principal relevance to Group strategy:  
Potential impact on Growth (organic revenue growth) 
Time frame: Long term 
Principal potential causes 
 Sudden and disproportionate excise increases and  
widening excise differentials between markets. 
 Unintended consequences of regulation, e.g. plain 
packaging, display bans and ingredients restrictions. 
 Extra compliance costs imposed on legitimate industry 
giving competitive advantages to illicit manufacturers. 
 Economic downturn. 
 Lack of law enforcement and weak border controls.
Potential impact on Group
 Erosion of brand equity. 
 Reduced ability to take price increases. 
 Investment in trade marketing and distribution  
is undermined. 
 Product is commoditised. 
 Lower volumes and reduced profits.
Principal activities in place to address risk 
 Dedicated Anti-Illicit Trade (AIT) teams operating at global, regional, area and key market levels and internal  
cross-functional coordination. 
 Active engagement with key external stakeholders. 
 Cross-industry and multi-sector cooperation on a wide range of AIT issues. 
 Global AIT strategy development supported by a research programme to further the understanding of the size and scope  
of the problem. 
 AIT Intelligence Unit (including a dedicated analytical laboratory) cooperates with law enforcement agencies in pursuit  
of priority targets and capacity building. 
 Strong internal business conduct and customer approval policies.  42

Key Group risk factors continued 
Excise and tax 
Excise shocks from tax rate increases or structure changes
Tobacco products are subject to substantial excise and sales taxes in most countries in which the Group operates. In many of 
these countries, taxes are generally increasing, but the rate of increase varies between countries and between different types 
of tobacco products. A number of significant excise shocks have taken place over the past two years, for example in Romania, 
Turkey, Malaysia, Mexico and Japan. To date, the Group has been able to balance these shocks with its geographic spread,  
and it continues to develop effective measures to address the risk.
Principal relevance to Group strategy:  
Potential impact on Growth (organic revenue growth)  
Time frame: Long term 
Principal potential causes 
 Government initiatives to raise revenues. 
 Increases advocated within context of national health policies. 
 Insufficient capacity to engage with stakeholders in 
meaningful dialogue. 
Potential impact on Group
 Consumers reject the Group’s legitimate tax-paid products 
for products from illicit sources. 
 Reduced legal industry volumes. 
 Reduced sales volume or alteration of sales mix. 
Principal activities in place to address risk 
 Requirement for Group companies to have in place formal pricing and excise strategies including contingency plans. 
 Pricing and excise committees at regional, area and individual market levels. 
 Engagement with local tax and customs authorities, where appropriate. 
 Annual management review of brand portfolio, brand health and equity. 
Onerous disputed taxes, interest and penalties
The Group may face significant financial penalties, including the payment of interest, if it fails to meet its obligations with  
regard to the filing of tax returns and the payment of applicable taxes or in the event of an unfavourable ruling by a tax  
authority in a disputed area. 
Principal relevance to Group strategy:  
Potential impact on Productivity (capital effectiveness)  
Time frame: Short term 
Principal potential causes 
 Non-filing or late filing of tax returns or incorrect filings. 
 Non-payment or late payments of taxes. 
 Unfavourable ruling by tax authorities in disputed areas and 
aggressive auditing and/or pursuit of tax claims. 
Potential impact on Group
 Significant fines and potential legal penalties. 
 Disruption and loss of focus on the business due to diversion 
of management time. 
 Impact on profit and dividend. 
Principal activities in place to address risk 
 Tax committees. 
 Specialist resources available internally to provide advice and guidance and external advice sought where appropriate. 
 Engagement with tax authorities at Group, regional and individual market level.  43

Financial
The Group’s underlying operations give rise to certain financial risks. The principal risks in this regard, and the controls in place to 
address them, are identified below and further details on the Group’s financial management and treasury operations can be 
found within the financial review. 
Management of cost base 
The Group continues to implement measures to reduce its overall cost base. There is a risk that targeted reductions will fail to be 
achieved and/or that productivity programmes do not achieve their objectives. 
Principal relevance to Group strategy:  
Potential impact on Productivity (cost management) 
Time frame: Short term 
Principal potential causes 
 Insufficient resources devoted to productivity programmes 
due to other priorities. 
 Low prioritisation or resistance to change.
Potential impact on Group
 Inability to manage cost savings leads to lower profits  
and reduced funds for investment in long-term growth. 
 Reduced shareholder confidence. 
Principal activities in place to address risk 
 Targeted improvements in operating margin through factory rationalisation, systems standardisation and productivity savings.
 Development of a formal structure to integrate, drive and orchestrate the delivery of productivity programmes by providing 
visibility and enabling benefits tracking. 
 Regular tracking of actual productivity savings and forecast improvements in operating margin and supply chain, overheads 
and indirect projects. 
 Aggregation of planned productivity savings in the annual budget. 
Translational foreign exchange rate exposures
The Group faces translational foreign exchange (FX) rate exposures for earnings/cash flows from its global business. 
Principal relevance to Group strategy:  
Potential impact on Productivity (capital effectiveness) 
Time frame: Short term 
Principal potential causes 
 FX rate exposures arise from exchange rate movements 
against sterling, the Group’s reporting currency. 
Potential impact on Group
 Fluctuations in translational FX rates of key currencies against 
sterling introduce volatility in reported results. 
Principal activities in place to address risk 
 While translational FX exposure is not hedged, its impact is identified in results presentations and financial disclosures; 
earnings are restated at constant rates for comparability. 
 Debt and interest are matched to assets and cash flows to mitigate volatility where possible.  44

Key Group risk factors continued 
Marketplace
The Group has substantial operations in around 180 countries. Its results are influenced by the economic, regulatory and political
situations in the countries and regions in which it has operations, as well as by the actions of competitors. 
Inability to obtain required price increases
To the extent that price increases are required to cover cost rises and deliver profit growth, there is a risk that the Group will be unable  
to achieve these.
Principal relevance to Group strategy:
Potential impact on Growth (organic revenue growth) 
Time frame: Short term
Principal potential causes 
 Changes in the global economy reduce consumers’ 
disposable income. 
 Consumer down-trading. 
 Competitors seek volume growth by price discounts  
or by not taking full price increases. 
Potential impact on Group
 Inability to capture value generated by innovative products. 
 Reduction in volumes. 
 Profit growth in the short term falls below shareholders’ 
expectations. 
 Reduction in funds for investment in long-term growth.
Principal activities in place to address risk 
 Strong alignment between pricing and brand portfolio. 
 Regular regional and management reviews of budgeted pricing scenarios.

Key Group risk factors continued 
Regulation
The Group’s businesses operate under increasingly stringent regulatory regimes around the world. Further regulation is 
expected, particularly as a result of the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)  
protocol and, increasingly, active tobacco control activities outside the FCTC. 
Regulation inhibits Growth strategy
There is a risk that the enactment of regulation that is not evidence based will put the Group at a competitive disadvantage, interfere
with its ability to differentiate its products and increase costs and complexity.
Principal relevance to Group strategy:  
Potential impact on Growth (organic revenue growth) 
Time frame: Long term
Principal potential causes 
 Adoption of FCTC guidelines and adoption of more  
stringent national regulations. 
 Adoption of differing regulatory regimes in different 
countries/groups of countries and/or lack of consensus  
on interpretation/application. 
 Exclusion of the industry from participating in engagement 
with regulators and policy makers. 
 Product regulation which increases complexity and cost. 
Potential impact on Group
 Contribution to the denormalisation of smoking. 
 Erosion of brand value and adverse impact on ability  
to communicate and build brand equity. 
 Increased cost of business for legitimate industry,  
lower turnover and reduced profits. 
 Reduced ability to communicate brand portfolio and 
innovations contributing to an increase in illicit trade. 
Principal activities in place to address risk 
 Group companies have regulatory strategies in place in order to identify issues material to their operating environment and 
develop plans to address them in a manner consistent with local law and Group policy. 
 Engagement is sought with scientific and regulatory communities within the context of the FCTC process, and stakeholder 
engagement takes place at global, regional and individual market levels. 
 Establishment of a dedicated Regulatory Futures team to monitor regulatory trends and developments, analyse regulatory 
proposals to determine impacts, if any, on business and develop initiatives in response. 
 Development of dedicated technical and advocacy capabilities, corporate positions and best practice examples, supported  
by training, for markets to address regulation.  47

Regulation (continued)
Reduced ability to meet consumer expectations and increased compliance costs
Restrictive regulation, in particular in relation to the content and design of tobacco products, may impair the Group’s ability to meet 
consumer expectations and may also lead to increased operating costs and reduced sales.
Principal relevance to Group strategy: 
Potential impact on Growth (organic revenue growth)  
Time frame: Long term 
Principal potential causes 
 Adoption of FCTC guidelines on product design, contents 
and emissions and testing and measuring. 
 Product regulation aimed at reducing the appeal of 
cigarettes through severe restrictions on ingredients  
and design. 
 Regulation on the content and design of tobacco  
products which increases complexity and cost. 
Potential impact on Group
 Reduced consumer acceptability of new product 
specifications, leading to loss of volume and contributing  
to an increase in illicit trade. 
 Loss of volume due to regulation in individual markets 
impacting on established portfolio. 
 Cost complexity of meeting regulations. 
 Loss of reputation, penalties and closure of production  
as a result of non-compliance. 
Principal activities in place to address risk 
 Establishment of Leaf Blending Innovation Centre in Brazil to explore and develop product solutions that are consumer 
relevant within the developing regulatory context. 
 Development of standardised product platforms and a rationalised brand/product portfolio to reduce the compliance testing 
and reporting costs. 
 Effective and globally integrated processes for sales and operations planning processes, product specification and new product initiatives.
 Programme of engagement with scientific and regulatory authorities within the context of the FCTC process. 
Loss of ability to directly communicate with consumer
Strict and restrictive regulation may reduce the Group’s ability to communicate with adult smokers and may also impact on its 
ability to communicate with its corporate stakeholders. 
Principal relevance to Group strategy:  
Potential impact on Growth (organic revenue growth) and  
Responsibility (balanced regulation) 
Time frame: Long term 
Principal potential causes 
 Adoption of FCTC guidelines on packaging and labelling, 
advertising and promotion.  
 Adoption of more stringent national regulations, such as 
point of sale display bans and plain packaging. 
Potential impact on Group
 Generic or plain packaging leads to loss of brand equity. 
 Lower margins through reduced ability to build brand equity 
and leverage price. 
 Reduced ability to compete and make new market entries. 
 Reduced volumes and impact on profits. 
Principal activities in place to address risk 
 Development of comprehensive plans to support markets to prepare for the implications of an increasingly strict regulatory 
environment and to address key regulatory issues. 
 Development of innovative solutions to evolve brand portfolio, product and design and product differentiation within the 
context of regulatory developments and consistent with Group policy and local law. 
 Programme of engagement with stakeholders at global, regional and individual market levels to address key regulatory issues, 
including plain packaging and product display initiatives, and identify potential unintended consequences, such as a 
contribution to increased illicit trade.  48

Corporate governance statement 
Chairman’s introduction 
At British American Tobacco, we remain committed to high 
standards of corporate governance. This is central to the 
continued strong performance of the business in a manner 
which is sustainable in the long term and to maintaining the 
confidence of investors. For us, good governance is about 
managing the business effectively and responsibly and in a  
way which is honest, transparent and shows accountability.  
On the following pages, we set out our approach to 
governance at British American Tobacco. We explain how  
the Board and its Committees are structured, how they operate 
and what they have done in the year, as well as how their 
effectiveness is evaluated. There are benefits, we believe, to 
being transparent. We are therefore broadly supportive of the 
Government’s efforts to encourage more effective narrative 
reporting and we said as much in our response to its recent 
consultation in this area. We try to ensure that our reporting on 
governance matters is clear, concise and well-structured, that it 
is relevant and accessible to users, and that it facilitates the 
comparative analysis of the information provided. We seek to 
minimise ‘boiler plate’ by preparing a separate report against 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code), which we 
publish on our www.bat.com website, although it is of course 
still important to ensure that this corporate governance 
statement meets the requirements of the Code. The quality  
of our narrative reporting was recognised in 2011, with the 
Company being awarded first place in the People Reporting and 
Executive Remuneration Reporting categories for the FTSE 100 in 
the PricewaterhouseCoopers Building Public Trust Awards. Thony 
Ruys, the Chairman of our Remuneration Committee, discusses 
our approach to executive remuneration, another topic which 
has been the subject of much recent debate, in his introduction 
to the remuneration report.  
As a Board, we have ultimate responsibility for the Group’s 
performance and for overseeing the management of risk.  
We are keenly aware that the shareholders also look to us to 
promote the long-term success of the Company and I recognise 
that, as Chairman, it is my role to provide the leadership to 
enable it to do so effectively. This year’s evaluation of the Board, 
which for the second year running was facilitated externally, 
confirmed that the Board continues to meet these obligations. 
One aspect of the evaluation which we considered in detail this 
year was a review of the skills required by the Board and I am 
delighted to welcome Ann Godbehere to the Board following 
her appointment in October. Our search for further non-
executive appointments continues. 
For us, good 
governance is  
about managing the 
business effectively 
and responsibly and in 
a way which is honest, 
transparent and shows 
accountability.  53
British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review
The Board takes seriously its responsibility for promoting the 
Group’s values and, in particular, for ensuring that everyone 
within the Group is aware of their responsibility not only to act 
lawfully, but also to conduct themselves at all times with high 
standards of business integrity. These values are embodied in 
our Standards of Business Conduct, which were updated in 
September 2011 to ensure that they continue to reflect best 
business practice and that they are aligned with the provisions 
of the UK Bribery Act, which came into effect in July 2011. 
Corruption causes distortion in markets and harms economic, 
social and political development. We have long made it clear 
that it is wholly unacceptable for our companies and employees 
to be involved or implicated in any way in corrupt practices, 
and we continue to keep our anti-corruption policies and practices 
under review to ensure that they fully reflect this approach. 
A further area of focus for us in 2011 was a review of our 
arrangements for ensuring the continued independence and 
objectivity of our external auditors. We consider that our 
relationship with PricewaterhouseCoopers is satisfactory but  
it is nevertheless important to guard against complacency.  
With support from its Audit Committee, the Board continues  
to satisfy itself as to both their effectiveness and their 
independence. Following the publication of revised guidance 
by the Financial Reporting Council, we have taken the 
opportunity to review and update our policy on auditor 
independence and we explain the revised policy in more  
detail in the section on audit and accountability. 
One of the highlights of 2011 was the reclassification of the 
shares comprising our secondary listing on the JSE Limited  
in South Africa as domestic assets, allowing South African 
institutions to hold a greater number of shares in the Company. 
This very positive outcome followed a programme of 
engagement with the relevant authorities and our  
institutional investors in South Africa. 
As I hope this report demonstrates, good corporate governance 
continues to be a key focus for the Board and this, combined with 
our clear and consistent strategy, means that the Company is well 
equipped to continue returning value to its shareholders. As we 
head towards our Annual General Meeting in April, I look forward 
to meeting with a number of you, both in the run up to the 
meeting and at the meeting itself, which this year will be held  
at a new venue, The Banqueting House in Whitehall, London.

Chairman 
Compliance statement 
The principal governance rules applying to UK companies  
listed on the London Stock Exchange are contained in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code adopted in June 2010 (the Code). 
The Code is published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
and is available from its website (www.frc.org.uk).  
This statement reports on how the Company has applied the 
Main Principles of the Code and provides our formal report  
on compliance with the Code’s Provisions.  
The Board considers that this Statement provides the information 
necessary to enable shareholders to evaluate how the Main 
Principles of the Code have been applied, that the Company  
has complied with the Provisions of the Code throughout the 
year and that it has therefore satisfied its obligations under  
the Code. 
To the extent that it is not specifically included in this  
corporate governance statement, the information required  
by section 7.2 of the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules  
is included in the section entitled other statutory and regulatory 
information and is incorporated herein by reference. 
In the interests of further transparency, we have again prepared 
a report which summarises the matters addressed in this 
statement, as appropriate, by reference to each Principle  
and Provision of the Code. The updated report is available  
on the corporate governance section of www.bat.com.  54

Chairman and Chief Executive 
The Chairman and Chief Executive are responsible for the profitable 
operation of the Group. Their roles are separate, with each 
having distinct and clearly defined duties and responsibilities. 
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, for 
ensuring its effectiveness on all aspects of its role and for 
facilitating the productive contribution of all Directors. He sets 
the agenda for Board meetings in consultation with the Chief 
Executive and the Company Secretary. He is also responsible for 
ensuring that the interests of the Company’s shareholders are 
safeguarded and that there is effective communication with 
them. The Chairman is accountable to the Board for leading the 
direction of the Group’s corporate and financial strategy and for 
the overall supervision of the policies governing the conduct of 
the Group’s business.  
The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for the performance  
of the Group’s business. He provides leadership to the Group to 
enable the successful planning and execution of the objectives  
and strategies agreed by the Board. He is also responsible for 
stewardship of the Group’s assets and, jointly with the  
Chairman, for representation of the Group externally. 
Non-Executive Directors 
The role of the Non-Executive Directors is to help develop 
strategy and, where appropriate, to provide constructive 
challenge to management’s proposals. They are responsible  
for scrutinising the performance of management in meeting 
agreed goals and objectives and for monitoring the reporting  
of performance. All of the Non-Executive Directors remain 
available to meet with major investors in order to understand 
their views and concerns. 
Senior Independent Director 
Sir Nicholas Scheele is the Senior Independent Director.  
He is responsible for leading the review of the Chairman’s 
performance with the other Non-Executive Directors. When 
required, he presides at meetings of the Board and shareholders 
in the absence of the Chairman. He serves as intermediary  
for the other Directors where necessary and is available to 
shareholders should occasion arise where there is a need  
to convey concerns to the Board other than through the 
Chairman or the Chief Executive.  
Board composition 
The Board considers that all of the Non-Executive Directors  
are independent, in the sense that that they are free from any 
business or other relationships which could materially interfere 
with or appear to affect the exercise of their judgement and 
have not previously been involved in the management of  
the Group.  55

Meetings of the Board 
The Board held eight meetings in 2011, seven of which were 
scheduled and one of which was convened to consider a proposal 
for the Company to provide a guarantee to the Trustee of the British 
American Tobacco UK Pension Fund in respect of the liabilities of 
certain UK Group companies. In 2011, the Board decided to reduce 
the number of its scheduled meetings in future years in order to 
promote the more efficient use of Directors’ time while also 
reducing costs. Future meetings will be longer to ensure that the 
full forward calendar of agenda items continues to be addressed 
effectively and so that the work of the Board and its Committees is 
not compromised. Accordingly, the Board is scheduled to hold six 
meetings in 2012.

Notes: 
1. Paul Adams retired from the Board and as Chief Executive on  
28 February 2011. 
2. Ann Godbehere was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director 
with effect from 3 October 2011. 
3. Dr Ana Maria Llopis retired from the Board immediately following the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2011. 
Those Directors who were absent from one meeting were unable to attend 
the ad hoc meeting arranged at short notice. In addition, Christine Morin-
Postel was unable to attend one of the scheduled meetings due to a long-
standing prior engagement. 
The Chairman will always seek to obtain consensus at Board 
meetings but, where necessary, decisions will be taken by majority. 
If any Director has concerns about the running of the Company or 
a proposed action which cannot be resolved, such concerns will be 
recorded in the Board minutes. No such concerns arose in 2011. If 
required, the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Chairman, meet 
prior to meetings of the Board without the Executive Directors present. 
Both the Executive and the Non-Executive Directors also meet 
annually, led by the Senior Independent Director and without the 
Chairman present, in order to appraise the Chairman’s performance. 
Board Committees 
The Board has established four principal Board Committees, to 
which it has delegated certain of its responsibilities. They are the 
Audit Committee, the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
Committee, the Nominations Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee. The roles, membership and activities of these 
Committees are described in more detail later in this corporate 
governance statement and, in the case of the Remuneration 
Committee, in the remuneration report. Each Committee has its 
own terms of reference, which are kept under review and updated 
regularly to ensure that they remain consistent with best practice. 
The current terms of reference were reviewed in 2010 to ensure 
alignment with the UK Corporate Governance Code and, following 
adoption by the Board in December 2010, they came into effect on 
1 January 2011. They are available on www.bat.com. 
In 2011, the Board also established a Corporate Committee 
comprising the three Executive Directors, which has responsibility 
for reviewing Group corporate and governance issues prior to their 
referral for consideration by the Board and its other Committees.

Key activities of the Board in 2011 
Growth  
The Board kept under review the Group’s performance 
throughout 2011, taking into account global economic 
conditions and the impact of political upheaval, such as the Arab 
Spring uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East, and natural 
disasters, such as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the 
floods in Australia. It considered the impact of foreign exchange 
rate movements, pricing and excise issues and challenges from 
illicit trade, and kept under review marketing and brand 
initiatives in key markets. It satisfied itself throughout the  
year that, despite continued difficult trading conditions, 
management remained on track to deliver the strategy. 
The Board regularly considered opportunities for growth 
through strategic acquisitions, overseeing the acquisition of 
Protabaco in Colombia and the extension of the Group’s 
shareholding in Chiletabacos in Chile. It considered post-
implementation reviews of the acquisitions of Tekel in  
Turkey and STK in Denmark. 
It regularly reviewed the Group’s liquidity, including the 
issuance of commercial paper and adherence to its financing 
principles, and continued to satisfy itself that management  
was making sufficient provision in this regard. In particular,  
it kept under review the implications of a possible default  
in the Eurozone and the impact of such an event on the  
Group’s financing. 
Productivity 
The Board continued to oversee initiatives aimed at managing 
costs, increasing efficiencies and leveraging the Group’s global 
reach. It noted the progress being made in the programmes 
established to develop the Group’s revised Operating Model  
and to implement a single IT operating system throughout the 
Group, which are anticipated to deliver significant cost savings 
in future years. 
Responsibility 
The Board continued to receive regular updates on the key 
regulatory issues facing the Group, focusing on pack space 
appropriation, product regulation and retail display bans. It 
monitored, in particular, developments in connection with the 
proposed introduction of plain packaging in Australia, the 
proposed UK retail display ban and the EU Products Directive.  
The Board visited the Group’s R&D facilities in Southampton and 
received briefings on the science-based approach being taken 
towards the development of potentially reduced-risk products.  
It requested a detailed annual update on the Group’s R&D 
activities. The Board also monitored developments in relation to 
Nicoventures Limited, a company established to focus exclusively 
on the development and commercialisation of innovative, 
regulatory-approved nicotine products. 
The Board received a briefing on the Group’s anti-corruption 
policies and procedures and the recommended enhancements 
following an internal review to ensure continued alignment 
with best practice and the UK Bribery Act and its associated 
guidance. In this context, it approved a revised version of the 
Group’s Standards of Business Conduct, which took effect 
from 1 September 2011.  
Winning organisation 
The Board reviewed succession planning in consultation with 
the Nominations Committee. It considered in detail the skills 
which will be desirable in relation to future non-executive 
appointments, noting the likely importance of entrepreneurial 
and science-based skills, experience in relation to the Far  
East and skills relating to the use of new media in a  
consumer-facing business. It kept under review the  
steps being undertaken to identify further non-executive 
appointments and considered and approved the Committee’s 
recommendation to appoint Ann Godbehere to the Board  
as a Non-Executive Director. 
The Board considered the issue of board diversity, the 
recommendations made by Lord Davies in his report entitled 
Women on Boards and the FRC’s consultation on proposed 
consequential changes to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. It approved the Chairman’s Statement on Board 
Diversity prepared in accordance with Lord Davies’s 
recommendations and published on www.bat.com  
in September 2011. 
The Board also reviewed proposed appointments at Management
Board level (see key activities of the Nominations Committee) 
and approved the creation of two new posts on the 
Management Board, namely Group Scientific Director  
and Group Business Development Director, reflecting  
the importance to the Group of these areas. 
Management Board 
The Management Board has responsibility for overseeing the 
implementation by the Group’s operating subsidiaries of the 
policies and strategy set by the Main Board, and for creating the 
framework for their successful day-to-day operation. The 
Management Board is chaired by the Chief Executive and its 
other members are the Finance Director, the Chief Operating 
Officer and the 12 senior Group executives, whose names 
appear on the Management Board pages. It held 11 scheduled 
meetings in 2011 (nine in 2010), including two three-day 
meetings held off-site, primarily to consider strategic matters.  
In addition, one further meeting was held to consider longer 
term challenges and opportunities. The Management Board  
is scheduled to hold 11 meetings in 2012, including the two  
off-site strategy meetings. Members of the Management Board  
are invited to attend meetings of the Board from time to time,  
in particular when the Group’s strategy and Budget are  
under discussion.  57
British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review
Conflicts of interest  
The Board has formal procedures for managing compliance with 
the conflicts of interest provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The 
Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to authorise 
situational conflicts. Directors are required to give advance notice of 
any conflict issues to the Company Secretary, and these are 
considered either at the next Board meeting or, if the timing 
requires it, at a meeting of the Board’s Conflicts Committee. The full 
Board is notified at its next meeting of any matters authorised by 
the Committee. In February each year, the Board reviews all 
previously authorised situational conflicts, considering each one 
afresh. Directors are excluded from the quorum and the vote in 
respect of any matters in which they have an interest. 
During 2011, a number of conflicts were notified to the Company 
in accordance with these procedures. All matters authorised by the 
Board and the Conflicts Committee were recorded in the register of 
interests maintained by the Company Secretary. They included the 
consideration, prior to her appointment to the Board, of Ann 
Godbehere’s other directorships, including her positions on the 
boards of UBS AG, the Company’s corporate broker and a provider 
of other financial and advisory services to Group companies, and 
Prudential plc, a potential supplier of services to Group companies.
In addition, a potential conflict of interest for Christine Morin-
Postel arose during 2011 in respect of the Group’s exposure to 
clean-up costs for pollution in the Lower Fox River, Wisconsin. 
Group companies have potential direct or indirect causes of 
action against French company Sequana SA in relation to 
dividend payments made to Sequana SA by a former subsidiary 
of it, which subsidiary the Group believes provides an indemnity 
to it in relation to the clean-up costs. Ms Morin-Postel is a non-
executive director of a shareholder in Sequana SA. To date, she 
has absented herself from any Board or Audit Committee 
meetings of the Company when the Fox River matter has been 
discussed. She stood down from the Audit Committee with 
effect from 21 February 2012 and will continue to absent  
herself from Board discussion of the matter in the future. 
Information and professional 
development
All Directors receive induction on joining the Board, covering their 
duties and responsibilities as directors. Non-Executive Directors also 
receive a full programme of briefings on all areas of the Company’s 
business from the Executive Directors, members of the 
Management Board, the Company Secretary and other senior 
executives, and they may request such further information as they 
consider necessary. The expected time commitment from Non-
Executive Directors for their induction has been formalised in the 
standard letter of appointment following the outcome of the Board 
evaluation for 2010 (see below) and visits to an overseas factory 
location and the Group Research & Development Centre in 
Southampton are specified as required elements of the induction. 
All Directors receive briefings designed to update their skills and 
knowledge on a regular basis, for example in relation to the 
business and on legal and regulatory requirements, and by 
visits to company sites. Non-Executive Directors have historically 
also made use of the opportunity to attend meetings of the 
Group’s regional audit and CSR committees. From 2012, it is 
proposed that such meetings will take place in the Group’s UK 
head office, to facilitate the efficient use of management time. 
The Non-Executive Directors will each be invited to accompany 
a Regional Director on a scheduled market visit in order to 
ensure that they continue to receive regular exposure to the 
Group’s business ‘on the ground’. In this regard, market visits to 
Australia, Colombia, Spain and Turkey are currently planned  
for 2012. 
The Chairman meets separately with each Non-Executive 
Director in October each year in order to discuss their individual 
training needs, development plans and the pattern of their 
future service. Following the outcome of the Board evaluation 
for 2010 (see below), these meetings have been incorporated 
within the formal annual review process for the proposed  
re-election of Non-Executive Directors.  
Following her appointment, Ann Godbehere attended induction 
briefings covering the Group’s strategy, its organisational 
structure and its business functions and activities, including its 
statutory reporting cycle and financing principles, research and 
development activities, information technology strategy and legal 
and regulatory issues. She also attended sessions addressing 
corporate governance, the Group’s internal control and risk 
management framework and the role of the external auditors.  
Her induction briefings are continuing, and she is due to receive 
a briefing on environmental health and safety issues and to visit 
the Group’s factory in Bayreuth, Germany.  
The full Board received briefings on a number of legal and 
regulatory developments, including the outcome of Lord 
Davies’s review of gender equality on the boards of UK listed 
companies, the government’s consultation on narrative 
reporting (delivered by an external presenter) and 
developments in relation to the Bribery Act 2010. 
The Board and its Committees receive high quality, up-to-date 
information for review in good time ahead of each meeting, and 
the Company Secretary, under the direction of the Chairman, 
ensures good information flows within the Board and its 
Committees and between the Non-Executive Directors and 
senior management. She is also responsible for advising the 
Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters. The 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
for the Board. In accordance with the recommendations arising 
from the 2010 Board evaluation (see below), a direct reporting 
line for the Company Secretary to the Chairman was established 
with effect from October 2010.  
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and a procedure is in place for them to  
take independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense should this be required. 58

Evaluation of Board performance 
Following the comprehensive report and findings which 
resulted from the 2010 Board Evaluation (see below), the Board 
once again appointed Simon Osborne and Geoffrey Shepheard 
from the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators 
(ICSA) to conduct a follow up Board and Committee evaluation 
for 2011. This also included a more detailed peer-based 
evaluation of the personal effectiveness of each Director.  
The key areas for the review were based on the topics which 
had been discussed the previous year and included:  
 the role of the Board, its responsibilities and those  
of its Committees;  
 how the Board oversees risk, business conduct and 
corporate governance;  
 the arrangements for, and effectiveness of, Board meetings;  
 the support and training provided to the Board;  
 Board composition, range of skills required, succession 
planning and effectiveness of the Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and Committee Chairmen;  
 how the Board works together and its engagement with 
shareholders; and 
 outcomes and achievements, including how the Board is 
perceived externally.  
John Daly, who had joined the Board after completion of the 
2010 evaluation, was interviewed by Simon Osborne. All other 
Directors were sent a transcript of their 2010 discussion and 
asked to update their comments with their thoughts on the 
progress of the Board over the preceding year. Each Director 
was required to give an assessment ranging from Poor through 
to Excellent on each of the core issues.  
In addition, each Director assessed themself, and all the other 
Directors – both Executive and Non-Executive and the Chairman 
– against a number of personal effectiveness criteria, including 
awareness of the Group strategy, ability to think strategically 
and challenge constructively, level of commitment and 
preparedness, communication and listening skills, and 
contribution to decision-making. The Chairman was also 
assessed on his ability to create the conditions for overall  
Board effectiveness and for setting the tone at the top. 
The facilitators collated and analysed the results from each 
element of the evaluation and prepared separate reports, 
summarising key points and including non-attributable 
comments given in individual responses. The Board and 
Director Reports were initially discussed with the Chairman.  
The Board report was then presented by ICSA at a Board 
meeting. Each Director received a copy of the report on his or 
her own effectiveness and those reports on individual 
performances were discussed by the Chairman with each 
Director as appropriate. The Chairman’s performance was 
discussed initially with the Senior Independent Director before 
he provided feedback to the Chairman. 
The Board evaluation for 2012 will be facilitated by the Company 
Secretary and it is anticipated that in the future it will be 
facilitated externally at least once every three years.  59

Evaluation of Board performance
Update on 2010 objectives 
Throughout 2011, the Board monitored progress towards 
achievement of the specific action points arising from its first 
externally facilitated evaluation. Details are set out below. 
 Carry out a review of the size and composition of the 
Remuneration Committee: At least one additional 
meeting has been scheduled in 2012 and a revised 
forward agenda has been established. For the time being, 
all independent Non-Executive Directors will continue to 
be members of the Committee. Further details of the 
review are provided in the remuneration report. 
 The Remuneration Committee to receive a formal 
report following the annual appraisal of each member 
of the Management Board: In February 2011, the Chief 
Executive provided a full update to the Committee on the 
performance of each member of the Management Board. 
This process will be repeated annually. 
 Each Committee to review the 2010 report’s specific 
comments relating to its activities as well as any generally 
applicable action points: These reviews have been carried 
out and, as a result, each Committee has updated its forward 
calendar of specific agenda items and considered its role and 
responsibilities, for example with regard to risk oversight. 
 Review the process for the proposed re-election of 
Directors: A formal two-stage process was introduced in 
February 2011. This involves a discussion between the 
Chairman and each Non-Executive Director in October 
each year and formal consideration by the Nominations 
Committee in the following February, with each Director 
being absent from the meeting while his or her own 
position is discussed. 
 Establish a direct reporting line for the Company 
Secretary to the Chairman in relation to Board matters:
This was introduced with effect from October 2010. 
 The Nominations Committee to have particular regard to a 
person’s ability to influence outcomes when considering 
non-executive appointments: An ability to influence and 
provide constructive challenge has always been a key 
requirement. This point was re-emphasised with the search 
firms engaged in 2011 to find further non-executive directors 
and in the role specification which was prepared.  
 Review the calendar of standard Board and Committee 
agenda items: The Board and each of the Committees 
have reviewed and updated the standard calendar of 
agenda items and also regularly reflect on the balance 
between pre-read and presentation at their meetings. 
 Review the induction arrangements for non-executive 
directors: These arrangements are reviewed with every 
new appointment and the time commitment expected for 
the induction is now specified in the appointment letter. 
 Implement a Board software solution to facilitate secure 
electronic delivery of papers: A secure electronic delivery 
system was introduced in September 2011 as an interim 
measure. Following a formal tender process, it is expected 
that the Blueprint Boardpad 2 software will be implemented 
by April 2012. 
Outcome of 2011 evaluation 
Board performance: The 2011 evaluation showed that the 
Board continues to be effective. The assessments showed that 
the Board is rated highly in each category, with only marginal 
variations from the previous year’s ratings. It was considered 
that the Board had discharged its role and responsibilities 
effectively and that, during the year, it had focused particularly 
on longer-term strategic issues, such as opportunities for 
speedier growth, the threats from increased illicit trade  
and the challenges posed by further regulation. The Board’s 
continuing focus on succession was highlighted by the 
smooth transition between the retiring Chief Executive,  
Paul Adams, and his successor, Nicandro Durante, and  
also by the appointment of Ann Godbehere in October 2011.  
The Board’s working relationship with its four principal 
Committees was considered to have improved during the year. 
The CSR Committee has benefitted from a revised schedule of 
meetings and the Remuneration Committee has agreed that it  
will hold at least one additional meeting in 2012. 
With regard to the spread of skills, background and experience 
on the Board, the evaluation confirmed that the current 
Directors’ backgrounds provide a good mix from both FMCG 
and financial companies. During 2011, the Board identified a 
number of additional skills which would also be beneficial to 
the Company, including science-based skills, experience in 
relation to the Far East and skills relating to the use of new 
media in a consumer-facing business.
Director Evaluations: The Chairman has discussed each  
report with the Director concerned and the Senior Independent 
Director has met with the Chairman to discuss his report with 
him. Development plans have been agreed and opportunities 
for Board training and development will be reviewed in 2012. 
2011 Action Plan: The outstanding action points from 2010 
will be fully implemented during 2012, including the 
introduction of new Board software and implementation  
of the revised calendar for meetings of the Remuneration 
Committee. In addition, the Board agreed to review the  
time allowed in the Board calendar for training and personal 
development purposes.  60

Shareholder engagement
Relations with shareholders 
The Board maintains a dialogue with shareholders directed 
towards ensuring a mutual understanding of objectives. Its 
primary contact, facilitated by the Head of Investor Relations, is 
through the Executive Directors, but the Chairman also contacts 
major shareholders periodically and in advance of the Annual 
General Meeting each year in order to understand their views 
on the Company and to ensure that their views are communicated 
to the Board as a whole. In addition, the Senior Independent 
Director and the other Non-Executive Directors are available  
to meet with major shareholders in order to understand their 
views and any concerns which they may have.  
A full programme of engagement with investors and analysts, 
both in the UK and overseas, is undertaken each year by the 
Head of Investor Relations, often accompanied by one or more 
of the Executive Directors and members of the Management 
Board, including presentations, roadshows and a bi-annual 
‘Investor event’ involving detailed presentations on the 
Company’s strategy and performance. Investor presentations 
are published on www.bat.com and results presentations  
are available by webcast. There is a debt micro site on 
www.bat.com for debt investors, which includes 
comprehensive bondholder information on credit ratings,  
debt facilities, outstanding bonds and maturity profiles. 
At least twice a year, the Head of Investor Relations presents a 
report to the Board on investor relations generally, identifying 
the key issues raised by institutional shareholders. In addition, 
the Board receives a report at each of its meetings on any 
changes to the holdings of the Company’s main institutional 
shareholders. Specific issues raised by individual institutions  
are also reported to the Board, as appropriate. 
During 2011, a wide range of business and corporate 
governance issues, were discussed with, or raised by, 
institutional investors as part of the regular investor relations 
programme. These included the Company’s overall 
performance, how the Chairman had settled into his role, the 
reinstatement of the share buy-back programme, regulatory 
developments, pricing issues and the outlook generally  
for the industry.  
In addition, a focused schedule of meetings with key institutional 
shareholders was undertaken by the Chairman in advance of the 
Annual General Meeting in April 2011, with discussions covering 
the Company’s performance and governance generally. These 
included issues such as succession planning and Board 
evaluation, executive remuneration, Board diversity, the litigation 
and regulatory environment, external auditors’ fees, the 
reinstatement of the share buy-back programme, and the 
consultation in late 2010/early 2011 in relation to proposed 
changes to the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
In October 2011, the National Treasury of South Africa 
confirmed the reclassification of all inward listed shares on the 
JSE Limited (JSE), including those comprising the Company’s 
secondary listing on the JSE, as domestic assets. Since the 
granting of that listing on the JSE in October 2008, the 
Company had maintained a programme of engagement with 
the JSE and the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), as well as its 
institutional investors in South Africa, to encourage the easing 
of the prudential limits restrictions on the ownership of shares in 
non-South African companies. Since December 2011, the 
Company’s ordinary shares are now principally included in the 
South African ALSI40 Index and the SWIX Index. The combined 
effect of these changes on the Company’s secondary listing is 
likely to be positive, as they potentially allow South African 
institutional investors to hold a greater number of shares  
in the Company. 
The programme of engagement with investors and analysts  
for 2011 included an investor event held in Hampshire on  
17/18 May, involving presentations by all members of the 
Management Board, including the Executive Directors, and 
other senior managers covering a range of topics, including the 
Group strategy, industry landscape and opportunities, financial 
performance, consumer engagement and the innovations 
pipeline and regional challenges. Roadshows were also held  
in a number of locations including Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, 
South Africa and North America. 
The Company also responded to issues raised in correspondence 
from shareholders, including providing clarification to an 
institutional shareholder on questions raised in relation to the 
Company’s relationship with its external auditors, the level of 
non-audit fees and also regarding the level and treatment of 
directors’ benefits.  61

Annual General Meeting 
The Annual General Meeting will be held at The Banqueting 
House, Whitehall, London SW1A 2ER at 11.30am on 26 April 
2012. Details of the business to be proposed at the meeting are 
contained in the Notice of Annual General Meeting which is 
sent to all shareholders and is also published on www.bat.com. 
The Annual General Meeting provides a useful opportunity for 
shareholder engagement and, in particular, for the Chairman  
to explain the Company’s progress and receive questions from 
investors. The chairmen of the Audit, CSR, and Remuneration 
Committees are normally available at the Annual General 
Meeting to take any relevant questions and all other Directors 
attend, unless illness or another pressing commitment 
precludes them from doing so. All Directors at the time 
attended the Annual General Meeting in April 2011, with  
the exception of Dr Gerry Murphy, who was unable to  
attend due to a long-standing commitment overseas. 
The Company provides for the vote on each resolution to be  
by poll rather than by show of hands. This provides for greater 
transparency and allows the votes of all shareholders to be 
counted, including those cast by proxy. The Chairman 
announces the provisional voting results at the Meeting, and 
the final results are announced on the same day through the 
Regulatory News Service and on www.bat.com. The Company 
has in recent years appointed an independent assessor to 
scrutinise the Annual General Meeting and to produce a report 
of the meeting, covering the proxy voting process, attendance 
and an audit of the poll procedures. The report in 2011 
confirmed the adequacy, accuracy and fairness of the proxy 
process and the voting procedures and systems. The Company 
does not intend to appoint an independent assessor for the 
2012 Annual General Meeting. It will implement the same 
procedures used previously. 
Stock market listings 
The ordinary shares of the Company (as British American 
Tobacco p.l.c.) have been listed on the Official List and traded 
on the main market of the London Stock Exchange for listed 
securities since 8 September 1998 (Share Code: BATS and  
ISIN: GB0002875804). This is classified as a premium listing. 
The share registrar is Computershare Investor Services PLC. 
Since 28 October 2008, the Company’s ordinary shares have 
had a secondary listing on the JSE Limited in South Africa (JSE), 
under the abbreviated name BATS and the trading code BTI.  
As at 31 December 2011, 215,049,297 ordinary shares of the 
Company (being 10.61 per cent of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital – excluding treasury shares) were on its 
South African branch register for which Computershare Investor 
Services (Pty) Ltd are share registrars. 
The Company’s ordinary shares are also traded on NYSE Amex 
Equities in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) 
under the symbol BTI with a CUSIP number 110448107. Each 
ADR represents two of the Company’s ordinary shares and  
at 31 December 2011, 38,750,804 ADRs were outstanding, 
represented by 77,501,608 ordinary shares. Citibank, N.A. 
continues to act as depositary for the ADR programme.  
The Company has unlisted trading privileges for the ADR 
programme and none of its securities are listed on any United 
States securities exchange or registered pursuant to the 
securities laws of the United States. As a result, the Company is 
subject to neither the NYSE Amex Equities listing standards nor 
the corporate governance rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  
of 2002. Nevertheless, the Board has chosen, in the interests  
of good governance, to make a voluntary statement explaining 
the principal differences and common areas between the 
Company’s corporate governance practices and those that 
would be required if the Company were subject to those rules. 
The updated statement will be available on the corporate 
governance section of www.bat.com from the date of 
publication of the Annual Report.

Notes: 
1. Christine Morin-Postel stood down from the Committee with effect from 
21 February 2012. 
Sir Nicholas Scheele was unable to attend one meeting of the Audit 
Committee due to a long-standing prior engagement. 
The Chief Operating Officer and the Finance Director attend all meetings of

Key activities of the Audit Committee 
in 2011
The Audit Committee held five meetings during 2011, at which 
it considered the following standing items of business: 
 The Group’s 2010 results and its 2011 half-yearly results 
and interim management statements. 
 Periodic reports from the Group’s regional audit and CSR 
committees and corporate audit committee. 
 Periodic reports from the Group Head of Audit and 
Business Risk on international audits and the management 
responses and action plans being put in place to address 
any concerns raised. 
 The 2012 Internal Audit Plan. 
 A report from the Head of Group Security including 
consideration of security risks and frauds and losses arising 
during the preceding year. 
 Compliance with the Group’s Standards of Business 
Conduct and records management procedures. 
 An annual review of the external auditors’ independence. 
The Committee also carried out its twice yearly review of the 
Group risk register and considered the following risk topics  
in detail: 
 Risks arising in relation to how major projects and 
programmes are managed within the Group, considered a 
significant area of potential risk given the importance of 
implementation of the revised Operating Model and single 
IT operating system in delivering future costs savings. 
 Risks arising in connection with the restructuring of the 
Group’s global IT function. 
 Risks and opportunities for savings and efficiencies arising 
in relation to the Group’s procurement activities and its 
procurement joint venture with Annheuser-Busch InBev 
(Agrega), including the various approaches employed to 
manage third party suppliers. 
 Key risks to the Group’s pension schemes, including  
asset underperformance, increased longevity and  
pension regulation, and the strategies in place to  
mitigate these risks. 
 Risks arising in connection with litigation involving  
Group companies, in particular in the Canadian 
recoupment claims and the Fox River matter in the  
US (see the statement on contingent liabilities at  
note 30 in the notes on the accounts). 
In addition, the Committee considered a number of other 
specific matters, including the following: 
 The Committee agreed the inclusion of recommended 
impairments as adjusting items in the consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2010 and an additional impairment in the financial 
statements for the year under review, in both cases  
arising from the material underperformance against 
expectation of the consolidated business in Turkey 
following the acquisition of Tekel. This was consequential 
upon excise shocks leading to increased illicit trade and 
lower volumes and profitability than anticipated. 
 It considered developments in relation to Group’s 
exposure to clean-up costs for pollution in the lower  
Fox River, Wisconsin and agreed the inclusion of a 
provision in this regard in the financial statements for  
the year under review (see notes 3(h) and 30 in the  
notes on the accounts). 
 It noted a revised internal audit methodology, updated  
to reflect best practice, and considered the steps being 
undertaken by internal audit to support the programmes 
established to develop the Group’s revised Operating 
Model and single IT operating system. 
 It noted the response submitted by the Committee 
Chairman to the Call for Evidence in the Inquiry led by 
Lord Sharman on going concern and liquidity risk.  
 It reviewed and recommended to the Board an updated 
policy on auditor independence, intended to formalise 
the Group’s arrangements for ensuring auditor 
independence and objectivity.
During 2011, the Committee considered a report prepared by 
the Company Secretary on the effectiveness of the Committee 
as assessed during the evaluation of the Board in 2010, 
including a review of its standard agenda items. Consequent 
upon this, it agreed that it would consider, on an annual basis, 
the Group’s pensions arrangements, both in terms of funding 
and investment strategies, and requested regular reports on the 
implementation of the programmes established to develop the 
Group’s revised Operating Model and to implement a single IT 
operating system throughout the Group.  
Financial reporting 
The Board is satisfied that it has met its obligation to present a 
balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s 
position and prospects in the Directors’ report and financial 
statements and in periodic reports, reports to regulators and 
price-sensitive announcements. A summary of the Directors’ 
responsibilities for the financial statements and their statement 
concerning relevant audit information is included at the end of 
this corporate governance section.   64

Audit and accountability continued 
Business model 
The business review includes an explanation of the basis on 
which the Group generates value and preserves it over the  
long term and its strategy for delivering its objectives. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position  
are set out in the performance and strategy section and the 
regional review. The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position, facilities and borrowing position are 
described in the financial review. The key group risk factors 
include an analysis of financial risk and the Group’s approach to 
financial risk management and notes 21 and 24 in the notes on 
the accounts provide further detail on the Group’s borrowings 
and management of financial risks.  
The Group has at the date of the report, sufficient existing 
financing available for its estimated requirements for the next 
12 months. This, together with its proven ability to generate 
cash from trading activities, the performance of the Group’s 
Global Drive Brands, its leading market positions in a number  
of countries and its broad geographical spread, as well as 
numerous contracts with established customers and suppliers 
across different geographic areas and industries, provides the 
Directors with the confidence that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully in the context of current 
financial conditions and the general outlook in the global 
economy.
After reviewing the Group’s annual budget, plans and financing 
arrangements, the Directors consider that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable 
future and that it is therefore appropriate to continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report.  
External auditors 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been the Company’s 
auditors since it listed on the London Stock Exchange in 
September 1998. The Audit Committee considers that the 
relationship with the auditors is working well and remains 
satisfied with their effectiveness. Accordingly, it has not 
considered it necessary to require the firm to tender for the 
audit work. There are no contractual obligations restricting the 
Company’s choice of external auditor. The external auditors are 
required to rotate the audit partners responsible for the Group 
audit at least every five years and those responsible for the 
subsidiary audits at least every seven years. The current lead 
audit partner has been in position for two years. 
Auditor independence 
The Audit Committee has an established policy aimed at 
safeguarding and supporting the independence and objectivity 
of the Group’s external auditors. Following the publication by 
the Financial Reporting Council of additional guidance in this 
area in 2010 in its revised Guidance on Audit Committees, the 
Audit Committee took the opportunity during 2011 to review 
and update this policy.  
The basic principle of the policy is that the Group’s external 
auditors may be engaged to provide services only in cases 
where those services do not impair their independence and 
objectivity, and provided that the total annual fees for non-audit 
services do not exceed the sum of annual fees for audit and 
audit-related services. In particular, the external auditor may not 
be engaged to provide services in circumstances where the 
provision of such services would: 
 create a mutual or conflicting interest between any Group 
company and the external auditor; 
 place the external auditor in the position of auditing its 
own work; 
 result in the external auditor acting as a manager or 
employee of any Group company; or 
 place the external auditor in the position of advocate for 
any Group company. 
Subject to the above, the external auditor is permitted to 
provide certain tax and other non-audit services. The 
Committee recognises that using the external auditors to 
provide such services can often bring significant benefits to the 
Group as a result of their detailed knowledge of its business. 
However, a tender process is required for permitted categories 
of tax and other non-audit services where the anticipated spend 
is above specified thresholds, unless a waiver from this 
requirement is agreed by the Group Finance Director and 
notified to the Audit Committee.  
The policy requires the submission to the Audit Committee, 
typically prior to the year end, of a work plan identifying the 
total fees for all audit-related services, tax services and other 
non-audit services which it is anticipated will be undertaken by 
the external auditor in the following year. Specific itemisation is 
required for tax services and other non-audit services in excess 
of the tender thresholds referred to above. Updated work plans 
must then be submitted to the Audit Committee at the mid-year 
and year end. In this way, the Audit Committee has full visibility 
of the Group spend on non-audit services throughout the year, 
enabling it to discharge its responsibility for keeping such fees 
under review and ensuring that neither their level nor their 
nature risk impairing the external auditor’s independence  
and objectivity. A breakdown of audit, audit-related and  
non-audit fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2011 is 
provided in note 3(d) in the notes on the accounts and is 
summarised as follows:  65

In 2011 non-audit fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers 
amounted to 57.6 per cent of the audit and audit-related  
fees paid to them (2010: 92.9 per cent). 
Annual assessment 
The Audit Committee assesses annually the qualification, 
expertise and resources, and independence of the Group’s 
external auditors and the effectiveness of the audit process.  
The Committee’s assessment is informed by an external audit 
satisfaction survey completed by members of senior 
management, which it reviews in detail. In 2011, it also had  
the benefit of the outcome of an assessment by the external 
auditors’ internal review group of the audit team, involving  
in-depth interviews with the Company’s senior managers. The 
resulting report was presented to the Committee by a member 
of the review team, allowing the Committee to ask further 
questions with regard to the quality of the audit. In addition, 
the Head of Internal Audit, the Company Secretary and the 
Committee Chair all meet with the external auditors to discuss 
the progress of the audit and any significant issues are  
included on the Audit Committee’s agenda for consideration 
during the year.  
The Audit Committee has completed its assessment of the 
external auditors for the financial period under review. It has 
satisfied itself as to their qualification, expertise and resources 
and remains confident that their objectivity and independence 
are not in any way impaired by reason of the non-audit services 
which they provide to the Group. The Committee recognises 
that certain projects on which they are engaged will necessarily 
span a number of years and that once appointed they will 
continue to provide those services for the length of the project. 
A number of current projects, particularly those relating to the 
restructuring of the Group’s global IT function and the development 
of a single IT operating system, fall within this category. 
The Committee has recommended to the Board, for approval by 
shareholders, the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as 
the Company’s external auditors. Resolutions will be proposed 
at the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2012 to reappoint 
PricewaterhouseCoopers as the Company’s auditors and to 
authorise the Directors to agree their remuneration for the  
2012 audit.  
Political contributions 
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing donations 
made for political purposes throughout the Group. No donation 
was made in 2011 to any political party registered in the UK 
under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. 
Subsidiaries of the Company in Australia and Jamaica made 
contributions to non-EU political parties in their respective 
countries of incorporation totalling £209,104 (2010: £114,245). 
Standards of Business Conduct 
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring compliance 
with the Company’s Standards of Business Conduct, which 
underpin the Group’s commitment to good corporate 
behaviour. The Standards of Business Conduct require all staff 
to act with high standards of business integrity, comply with all 
applicable laws and regulations and ensure that business 
standards are never compromised for the sake of results. They 
were updated with effect from 1 September 2011 in order to 
ensure that they remain at the forefront of best business 
practice and to ensure alignment with the provisions of the  
UK Bribery Act 2010, which came into effect on 1 July 2011,  
and associated guidance.  
Every Group company and every employee worldwide is 
expected to live up to the Standards of Business Conduct and 
guidance on them is provided across the Group, including 
through training and awareness programmes. All Group 
companies have adopted the Group Standards or local policies 
embodying them. They are applicable to all employees, 
including senior management, and to the Board Directors. 
Senior managers in the Group must report on annual 
compliance with the Standards with regard to all employees in 
the company or department for which they are responsible. 
Information on compliance with the Standards is gathered  
at a global level and reported to the regional audit and CSR 
committees and to the Audit Committee. The CSR Committee 
also reviews any Group reputation-related issues arising from 
non-compliance with the Standards. 
The Standards of Business Conduct are available on 
www.bat.com.  
Confidential reporting procedures 
The Standards of Business Conduct also set out the Group’s 
whistleblowing policy, which enables staff, in confidence, to 
raise concerns about possible improprieties in financial and 
other matters and to do so without fear of reprisal, provided 
that such concerns are not raised in bad faith. The policy is 
supplemented by local procedures throughout the Group and 
at the Group’s London headquarters, which provide staff with 
additional guidance and enable them to report matters in a 
language with which they are comfortable. The Audit 
Committee receives quarterly reports on whistleblowing 
incidents. It remains satisfied that the policy and the procedures 
in place incorporate arrangements for the proportionate and 
independent investigation of matters raised and for the 
appropriate follow-up action.  66

Risk management and internal control 
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent 
of the significant risks that the Group is willing to take to 
achieve its strategic objectives and for maintaining sound risk 
management and internal control systems. With the support of 
the Audit Committee, it carries out a review of the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems 
annually, covering all material controls including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management 
systems, and reports to shareholders that it has done so. During 
2011, the Board reviewed the Group’s risk profile, taking into 
account the implications of natural disasters, such as in Japan 
and Australia, and political upheaval, in particular in the Middle 
East and the Eurozone. 
Overview 
The Company maintains its system of risk management and 
internal control with a view to safeguarding shareholders’ 
investment and the Company’s assets. It is designed to identify, 
evaluate and manage risks that may impede the achievement of 
the Company’s business objectives rather than to eliminate 
these risks and can therefore provide only reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. A 
description of the key risk factors that may affect the Group’s 
business is provided in the business review.  
The main features of the risk management processes and system 
of internal control operated within the Group, which have been 
in place throughout the year under review and remain in place 
to date, are described below. They do not cover the Group’s 
associate undertakings.  
Audit and CSR committee framework 
The Group’s audit and CSR committee framework underpins 
the Board’s Audit and CSR Committees. It provides a flexible 
channel for the structured flow of information throughout the 
organisation, with committees at various levels covering key 
individual markets, areas and the Group’s regions, each referring 
matters to the next level as appropriate. This framework ensures 
that significant financial, social, environmental and reputational 
risks faced by the Company and its subsidiaries are appropriately 
managed and that any failings or weaknesses are identified  
so that remedial action may be taken where necessary.  
The Group’s regional audit and CSR committees (which are all 
chaired by an Executive Director) focus on risks and the control 
environment within each region and are in turn supported by 
area and/or individual market audit and CSR committees. The 
corporate audit committee focuses on the risks and the control 
environment within the Group’s operations which do not fall 
within the regional committees’ remit, for example head office 
central functions, global programmes and above-region 
projects. It comprises members of the Management Board  
and is chaired by the Chief Executive.  
The relevant external and internal auditors regularly attend 
meetings of these committees and have private audiences with 
members of the committees after every meeting. In addition, 
central, regional and individual market management, along 
with internal audit, supports the Board in its role of ensuring  
a sound control environment. 
Risk management and internal control processes  
Risk registers, based on a standardised methodology, are used 
at Group, regional, area and individual market level to identify, 
assess and monitor the key risks (both financial and non-
financial) faced by the business at each level. Information on 
prevailing trends, for example whether a risk is considered to be 
increasing or decreasing over time, is provided in relation to 
each risk and all identified risks are assessed at three levels 
(high/medium/low) by reference to their impact and likelihood. 
Mitigation plans are required to be in place to manage the risks 
identified and the risk registers and mitigation plans are 
reviewed on a regular basis. Regional and above-market risk 
registers are reviewed regularly by the relevant regional audit 
and CSR committee or the corporate audit committee,  
as appropriate.  
At Group level, specific responsibility for managing each 
identified risk is allocated to a member of the Management 
Board. The Group risk register is reviewed regularly by a 
committee of senior managers chaired by the Finance Director 
and twice yearly by the Corporate Committee. In addition, it is 
reviewed annually by the Board and twice yearly by the Audit 
Committee. The Board and each such Committee reviews 
changes in the status of identified risks, assessing the impact  
of changes in impact and likelihood, and the Audit Committee  
also spends time focusing on selected key risks in detail.  
Group companies and other business units are required at least 
annually to complete a checklist of the key controls which they 
are expected to have in place, called Control Navigator. Its 
purpose is to enable them to self-assess their internal control 
environment, assist them in identifying any controls which may 
require strengthening and support them in implementing and 
monitoring action plans to address control weaknesses. The 
Control Navigator checklist is reviewed annually to ensure that 
it remains relevant to the business and covers all applicable key 
controls. In addition, at each year end, Group companies and 
other business units are required to: 
 review their system of internal control, confirm whether it 
remains effective and report on any material weaknesses 
and the action being taken to address them; and 
 review and confirm compliance with the Standards of 
Business Conduct and identify any material instances of 
non-compliance or conflicts of interest identified. 
The results of these reviews are reported to the relevant regional 
audit and CSR committee or to the corporate audit committee 
and, where appropriate, to the Board’s Audit Committee to 
ensure that appropriate remedial action has been, or will be, 
taken where necessary. 
The Group’s internal audit function provides advice and 
guidance to the Group’s businesses on best practice in risk 
management and control systems. It is also responsible for 
carrying out audit checks on Group companies and other 
business units, and does so against an audit plan presented 
annually to the Audit Committee, which focuses in particular  
on higher risk areas of the Group’s business.   67

Financial reporting controls 
The Group has in place a series of policies, practices and 
controls in relation to the financial reporting and consolidation 
process, which are designed to address key financial reporting 
risks, including risks arising from changes in the business or 
accounting standards. The Group Manual of Accounting 
Policies and Procedures sets out the Group accounting policies, 
its treatment of transactions and its internal reporting 
requirements. The internal reporting of financial information  
for the purpose of preparing the Group’s financial statements 
quarterly, half-yearly and at the year end is signed-off by the 
heads of finance responsible for the Group’s markets and 
business units. In addition, the heads of finance responsible  
for the Group’s markets and all senior managers are required  
to confirm annually that all information relevant to the Group 
audit has been provided to the Directors and that reasonable 
steps have been taken to ensure full disclosure in response to 
requests for information from the external auditors.  
The effectiveness of the Group’s financial reporting controls  
is assessed through self-certification as part of the Control 
Navigator exercise described above and evaluation by internal 
audit in the context of the annual audit plan. The integrity of the 
Group’s public financial reporting is further supported by a 
number of processes and steps to provide assurance over the 
completeness and accuracy of the content, including: 
 review by the Chairman, Executive Directors and members 
of the Management Board; 
 review and recommendation by the Audit Committee; and 
 review and approval by the Board. 
Review 
The Turnbull Guidance (the Guidance) sets out best practice on 
internal control for UK-listed companies to assist them in 
assessing the application of the Code’s Principles and 
compliance with the Code’s Provisions with regard to risk 
management and internal control. The current version of the 
Guidance applies to listed companies for financial years 
beginning on or after 1 January 2006.  
The processes described above, and the reports that they give 
rise to, enable the Board and the Audit Committee to monitor 
the risk management and internal control framework on a 
continuing basis throughout the year and to review its 
effectiveness at the year end. The Board, with advice from its 
Audit Committee, has completed its annual review of the 
effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal 
control for the period since 1 January 2011. No significant 
failings or weaknesses were identified and the Board is satisfied 
that, where specific areas for improvement have been identified, 
processes are in place to ensure that the necessary remedial 
action is taken and that progress is monitored. The Board is 
satisfied that the system of risk management and internal 
control is in accordance with the Guidance.  68

growing, including its membership of the Eliminating 
Child Labour in Tobacco Foundation and its efforts to 
drive high standards from suppliers through its Social 
Responsibility in Tobacco Production (SRTP) programme.

measures to improve safety culture behaviour 
throughout the Group and the recommendation  
for adoption by the Board of a revised Corporate  
Health and Safety Policy. 
 Adherence to the Group’s International Marketing

Sustainability planning and reporting 
 Central and local stakeholder dialogue activities

 A review of the 2010 Sustainability Report, including  
a summary of external feedback and proposed 
enhancements for 2011, and Ernst & Young’s Assurance

Sustainability reporting and progress made against the 
2010 goals and commitments.
During 2011, the Committee considered the feedback from the 
external Board evaluation exercise which took place in 2010, 
including a review of its standard agenda items, and reviewed 
and agreed its programme for 2012.  
CSR governance 
The CSR Committee is supported at regional and local levels 
through combined audit and CSR committees. The structure 
supports the embedding of CSR and sustainability principles 
across the Group and allows performance against those 
principles to be monitored. The regional audit and CSR 
committees meet three times annually, and they follow a 
standard agenda, in order that materials and issues which are 
presented and raised at local and regional level may feed into 
Board level discussions, and vice versa. 
Statement of Business Principles 
Our Statement of Business Principles sets out our expectations 
for the responsible management of the Group’s business. It was 
developed in 2002 in consultation with stakeholders, supported 
by the Institute of Business Ethics. The Statement comprises 
three principles – Mutual Benefit, Responsible Product 
Stewardship and Good Corporate Conduct – and 18 Core 
Beliefs which explain in more detail what each principle  
means for the Group. It is available on www.bat.com.  
Sustainability reporting 
The Company’s Sustainability Reports and, prior to 2008, its  
Social Reports have detailed its social, ethical and environmental 
performance and performance against its commitments  
each year since the Company’s first Social Report in 2002.  70
British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review
Sustainability reporting, like the social reporting that preceded 
it, is conducted using a robust methodology, including 
independent assurance conducted by Ernst & Young LLP, in line 
with the AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008). Engagement with 
key stakeholders is a major requirement of the Standard and we 
have continued to hold independently facilitated and assured 
dialogue with those stakeholders throughout the year. 
The Company’s sustainability reporting is based on its sustainability 
agenda, which was developed in 2007 and focuses on five pillars: 
harm reduction, marketplace, environment, supply chain and 
people and culture. Its aim is to create value for the Company’s 
shareholders and wider society by addressing the Group’s social, 
environmental and economic impacts. 
Starting with the 2009 Report, produced in 2010, a single 
Sustainability Report has been produced for the Group, 
including balanced scorecards and case studies from some  
of the Group’s largest markets. This approach, together with  
the information provided on www.bat.com, aims to provide 
comprehensive coverage of the Group’s sustainability  
efforts globally. 
In March 2011, the Company published its fourth Sustainability 
Report outlining progress in each of the five key elements of its 
sustainability agenda. In March 2012, it is publishing its fifth 
Sustainability Report, to coincide with publication of this  
Annual Report.  
The Company has taken into account the increasing emphasis 
that is being placed on integrated financial and non-financial 
reporting. We believe that it is important to address 
sustainability issues in the Annual Report, but we also 
acknowledge that different audiences have differing 
expectations and requirements. As a result, we intend to 
continue publishing a separate Sustainability Report which 
covers in more detail progress against our sustainability agenda, 
including monitoring performance against targets. In addition 
to the Sustainability Report and the information provided in this 
Annual Report, the Company will continue to publish more 
detailed sustainability information on www.bat.com. 
The Company has been included in both the Dow Jones 
Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) and the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Europe Index (DJSI Europe) for the tenth year 
running. These indices track the economic, environmental and 
social performance of companies that have demonstrated that 
they integrate sustainability into their business. In 2011, the 
Company received a gold rating in the UK’s Business in the 
Community Corporate Responsibility Index, with a score of 94 
per cent. The Company was also included in the STOXX® Global 
ESG Leaders Index, an innovative index that uses a transparent 
selection process to enable investors to fully understand which 
environmental, social and governance factors determine a 
company’s rating. In addition, it won the top award for People 
Reporting in PricewaterhouseCooper’s Building Public Trust 
Awards, the judges referring to the quality of people reporting 
in both the Annual Report, in the context of the Company’s 
business strategy, and the Sustainability Report. 
Corporate social investment 
The Company recognises the role of business as a corporate 
citizen and Group companies have long supported local 
community and charitable projects. The Group’s approach  
to corporate social investment (CSI) is to regard it as an end  
in itself, rather than as a means of promotion, and Group 
companies have always been closely identified with the 
communities where they operate. 
Group companies are encouraged to focus their CSI activities 
around three themes: 
 Sustainable agriculture and the environment: This 
includes activities such as efforts to improve biodiversity 
and access to water, afforestation, programmes to prevent 
child labour, grants for agricultural research and training to 
help farmers optimise land yields by growing additional 
(non-tobacco) crops. These initiatives are expected to 
complement the Group’s own agricultural, environmental 
and biodiversity conservation practices.  
 Civic life: This encompasses activities that aim to enrich 
public and community life, including supporting the arts 
and educational institutions, conserving indigenous 
cultures and restoring public spaces. 
 Empowerment: This focuses on communities where we 
operate, providing people with educational opportunities 
to help them develop, for example through scholarships 
and information technology training or programmes 
supporting small businesses and promoting entrepreneurship. 
Group companies also continue to make other important 
contributions to meet local needs, such as relief efforts after 
natural disasters or programmes focused on HIV/AIDS. 
The major activities currently supported by the Company are 
the British American Tobacco Biodiversity Partnership and the 
Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation. 
Charitable contributions 
Payments for charitable purposes in 2011 amounted to  
£13.7 million (2010: £15.5 million), £1.9 million of which  
was paid in the UK (2010: £2 million). 
OECD Guidelines 
The Group recognises its responsibilities to the countries  
in which it operates and in this context, notes the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises in their current form. 
Our approach to human rights draws on the OECD Guidelines, 
in addition to the UN Declaration of Human Rights, and further 
information in this respect is provided in our Sustainability 
Report. Full details of a specific finding against our company  
in Malaysia under the Guidelines are provided in the full  
online report on www.bat.com.

Notes: 
1. Ann Godbehere became a member with effect from 24 October 2011. 
2. Dr Ana Maria Llopis ceased to be a member of the Committee following 
her retirement as a Non-Executive Director at the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2011. 
Sir Nicholas Scheele was unable to attend one meeting of the Nominations 
Committee due to a long-standing prior engagement. 
The Chief Executive and Management Board member responsible for Human 
Resources regularly attend meetings by invitation but are not members. 
Summary Terms of Reference 
The Nominations Committee is responsible for: 
 reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Main 
Board and Management Board to ensure that both boards 
have an appropriate balance of skills, expertise, knowledge 
and (in the case of the Main Board) independence; 
 reviewing the succession plans for the Executive Directors 
and members of the Management Board; 
 ensuring that the procedure for appointing new Directors 
is rigorous and transparent and that appointments  
are made on merit against objective criteria and with  
due regard for the benefits of diversity, including  
gender diversity;  
 making recommendations to the Board on suitable 
candidates for appointment as Main Board Directors  
or as members of the Management Board; and 
 assessing the time needed to fulfil the roles of Chairman, 
Senior Independent Director and Non-Executive Director, 
and ensuring that Non-Executive Directors undertake that 
they will have sufficient time to fulfil their duties. 
The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed in December 
2010 and minor updates were made with effect from 1 January 
2011. The full terms of reference are available on www.bat.com.
The Nominations Committee is responsible for identifying 
candidates to fill vacancies on the Board. This process includes 
an evaluation of the skills and experience to be looked for in 
those candidates to ensure continuing Board balance. The 
selection process will generally involve interviews with a 
selection of candidates, using the services of external search 
firms specialising in board level recruitment to identify and 
shortlist appropriate candidates. This process was followed for 
the recruitment of Ann Godbehere, who was shortlisted by an 
external consultancy and interviewed by the Chairman and 
Executive Directors and by members of the Nominations 
Committee, which then recommended her appointment to the 
Board. The Committee and the Board specifically considered her 
other commitments and satisfied themselves that she was able 
to devote sufficient time to her role as a Non-Executive Director 
of the Company.  
Further non-executive appointments remain under active 
consideration. 
Appointments to the Board  72

Appointments to the Board continued 
Key activities of the Nominations 
Committee in 2011 
The Nominations Committee held four meetings during 
2011, two of which were scheduled and two of which were 
convened to address Main Board and Management Board 
succession issues. The specific items considered by the 
Committee included: 
 The role specification for the appointment of additional 
Non-Executive Directors including, in particular, the  
skills required effectively to influence and provide 
constructive challenge. 
 Revised standard terms of appointment for Non-
Executive Directors, updated to reflect the provisions  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code and to specify  
the expected time commitment for the induction  
process (see the section on information and  
professional development). 
 The recruitment of Ann Godbehere and her appointment 
to the Board as a Non-Executive Director, with the 
assistance of an external recruitment consultancy,  
and the continuing search for a candidate with  
Asian experience. 
 The steps being taken to search for further potential 
non-executive appointments. 
 Changes in the composition of the Management  
Board, including:  
- the appointment of Giovanni Giordano in the role of 
Group HR Director with effect from 1 June 2011; 
- the exchange of roles between Mark Cobben and 
Jack Bowles, with the appointment of Mark Cobben 
as Regional Director, Western Europe and of Jack 
Bowles as Regional Director, Americas; 
- the appointment to the Management Board of 
Kingsley Wheaton as Deputy Group Corporate & 
Regulatory Affairs Director with effect from 1 January 
2012, to replace Michael Prideaux on his forthcoming 
retirement in June 2012; and 
- the creation of two new roles on the Management 
Board, namely Group Scientific Director and Business 
Development Director, and the appointment of Dr 
David O’Reilly and Naresh Sethi respectively in these 
roles with effect from 1 January 2012. 
 An overview of succession planning for the Executive 
Directors and members of the Management Board. 
During 2011, the Committee also considered a report prepared 
by the Company Secretary on its effectiveness, as assessed 
during the evaluation of the Board in 2010, including a  
review of its membership, frequency of meeting and  
regular terms of business.  
Terms of appointment to the Board 
The Executive Directors have rolling contracts of one year. The 
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the 
Company but instead have letters of appointment. Since 2010, 
all Non-Executive Directors have terms of appointment of one 
year only which are considered for renewal around the time of 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting when, in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code, each Director is 
subject to election or re-election by the shareholders (see 
below). Details of the Company’s policy on Executive Directors’ 
service contracts and the terms of appointment for Non-
Executive Directors are set out in the remuneration report. 
The Board continues to take in to account the need for it 
progressively to refresh its membership over time. Non-
Executive Directors will normally be expected to serve for six 
years. They may be invited to serve for longer, but service 
beyond nine years is unlikely. Any additional service beyond six 
years will be subject to particularly rigorous review.  
Directors’ interests and indemnities 
Further details of Directors’ contracts and letters of appointment, 
remuneration and emoluments, and their interests in the shares 
of the Company (including interests in share options and 
deferred shares) as at 31 December 2011 are given in the 
remuneration report. No Director had any material interest  
in a contract of significance (other than a service contract)  
with the Company or any subsidiary company during the year. 
The Company has arranged appropriate insurance to provide 
cover in the event of legal action against its Directors and also 
provides indemnities to its Directors in accordance with the 
Company’s Articles of Association and to the maximum extent 
permitted by law. As at the date of this report, such indemnities 
are in force covering any costs, charges, expenses or liabilities 
which they may incur in or about the execution of their duties 
to the Company or to any entity which is an associated 
company (as defined in Section 256 of the Companies Act 
2006), or as a result of duties performed by the Directors on 
behalf of the Company or any such associated company.  73

Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review
Board diversity 
The Board recognises the benefits of diversity in its widest  
sense, both at Board level and throughout all levels within the 
organisation. Diversity takes many forms: gender is one aspect, 
but other important attributes to consider will include, for 
example, nationality and background.  
For a number of years, the Company has benefited from the 
presence on its Board of female Non-Executive Directors.  
During its search for additional Non-Executive Directors in  
2011, culminating in the appointment of Ann Godbehere, the 
Company made clear to its external search consultancies that 
male-only shortlists of candidates would not be accepted.  
The current level of female representation on the Board stands 
at 25 per cent, the 2015 aspirational target level of female 
representation on Boards for FTSE 100 companies, as set out  
in the report by Lord Davies entitled Women on Boards. The 
Company hopes to at least maintain, and possibly to increase, 
this level of representation when refreshing and renewing Board 
membership over the coming years. However, such aspirations 
will always be subject to the overriding need to ensure that 
appointments are made on merit and having regard to an 
appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence  
and knowledge required on the Board. The Board will  
continue to take into account diversity, in all its forms,  
when making appointments.  
Lord Davies’s report also examines gender diversity at management 
levels below the Board. Whilst the Company has a number of 
initiatives to improve gender diversity at senior management 
levels, the Board recognises that these will take time to be 
reflected in the numbers of senior women in the Group. The 
recently appointed Group HR Director will be taking this 
forward in 2012.  
The Board will continue to review and report further on the 
Company’s approach to diversity and related ambitions, 
particularly in the context of any developing guidance in  
this area. 
Annual General Meeting 2012 
The Company will be submitting all eligible Directors for re-
election or, in the case of Ann Godbehere, election for the first 
time at this year’s Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2012.

The Company’s Articles of Association provide that any Director 
who has been appointed by the Board since the last Annual 
General Meeting is required to retire from the Board at the next 
Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, may offer himself 
or herself for reappointment. Accordingly, Ann Godbehere will 
retire and offer herself for reappointment in accordance with 
these provisions. 
Non-Executive Directors who serve for a total of more than six 
years are subject to a particularly rigorous review. This was 
done in 2011 in the case of Robert Lerwill and Sir Nicholas 
Scheele, both of whom have served in excess of six years, and 
Anthony Ruys, who will have served in excess of six years at the 
time of the 2012 Annual General Meeting.  
The Chairman’s letter accompanying the Notice for this year’s 
Annual General Meeting confirms that the performance of  
the Directors being proposed for re-election continues to be 
effective and that they continue to demonstrate commitment  
to their roles as Non-Executive Directors, including commitment 
of the necessary time for Board and Committee meetings  
and other duties. Biographical details of the Directors  
are also provided.  74

Anthony Ruys 
Chairman, Remuneration Committee 
Overview 
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am very much 
aware that the last 12 months have seen increasing debate 
surrounding executive remuneration. The proposals announced by 
the Business Secretary in January 2012 which include increased 
transparency of reporting and more shareholder power to agree a 
company’s future pay policy show just how far that debate has 
come. British American Tobacco has been active in contributing its 
views to that discussion. We responded to the consultation 
document issued by the Department for Business, Innovation and 
Skills on Executive Remuneration and on the linked consultation 
document on Narrative Reporting. We are broadly supportive of 
those proposals that aim to link pay to a company’s performance 
and to increase transparency for shareholders. Indeed, we have for 
many years aimed to build a strong link between the Company’s 
performance and the level of remuneration received by the 
Executive Directors and the senior management team. Our 
incentive schemes are designed to closely reflect the Group’s key 
performance measures and we listen to shareholders on how our 
reporting may be improved. 
It seems that others also believe we are on the right track. In 
November 2011 we were awarded the PricewaterhouseCoopers 
“Building Public Trust Award for FTSE 100 Executive Remuneration 
Reporting”. I am clear that whilst the final details of the regulatory 
proposals on executive remuneration have yet to be determined, 
the Company is already relatively well placed to meet the 
Government’s objectives. 
Summary of key activities in 2011 
Following on from the review undertaken by the Remuneration 
Committee in 2010, and the consultation with key shareholders at 
the end of that year and into 2011, last year our shareholders 
agreed to amend the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The 
new rules increased the maximum annual award under the LTIP 
scheme from 300 per cent to 400 per cent of annual base salary 
and also introduced a ‘clawback’ clause giving the Committee the 
discretion to reduce (or to forfeit entirely) a participant’s unvested 
award. This would be considered in circumstances where there had 
been a material misrepresentation involving the participant in 
connection with a prior vested award.  
We had also discussed with shareholders our desire to reduce 
the number of performance measures from six to four for the 
International Executive Incentive Scheme (IEIS) and at the 
suggestion of a number of shareholders we also increased  
the proportion of salary that Executive Directors are required  
to hold as shares under our shareholding guidelines. 
These measures were all implemented in 2011 and I am 
confident that the revised reward structure for the Executive 
Directors and members of the Management Board further 
improves the alignment between remuneration and the delivery 
of the Group’s strategy.  
Committee evaluation 
During 2011, the Remuneration Committee also discussed the 
report on its own effectiveness, prepared following the 2010 
Board evaluation; the key recommendation of which had been 
to review the size and composition of the Committee. Members 
of the Committee had a very fruitful discussion and while the 
creation of a smaller committee was considered, the current 
external profile of remuneration, generally, led them to believe 
that all Directors, at least for the time being, should be involved 
in remuneration issues. The Committee therefore continues to 
be made up of all independent Directors. Our discussions did 
however, lead to a number of significant changes for the 
Committee. These include at least one additional remuneration 
meeting being scheduled in 2012 as well as a revised agenda 
for each meeting and more regular discussions between 
shareholders and me over remuneration proposals. Full details 
of this review and its outcomes are set out elsewhere in this 
report. However, I am pleased that the Committee has looked in 
detail at the way in which it works and that we have some 
positive proposals to further improve our approach to executive 
remuneration and reporting.
We have for many
years aimed to build a 
strong link between the 
Company’s performance 
and the level of 
remuneration received 
by the Executive Directors 
and the senior 
management team.

Note: 
Those Directors who were absent from one or more meetings were either 
unable to attend a meeting arranged at short notice or had a long-standing 
prior engagement. 
No Executive Director or Management Board member plays any 
part in determining his or her own remuneration. During the year 
ended 31 December 2011, both the Chief Executive and the 
Chairman were consulted and invited to attend meetings of the 
Committee, except when their own remuneration was under 
consideration. In determining remuneration for the year, the 
Committee considered reports from Deloitte LLP, the Committee’s 
remuneration consultants, and also consulted the Chief Executive, 
the member of the Management Board responsible for Human 
Resources and the Group Head of Reward.  76

The Remuneration Committee is authorised by the Board  
to seek any information it requires from, and require the 
attendance at any of its meetings of, any Director or member  
of management, and all employees are expected to cooperate 
with any request made by the Committee. The Committee is 
authorised by the Board to obtain, at the Company’s expense, 
outside legal or other independent professional advice if it 
considers this necessary. 
Deloitte LLP provided remuneration services and advice to the 
Remuneration Committee throughout the year at a cost of 
£101,800. Deloitte is an international professional services firm 
which, during the year, has also provided tax, corporate finance

of the Company’s share schemes. 
Evaluation of the Remuneration Committee
In October 2011, the Remuneration Committee discussed  
and considered the report on its effectiveness following the 
externally facilitated Board evaluation of 2010 with the 
following outcomes: 
 remuneration consultants – it was confirmed that the 
remuneration consultants (Deloitte) performed well in 
providing external views and benchmarking information  
to the Remuneration Committee in a manner that was 
independent from the Company; 
 size of the committee – it was recognised that the 
Committee was in the minority among comparable 
companies in having all or nearly all of its Non-Executive 
Directors as members of the Committee; however, the 
Committee concluded that, as these arrangements did not 
impair its effectiveness, and given the current external profile 
of remuneration issues, generally, that this membership 
profile of the Committee should continue for the time being; 
 number of meetings and agenda development – in 
recognition of the increasing workload of the Committee it 
was agreed that the number of meetings of the Committee 
be increased from two to at least three scheduled meetings 
each year (to include private sessions without management 
present) and with an appropriately revised calendar of 
agenda items; 
 oversight – it was agreed, following a trial at the meeting  
of the Committee in February 2011, to provide greater 
formality to the reporting of the appraisal process and 
associated outcomes for the Executive Directors and 
members of the Management Board; and 
 consultation process with institutional shareholders  
– it was agreed that the Chairman of the Committee would  
seek regular meetings with institutional shareholders on 
remuneration matters irrespective of whether there might 
be any formal matters requiring shareholders’ approval.  
Key activities of the Remuneration 
Committee in 2011 
The Remuneration Committee met five times during 2011.  
The Committee followed its regular work programme designed 
around its two scheduled meetings in February and October 
each year at which it: 
 benchmarked, reviewed and set the salaries for the 
Executive Directors and the Management Board members 
taking into account the pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group, and particularly in the UK; 
 assessed the achievement of the targets for the 2010 IEIS 
award and set the IEIS targets for 2011; 
 assessed the measurement of the performance conditions 
for the vesting of the LTIP 2008 award; 
 determined the LTIP awards for March 2011 (the general 
LTIP population) and May 2011 (Executive Directors and 
members of the Management Board) and their associated 
performance conditions; 
 assessed the achievement of the targets for the 2010  
Share Reward Scheme award and set the targets for the 
2011 award; 
 monitored the continued application of the Company’s 
shareholding guidelines for the Executive Directors and  
the Management Board members; 
 maintained oversight of the Group’s salary review processes 
to ensure consistency of application; and 
 reviewed the remuneration report for the year ended 2010 
prior to its approval by the Board and subsequent approval 
by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in April 2011.  
In addition, the Remuneration Committee considered the 
following:
 feedback from the consultation with the Company’s largest 
shareholders in connection with the proposed changes to 
the LTIP and IEIS prior to the recommendation of revised 
proposals to the Board in February 2011; 
 changes to the Company’s shareholding guidelines 
requiring an increase in the amount of shares to be held  
by the Executive Directors from 1 May 2011;  
 the application of the Group’s policy on returning expatriate 
employees in respect of John Daly’s relocation from Hong 
Kong back to the UK in late 2010;  
 the terms of appointment and termination in connection 
with Management Board appointments and departures 
during the year;  
 the constituents of the Pay Comparator Group for the 2012 
salary review and agreed to review the current criteria and 
constituent companies during 2012, for use in the 2013 
salary review; 
 a review of the report on the effectiveness of the 
Remuneration Committee as outlined above; and

 consideration of the impact of the tax treatment of UK pensions 
benefits for applicable Executive Directors and members of the 
Management Board following legislative changes. 
Remuneration policy: Group reward strategy 
The Company adopts a straightforward approach to remuneration. 
The remuneration package comprises core fixed elements (base 
salary, pension and other benefits) as well as performance-
based variable elements (a single cash and share incentive 
annual bonus plan (IEIS), and a single long-term incentive 
scheme (LTIP)) with the performance based elements forming 
approximately 60 per cent of the total remuneration package. 
These arrangements are very much ‘plain vanilla’ and it is rare 
that the Remuneration Committee is called upon to exercise  
its discretion. 
Financially based Group key performance indicators (KPIs) form 
the basis for the majority of the performance-related bonus 
incentives with market share being an important additional 
non-financial indicator. The Executive Directors and the 
members of the Management Board are also held accountable 
for their performance in respect of the business measures which 
comprise a mixture of other financial and non-financial targets. 
Taken together, these elements provide a comprehensive set  
of challenging performance criteria which sit alongside the 
Company’s positive position on sustainability and governance 
issues. Payouts and grants under the respective incentive 
schemes are directly linked to the Company’s objectives, 
achieving a high level of alignment with the long-term  
interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
The current Executive Directors’ percentage of fixed and variable 
remuneration for 2011 is illustrated in the bar chart below. This is 
based on a number of assumptions: (1) base salary represents 
annual salary; (2) pension represents the annual service cost to  
the Company as calculated in accordance with IAS24 (Nicandro 
Durante’s transfer value is based on constant exchange rates); (3) 
benefits are core benefits such as car allowance, private medical 
and personal accident insurance; (4) bonus is the amount received 
for performance in 2011 delivered in cash and deferred shares;  
and (5) LTIP represents the target annualised expected value of  
the long-term incentive award granted in 2011 expressed as a 
percentage of base salary. Fixed remuneration comprises: salary, 
pension and benefits. Variable remuneration comprises: bonus 
(cash and deferred shares) and LTIP. 
Remuneration policy: risk management 
The Company’s strategy clearly underpins the remuneration 
policy for all employees. In particular, performance criteria for 
the IEIS are aligned to the Group’s KPIs (see business review) 
with no individual performance objectives. Awards under the 
LTIP only vest to the extent that total shareholder returns and 
earnings per share have met appropriate thresholds. The design 
of the IEIS and its positioning as the Company’s sole bonus 
scheme means that the risk of inappropriate individual 
behaviour to drive reward opportunities is minimised. The 
annual outcomes of the IEIS’s four measures for performance 
are reviewed by the Group’s external auditors and internal audit 
also provides a control framework (see audit and accountability 
in the corporate governance statement). The Remuneration 
Committee is therefore confident that there are clear processes 
in place to provide sufficient comfort that the Company only 
rewards true and verified performance. 
Benchmarking of remuneration 
The setting of remuneration for Executive Directors remains 
underpinned by responsible independent benchmarking.  
The approach is focused on a peer group which is made up of 
companies which meet the criteria of a consumer goods focus, 
an international spread of operations and a competitor for top 
management talent. It includes selected FTSE 100 companies 
and, the Group’s key competitor, Philip Morris International 
(the Pay Comparator Group). This is supplemented by market 
data of listed companies of a similar size and complexity to the 
Company, as well as the practice of the FTSE 30 companies. The 
Pay Comparator Group as at 31 December 2011 is set out below.

BP Reed Elsevier 
BT Group Royal Dutch Shell 
British Sky Broadcasting SABMiller 
Diageo Tesco

the Company 
– base salary is pensionable 
2011 Update – no change to policy 
The process of salary review for the Executive Directors and the 
Management Board members undertaken by the Remuneration 
Committee initially takes into account outcomes applied to the 
salary review process for senior managers and other levels in the 
organisation. The Committee then applies the key policy 
principles set out in the table above.

The Management Board members will receive salary increases 
averaging around 4.9 per cent; centre-based UK employees will 
receive salary increases averaging around 4.0 per cent in each 
case with effect from 1 April 2012. Actual rises have been based 
on each individual’s contribution and performance and account 
is also taken of current UK market conditions to ensure that 
individual salaries are competitive. 
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain 
benefits in kind, principally: a car or car allowance; the use of a 
driver; the installation and then maintenance of home security 
systems; tax advice (where appropriate); and private medical 
and personal life and accident insurance. With the exception of 
the car or car allowance it is also the practice of the Company  
to pay the tax which may be due on any such benefits.  
Performance-related bonus – International 
Executive Incentive Scheme (IEIS) 
Purpose – incentivise the attainment of corporate 
targets on an annual basis 
Delivery – annual award 
– 50 per cent cash 
– 50 per cent shares (deferred shares 
through the Deferred Share Bonus 
Scheme) 
– dividend equivalent payment 
Policy – four measures for performance for 2011 
(reduced from six for 2010) with the 
following weightings: adjusted profit from 
operations (40 per cent); Group’s share of 
key subsidiary markets (20 per cent); Global 
Drive Brand volume (20 per cent); and cash 
flow from operations (20 per cent) 
– the annual ‘on-target’ bonus opportunity 
for the Chief Executive is 100 per cent of 
base salary with a maximum award of  
200 per cent of salary, and for the Chief 
Operating Officer and the Finance Director 
and Chief Information Officer the ‘on-
target’ bonus opportunity is 90 per cent 
with a maximum award of 180 per cent 
– for the Management Board the ‘on-target’ 
bonus opportunity is 67.5 per cent of the 
base salary with a maximum award of  
135 per cent of salary 
– awards are non-pensionable 
2011 Update – structure and potential bonus opportunity 
remain unchanged 
– introduction of four measures for 
performance for 2011 as above 
The IEIS rewards short-term business performance within the 
context of longer-term sustainability. Appropriately stretching 
business and financial performance targets are set by the 
Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each year. The 
annual bonus opportunity for 2011 remained unchanged although 
the previous six measures were reduced to four with the applicable 
weightings as referred to above. These four performance measures 
provide a simplified and appropriate mix of criteria that look to 
assess the vitality and performance of the Company while still 
providing full clarity for both shareholders and eligible participants 
about the required areas of performance. 
Relevant performance points for each of the four measures are: 
‘threshold’ (which must be exceeded to attract any bonus 
payout in respect of that measure); ‘target’(which amounts to 
the budgeted performance); and ‘maximum’ (the level of 
performance, exceeding budget, and at which the bonus 
payout for that measure is capped). No element of the bonus is 
guaranteed and, as in previous years, the specific performance 
targets are commercially sensitive and not made public.

Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review
For senior managers only the total payouts reflect performance at a 
global, regional, area or end market level, as applicable to their 
roles. The annual bonus opportunity for senior managers remained 
unchanged in 2011(with the exception of the alignment to four 
performance measures) with the annual ‘on-target’ bonus 
opportunity being 45 per cent of base salary with a normal 
maximum award of 90 per cent of salary rising to 135 per cent of 
base salary in cases of excellent performance. The award for senior 
managers continues to be delivered in variable proportions split 
between cash and deferred shares according to grade. 
In February each year, the Committee receives a report allowing 
it to assess the extent to which each of the performance 
measures has been achieved. Subject to the Committee 
exercising its judgment with regard to the Company’s overall 
performance, the total payout is determined by the Company’s 
performance for each measure relative to that measure’s 
performance points. 
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2011, the 
performance against the measures and the total payouts under 
the IEIS were:

Paul Adams retired as Chief Executive on 28 February 2011 and 
ceased to be an employee of the Company from that date. In 
accordance with the rules of the IEIS, his performance-related 
bonus in respect of the first two months of the year ended  
31 December 2011 is pro-rated as an ‘on-target’ amount 
payable as a 100 per cent cash bonus instead of 50 per cent  
in cash and 50 per cent in deferred shares. 
For senior managers whose bonus was linked to global 
performance the total payout under the IEIS in respect of  
the year ended 31 December 2011 was 135 per cent (2010: 
96.9 per cent), paid 94.5 per cent in cash and 40.5 per cent 
in deferred shares. 
Awards made under the Deferred Share Bonus Scheme are in the 
form of free ordinary shares in the Company which are normally 
held in trust for three years and no further performance conditions 
apply in that period. This element of ‘reward deferral’ has been a 
key element of the Company’s bonus structure for a number of 
years and, in certain circumstances, such as resigning before the 
end of the three year period, participants may forfeit the shares.  
The Remuneration Committee encourages a culture of ‘ownership’ 
of these awarded shares and participants receive a cash sum 
equivalent to the dividend on the after-tax position of all unvested 
ordinary shares held in the Deferred Share Bonus Scheme at the 
dividend record date.  80

Long-term incentives 
Purpose – incentivise growth in earnings per share 
and total shareholder return (TSR) over a 
three year period 
Delivery – discretionary annual award 
– awards of shares 
– variable due to performance over three 
year period 
– dividend equivalent payment 
Policy – maximum annual award of 400 per cent 
of salary 
– three year performance period 
– TSR performance (50 per cent of the total 
award) combines both the share price and 
dividend performance during the three 
year performance period as against two 
comparator groups (25 per cent for each 
measure): (1) constituents of the FTSE 100 
Index; and (2) a peer group of FMCG 
companies
– earnings per share measure (50 per cent 
of the total award) relates to earnings per 
share growth (on an adjusted diluted 
basis) relative to inflation 
2011 Update – shareholders approved an increase in  
the maximum annual award under the 
LTIP scheme rules from 300 per cent to 
400 per cent of annual base salary 
– LTIP awards made in May 2011 were 
made at 400 per cent of annual base 
salary for the Chief Executive and at 300 
per cent for the other Executive Directors 
– the introduction of a discretionary power 
to reduce/forfeit unvested awards in the 
event of material misrepresentation 
– all other elements of the LTIP remain 
unchanged
The long-term element of remuneration continues to be 
delivered through the Company’s LTIP. All the Executive 
Directors, Management Board members and senior employees 
participate in the Long-Term Incentive Plan adopted in 2007 
(the 2007 LTIP) – the successor plan to the 1998 LTIP. The 2007 
LTIP provides for awards of free ordinary shares, provided 
demanding and appropriately stretching performance 
conditions are met over a three year period. 
Award levels
The current award levels for Executive Directors and Management 
Board members are set out in the table below. Senior managers 
receive awards of 75 per cent or 25 per cent of salary dependent  
on grade.

Since 2005, participants have been entitled to receive a dividend 
equivalent payment to the value of the dividends that they would 
have received as shareholders on their vesting awards. The LTIP 
dividend equivalent payment continues to be important in  
aligning further the interests of senior management with those of 
shareholders. The values of the LTIP dividend equivalent payments 
for the Executive Directors are shown as individual emoluments in 
Tables 4 and 5.  
Following assessment by the Remuneration Committee, LTIP 
awards may only be normally exercisable after three years to the 
extent that the performance conditions are satisfied in accordance 
with the measures set out above at the end of the three year 
performance period. Any proportion of an award that lapses does 
not attract the payment of the LTIP dividend equivalent payment.  
Performance 
The percentage of award vesting is based on a combination of total 
shareholder return (TSR) and earnings per share (EPS) performance 
conditions measured over a three year period. The Remuneration 
Committee periodically reviews the suitability of TSR and EPS as 
performance measures but continues to believe that the current 
combination of measures provides an important balance of 
measures relevant to the Group’s business and market conditions 
as well as providing a common goal for the Executive Directors,  
the Management Board members and shareholders.  
TSR performance condition 
A total of 50 per cent of the total award is based on the 
Company’s TSR performance against two comparator groups 
(25 per cent for each measure): (1) the constituents of the 
London Stock Exchange’s FTSE 100 Index at the beginning of 
the performance period; and (2) a peer group of international 
FMCG companies. In the event of upper quartile performance 
by the Company relative to the comparator groups above,  
25 per cent of the total award vests in full. From 2008, 6 per 
cent of the total award vests for median performance. There is 
pro rata vesting between these two points. The TSR portions of 
an LTIP award do not vest for below median performance.

TSR continues to be measured according to the return index 
calculated by Datastream and reviewed by the Company’s 
independent advisers. It is measured on the basis that all 
companies’ dividends are reinvested in the shares of those 
companies. The return is the percentage increase in each 
company’s index over the three year performance period. The 
opening and closing indices for this calculation are respectively the 
average of the index numbers for the last quarter preceding the 
performance period and for the last quarter of the final year of that 
performance period – this methodology is employed to reflect 
movements of the indices over that time as accurately as possible.  
A local currency basis is used for the purposes of TSR measurement. 
This approach is considered to have the benefits of simplicity and 
directness of comparison with the performance of the comparator 
companies and is in line with the historic approach taken by the 
Remuneration Committee for the purposes of TSR measurement.  
EPS performance condition 
Half of the award is based on earnings per share growth relative to 
inflation. This element of the award will vest in full if EPS growth over 
the three year performance period is an average of at least 8 per cent 
per annum in excess of inflation. Eight per cent of the award will vest 
if the EPS growth over the performance period is 3 per cent in excess 
of inflation. An award will vest on a pro rata basis between these two 
points. None of the EPS portion of an award vests if EPS growth is less 
than 3 per cent per annum in excess of inflation.  
These EPS targets are consistent with and support the Company’s 
strategy to deliver high single-digit EPS growth (on average) over 
the medium to long term. The Remuneration Committee reviewed 
the EPS targets as part of its review of long-term incentives in 2010 
and the consultation with key shareholders at the end of 2010 and 
early 2011. It concluded that the current targets continue to be 
appropriately stretching.  
For awards made up to and including 2008, growth in EPS for 
these purposes is calculated on an adjusted diluted EPS basis using 
a formula which incorporates: (1) the adjusted diluted EPS for the 
year prior to the start of the first performance period and then for 
the first, second and third years of that performance period; and  
(2) retail price index (RPI) for the last month of the year immediately 
preceding the performance period and then the RPI for the 
respective first, second and third years of that performance period.  
Since the LTIP award made in March 2009, EPS performance is 
measured as an increase in adjusted diluted EPS between the base 
year and the final year of the performance period, expressed as an 
annual growth rate over the period. Under this approach, only the 
base year and final year adjusted diluted EPS results are considered. 
However, on the basis that rolling annual awards are made, all 
years of performance ultimately will be taken into account in 
calculating EPS growth over time. This change was made in order 
to simplify the approach and to bring it into line with prevailing 
market practice. Where EPS grows at a relatively constant rate, the 
two methodologies will produce broadly similar results, although 
the outcome will differ for different growth profiles. Both methods 
are considered to be fair and reasonable measures of performance.  
Vesting of LTIP award made in 2009 
An LTIP award was made to Executive Directors and Management 
Board members on 27 March 2009 with the performance period 
being completed at 31 December 2011 (the 2009 Award). The 
Remuneration Committee has assessed the performance of the 
Company against the two performance conditions. On the TSR 
measure, the Company ranked 21st out of the FTSE 100 group of 
companies, giving a vesting of 25 per cent for performance at the 
upper quartile. A vesting of 25 per cent was also achieved for 
ranking 5th out of the peer group of international FMCG companies, 
this also being upper quartile. EPS growth was 10.8 per cent per 
annum in excess of inflation. The overall assessment of both  
LTIP measures, therefore, resulted in a vesting of 100 per cent  
of the award.   82

In accordance with the rules of the 2007 LTIP, the Remuneration 
Committee also resolved that the participants would receive an LTIP 
dividend equivalent payment on the vesting of their 2009 awards.

Performance graph 
Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 requires that the 
Company must provide a graph comparing the TSR performance 
of a hypothetical holding of shares in the Company with a broad 
equity market index over a five year period. In this context, the 
Directors have again chosen to illustrate the performance of TSR 
against the FTSE 100 Index over a five year period, commencing on 
1 January 2007. In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE 100 Index 
is the most appropriate index against which TSR should be 
measured because it is a widely used and understood index of 
broadly similar sized UK companies to the Company. The 
performance graph is shown on this page.  
LTIPs – change of control 
The rules of the 2007 LTIP provide that in the event of a change

Committee determines this not to be appropriate in the 
circumstances. In addition, the 2007 LTIP allows (as an 
alternative to early release) that participants may, if permitted, 
exchange their LTIP awards for new awards of shares in the 
acquiring company on a comparable basis.  
All-Employee Share Scheme 
The Executive Directors, Management Board members and 
senior managers are also eligible to participate in the following 
all-employee share schemes which are designed to incentivise 
employees of the Group by giving them opportunities to build a 
shareholding in the Company: the British American Tobacco 
Sharesave Scheme (Sharesave Scheme) and the Employee  
Share Ownership Plan.  
Sharesave Scheme 
The Sharesave Scheme is approved by HM Revenue & Customs 
(HMRC). Eligible employees, including the Executive Directors and 
Management Board members, have been granted employee 
savings-related share options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the 
Company. Following a review of its timetable for making grants of 
options under the Sharesave Scheme, the Company has, since 
March 2011, introduced a practice of making grants of options 
under the Sharesave Scheme at that time each year following its 
Preliminary Announcement. Options are granted to be exercisable 
in conjunction with either a three year or five year savings contract 
up to a monthly limit of £250. Options are normally granted at  
a discount of 20 per cent to the market price at the time of the 
invitation, as permitted under the rules of the Sharesave Scheme.  
At 31 December 2011, Nicandro Durante and Ben Stevens each 
held options under the Sharesave Scheme.  
Employee Share Ownership Plan 
The Employee Share Ownership Plan is an HMRC-approved 
share incentive plan, which incorporates a Partnership and  
Free Shares element. The Partnership Share Scheme is open  
to all eligible employees, including Executive Directors and 
Management Board members. Employees can allocate part of 
their pre-tax salary to purchase shares in the Company. The 
maximum amount that can be allocated in this way is £1,500  
in any year. Shares purchased are held in a UK-based trust, 
normally capable of transfer to participants tax-free after a five 
year holding period. At 31 December 2011, Nicandro Durante 
participated in the Partnership Share Scheme.  
The Company also operates the Free Shares element of the plan, 
known as the Share Reward Scheme. Under this Scheme, eligible 
employees (including Executive Directors and members of the 
Management Board) receive an award of shares in April of each 
year in which the Scheme operates in respect of performance in  
the previous financial year. An award of £3,000 will be made  
to Executive Directors and Management Board members on  
2 April 2012 in respect of the year ended 31 December 2011. The 
performance conditions are aligned to those set for the IEIS in 
respect of the same performance period. The plan shares are held in 
a UK-based trust for a minimum period of three years and during 
that time the trust will exercise its voting rights as directed by the 
plan’s participants. The maximum individual award under the  
Share Reward Scheme is £3,000.  
Options and awards outstanding 
To satisfy the future exercise of awards or options under the 
Group’s employee share schemes, ordinary shares are acquired 
in the market by the Group’s employee share ownership trusts 
or the Company issues new shares.  
During the year, new ordinary shares were issued by the Company 
in relation to the Sharesave Scheme and to certain participants in 
the Share Option Scheme resident outside the UK.  
Under the Sharesave Scheme, a total of 881,940 options  
over ordinary shares in the Company were outstanding at  
31 December 2011. The options outstanding under the 
Sharesave Scheme are exercisable until September 2016 at 
option prices ranging from 1,152p to 1,974p.  
The British American Tobacco Group 
Employee Trust (BATGET) 
BATGET is used to satisfy the vesting and exercise of awards of 
ordinary shares made under the Deferred Share Bonus Scheme, and 
the 1998 LTIP and the 2007 LTIP as well as the exercise of options 
under the Share Option Scheme. The number of shares held in 
BATGET to satisfy outstanding awards is consistently monitored by 
a committee of senior management that reports to the Board’s 
Employee Share Schemes Committee. BATGET is funded by 
interest-free loan facilities from the Company totalling £600 million, 
enabling the trust to facilitate the purchase of ordinary shares to 
satisfy the future vesting or exercise of options and awards. The 
loan to BATGET amounted to £424 million at 31 December 2011 
(2010: £325 million). The loan is either repaid from the proceeds of 
the exercise of options or, in the case of ordinary shares acquired by 
BATGET to satisfy the vesting and exercise of awards, the Company 
will subsequently waive the loan provided over the life of the 
awards. If the options lapse, ordinary shares may be sold by 
BATGET to cover the loan repayment.  
Details of the ordinary shares in the Company held by BATGET 
are set out below.

BATGET currently waives dividends on the ordinary shares held 
by it. BATGET waived payment of the final dividend for 2010 of 
£9.0 million in May 2011 and the interim dividend for 2011 of 
£4.8 million in September 2011.  
While shares are held by BATGET, the trustee does not exercise  
any voting rights. However, as soon as shares held in BATGET are 
transferred out to share scheme participants, the participants may 
exercise the voting rights attaching to those shares.  
Details of the Company’s material share-based payment 
arrangements, reflecting both equity share-based and cash-settled 
share-based arrangements, are set out in note 27 on the accounts.   84

Shareholding guidelines 
The Remuneration Committee’s guidelines require Executive 
Directors to hold shares in the Company equal to the value  
of a percentage of salary as set out below and excludes shares 
earned but not yet vested under Company share plans. 
Management Board members are also required to hold shares in 
the Company equal to the value of 100 per cent of their salary.

John Daly, who was appointed an Executive Director and Chief 
Operating Officer on 1 September 2010, is currently subject to the 
transitional provisions in place for those Executive Directors and 
Management Board members who do not meet the requirements of 
the shareholding guidelines upon appointment. In such cases, 
individuals may, generally, only sell a maximum of up to 50 per cent 
of any shares vesting (after tax) under Company share plans until the 
threshold under the shareholding guidelines has been met.  
The interests of the Directors of the Company in the ordinary 
shares of the Company are shown in Table 6. 
Executive Directors’ pension benefits 
Purpose – provision of competitive post-retirement 
benefits
Delivery – British American Tobacco UK Pension  
Fund and Company supplementary 
pension arrangements 
– monthly/quarterly pension payment 
Policy – pension accrues at one-fortieth of annual 
base salary 
– Fund normal pensionable age of 60 
– maximum pension payable will not exceed 
two-thirds of base salary averaged over  
the preceding 12 months at age 60 
– UK Pension Fund retains a scheme-specific 
cap
– excess benefits over the scheme-specific 
cap and the statutory annual allowance 
(effective from the commencement of the 
pension input period from 1 October 
2010) continue to be accrued within an 
unfunded unapproved retirement benefit 
scheme where possible 
Executive Directors (with the exception of Nicandro Durante) 
are, like other UK employees, eligible for membership of the 
British American Tobacco UK Pension Fund (Pension Fund).  
The Pension Fund, for members who joined before 1 April 2005, is 
a non-contributory defined benefit scheme. The early retirement 
rules in the Pension Fund permit a member to draw the accrued 
retirement pension within five years of Fund normal retirement age 
without actuarial reduction, subject to the employing company’s 
agreement. Alternatively, an Executive Director may choose to  
leave and take a pension at any time on or after his or her 50th 
birthday without the employing company’s agreement, subject  
to a reduction as determined by the Pension Fund trustee in 
conjunction with the Pension Fund actuary. Accrual rates differ 
according to individual circumstances but do not exceed one-
fortieth of pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service.  
Pensionable pay covers base salary only and therefore bonus 
awards and the value of benefits in kind are not pensionable. 
The Pension Fund includes provision for spouses’ benefits on death 
in service or after retirement. In the event of death in service, a 
spouse’s pension equal to half of the member’s prospective 
pension at normal retirement age would be payable. A spouse’s 
pension payable in the event of death after retirement is equal to 
half of the member’s full pension, irrespective of any decision to 
exchange part of the benefit for a lump sum.  
John Daly and Ben Stevens each joined the Pension Fund after 
1989. As a result, prior to 6 April 2006, these individuals were 
subject to the HM Revenue & Customs cap on pensionable 
earnings (notionally £129,000 for the tax year 2011/12). In 
addition, each has an unfunded pension promise from the 
Company in respect of earnings above the cap on an equivalent 
basis to the benefits provided by the Pension Fund. This is 
provided through membership of an unfunded unapproved 
retirement benefit scheme (UURBS). Further to the changes  
to the applicable tax regulations, the pension accrual in the 
Pension Fund for John Daly and Ben Stevens has, with member 
consent, been restricted to the statutory annual allowance of 
£50,000 per annum with the balance of approximately £1,840 
per annum being provided through the UURBS. There has been 
no change to the overall pension entitlement of either Director. 
These commitments are included in note 12 on the accounts. 
Members of the Pension Fund are entitled to receive increases in 
their pensions once in payment in line with price inflation (as 
measured by the Retail Prices Index) up to 6 per cent per annum.  
John Daly was formerly a member of the P J Carroll Directors’ 
Plan in Ireland. He is also entitled to a deferred benefit currently 
amounting to €107,479 per annum, payable from the age of 
60. This benefit is scheduled to increase each year between 
January 2011 and December 2015 by the lower of 4 per cent or 
the Irish Consumer Price Index. The increase amount is 
confirmed each year by the Minister of Social Protection in 
Ireland (the increase for 2011 was 1.75 per cent).  
Paul Adams retired as an Executive Director on 28 February 2011. 
Details of his pension entitlements are set out in note 6 to Table 8.

Nicandro Durante is a member of the Fundação Albino Souza Cruz 
(FASC) in Brazil. This is a non-contributory defined benefit scheme 
and includes a spouse’s death in service benefit equal to 37.5 per 
cent of the member’s prospective pension at normal retirement 
age. Accrual rates do not exceed 1.85 per cent of basic salary 
(excluding bonus) averaged over the 12 months to normal 
retirement age, for each year of pensionable service. Nicandro 
Durante’s Brazilian pensionable salary will be reviewed by the 
Company annually with reference to the salary of that of a General 
Manager of Souza Cruz SA which will be adjusted annually in line 
with local practice and agreed with the Company. Benefits from the 
FASC remain subject to the rules of that scheme.  
In addition, Nicandro Durante accrues a pension of 0.65 per cent 
for each year of service (the UK Accrual Rate) with effect from  
1 March 2006, being the date of his appointment as a member of 
the Management Board. At retirement the pension will be based on 
Nicandro Durante’s 12 month average UK base salary (excluding 
bonus) immediately prior to retirement. This accrued pension will 
be provided through the UURBS.  
Further, with effect from 1 January 2011, the UK Accrual Rate for 
the element of the base salary in excess of £670,000 increased from 
0.65 per cent as stated above to 2.50 per cent for each year of 
service and will continue to be provided through the UURBS. The 
initial base salary level of £670,000 in respect of the 2.50 per cent 
accrual provided through the UURBS will be adjusted annually by 
the same percentage as that agreed for Nicandro Durante’s 
pensionable salary for the purposes of calculating benefits payable 
from the FASC. Following legislative changes to the applicable UK 
tax relief regulations in respect of members of overseas pension 
arrangements, Nicandro Durante has elected to commence  
the receipt of his benefits from the FASC in Brazil with effect  
from 1 April 2012. The resulting tax charge for the period from  
1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012 will be tax equalised by way  
of a payment to Nicandro Durante of an allowance. No further 
compensation will be made or element of remuneration adjusted 
in lieu of further pension accrual in the FASC. 
Executive Directors’ service contracts 
Each Executive Director has a one year rolling contract, 
executed at the time of his original appointment. The contract 
may be varied from time to time to take account of changes in 
terms and conditions as well as to incorporate best practice. 
Each contract includes a provision for a termination or 
compensation payment in lieu of notice.  
The Remuneration Committee, however, has discretion to agree 
longer contracts in the event that an Executive Director is 
recruited externally or from overseas, when it may then be 
appropriate to offer a contract with an initial period of longer 
than one year, reducing to a one year rolling contract after the 
expiry of the initial period. None of the current Executive 
Directors falls within this type of contract. 
An Executive Director’s compensation payment, in lieu of notice, 
would comprise: (1) 12 months’ salary at his then current base pay; 
and (2) a cash payment in respect of other benefits under the 
contract such as medical insurance, or the Company may at its 
option continue those benefits for a 12 month period. The 
Committee maintains discretion as to how to deal with any grants 
or awards made prior to termination under the LTIPs and the IEIS. 
Pension entitlements are dealt with in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of the applicable pension scheme and do not form 
part of the contractual compensation payment.  
The compensation payment is payable where the requisite  
12 months’ notice is not given to the Executive Director or when he 
terminates by giving 12 months’ notice and the Company does 
not wish him to serve his notice. If a period of notice is served, 
the compensation payment is reduced pro rata. In the unlikely 
event that the contract is terminated for cause (such as gross 
misconduct), the Company may terminate the contract with 
immediate effect and no compensation would be payable.  
Nicandro Durante has a service contract with the Company  
in the form outlined above. In addition, as a result of the 
application of local labour laws in Brazil, Nicandro Durante 
retains certain termination or compensation rights in respect of 
his former employment with Souza Cruz SA. In the event of any 
compensation being payable to Nicandro Durante pursuant to 
his service contract with the Company, these Souza Cruz rights 
will be taken into account first in arriving at a final compensation 
amount in order that he does not benefit twice from these  
dual arrangements.

Executive Directors’ external appointments 
Executive Directors and members of the Management Board are 
able to accept one substantive external Board appointment 
provided that permission is respectively sought from the Board 
or Chairman. Any fees from such appointments are retained by 
the individual in recognition of the increased level of personal 
commitment required.  
None of the Executive Directors or Management Board 
members currently holds such an appointment. 
John Daly, an Executive Director of the Company, has been a 
non-executive director of Reynolds American Inc (RAI) since  
1 December 2010. RAI is an associate undertaking of the 
Company and John Daly was designated by Brown & 
Williamson Holdings, Inc. (a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary 
of the Company), as its nominee to sit on the board of RAI. In 
accordance with present arrangements, the Group received  
a fee of US$237,000 from RAI (2010: US$195,525) in respect  
of John Daly’s service in that role for the year ended  
31 December 2011. 
Non-Executive Directors’ terms
of appointment 
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with 
the Company but instead have letters of appointment. Since 
2010 and following the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all Non-Executive Directors have terms of 
appointment of one year only which are considered for renewal 
around the time of the Company’s Annual General Meeting. 
Each Director is then subject to election or re-election by 
shareholders every year.

The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are considered annually 
and are determined in light of market best practice and with 
reference to the time commitment and responsibilities 
associated with the roles.  
In October 2011, in order to recognise the increasing focus on 
remuneration matters and the corresponding increase in the 
workload of the Remuneration Committee, the supplement  
for chairing that Committee was increased to £28,000 and  
a Committee membership fee of £5,000 per annum was 
introduced for Non-Executive Directors who are members  
of the Remuneration Committee. 
The basic fee and other supplements and Committee membership 
fees for Non-Executive Directors remain unchanged.  
Non-Executive Directors’ fees (including those of the Chairman) 
are determined within the overall aggregate annual limit of 
£2,500,000 authorised by shareholders with reference to the 
Company’s Articles of Association. The Board as a whole 
considers the policy and structure for the Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees on the recommendation of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive. The Non-Executive Directors do not participate 
in discussions on their specific levels of remuneration.  
Non-Executive Directors are generally reimbursed for the cost  
of travel and related expenses incurred by them as Directors of 
the Company in respect of attendance at Board, Committee  
and General meetings. In the instances where the cost of 
reimbursement of such expenses are classified as a benefit  
to the Director, the Company will meet, as appropriate, the 
personal income tax liability that arises. They receive no other  88

pay or benefits. It is the policy of the Board that the spouses  
of the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors may 
accompany the Directors for business purposes on designated 
trips and functions during the year.  
Anthony Ruys has been a Non-Executive Director of ITC Limited 
(ITC) (an associate undertaking of the Company) since 20 January 
2009. During the year ended 31 December 2011, Anthony Ruys 
received INR 720,000 (£8,724) in fees from ITC (2010: INR 680,000 
(£9,713)). This amount is the subject of an annual supplement 
from a Group company so that he receives a total annual fee for  
this appointment of £75,000. Anthony Ruys also has an interest  
in options over shares in ITC – see Table 9.   
Chairman’s terms of appointment and 
remuneration 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining 
the terms of engagement and fees payable to the Chairman. 
This process takes into account the breadth of that role coupled 
with its associated levels of commitment and expertise.  
Richard Burrows has been a Director of the Company since  
1 September 2009 and has been Chairman of the Company from  
1 November 2009. Since September 2011, Richard Burrows has a 
term of appointment of one year only which is considered for 
renewal around the time of the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting each year unless the appointment is terminated earlier by: 
(1) the Company giving three months’ notice or a discretionary 
compensation payment in lieu of notice; or (2) by him giving  
one month’s written notice, with the Company having discretion  
to make a compensation payment in lieu of such notice. The 
compensation payment is limited to any fees which are payable  
for such part of the relevant notice period as the Board does not 
require him as Chairman to perform his duties.  
The current terms of Richard Burrows’ appointment provide for: 
(1) an annual fee of £570,000; (2) the use of a driver; (3) private 
medical insurance and personal accident insurance benefits; 
and (4) the reimbursement by the Company of the cost of 
return airline tickets to London from Ireland in connection with 
his duties as Chairman. In common with the Non-Executive 
Directors, Richard Burrows does not participate in the British 
American Tobacco share schemes, bonus schemes or incentive 
plans and is not a member of any Group pension plan.  
In February 2012, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the 
fees for the Chairman against practice in the FTSE 30 and agreed 
to increase his annual fees from £570,000 to £600,000 with 
effect from 1 April 2012.  
Copies of service contracts and terms  
of appointment 
Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts and the 
details of the terms of appointment of each Non-Executive 
Director and the Chairman are available for inspection during 
normal business hours at the Company’s registered office and 
will also be available for inspection at the Annual General 
Meeting on 26 April 2012.

Notes: 
1. The total benefits in respect of 2010 have been restated in the table above (2010: £47,068) to take account of the change in the Company’s reporting of 
hotel accommodation and related expenses in respect of Directors’ attendance at Board meetings of the Company in the UK in respect of which UK tax is 
payable. This change affected a number but not all of the Directors. Those Directors whose numbers are restated above are the following: (a) Robert Lerwill: (2010: £774); 
(b) Christine Morin-Postel: (2010: £0); (c) Anthony Ruys: (2010: £5,543); (d) Sir Nicholas Scheele: (2010: £16,131); and (e) Ana Maria Llopis: (2010: £0). 
2. The total benefits shown for these Directors exclude the reimbursement of travel expenses (air, rail and taxi fares) in respect of Directors’ attendance at 
Board meetings of the Company in the UK in respect of which UK tax is payable. The gross amounts of the travel costs and the tax which is due thereon  
is: 2011: £102,706; and 2010: £69,298. 
3. Benefits for these Non-Executive Directors include those expenses incurred in connection with accompanied attendance at business functions. 
4. In addition, Anthony Ruys received INR 720,000 (£8,724) (2010: INR 680,000 (£9,713)) from ITC Limited, the Group’s associate undertaking in India in 
respect of his services as a Non-Executive Director of that company during 2011. This was supplemented by a further payment of £66,276 (2010: £65,287) 
paid by the Group for services up to and including 31 December 2011. 
5. During 2011 no fees were payable to members of the Remuneration Committee; only the Committee Chairman received a fee. From 1 January 2012, 
£5,000 per annum will be paid to Remuneration Committee members. No fees are paid in respect of membership of the Nominations Committee.

Long-Term Incentive Plan Notes 
1. The closing mid-market price of ordinary shares in British American Tobacco p.l.c. on the following award dates was: 15 May 2008 (1,966.0p); 
27 March 2009 (1,534.0p); 25 March 2010 (2,278.0p); and 13 May 2011 (2,704.0p). 
2. The March 2009 award will vest on 27 March 2012 at 100 per cent in the manner described in the remuneration report. For illustrative  
purposes only, the share price on 21 February 2012, being the latest practicable date prior to publication, of 3,114.0p has been used  
to value the vesting awards.  
3. The performance conditions applicable to the LTIP awards relate to an apportionment between measures relating to TSR and EPS-based criteria 
with reference to a three year performance period. TSR combines both the share price and dividend performance of the Company as set against 
two comparator groups: (a) the FTSE 100 Index at the beginning of the performance period; and (b) a peer group of FMCG companies. A  
total of 50 per cent of the total award is based upon each of two separate measures (25 per cent for each measure). 50 per cent of an award 
is based on EPS growth relative to inflation. Further details of the performance conditions are set out in the long-term incentives section of  
the remuneration report. 
4. There have been no variations in the terms and conditions of the LTIP interests during the year. 
5. The awards made in March 2010 and May 2011 are due to vest in March 2013 and May 2014 respectively. At 31 December 2011,  
the performance percentage reflecting performance to date, was 91.4 per cent for the March 2010 award and 77.4 per cent for the
March 2011 award. 
6. Paul Adams retired as a Director on 28 February 2011. The Remuneration Committee agreed that, in accordance with the LTIP rules, his 
outstanding LTIP awards of shares would vest immediately upon his retirement (the Awards). The 2008 Award, having completed the
entire performance period, vested in full. The 2009 Award and the 2010 Award vested on a pro-rated time and performance basis.  98

discount of 20 per cent to the market price at the time of the invitation, as permitted under the rules of the Sharesave Scheme.
3. The aggregate gain on the exercise of Sharesave Scheme options in 2011 was £nil (2010: £81,912). 
4. The closing mid-market price of ordinary shares in British American Tobacco p.l.c. on 30 December 2011 (being the last trading day of the year) 
was 3,055.5p and the range during the year was 2,282.5p to 3,068.0p. The market price on 31 December 2011 exceeded the grant price of all

Notes: 
1 The amount of total accrued pension is the pension that would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year, excluding any 
increase granted under statute before retirement. 
2 The value of net increase in accrued pension represents the incremental value to the Executive Director of his service during the year, calculated on the 
assumption that service terminated at the year end. 
3 The pension accrual in the Pension Fund for John Daly and Ben Stevens has, with member consent, been restricted to the statutory annual allowance of 
£50,000 per annum with the balance of approximately £1,840 per annum being provided through the UURBS. There has been no change to the overall 
pension entitlement of either Director. 
4 John Daly was formerly a member of the P J Carroll Directors’ Plan in Ireland. He is entitled to a deferred benefit currently amounting to €107,479 per 
annum, payable from the age of 60. This deferred benefit is scheduled to increase each year between January 2011 and December 2015 by the lower of  
4 per cent or the Irish Consumer Prices Index. The increased amount is confirmed each year by the Minister of Social Protection (the increase for 2011 is  
1.75 per cent). The transfer value in respect of John Daly’s deferred benefit is included in Table 8 above and has been calculated in accordance with the 
method used for the Pension Fund. 
5 Nicandro Durante is entitled to a benefit promise of 0.65 per cent of final sterling pensionable salary (calculated as a 12 month average) in relation to 
service from 1 March 2006. This is provided through the UURBS. At the point where the sterling pensionable salary exceeds £670,000 as an initial base, 
then the accrual rate will increase from 0.65 per cent as stated above to 2.50 per cent in respect of base salary in excess of £670,000 for each year of service 
and will continue to be provided through the UURBS. In addition, Nicandro Durante is entitled to a pension from the Souza Cruz Pension Scheme based on 
an accrual rate of 1.85 per cent of final Brazilian real pensionable salary (calculated as a 12 month average) in relation to service from December 1981 (the 
value of this pension – in terms of sterling – has decreased during 2011 due to a 13 per cent fall in value of the Brazilian real). The accrued pension amount 
and transfer value shown above are based on the sum of these promises, with the accrual rate since March 2006 being a total of 2.50 per cent. Nicandro 
Durante is entitled to receive that part of the promise from the Souza Cruz Pension Scheme (based on 1.85 per cent accrual rate) with immediate effect; 
this right to take the benefit early has been ignored for the purposes of the calculation of the above transfer value. 
6 Paul Adams retired as a Director on 28 February 2011. He elected to commute part of his pension for a cash lump sum of £450,000 at his retirement and he 
received £90,092 in respect of benefits that exceeded the statutory lifetime allowance, as permitted under the rules of the Pension Fund. The figures shown 
in Table 8 above exclude the amount which relates to that cash lump sum. 
7 Changes in the transfer values reflect both individual Executive Director’s circumstances such as the date of joining the Pension Fund and changes in  
salary during the year, together with the application of market value adjustments in accordance with actuarial and legislative requirements. The increase  
in the transfer values during the year ended 31 December 2011 was largely attributable to the underlying reduction in gilt yields from 4.22 per cent to  
 The transfer value basis used is consistent with that used by the Trustee of the Pension Fund for the ongoing funding of the Pension Fund. The transfer 
values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the Pension Fund would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring 
the Pension Fund’s liability in respect of Executive Director’s pension benefits. They do not represent sums payable to individual Executive Directors and, 
therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.  
 Further, although Nicandro Durante is not a member of the Pension Fund, the transfer values calculated above have been calculated in accordance with the 
method used for the Pension Fund. Although Paul Adams, John Daly and Ben Stevens receive a significant element of their overall entitlement from the 
UURBS, the transfer values above have been calculated in accordance with the method used for the Pension Fund. 
8 The Pension Fund is non-contributory. Voluntary contributions paid by Executive Directors and resulting benefits are not shown. No excess retirement 
benefits have been paid to or are receivable by any Executive Director or past Executive Director.

Notes: 
1. ITC Limited (ITC) is an associate undertaking of the Company and is listed on stock exchanges in India. Anthony Ruys, a Non-Executive Director of the 
Company, is also a non-executive director of ITC. Anthony Ruys has been granted options over shares in ITC under the ITC Employee Stock Option 
Schemes 2006 and 2010 which provide for the grant of options to its Non-Executive Directors as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Employee Stock Option Scheme and Employee Stock Purchase Scheme) Guidelines 1999 (the Schemes). 
2. Each option entitles its holder to apply for and to be allotted 10 ordinary shares in ITC of INR1 each upon the payment of the grant price during the 
appropriate exercise period. An exercise period begins at the date of vesting of an option and expires at the end of five years from that vesting date. The 
vesting periods for the conversion of an option under the Schemes are as follows: (a) 30 per cent vests 12 months from date of grant; (b) 30 per cent vests 
24 months from date of grant; and (c) 40 per cent vests 36 months from the date of grant.  
Status of remuneration report 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 5 and Schedule 
8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The report also meets the 
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of
Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code referred to in the corporate
governance statement. As required by the Companies Act 2006, a resolution to approve the Directors’ remuneration report (the 
Report) will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company on 26 April 2012, at which the financial statements will 
be presented for approval. The vote will have advisory status, will be in respect of the remuneration policy and overall 
remuneration packages and will not be specific to individual levels of remuneration. The Companies Act 2006 requires the auditors
to report to the Company’s shareholders on the ‘audited information’ within the Report and to state whether, in their opinion, 
those parts of the Report have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The report of the independent auditors,
in respect of the Company, addresses those aspects of this Report, and those which have been subject to audit have been clearly
marked: Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 7, Table 8 and Table 9.

Companies Act 2006 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Company to set out in 
this report the development and performance of the business of 
the Group during the financial year ended 31 December 2011, 
including an analysis of the position of the Group at the end of 
the financial year, and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group.  
Principal activities 
British American Tobacco p.l.c. is a holding company which 
owns, directly or indirectly, investments in the numerous 
companies constituting the British American Tobacco Group of 
companies. The principal subsidiaries and associates are listed 
on the principal subsidiary and associate undertakings pages.  
All subsidiary undertakings are involved in activities directly or 
indirectly related to the manufacture, distribution or sale of 
tobacco and nicotine products.  
Group results and dividends 
The Group results are addressed fully in the financial statements 
and in the Directors’ report: business review. The Board recommends 
to shareholders a final dividend of 88.4p per ordinary share of 
25p for the year ended 31 December 2011. If approved by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on  
26 April 2012, the dividend will be payable on 3 May 2012 to 
shareholders registered on either the UK main register or the 
South African branch register on 9 March 2012, the record  
date. The ex-dividend trading dates are 5 March 2012 on the JSE 
Limited (JSE) and 7 March 2012 on the London Stock Exchange 
(LSE). As the Group reports in sterling, dividends are declared 
and payable in sterling except for shareholders on the branch 
register in South Africa whose dividends are payable in rand.  
A rate of exchange of £:R = 12.19960 as at 21 February 2012 
(the closing rate for that date as quoted on Bloomberg), results 
in an equivalent final dividend of 1,078.44464 SA cents per 
ordinary share.  
From the commencement of trading on 23 February 2012  
(the date of the preliminary announcement) to 9 March 2012 
(inclusive), no removal requests between the UK main register 
and the South African branch register (in either direction) are 
permitted. Further, from the close of business on 2 March 2012 
until the close of business on 9 March 2012 (inclusive), no 
transfers between the UK main register and the South  
African branch register are permitted and no shares may  
be dematerialised or rematerialised between 5 March 2012  
and 9 March 2012, both days inclusive.  
Further details of the total amounts of dividends paid in 2011 
(with 2010 comparatives) are given in note 8 on the accounts.  
Share capital 
As at 31 December 2011, the Company had an allotted and fully 
paid share capital of 2,025,986,670 ordinary shares of 25p each 
with an aggregate nominal value of £506 million (including 
treasury shares and shares owned by the employee share trusts).  
Purchase of own shares 
The Board reinstated its on-market share buy-back programme 
following the Company’s Preliminary Announcement on  
24 February 2011and under the authority granted by shareholders 
in 2010. At the 2011 Annual General Meeting, the Company 
was given authority to purchase up to 199,400,000 of its ordinary 
shares. The minimum price that may be paid for such shares is 
25p and the maximum price is an amount equal to 105 per cent 
of the average of the middle market prices shown in the quotation 
for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange 
Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding 
the day on which the ordinary share is contracted to be purchased.  
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Company made 
on-market repurchases totalling 28,037,708 of its own ordinary 
shares, representing 1.4 per cent of the issued share capital 
(excluding treasury shares) as at 31 December 2011 and at a 
value of £750 million, excluding transaction costs. In accordance 
with the Company’s policy, all of these repurchased shares are 
held as treasury shares and as at 31 December 2011 the number 
of treasury shares was 56,997,762. While treasury shares are 
held no dividends are paid on them and they have no voting 
rights. Treasury shares may be resold at a later date.  
The present authority for the Company to purchase its own 
shares will expire at the 2012 Annual General Meeting where  
it is proposed that the Company’s authority to purchase its  
own shares is renewed. This will enable the share buy-back 
programme to continue for a further year. In the opinion of the 
Directors, the exercise of this authority is likely to result in an 
increase in the Company’s earnings per share and will be in the 
interests of its shareholders generally. Details of the applicable 
resolution and explanatory notes are contained in the Notice  
of Annual General Meeting which is sent to all shareholders  
and is also published on www.bat.com.

Group’s business activities including those covering input materials 
(filter tow, tobacco leaf and wrapping materials), logistics and

Articles of Association 
The following description summarises certain provisions of  
the Company’s current Articles of Association (as adopted by 
special resolution at the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 
2010), applicable English law and the Companies Act 2006  
(the Companies Act). This summary is qualified in its entirety  
by reference to the Companies Act and the Company’s Articles 
of Association, a copy of which is available on www.bat.com  
Share capital 
All of the Company’s ordinary shares are fully paid and, 
accordingly, no further contribution of capital may be  
required by the Company from the holders of such shares.  
Objects and purposes 
The Company is incorporated under the name of British American 
Tobacco p.l.c. and is registered in England and Wales under 
registered number 3407696. Under the Companies Act 2006, 
the Company’s objects are unrestricted.  
Directors: appointment and retirement 
The Company’s Articles of Association provide for a Board of 
Directors, consisting (unless otherwise determined by ordinary 
resolution of the shareholders) of not fewer than five Directors, 
not subject to any maximum, who shall manage the business  
of the Company.  
The Directors and the Company (by ordinary resolution) may 
appoint a person who is willing to act as a Director, either to fill 
a vacancy or as an additional Director. A Director appointed by 
the Directors shall retire at the next Annual General Meeting 
and will put himself/herself forward to be reappointed by the 
shareholders. Such a Director shall not be taken into account in 
determining the number or identity of the Directors to retire by 
rotation at that next Annual General Meeting.  
At each Annual General Meeting, all Directors shall retire from 
office by rotation who: (1) held office at the time of each of the 
two preceding Annual General Meetings and who did not retire 
at either of them; and (2) if the number of Directors retiring in 
(1) above is less than one-third of the Directors who are subject 
to retirement by rotation (or, if their number is not three or a 
multiple of three, is less than the number which is nearest to 
but does not exceed one-third of the Directors), such additional 
number of Directors as shall, together with the Directors retiring 
under (1) above, equal one-third of the Directors (or, if their 
number is not three or a multiple of three, the number which  
is nearest to but does not exceed one-third of the Directors).  
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act and the Articles 
of Association, the Directors to retire at an Annual General 
Meeting under (2) above will be those who have been in office 
the longest since their appointment or last reappointment.  
Notwithstanding these provisions contained in the Articles of 
Association, the Company is not restricted to the number of 
Directors who may retire and seek re-election each year. The 
Articles of Association merely set a minimum number of Directors 
who must be subject to retirement by rotation each year. As a  103

Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review
result, since the introduction of the provision of UK Corporate 
Governance Code in 2011 that all Directors of FTSE 350 
companies should be subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders, all of the Directors of the Company will be subject 
to either election (i.e. those Directors appointed by the Board of 
Directors during the year) or re-election at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 26 April 2012.  
A Director who retires at an Annual General Meeting and is  
not reappointed shall retain office until the meeting elects 
someone in his place or, if it does not do so, until the 
conclusion of the meeting.  
In addition to any power of removal under the Companies Act, the 
Company may, by special resolution, remove a Director before the 
expiration of his period of office and, subject to the Articles of 
Association, may by ordinary resolution, appoint another person 
who is willing to act as a Director, and is permitted by law to do so, 
to be a Director instead of him. A person so appointed shall be 
subject to retirement as if he had become a Director on the day on 
which the Director in whose place he is appointed was last 
appointed or reappointed a Director.  
Fees for Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman shall be 
determined by the Directors but shall not exceed in aggregate 
an annual sum of £2,500,000, unless determined otherwise by 
ordinary resolution of the shareholders. The remuneration of the 
Executive Directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee 
which is comprised of independent Non-Executive Directors.  
Directors: meetings and voting 
The quorum for meetings of Directors is two Directors. The 
Directors may delegate any of their powers which are conferred 
upon them under the Articles of Association to such person or 
committee as they consider appropriate.  
The Articles of Association place a general prohibition on a 
Director voting at a meeting of the Directors on any resolution 
concerning a matter in which he has an interest other than by 
virtue of his interest in shares in the Company. However, in the 
absence of some other interest not indicated below, a Director is 
entitled to vote and to be counted in a quorum for the purpose of 
any vote relating to a resolution concerning the following matters:  
1. the giving to him of a guarantee, security or indemnity in 
respect of money lent to, or an obligation incurred by him 
for the benefit of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries;  
2. the giving to a third party of a guarantee, security or 
indemnity in respect of an obligation of the Company or 
any of its subsidiaries for which the Director has assumed 
responsibility (in whole or part and whether alone or jointly 
with others) under a guarantee or indemnity or by the 
giving of security;  
3. the giving to him of any other indemnity which is on 
substantially the same terms as indemnities given, or to be 
given, to all of the other Directors and/or to the funding by 
the Company of his expenditure on defending proceedings 
of the doing by the Company of anything to enable him to 
avoid incurring such expenditure where all other Directors 
have been given, or are to be given, substantially the  
same arrangements;  
4. any proposal concerning the purchase of Directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance;  
5. any proposal concerning his being, or intending to become, 
a participant in the underwriting or sub-underwriting of an 
offer of any such shares, debentures or other securities for 
subscription, purchase or exchange;  
6. any arrangements which relate in any way to a retirement 
benefits scheme or any arrangement for the benefit of the 
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries including 
but without being limited to an employees’ share scheme, 
which does not accord to any Director any privilege or 
advantage not generally accorded to the employees and/or 
former employees to whom the arrangement relates; and  
7. any transaction or arrangement with any other company, being 
a company in which the Director is interested only as an officer, 
creditor or shareholder, provided that he is not the holder of or 
beneficially interested in one per cent or more of the equity 
share capital of that company (or of any other company 
through which his interest is derived) and not entitled to 
exercise one per cent or more of the voting rights available to 
members of the relevant company (disregarding, for the 
purposes of this proviso: (i) any shares held by a Director as 
bare or custodian trustee and in which he has no beneficial 
interest; (ii) any shares comprised in an authorised unit trust 
scheme in which the Director is interested only as a unit holder; 
and (iii) any shares of that class held as treasury shares).  
The Company may by ordinary resolution suspend or relax to 
any extent, either generally or in respect of any particular matter, 
any provision of the Articles prohibiting a Director from voting 
at a meeting of the Directors or of a committee of the Directors.  
Directors: borrowing powers 
Without prejudice to their general powers, the Directors may 
exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and 
to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property, assets (present 
and future) and uncalled capital or any part thereof, and (subject to 
the provisions of the Articles of Association) to issue debentures, 
debenture stock and other securities whether outright or as 
security for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company  
or of any third party.  
Directors: interests 
Provided that the Director has disclosed to the other Directors 
the nature and extent of any material interest of his, a Director, 
notwithstanding his office:  
1. may be a party to, or otherwise interested in, any transaction 
or arrangement with the Company or in which the Company 
is otherwise interested;  
2. may be a Director or other officer of, or employed by or may 
be a party to, or otherwise interested in, any transaction or 
arrangement with anybody corporate promoted by the 
Company or in which the Company is otherwise interested;  
3. shall not, by reason of his office, be accountable to the 
Company for any benefit which he derives from any such 
office or employment or from any such transaction or 
arrangement or from any interest in any such body corporate;   104
British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review
Other statutory and regulatory information continued 
4. shall not infringe his duty to avoid a situation in which he 
has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or 
may possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company as 
a result of any such office or employment or from any such 
transaction or arrangement or from any interest in any such 
body corporate;  
5. shall not be required to disclose to the Company, or use in 
performing his duties as a Director of the Company, any 
confidential information relating to such office or employment 
if to make such a disclosure or use would result in a breach 
of duty or obligation of confidence owed by him in relation 
to or in connection with that office or employment;  
6. may absent himself from discussions and exclude himself 
from information, which will or may relate to that office, 
employment, transaction, arrangement or interest; and  
7. no such transaction or arrangement will be liable to be 
avoided because of any such interest or benefit.  
For the purposes of the Articles, a general notice given to the 
Directors that he is to be regarded as having an interest of the 
nature and extent specified in the notice in any transaction or 
arrangement in which a specified person or class of persons  
is interested is deemed to be a disclosure that the Director  
has an interest in any such transaction of the nature and  
extent so specified.  
An interest of which a Director has no knowledge and of which 
it is unreasonable to expect him to have knowledge is not 
treated as an interest; an interest which consists of a Director 
being a Director or other officer of, or employed by any 
subsidiary of the Company is not deemed to be a material 
interest; a Director need not disclose an interest if it cannot be 
reasonably regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest; 
and a Director need not disclose an interest if, or to the extent 
that, the other Directors are already aware of it.  
A Director will no longer be regarded as having an interest in  
a transaction by virtue of a person connected to the Director 
having a relevant interest. However, the Director and the 
Company must still take a view each time a matter is being 
considered as to whether the interests of the Director’s connected 
persons mean that a Director should be treated as interested  
in a transaction.  
The Directors may (subject to such terms and conditions, if any, 
as they may think fit to impose from time to time, and subject 
always to their right to vary or terminate such authorisation) 
authorise, to the fullest extent permitted by law:  
1. any matter which would otherwise result in a Director 
infringing his duty to avoid a situation in which he has, or 
can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or 
possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company 
and which may reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise 
to a conflict of interest (including a conflict of interest and 
duty or conflict of duties);  
2. a Director to accept or continue in any office, employment 
or position in addition to his office as a Director of the 
Company and may authorise the manner in which a  
conflict of interest arising out of such office, employment or 
position may be dealt with, either before or at the time that 
such a conflict of interest arises, provided that the authorisation 
is only effective if:
1. any requirement as to the quorum at the meeting at which 
the matter is considered is met without counting the 
Director in question or any other interested Director; and  
2. the matter was agreed to without their voting or would 
have been agreed to if their votes had not been counted.  
If a matter, or office, employment or position, has been 
authorised by the Directors then (subject to such terms and 
conditions, if any, as the Directors may think fit to impose from 
time to time, and subject always to their right to vary or 
terminate such authorisation or the permissions set out below):  
1. the Director shall not be required to disclose any confidential 
information relating to such matter, or such office, 
employment or position, to the Company if to make such  
a disclosure would result in a breach of a duty or obligation 
of confidence owed by him in relation to or in connection 
with that matter, or that office, employment or position;  
2. the Director may absent himself from discussions, whether 
in meetings of the Directors or otherwise, and exclude 
himself from information which will or may relate to  
that matter, or that office, employment or position; and  
3. a Director shall not, by reason of his office as a Director  
of the Company, be accountable to the Company for  
any benefit which he derives from any such matter,  
or from any such office, employment or position.  
Dividend rights 
Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares may, by ordinary 
resolution, declare dividends but may not declare dividends  
in excess of the amount recommended by the Directors. The 
Directors may also pay interim dividends if it appears that such 
dividends are justified by the profits available for distribution. 
No dividend shall be paid otherwise than out of profits available 
as specified under the provisions of the Companies Act.  
The Directors may, with the sanction of an ordinary resolution 
of the shareholders, offer any holders of ordinary shares the 
right to elect to receive ordinary shares credited as fully paid 
instead of cash in respect of the whole or part of all such 
dividends as may be specified by the resolution. Any general 
meeting declaring a dividend may, upon the recommendation 
of the Directors, direct payment or satisfaction of such dividend 
to be wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets. 
Where difficulty arises in regard to distribution, the Directors 
may ignore fractions or issue fractional certificates, fix the  
value for distribution of any assets and may determine that  
cash shall be paid to any shareholder in order to adjust the 
rights of such members.  
Any dividend which has been unclaimed for 12 years from the 
date when it became due for payment shall, if the Directors so 
resolve, be forfeited and shall cease to be owed by the Company.   105
British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review
The Company can cease sending dividend warrants and 
cheques by post or otherwise if these have been returned 
undelivered to, or left uncashed by, the shareholder on at least 
two consecutive occasions, or, if following one such occasion, 
reasonable enquiries have failed to establish the member’s new 
address. No dividend shall bear interest against the Company, 
unless provided by the rights attached to the share.  
The Directors may elect to make payments of dividends to 
shareholders by bank or electronic transfer only. Amounts due 
to shareholders who provide no, or invalid, account details may 
be held in an account in the Company’s name until such 
shareholders nominate a valid account. The Company shall  
not be a trustee of any such monies, shall be deemed to have 
discharged its payment obligations by paying the relevant 
monies into such account and interest will not accrue for 
shareholders on any such monies pending payment to  
such persons.  
Voting rights 
Voting at any general meeting of shareholders is by a show of 
hands unless a poll is demanded. On a show of hands, every 
shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting  
has one vote regardless of the number of shares held by  
the shareholder.  
Every proxy appointed by a shareholder and present at a general 
meeting has one vote, except that if the proxy has been duly 
appointed by more than one shareholder entitled to vote on the 
resolution and is instructed by one or more of those shareholders  
to vote for the resolution and by one or more others to vote 
against it, or is instructed by one or more of those shareholders 
to vote in one way and is given discretion as to how to vote by 
one or more others (and wishes to use that discretion to vote  
in the other way) he has one vote for and one vote against  
the resolution.  
On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy 
has one vote for every share held by the shareholder. A shareholder 
(or his duly appointed proxy) entitled to more than one vote 
need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the 
same way. A poll may be demanded by any of the following:  
1. the Chairman of the meeting; 
2. the Directors; 
3. not less than five shareholders having the right to vote at the 
meeting;
4. a shareholder or shareholders representing not less than 
one-tenth of the total voting rights of all shareholders 
having the right to vote at the meeting (excluding any 
voting rights attached to treasury shares); or  
5. a shareholder or shareholders holding shares which confer a 
right to vote on the resolution at the meeting being shares 
on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not 
less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all shares 
conferring that right (excluding any voting rights attached 
to treasury shares).  
Matters are transacted at general meetings of the Company by 
proposing and passing of two kinds of resolutions: 
1. ordinary resolutions, which can include resolutions for the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of Directors, the 
receiving of the Annual Report, the declaration of final 
dividends, the appointment and reappointment of the 
external auditor, the authority for the Company to purchase 
its own shares and the grant of authority to allot shares; and  
2. special resolutions, which can include resolutions amending 
the Company’s Articles of Association and resolutions relating 
to certain matters concerning a winding-up of the Company.  
An ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a simple 
majority of the votes cast at a meeting at which there is a 
quorum in order to be passed. Special resolutions require the 
affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the votes cast 
at a meeting at which there is a quorum in order to be passed. 
The necessary quorum for a meeting of the Company is a 
minimum of two shareholders present in person or by proxy or 
by a duly authorised representative(s) of a corporation which is 
a shareholder and entitled to vote.  
When convening a meeting the Company may specify a time 
not more than 48 hours before the time of the meeting (excluding 
any part of a day that is not a working day) by which a person 
must be entered on the register of members in order to have  
the right to attend or vote at the meeting.  
Winding-up 
If the Company is wound up, the liquidator may, with the 
sanction of a special resolution and any other sanction required 
by law, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, divide 
among the shareholders the whole or any part of the assets of 
the Company, and may, for that purpose, value any assets and 
determine how the division is to take place as between the 
shareholders or different classes of shareholders. Alternatively, 
with the same sanction, the liquidator may vest the whole or 
any part of the assets in trustees upon trusts for the benefit of 
the shareholders, but no shareholder will be compelled to 
accept any asset upon which there is a liability.  
Transfer of shares 
Shares may be transferred by an instrument of transfer in  
any usual form or in any other form which the Directors may 
approve and shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor 
and, where the share is not fully paid, by or on behalf of the 
transferee. The Directors can, in their absolute discretion, refuse 
to register the transfer of a share in certificated form which is 
not fully paid, provided that such a refusal would not prevent 
dealings in shares in certificated form which are not fully paid 
from taking place on a proper basis. The Directors may also 
refuse to register a transfer of a share in certificated form 
(whether fully paid or not) unless the instrument of transfer:  
1. is lodged, duly stamped, and is deposited at the registered 
office of the Company or such other place as the Directors 
may appoint and is accompanied by a certificate for the 
shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the 
Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the 
transferor to make the transfer;   106
British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review
Other statutory and regulatory information continued 
2. is in respect of only one class of share; and 
3. is in favour of not more than four transferees. 
In the case of uncertificated shares, transfers shall be registered 
only in accordance with the terms of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001 so that Directors may refuse to register a 
transfer which would require shares to be held jointly by  
more than four persons.  
If the Directors refuse to register a transfer of shares, they must 
give the transferee notice of this refusal as soon as practicable 
and in any event within two months of the instrument of 
transfer being lodged with the Company. No fees may be 
charged for the registration of a transfer of shares.  
Pre-emptive rights and new issues of shares 
While holders of ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights 
under the Articles of Association, the ability of the Directors to 
cause the Company to issue shares, securities convertible into 
shares or rights to shares, otherwise than pursuant to an 
employee share scheme, is restricted. Under the Companies Act, 
the Directors of a company are, with certain exceptions, unable 
to allot any equity securities without express authorisation, 
which may be contained in a company’s Articles of Association 
or given by its shareholders in general meeting, but which in 
either event cannot last for more than five years. Under the 
Companies Act, a company may also not allot shares for cash 
(otherwise than pursuant to an employee share scheme) 
without first making an offer to existing shareholders to allot 
such shares to them on the same or more favourable terms  
in proportion to their respective shareholdings, unless this 
requirement is waived by a special resolution of the 
shareholders.  
Alteration of share capital 
The Company may, from time to time, by ordinary resolution: 
1. consolidate and divide all or any of its shares into shares  
of a larger amount than its existing shares; 
2. sub-divide any of its shares into shares of smaller amount 
than its existing shares; and 
3. determine that, as between the shares resulting from such  
a sub-division, any of them may have any preference or 
advantage as compared with the others.  
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act: 
1. the Company may reduce its share capital, its capital 
redemption reserve and any share premium account in any 
way; and 
2. the Company may purchase its own shares, including 
redeemable shares, and may hold such shares as treasury 
shares or cancel them. 
Disclosure of interests in the Company’s shares 
There are no provisions in the Articles of Association whereby 
persons acquiring, holding or disposing of a certain percentage 
of the Company’s shares are required to make disclosure of their 
ownership percentage, although there are such requirements 
under statute and regulation. The basic disclosure requirement 
under Part 6 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and 
Rule 5 of the Disclosure Rules and the Transparency Rules made 
by the Financial Services Authority imposes a statutory obligation 
on a person to notify the Company and the Financial Services 
Authority of the percentage of the voting rights in the Company 
he directly or indirectly holds or controls, or has rights over, 
through his direct or indirect holding of certain financial 
instruments, if the percentage of those voting rights:  
1. reaches, exceeds or falls below 3 per cent and/or any 
subsequent whole percentage figure as a result of an 
acquisition or disposal of shares or financial instruments; or  
2. reaches, exceeds or falls below any such threshold as a 
result of any change in the number of voting rights attached 
to shares in the Company.  
The Disclosure Rules and the Transparency Rules set out in 
detail the circumstances in which an obligation of disclosure 
will arise, as well as certain exemptions from those obligations 
for specified persons.  
Under Section 793 of the Companies Act, the Company may, by 
notice in writing, require a person that the Company knows or 
has reasonable cause to believe is or was during the three years 
preceding the date of notice interested in the Company’s shares, 
to indicate whether or not that is the case and, if that person 
does or did hold an interest in the Company’s shares, to provide 
certain information as set out in that Act. The Disclosure Rules 
and the Transparency Rules further deal with the disclosure by 
persons of interests in shares or debentures of the companies of 
which they are Directors and certain associated companies.  
The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers also imposes strict 
disclosure requirements with regard to dealings in the securities 
of an offeror or offeree company on all parties to a takeover  
and also on their respective associates during the course of  
an offer period.  
General meetings and notices 
An Annual General Meeting and all other general meetings of 
the Company must be called by at least 21 clear days’ written 
notice. However, the Companies Act allows for this period of 
notice for meetings other than Annual General Meetings to be 
reduced to 14 clear days’ notice provided that two conditions 
are met: (1) a company must allow shareholders to make proxy 
appointments via a website (such as that hosted by its share 
registrars); and (2) shareholders must pass a special resolution 
at the Annual General Meeting every year approving that 
shortening of the notice period to 14 days. A special resolution 
enabling the Company to hold general meetings (other than 
Annual General Meetings) on 14 days’ notice will be proposed 
at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 26 April 2012.  
Subject to the resolution being passed, the approval of the 
shortening of the notice period will be effective until the 
Company’s next AGM, when it is intended that the approval be 
renewed. The shorter notice period would not be used as a 
matter of routine. Rather the Directors will consider on a case-
by-case basis whether the use of the flexibility offered by the 
shorter notice period is merited, taking into account the 
circumstances, including whether the business of the meeting is  107
British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review
time sensitive, and is thought to be to the advantage of 
shareholders as a whole. Further, the shorter notice period 
would not be used unless both of the conditions as stated 
above are met.  
Variation of rights 
If the capital of the Company is divided into different classes  
of shares, the rights attached to any class of shares may only  
be varied, either in such a manner as provided by those rights  
or in the absence of any provision, with the consent in writing 
of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that 
class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a 
separate meeting of holders of such shares. At any separate 
meeting, the necessary quorum is two persons together holding 
or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal amount 
of the issued shares of the class (but at an adjourned meeting 
shall be any one person holding shares of the class or his proxy).  
Unless otherwise expressly provided by the rights attached to 
any shares, those rights shall be deemed to be varied by the 
reduction of the capital paid up on those shares and by the 
creation or issue of further shares ranking in priority for payment  
of a dividend or in respect of capital or which confer on the 
holders voting rights more favourable than those conferred by 
the first-mentioned shares, but shall not otherwise be deemed 
to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking 
pari passu with them or subsequent to them.  
Repurchase of shares 
Subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, the Company 
may purchase its own shares in accordance with the Companies 
Act. Any shares which have been bought back may be held as 
treasury shares or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately 
upon completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the amount 
of the Company’s issued share capital. There is no longer a 
requirement for public companies to have specific authorisations  
in their articles of association to undertake these actions.  
Creditor payment policy 
Given the international nature of the Group’s operations,  
there is not a global standard code for the Group in respect  
of payments to suppliers. In the UK, the operating subsidiaries 
have signed up to the Better Payment Practice Code under 
which each company undertakes to: (1) seek agreement on 
payment terms with its suppliers at the outset of each transaction; 
(2) explain its payment procedures to its suppliers; (3) pay bills 
in accordance with the agreed terms and all legal requirements; 
and (4) inform suppliers without delay when contesting an 
invoice and settle disputes quickly. Details of the Code are 
available on the website, www.payontime.co.uk  
Non-UK operating subsidiaries are responsible for agreeing 
terms and conditions for their business transactions when orders 
for goods and services are placed, ensuring that suppliers are aware 
of the terms of payment and including the relevant terms in 
contracts where appropriate. These arrangements are adhered 
to provided that suppliers meet their contractual commitments.  
Creditor days have not been calculated for the Company as it is 
an investment holding Company and had no trade creditors at 
31 December 2011. 
Intra-Group pricing 
The prices agreed between Group companies for Intra-Group 
sales of materials, manufactured goods, charges for royalties, 
services and fees are based on the normal commercial practices 
which would apply between independent businesses.

Responsibility of Directors  
Directors’ responsibilities in relation
to the financial statements 
The following statement sets out the responsibilities of the 
Directors in relation to the financial statements of both the 
Group and the Company. The reports of the independent 
auditors for the Group and the Company set out their 
responsibilities in relation to those financial statements.  
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as  
at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the 
Group and the Company for the financial year. In preparing 
those financial statements, the Directors are required to:  
 select appropriate accounting policies and apply  
them consistently;  
 make judgments and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;  
 state whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures being disclosed 
and explained; and 
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless they consider that to be inappropriate.  
The applicable accounting standards referred to above are:  
(a) United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(UK GAAP) for the Company; and (b) International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European  
Union and implemented in the UK for the Group.  
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Company 
keeps sufficient accounting records to disclose with reasonable 
accuracy the financial position of the Company and the Group 
and to enable them to ensure that the Group financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation, and that the Company financial statements and the 
Directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies  
Act 2006. They are also responsible for taking reasonable steps 
to safeguard the assets of the Company and the Group and,  
in that context, having proper regard to the establishment  
of appropriate systems of internal control with a view to the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.  
The Directors are required to prepare financial statements and 
to provide the auditors with every opportunity to take whatever 
steps and undertake whatever inspections the auditors consider 
to be appropriate for the purpose of enabling them to give their 
audit report.  
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Annual Report on www.bat.com in accordance with the 
UK legislation governing the preparation and dissemination  
of financial statements. Access to the website is available from 
outside the UK, where comparable legislation may be different.  
The Directors consider that they have pursued the actions necessary 
to meet their responsibilities as set out in this statement.  
Directors’ declaration in relation
to relevant audit information
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the Company’s 
auditors, each of the Directors confirms that:  
 to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware; and  
 he or she has taken all steps that a Director might reasonably  
be expected to have taken in order to make himself or 
herself aware of relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.  
Directors’ responsibility statement  
The Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge and  
belief that:  
 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable accounting standards identified above, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Company and the Group; and  
 the Directors’ report (which incorporates the business 
review) includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the  
Group and the Company, together with a description  
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.  
The names of the Directors are listed in this Directors’ report 
and their details appear on the Board of Directors page.  
Neither the Company nor the Directors accept any liability to 
any person in relation to this Annual Report except to the extent 
that such liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, 
any liability to a person who has demonstrated reliance on any 
untrue or misleading statement or omission shall be determined 
in accordance with section 90A of the Financial Services and 
Markets Act 2000.  
The responsibility statement was approved by the Board of 
Directors on 22 February 2012 and signed on its behalf by:

To the members of British American Tobacco p.l.c. 
 
We have audited the Group financial statements of British American 
Tobacco p.l.c. for the year ended 31 December 2011 which 
comprise the Group income statement, the Group statement of 
comprehensive income, the Group statement of changes in equity, 
the Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the notes 
on the accounts and the Principal subsidiary undertakings and the 
Principal associate undertakings. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by  
the European Union.  
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibility statement set 
out on page 108, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report  
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies,  
we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the Group financial statements:  
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at  
31 December 2011 and of its profit and cash flows for the year  
then ended;  
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as  
adopted by the European Union; and  
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.  
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the Group financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:  
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or  
 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
 the Directors’ statement, set out on page 108, in relation to 
going concern;  
 the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and 
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
Directors’ remuneration. 
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial 
statements of British American Tobacco p.l.c. for the year ended  
31 December 2011 and on the information in the remuneration 
report that is described as having been audited.

1 Accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention except as described in the accounting policy below on 
financial instruments. 
The Group has not adopted any new and amended IFRS and IFRIC 
interpretations, that have had any significant effect on reported profit or 
equity or on the disclosures in the financial statements, with effect from  
1 January 2011. 
The preparation of the Group financial statements requires management 
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The key estimates and 
assumptions are set out in the accounting policies below, together with 
the related notes to the accounts. 
The most significant items include: 
 the review of asset values, especially goodwill and impairment 
testing. The key assumptions used in respect of goodwill and 
impairment testing are the determination of cash-generating units, 
the long-term growth rate for cash flow projections and the rate used 
to discount the cash flow projections. These are described in note 9; 
 the estimation of and accounting for retirement benefit costs.  
The determination of the carrying value of assets and liabilities,  
as well as the charge for the year, and amounts recognised in other 
comprehensive income, involves judgments made in conjunction 
with independent actuaries. These involve estimates about uncertain 
future events based on the environment in different countries, 
including life expectancy of scheme members, salary and pension 
increases, inflation and expected returns on assets, as well as discount 
rates and asset values at the year end. The assumptions used by the 
Group and sensitivity analysis are described in note 12; 
 the estimation of amounts to be recognised in respect of taxation and 
legal matters, and the estimation of other provisions for liabilities and 
charges are subject to uncertain future events, may extend over 
several years and so the amount and/or timing may differ from 
current assumptions. The accounting policy for taxation is explained 
below and the recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities, together 
with a note of unrecognised amounts, are shown in note 6(b) and 
note 13. Other provisions for liabilities and charges are as set out in 
note 22. The accounting policy on contingent liabilities, which are not 
provided for, is set out below and the contingent liabilities of the 
Group are explained in note 30; 
 the definition of adjusting items, which are separately disclosed as 
memorandum information, is explained below and the impact of  
these on the calculation of adjusted earnings is described in note 7;  
 the estimation of the fair values of acquired net assets arising in a 
business combination under IFRS 3 Revised and the allocation of the 
purchase consideration between the underlying net assets acquired, 
including intangible assets other than goodwill, on the basis of their  
fair values. These estimates are prepared in conjunction with the 
advice of independent valuation experts where appropriate. The 
relevant transactions for 2011 are described in note 26; and 
 the exemptions taken under IFRS 1 on the first time adoption of IFRS  
at 1 January 2004 and, in particular, those relating to goodwill on 
business combinations which are explained in the accounting  
policies below. 
Such estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  
and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the 
circumstances and constitute management’s best judgment at the date of 
the financial statements. In the future, actual experience may deviate from 
these estimates and assumptions, which could affect the financial 
statements as the original estimates and assumptions are modified,  
as appropriate, in the year in which the circumstances change. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial information includes the financial statements  
of British American Tobacco p.l.c. and its subsidiary undertakings, together 
with the Group’s share of the results of its associates and joint ventures. 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group, where control is the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so  
as to obtain benefit from its activities. 
Associates and joint ventures comprise investments in undertakings, 
which are not subsidiary undertakings, where the Group’s interest in  
the equity capital is long term and over whose operating and financial 
policies the Group exercises a significant influence and, in the case of  
joint ventures, has joint control. They are accounted for using the  
equity method. 
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are 
included from the date of acquisition of a controlling interest at which 
date, for the purposes of consolidation, the purchase consideration  
is allocated between the underlying net assets acquired, including 
intangible assets other than goodwill, on the basis of their fair value. 
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. Similarly, the results  
of associates and joint ventures are included from the date of acquiring 
significant influence or, in the case of joint ventures, joint control.  
The results of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures which 
have been sold during the year are included up to the date of disposal. 
The profit or loss on sale is calculated by reference to the net asset value  
at the date of disposal, adjusted for purchased goodwill previously 
consolidated in the balance sheet. 
Inter-company balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains  
arising from inter-company transactions, are eliminated in preparing  
the consolidated financial statements. 
Foreign currencies 
The functional currency of the Parent Company is sterling and this is  
also the presentation currency of the Group. The income and cash flow 
statements of Group undertakings expressed in currencies other than 
sterling are translated to sterling using exchange rates applicable to the 
dates of the underlying transactions. Average rates of exchange in each 
year are used where the average rate approximates the relevant exchange 
rate at the date of the underlying transactions. Assets and liabilities of 
Group undertakings are translated at the applicable rates of exchange  
at the end of each year. For hyperinflationary countries, the financial 
statements in local currency are adjusted to reflect the impact of local 
inflation prior to translation into sterling. 
The differences between retained profits of overseas subsidiary 
undertakings, associates and joint ventures translated at average and 
closing rates of exchange are taken to reserves, as are differences arising 
on the retranslation to sterling (using closing rates of exchange) of 
overseas net assets at the beginning of the year. Any differences that  
have arisen since 1 January 2004 are presented as a separate component 
11 6
British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review  
of equity. As permitted under IFRS 1, any differences prior to that date  
are not included in this separate component of equity.  
Where a disposal of an investment in a Group undertaking results in a loss 
of control of a subsidiary undertaking, the loss of significant influence over 
an associated company or the loss of joint control over a joint venture, the 
cumulative amount of the related foreign exchange differences deferred in 
the separate component of equity are recognised in the income statement 
when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised. These related exchange 
differences comprise the exchange differences on all amounts deemed  
to be part of the net investment in the undertaking, which are recycled  
to the income statement when a disposal occurs. For partial disposals of 
subsidiary undertakings the related exchange differences are reclassified 
within equity. For all other partial disposals the proportional share of the 
related exchange differences is recycled to the income statement. 
Foreign currency transactions are initially recognised in the functional 
currency of each entity in the Group using the exchange rate ruling at  
the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting 
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of 
foreign currency assets and liabilities at year end rates of exchange are 
recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity  
as qualifying cash flow hedges, on inter-company net investment loans 
and qualifying net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains or losses 
recognised in the income statement are included in profit from operations 
or net finance costs depending on the underlying transactions that gave 
rise to these exchange differences. 
Revenue 
Revenue principally comprises sales of cigarettes, cigars, leaf and other 
tobacco products to external customers. Revenue excludes duty, excise 
and other taxes and is after deducting rebates, returns and other similar 
discounts. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards  
of ownership are transferred to a third party. 
Retirement benefit costs 
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution 
schemes. The net deficit or surplus for each defined benefit pension 
scheme is calculated in accordance with IAS 19, based on the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the 
fair value of the scheme assets adjusted, where appropriate, for any 
surplus restrictions or the effect of minimum funding requirements. 
Actuarial gains and losses, changes in unrecognised scheme surpluses  
and minimum funding requirements are recognised in full through  
other comprehensive income. 
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are expensed over the 
period to vesting and if they vest immediately, then they are recognised  
at that time in the income statement. 
The Group also has certain post-retirement healthcare schemes  
and they are accounted for on a similar basis to the defined benefit 
pension schemes. 
For defined benefit schemes, the actuarial cost charged to profit from 
operations consists of current service cost, interest cost, expected  
return on plan assets, past service cost and the impact of any settlements 
or curtailments. 
Some benefits are provided through defined contribution schemes  
and payments to these are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
Share-based payments 
The Group has equity-settled and cash-settled share-based  
compensation plans. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the  
date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-
settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based 
on the Group’s estimate of awards that will eventually vest. For plans 
where vesting conditions are based on total shareholder returns, the  
fair value at date of grant reflects these conditions, whereas earnings  
per share vesting conditions are reflected in the calculation of awards that 
will eventually vest over the vesting period. For cash-settled share-based 
payments, a liability equal to the portion of the services received is 
recognised at its current fair value determined at each balance sheet  
date. Fair value is measured by the use of the Black-Scholes option  
pricing model, except where vesting is dependent on market conditions  
when the Monte Carlo option pricing model is used. The expected life 
used in the models has been adjusted, based on management’s best  
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations. 
Research and development 
Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it  
is incurred. Development expenditure is charged to income in the  
year it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38  
(Intangible Assets). 
Taxation 
Taxation is that chargeable on the profits for the period, together with 
deferred taxation. 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax laws 
enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries 
where the Group’s subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures operate and 
generate taxable income. 
Deferred taxation is provided in full using the liability method for 
temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for taxation 
purposes. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in Group undertakings, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is 
probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax 
asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. As required 
under IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or deferred tax liability 
is settled. 
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  
in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income  
or changes in equity. 
The Group has exposures in respect of the payment or recovery of a 
number of taxes. Liabilities or assets for these payments or recoveries  
are recognised at such time as an outcome becomes probable and  
when the amount can reasonably be estimated. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and is considered to have an 
indefinite life subject to impairment reviews. Any impairment of goodwill 
is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed. 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a subsidiary, 
associate or joint venture over the Group’s share of the fair value  
of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost net of

accumulated impairment losses and recognised amortisation prior  
to 1 January 2004. 
The Group’s policy up to and including 1997 was to eliminate goodwill 
against reserves. Goodwill acquired from 1998 to 31 December 2003  
was capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life.  
As permitted under IFRS 1, in respect of acquisitions prior to  
1 January 2004, the classification and accounting treatment of business 
combinations was not amended on transition to IFRS. Goodwill previously 
written off direct to reserves is not recycled to the income statement on 
the disposal of the subsidiary, associate or joint venture to which it relates. 
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.  
In respect of associates and joint ventures, goodwill is included in  
the carrying value of the investment in the associated company or  
joint venture. On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture,  
the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination  
of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Intangible assets other than goodwill 
The intangible assets shown on the Group balance sheet consist mainly  
of trademarks acquired by the Group’s subsidiary undertakings and 
computer software. 
Acquired trademarks are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation  
and impairment. Trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortised  
but are reviewed annually for impairment. Intangible assets other than 
goodwill classified as held-for-sale are not amortised. Other trademarks  
are amortised on a straight-line basis over their remaining useful lives, 
consistent with the pattern of economic benefits expected to be received, 
which do not exceed 20 years. Any impairments of trademarks are 
recognised in the income statement but increases in trademark values  
are not recognised. 
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment, and is amortised on a straight-line basis over periods ranging 
from three years to seven years. 
The investments in associates and joint ventures shown in the Group 
balance sheet include trademarks arising from the combination of  
Brown & Williamson (B&W) and R J Reynolds (RJR) in 2004 to form 
Reynolds American Inc. (RAI), as well as those arising on the acquisition  
of Conwood by RAI in 2006. As the combination of B&W and RJR for the 
Group involved the partial disposal of B&W and an investment in RAI,  
fair values were assigned to trademarks formerly owned by RJR but  
not to those formerly owned by B&W. Most of the carrying value of the 
trademarks relates to trademarks which are deemed to have indefinite lives 
and each trademark is subject to an annual impairment test. Certain minor 
trademarks are being amortised over their remaining lives. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line 
basis to write off the assets over their useful economic life. No depreciation 
is provided on freehold land or assets classified as held for sale. Freehold 
and leasehold property are depreciated at rates between 2.5 per cent  
and 4 per cent per annum, and plant and equipment at rates between  
7 per cent and 25 per cent per annum.  
Capitalised interest 
Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of intangible assets or plant, property  
and equipment that takes a substantial period of time to get ready  
for its intended use or sale, and for which the commencement date for 
capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009, are capitalised as part of the 
cost of the asset, in accordance with IAS 23 Revised (Borrowing costs).  
The Group’s previous policy was to expense such borrowing costs as  
they were incurred.  
Leased assets 
Assets where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards  
of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases and  
are included as part of property, plant and equipment. Finance lease 
assets are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lower of their  
fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at 
inception of the lease, then depreciated over the shorter of the lease  
term and their estimated useful lives. Leasing payments consist of capital 
and finance charge elements and the finance element is charged to the 
income statement. 
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Where arrangements are entered into which, while they are not in the 
legal form of a lease, are in substance a lease under IFRIC 4, then they  
are recognised on the same basis as the leased assets above. 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that the 
carrying amount of a cash-generating unit may not be recoverable.  
In addition, assets that have indefinite useful lives are tested annually  
for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the 
carrying value exceeds the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell 
and its value in use. 
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that 
generates cash flows which are largely independent of the cash flows  
from other assets or groups of assets. At the acquisition date, any goodwill 
acquired is allocated to the relevant cash-generating unit or group of cash-
generating units expected to benefit from the acquisition for the purpose 
of impairment testing of goodwill. 
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date, or whenever 
events indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In  
the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant 
or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost  
is considered as an indicator that the investment is impaired. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is 
based on the weighted average cost incurred in acquiring inventories and 
bringing them to their existing location and condition, which will include 
raw materials, direct labour and overheads, where appropriate. Net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to completion and 
sale. Tobacco inventories which have an operating cycle that exceeds  
12 months are classified as current assets, consistent with recognised 
industry practice. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument 
and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.  
Such assets and liabilities are classified as current if they are expected  
to be realised or settled within 12 months after the balance sheet date.  
If not, they are classified as non-current.  
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair  
value, plus directly attributable transaction costs where applicable,  
with subsequent measurement as set out below.

British American Tobacco

Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review  
Non-derivative financial assets are classified on initial recognition as 
available-for-sale investments, loans and receivables or cash and cash 
equivalents as follows: 
Available-for-sale investments: available-for-sale investments are  
those non-derivative financial assets that cannot be classified as loans  
and receivables or cash and cash equivalents. 
Loans and receivables: these are non-derivative financial assets with  
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
Cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents include cash  
in hand and deposits held on call, together with other short-term highly 
liquid investments including investments in certain money market funds. 
Cash equivalents normally comprise instruments with maturities of three 
months or less at date of acquisition. In the cash flow statement, cash and 
cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts, which are included  
as current borrowings in the liabilities section on the balance sheet. 
Apart from available-for-sale investments, non-derivative financial assets 
are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, subject  
to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. These 
estimates for irrecoverable amounts are recognised when there is objective 
evidence that the full amount receivable will not be collected according  
to the original terms of the asset. Such evidence might include financial 
difficulties of the debtor, defaults of payment or significant overdue 
balances. For interest-bearing assets, their carrying value includes  
accrued interest receivable. Available-for-sale investments are stated  
at fair value, with changes in fair value being recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income. When such investments are derecognised (e.g. 
through disposal) or become impaired, the accumulated gains and losses, 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income, are reclassified  
to the income statement within ‘finance income’. Dividend and interest 
income on available-for-sale investments are included within ‘finance 
income’ when the Group’s right to receive payments is established. 
Fair values for quoted investments are based on observable market prices. 
If there is no active market for a financial asset, the fair value is established 
by using valuation techniques principally involving discounted cash  
flow analysis. 
Non-derivative financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. For borrowings, their carrying value includes 
accrued interest payable, as well as unamortised issue costs. 
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, and 
subsequently measured, at fair value, which includes accrued interest 
receivable and payable where relevant. Changes in their fair values are 
recognised as follows: 
 for derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in 
their fair values are recognised directly in other comprehensive 
income, to the extent that they are effective, with the ineffective 
portion being recognised in the income statement. Where the hedged 
item results in a non-financial asset, the accumulated gains and losses, 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income, are included 
in the initial carrying value of the asset (basis adjustment) and 
recognised in the income statement in the same periods as the 
hedged item. Where the underlying transaction does not result in 
such an asset, the accumulated gains and losses are reclassified to the 
income statement in the same periods as the hedged item; 
 
 
 
 for derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges, the carrying 
value of the hedged item is adjusted for the fair value changes 
attributable to the risk being hedged, with the corresponding entry 
being made in the income statement. The changes in fair value  
of these derivatives are also recognised in the income statement; 
 for derivatives that are designated as hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations, the changes in their fair values are recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are 
effective, with the ineffective portion being recognised in the income 
statement. Where non-derivatives such as foreign currency 
borrowings are designated as net investment hedges, the relevant 
exchange differences are similarly recognised. The accumulated gains 
and losses are reclassified to the income statement when the foreign 
operation is disposed of; and 
 for derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not 
designated as hedges, the changes in their fair values are recognised  
in the income statement in the period in which they arise. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to 
document prospectively the relationship between the item being hedged 
and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to demonstrate 
an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the 
hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective 
on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is reperformed periodically 
to ensure that the hedge has remained, and is expected to remain,  
highly effective. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is 
derecognised (e.g. through expiry or disposal), or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. Where the hedged item is a highly probable forecast 
transaction, the related gains and losses remain in equity until the 
transaction takes place, when they are reclassified to the income statement 
in the same manner as for cash flow hedges as described above. When  
a hedged future transaction is no longer expected to occur, any related 
gains and losses, previously recognised in other comprehensive income, 
are immediately reclassified to the income statement. 
Derivative fair value changes recognised in the income statement are 
either reflected in arriving at profit from operations (if the hedged item  
is similarly reflected) or in finance costs. 
Dividends 
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised 
as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting, while interim dividend distributions are recognised in 
the period in which the dividends are declared and paid. 
Segmental analysis 
The Group is organised and managed on the basis of its geographic 
regions. These are the reportable segments for the Group as they form the 
focus of the Group’s internal reporting systems and are the basis used by 
the chief operating decision maker, identified as the Management Board, 
for assessing performance and allocating resources. 
The Group is a single product business providing cigarettes and other 
tobacco products. While the Group has clearly differentiated brands, 
global segmentation between a wide portfolio of brands is not part of  
the regular internally reported financial information. 
The prices agreed between Group companies for intra-group sales  
of materials, manufactured goods, charges for royalties, commissions, 
services and fees, are based on normal commercial practices which would 
apply between independent businesses. Royalty income, less related 
expenditure, is included in the region in which the licensor is based.

Adjusting items 
Adjusting items are significant items in the profit from operations, net 
finance costs, taxation and the Group’s share of the post-tax results of 
associates and joint ventures which individually or, if of a similar type, in 
aggregate, are relevant to an understanding of the Group’s underlying 
financial performance. While the disclosure of adjusting items is  
not required by IFRS, these items are separately disclosed either as 
memorandum information on the face of the income statement and  
in the segmental analyses, or in the notes to the accounts as appropriate. 
The Group believes that these items are useful to users of the Group 
financial statements in helping them to understand the underlying 
business performance and are used to derive the Group’s principal  
non-GAAP measure which is adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when either a legal or constructive obligation as 
a result of a past event exists at the balance sheet date, it is probable that 
an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reasonable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Contingent liabilities and contingent assets 
Subsidiaries and associates and joint ventures companies are defendants 
in tobacco-related and other litigation. Provision for this litigation would 
be made at such time as an unfavourable outcome became probable and 
the amount could be reasonably estimated. 
Contingent assets are possible assets whose existence will only be 
confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the entity  
and are not recognised as assets until the realisation of income is  
virtually certain. 
The Group records its external legal fees and other external defence costs 
for tobacco-related and other litigation as these costs are incurred. 
Repurchase of share capital 
When share capital is repurchased the amount of consideration paid, 
including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from 
equity. Repurchased shares which are not cancelled, or shares purchased 
for the employee share ownership trusts, are classified as treasury shares 
and presented as a deduction from total equity. 
Future changes to accounting policies 
Certain changes to IFRS will be applicable for the Group accounts in future 
years. Set out below are those which are considered to affect the Group. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments has been issued. This standard represents the 
first phase of the IASB’s project to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement, and has mandatory application for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. In its current 
form, it sets out the classification and measurement criteria for financial 
assets and financial liabilities. It requires all financial assets, including assets 
currently classified under IAS 39 as available-for-sale, to be measured at fair 
value through profit and loss unless the assets can be classified as held at 
amortised cost. Qualifying equity investments held at fair value may have 
their fair value changes taken through other comprehensive income by 
election. Where the fair value option for certain financial liabilities is 
applied, the portion of fair value changes representing own credit risk 
would be recognised through other comprehensive income rather than 
the income statement. The Group does not use the fair value option for 
financial liabilities. The effect of applying the standard in its current form is 
not considered to have a material impact on the Group’s reported profit 
or equity. These changes have not been endorsed by the EU and will only 
become applicable once that endorsement has occurred. 
A revised IAS 19 Employee Benefits has been issued and has mandatory 
application (subject to EU endorsement) from 1 January 2013. The new 
standard does not change the values of retirement benefit assets and 
liabilities on the balance sheet, but does change the amounts recognised 
in the income statement and in other comprehensive income. The 
expected return on plan assets and the interest cost on liabilities are 
replaced by a new component of the income statement charge – interest 
on the net retirement benefit asset / liability. In addition, prior service  
costs will no longer be deferred and will be recognised immediately.  
The revised standard has retrospective application. Had the standard  
been applied to the 2011 results profit for the year would have been 
approximately £54 million lower (2010: £47 million lower), with  
a compensating credit in other comprehensive income. 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 
and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities have been issued along 
with revised versions of IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements and IAS 28 
Associates; additionally IAS 31 Joint Ventures has been withdrawn. These 
standards form a single package of proposals with mandatory application 
from 1 January 2013 (subject to EU endorsement). The aim of these 
standards is to improve the quality of reporting in relation to the 
consolidation of subsidiaries, special purpose vehicles and accounting  
for joint arrangements. While the requirements of IFRS 12 will potentially 
lengthen certain disclosures in respect of Group entities, the requirements 
of these standards are not expected to materially affect the Group.  
An amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements has been 
issued. This amendment changes the disclosure of items presented in 
other comprehensive income grouping them into items which recycle  
to profit and loss and items which will not. Apart from the change in 
disclosure, this amendment will have little impact on the Group Accounts. 
Mandatory application (subject to EU endorsement) is for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012. 
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement has been issued. This standard aims  
to provide a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure 
requirements for use across IFRS. The implementation of IFRS 13 does  
not change where fair value is or is not applied under IFRS and will not 
require a restatement of historical transactions. Mandatory application 
(subject to EU endorsement) is from 1 January 2013. 
In addition, a number of other interpretations and revisions to  
existing standards have been issued which will be applicable to the  
Group financial statements in future years and which will have no  
material effect on reported profit or equity or on the disclosures in  
the financial statements.

2 Segmental analyses 
As the chief operating decision maker, the Management Board reviews external revenues and adjusted profit from operations to evaluate segment 
performance and allocate resources. Interest income, interest expense and taxation are centrally managed and accordingly such items are not 
presented by segment as they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability. 
As part of the plans to reduce complexity and drive efficiency in management structures and achieve a better balance in the scale of our regions, it was 
decided to reduce the management structure from five regions to four regions from 1 January 2011. Markets which comprised the Eastern Europe 
region were merged into the Africa and Middle East region and the Western Europe region. Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Caucasus and Central 
Asia form part of the new Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa region (EEMEA), while Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania and Kosovo 
have become part of the Western Europe region. The comparatives have been restated according to the new management structure.  
The four geographic regions are the reportable segments for the Group as they form the focus of the Group’s internal reporting systems and are the 
basis used by the Management Board for assessing performance and allocating resources. 
The Management Board reviews current and prior year segmental revenue, adjusted profit from operations of subsidiaries and adjusted post-tax results 
of associates and joint ventures at constant rates of exchange. The constant rate comparison provided for reporting segment information is based on a 
retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year results of the Group’s overseas entities but, other than in exceptional circumstances, does 
not adjust for transactional gains and losses in operations which are generated by movements in exchange rates. As a result, the 2011 segmental results 
were translated using the 2010 rates of exchange. The 2010 figures are also stated at the 2010 rates of exchange. 
The analyses of revenue for the 12 months to 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, based on location of sales, are as follows:

Total research and development costs including employee benefit costs and depreciation were £166 million (2010 restated: £164 million). 
Other operating expenses also include the Fox River provision, which was made in 2011 and explained in note 30 (see page 182). 
As a result of restrictions on accessing foreign exchange at the official exchange rate in Uzbekistan, the Group revalues monetary items, mostly 
comprising foreign currency payables, in its subsidiary in Uzbekistan at a more conservative rate. This rate represents the rate at which management 
expects to settle these items and resulted in the recognition of net exchange losses of £38 million in 2010. These were included in exchange differences 
of £62 million within other operating expenses in 2010. 
(e) Restructuring and integration costs 
Restructuring costs reflect the costs incurred as a result of initiatives to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of the Group as a globally integrated 
enterprise. These initiatives include a review of the Group’s manufacturing operations, overheads and indirect costs, organisational structure and 
systems and software used. The costs of these initiatives together with the costs of integrating acquired businesses into existing operations, including 
acquisition costs, are included in profit from operations under the following headings:

3 Profit from operations continued 
Restructuring and integration costs in 2011 principally relate to the continuation of: factory closure and downsizing activities in Denmark and Australia 
respectively; a voluntary separation scheme and closure of the printing unit in Argentina; the closure of the Jawornik factory in Poland, the Tire factory  
in Turkey and the Lecce factory in Italy. The costs also cover the social plan and other closure activities relating to the Bremen factory closure in Germany 
and the integration of Productora Tabacalera de Colombia, S.A.S. (Protabaco) into existing operations, including acquisition costs, as well as other 
restructuring initiatives directly related to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Group as a globally integrated enterprise. In addition,  
they also include separation packages in respect of permanent headcount reductions and permanent employee benefit reductions in the Group.  
Restructuring and integration costs in 2010 principally relate to: the continuation of factory closure and downsizing activities in Denmark and Australia 
respectively; the closure of the Jawornik factory in Poland, the Tire factory in Turkey and the Lecce factory in Italy. The costs also cover a voluntary 
separation scheme and closure of the printing unit in Argentina and the continued integration of Bentoel into existing operations; as well as other 
restructuring initiatives directly related to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Group as a globally integrated enterprise. These include the 
combining of the Group’s businesses in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands and some other activities to reduce the overheads of the Group.  
In addition, the Group has recognised impairment charges as a result of the continued review of its software assets in light of the development of global 
software solutions. 
Restructuring and integration costs in 2010 also include a payment of US$21 million to Reynolds American relating to the early termination and 
settlement of all disputes at issue in respect of the Contract Manufacturing Agreement dated 30 July 2004, as explained in note 29. 
Other operating income in 2011 includes gains from sale of surplus land and buildings in Argentina and the release of deferred income from a disposal 
in 2007. In 2010, other operating income also includes gains on property disposals and the release of deferred income from a disposal in 2007.  
(f) Amortisation of trademarks 
The acquisitions of Protabaco, Bentoel, Tekel and ST resulted in the capitalisation of trademarks which are amortised over their expected useful lives, 
which do not exceed 20 years. The amortisation charge of £58 million (2010: £62 million) is included in depreciation, amortisation and impairment 
costs in profit from operations. 
(g) Impairment of goodwill and trademarks 
During 2011, the Group impaired the remaining balance of the goodwill in respect of the Tekel acquisition in 2008, amounting to £273 million.  
This followed a goodwill and trademarks impairment of £249 million and £44 million respectively for the year ended 31 December 2010. Although 
cost saving initiatives in the acquisition plan have been delivered successfully, the impairment recognised in 2010 was calculated on the basis of no 
further significant excise increases. However, the Turkish Government announced a further increase effective from October 2011 and an additional 
increase effective from January 2013. The excise increases to date have resulted in the growth of illicit trade and a loss of volumes and market share  
and this is expected to continue. Turkey remains an important strategic market for the Group. The basis for determining the recoverable amounts  
of the goodwill and trademarks is explained in note 9.  
(h) Fox River 
A provision of £274 million has been made for a potential claim under a 1998 settlement agreement entered into by a Group subsidiary in respect  
of the clean up of sediment in the lower Fox River. This is explained in more detail in note 30 (see page 182).

Notes: 
(i) Hedge ineffectiveness in respect of fair value hedges is a £12 million gain (2010: £21 million gain) being the difference between the two items above. 
(ii) IFRS requires derivatives which do not meet the tests for hedge accounting under IAS 39 to be classified as instruments held-for-trading with fair value changes included  
in the income statement. These derivatives principally consist of other derivatives shown in note 16(d) and forward foreign currency contracts which have not been 
designated as hedges due to their fair value changes offsetting with other components of net finance costs relating to financial assets and liabilities.  
Other interest payable includes interest on the bonds and notes detailed in note 21. Facility fees principally relate to the Group’s central undrawn 
banking facility of £2 billion (2010: £2 billion), as well as the Group’s €450 million term loan facility (2010: €450 million). Both facilities were 
renegotiated and agreed during December 2010 from £1.75 billion and €700 million respectively. 
Exchange differences in respect of hedged items subject to fair value hedges and cash flow hedges were a gain of £4 million (2010: £14 million loss) 
and a gain of £9 million (2010: £16 million gain) respectively and are included in ‘Finance costs – exchange differences’ in the table above.

The share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures is after the following adjusting items which are excluded from the calculation of adjusted 
earnings per share as set out in note 7. 
In 2011, the Group’s interest in ITC decreased from 31.43 per cent to 31.04 per cent as a result of ITC issuing ordinary shares under the company’s 
employee stock option scheme. The issue of shares and change in the Group’s share of ITC resulted in a gain of £28 million, which is treated as a partial 
deemed disposal and included in the income statement. 
During the year, Reynolds American, along with other tobacco companies, was refused by the US Supreme Court a request to revoke a 2009 order 
requiring them to finance a US$278 million smoking cessation programme in Louisiana (Scott case). The Group’s share of this charge amounts to  
£23 million (net of tax). 
In March 2011, Reynolds American sold Lane Limited for US$205 million in cash. The Group’s share of the gain on the disposal of this business amounts 
to £22 million (net of tax). 
Reynolds American has also recognised the following amounts which have been combined in the table of adjusting items and reported in other: 
Reynolds American reported a charge of US$64 million in respect of four Engle progeny lawsuits that have proceeded through the appellate process  
in the state of Florida. The amount includes compensatory and punitive damages as well as attorneys’ fees and statutory interest. The Group’s share  
of this charge amounts to £10 million (net of tax). Reynolds American recognised trademark amortisation and impairment of US$47 million and the 
Group’s share of these charges amounts to £8 million (net of tax). Reynolds American reported US$16 million and US$11 million of tax credits and 
interest, respectively and the Group’s share of these credits amounts to £6 million (net of tax). Reynolds American recognised restructuring charges  
of US$23 million and the Group’s share of these charges amounts to £4 million (net of tax).

During 2010, the Group’s interest in ITC decreased from 31.92 per cent to 31.43 per cent as a result of ITC issuing ordinary shares under the 
company’s employee stock option scheme. This resulted in a charge of £9 million.  
In the year ended 31 December 2010, a subsidiary of Reynolds American, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Inc. (RJRTC), entered into a comprehensive 
settlement agreement with the Canadian federal, provincial and territorial governments to resolve all the governments’ civil claims related to smuggling 
in Canada during the 1980s and 1990s. As part of the civil settlement, RJRTC agreed to pay the governments CA$325 million. In a separate matter, a 
subsidiary of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc., Northern Brands International Inc., entered into a plea agreement with the Ministry of the Attorney 
General of Ontario. As a result of its plea to one count of conspiracy to aid others in the sale and possession of contraband cigarettes in the early 1990s, 
Northern Brands paid a fine of CA$75 million. The Group’s share of these charges amounted to £59 million (net of tax).  
In the year ended 31 December 2010, Reynolds American recognised the following amounts which have been combined in the table of adjusting items 
and reported in other: Reynolds American recognised restructuring charges from the closure of one factory in August 2010 and the planned closure  
of another in mid 2011. As a result of these actions, Reynolds American recorded charges mostly relating to asset impairment and, to a lesser extent, 
severance costs. The Group’s share of these charges amounted to £6 million (net of tax). RJRTC also received a payment of US$21 million as a result of 
the agreement to terminate early the Contract Manufacturing Agreement dated 30 July 2004 between RJRTC and BATUS Japan Inc., a wholly owned 
Group subsidiary, and settle all disputes at issue between the parties as explained in note 29. The Group’s share of this receipt amounted to £3 million 
(net of tax). In addition, Reynolds American recognised a trademark impairment charge of US$6 million as well as trademark amortisation of  
US$4 million. The Group’s share of these charges amounted to £1 million (net of tax).

(b) Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order 
British American Tobacco is the principal test claimant in an action in the United Kingdom against HM Revenue & Customs in the Franked Investment 
Income Group Litigation Order (FII GLO). There are 25 corporate groups in the FII GLO. The case concerns the treatment for UK corporate tax purposes 
of profits earned overseas and distributed to the UK. The claim was filed in 2003 and the case was heard in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2005 
and a decision of the ECJ received in December 2006. In July 2008, the case reverted to a trial in the UK High Court for the UK Court to determine how 
the principles of the ECJ decision should be applied in a UK context. 
The High Court judgment in November 2008 concluded, amongst many other things, that dividends received from EU subsidiaries should be, and 
should have been, exempt from UK taxation. It also concluded that certain dividends received before 5 April 1999 from the EU and, in some limited 
circumstances after 1993 from outside the EU, should have been treated as franked investment income with the consequence that advance corporation 
tax need not have been paid. Claims for the repayment of UK tax incurred where the dividends were from the EU can be made back to 1973. The 
tentative conclusion reached by the High Court would, if upheld, produce an estimated receivable of about £1.2 billion for British American Tobacco.

6 Taxation on ordinary activities continued 
The case was heard by the Court of Appeal in October 2009 and the judgment handed down on 23 February 2010. The Court of Appeal has 
determined that various questions should be referred back to the ECJ for further clarification. In addition, the Court determined that the claim should  
be restricted to six years and not cover claims dating back to 1973. This time restriction would, if upheld, reduce the value of the claim to between zero 
and £10 million. Based on advice received, the Company believes it has realistic prospects of success on further appeal. The Company sought leave to 
appeal from the Supreme Court in the UK and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal on time limits in February 2012.  
Several questions were referred back to the ECJ for further clarification and a hearing took place in February 2012 at the ECJ. The courts’ decisions  
are awaited.  
No potential receipt has been recognised in the current year or the prior year, in the results of the Group, due to the uncertainty of the amounts and 
eventual outcome.  
(c) Factors affecting the taxation charge 
The taxation charge differs from the standard 26 per cent (2010: 28 per cent) rate of corporation tax in the UK. The major causes of this difference are 
listed below:

7 Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share are based on profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £3,095 million (2010: £2,879 million) and 1,970 million 
(2010: 1,983 million) ordinary shares of 25p each, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year (excluding shares held as 
treasury shares). 
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is increased to 1,982 million (2010: 1,994 million)  
to reflect the potential dilutive effect of employee share schemes.

The Directors have recommended to shareholders a final dividend of 88.4 pence per share for the year ended 31 December 2011. If approved,  
this dividend will be paid to shareholders on 3 May 2012. This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and 
therefore, in accordance with IAS 10, it has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. The total estimated dividend to be paid is 
£1,741 million, which takes the total dividends declared in respect of 2011 to £2,479 million (2010: £2,282 million) representing 126.5 pence  
per share (2010: 114.2 pence per share).

Included in computer software and assets in the course of development are internally developed assets with a carrying value of £203 million (2010: 
£150 million). The costs of internally developed assets include capitalised expenses of employees working full time on software development projects, 
third party consultants, as well as software licence fees from third party suppliers. 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries relate to the acquisition of Protabaco as explained in note 26(a). 
Included in the net book value of trademarks and licences are trademarks relating to the acquisition of ST £367 million (2010: £412 million), Tekel  
£45 million (2010: £61 million) and Bentoel £80 million (2010: £94 million), as well as £119 million from the acquisition of Protabaco in 2011.  
As a result of a loss of volumes in 2010, the Tekel trademarks were impaired by £44 million as explained in note 3(g). The recoverable amounts of the 
Tekel trademarks was determined on a value-in-use basis over their remaining useful economic lives applying the same assumptions used to determine 
the recoverable amount of the Group’s Turkey cash-generating unit as described below.

9 Intangible assets continued 
Impairment testing for intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill 
Goodwill of £11,120 million (2010: £11,656 million) is included in intangible assets in the balance sheet of which the following are the significant 
acquisitions: Rothmans Group £4,947 million (2010: £5,176 million); Imperial Tobacco Canada £2,533 million (2010: £2,576 million); ETI (Italy) 
£1,377 million (2010: £1,412 million); ST (principally Scandinavia) £1,038 million (2010: £1,062 million) and Tekel (Turkey) £nil million (2010:  
£333 million). The principal allocations of goodwill in the Rothmans’ acquisition are to the cash-generating units of Eastern Europe, Western Europe 
and South Africa, with the remainder mainly relating to operations in the domestic and export markets in the United Kingdom and operations in  
Asia-Pacific.  
As a consequence of the Group’s new regional structure and the integrated nature of the activities, goodwill associated with the additional markets 
now part of the Western Europe region has been allocated to the Western Europe cash-generating unit, which was effective from 1 January 2011. 
Goodwill associated with markets now part of the new EEMEA region remains in the Eastern Europe cash-generating unit. 
Due to initiatives to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of the Group as a globally integrated enterprise and the integrated nature of the 
activities, the goodwill arising from the ST acquisition (principally Scandinavia) and ETI (Italy) have been transferred to the Western Europe cash-
generating unit with effect from 1 January 2011. 
In 2011, goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to 15 individual cash-generating units – five in Asia-Pacific, five in the Americas, 
two in Western Europe and three in EEMEA. In 2010, goodwill was allocated for impairment testing purposes to 16 individual cash-generating units – 
five in Asia-Pacific, four in the Americas, four in Western Europe and three in EEMEA.  
The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units of Canada £2,533 million (2010: £2,576 million), Western Europe (includes 
Rothmans and other acquisitions) £3,646 million (2010: £3,726 million restated), Eastern Europe (includes Rothmans and other acquisitions)  
£914 million (2010: £931 million restated), South Africa £883 million (2010: £1,069 million), Australia (includes Rothmans and other acquisitions)  
£884 million (2010: £877 million), Singapore £530 million (2010: £532 million) and Malaysia £478 million (2010: £488 million) are considered 
significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill. As explained below, the goodwill in respect of Turkey, which was £333 million  
at 31 December 2010, has been fully impaired in 2011. 
The recoverable amount of all cash-generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis. The key assumptions for the recoverable amount  
of all units are the long-term growth rate and the discount rate. The long-term growth rate used is purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under 
IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets) and does not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other 
assessments. The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to 
which specific market-related premium adjustments are made. These adjustments are derived from external sources and are based on the spread 
between bonds (or credit default swaps, or similar indicators) issued by the US or comparable governments and by the local government, adjusted  
for the Group’s own credit market risk. For ease of use and consistency in application, these results are periodically calibrated into bands based on 
internationally recognised credit ratings. These assumptions have been applied to the individual cash flows of each unit as compiled by local 
management in the different markets.  
The valuations use cash flows based on detailed financial budgets prepared by management covering a one year period, with growth in year 2 of  
6 per cent. Cash flows for the years 3 to 10 are extrapolated from year 2 cash flows at 5 per cent per annum, including 2 per cent inflation, whereafter a 
total growth rate of 2 per cent per annum (including 2 per cent inflation) has been assumed. The extrapolated growth rates are considered conservative 
given the Group’s history of profit and cash growth, its well balanced portfolio of brands and the industry in which it operates. The long-term real 
growth does not exceed the expected long-term average growth rate for the combined markets in which the cash-generating units operate. In some 
instances, such as recent acquisitions or start-up ventures, the valuation is expanded to reflect the medium-term plan of management, spanning five 
years or beyond. The recoverable amount of the Turkey cash-generating unit has been determined on a value-in-use basis using a 10 year cash flow 
forecast with cash flows after year 10 extrapolated as described above. The impairment recognised in 2010 was calculated on the basis of no further 
significant excise increases. However, the Turkish government announced a further excise increase effective from October 2011 with an additional 
increase effective from January 2013. A ten year forecast is considered appropriate as this takes account of the expectation of sharp declines in volumes 
in 2012 and 2013, followed by gradual stabilisation and recovery. In addition, the forecast assumes no further increases in excise. As explained in note 
3(g), although cost saving initiatives in the acquisition plan have been delivered successfully, as a direct result of the above, the remaining goodwill 
balance has been impaired by £273 million in 2011 (2010: £249 million). In 2011, there was no impairment of the trademarks in Turkey (2010:  
£44 million). Other than the impairment charge recognised in respect of Tekel goodwill, no other goodwill impairment charges were recognised  
in 2011 or 2010. 
Pre-tax discount rates of between 7.2 per cent and 18.0 per cent (2010: 7.8 per cent to 18.7 per cent) were used, based on the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital, together with any premium applicable for economic and political risks. 
The pre-tax discount rates used for the cash-generating units which are significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill are 8.8  
per cent for Canada (2010: 9.7 per cent), 8.6 per cent for Western Europe (2010: 9.3 per cent), 10 per cent for Eastern Europe (2010: 10.6 per cent),  
10.8 per cent for South Africa (2010: 11.5 per cent), 8.6 per cent for Australia (2010: 9.3 per cent), 7.2 per cent for Singapore (2010: 7.8 per cent),  
9.3 per cent for Malaysia (2010: 10.0 per cent) and 11.3 per cent for Turkey (2010: 11.9 per cent). 
If discounted cash flows for cash-generating units should fall by 10 per cent, or the discount rate was increased at a post-tax rate of 1 per cent,  
there would be no further impairment.

arising from the Reynolds transaction in 2004 has been reported in the income statement. In addition, the non-current assets above include £669 
million (2010: £664 million) of goodwill and £310 million (2010: £310 million) of trademarks arising from the acquisition of Conwood by Reynolds 
American in 2006. 
Details of the Group’s contingent liabilities are set out in note 30. In addition to US litigation involving Group companies, which is covered by the  
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJRT) indemnity referred to in note 30, Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) group companies are named in litigation which 
does not involve Group companies. While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse 
verdict, it is not impossible that the results of operations or cash flows of RAI, in particular quarterly or annual periods, could be materially affected by 
this and by the final outcome of any particular litigation. However, having regard to the contingent liability disclosures on litigation made by RAI in its 
public financial reports, the Directors are satisfied with the carrying value included above for RAI.

Additional information on associates is provided in the principal associate undertaking sections to the Annual Report. 
12 Retirement benefit schemes 
The Group’s subsidiary undertakings operate around 175 retirement benefit arrangements worldwide. These arrangements have been developed in 
accordance with local practices in the countries concerned. The majority of scheme members belong to defined benefit schemes, most of which are 
funded externally and many of which are closed to new entrants. The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes. 
The liabilities arising in the defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, 
using the projected unit credit method. All schemes are formally valued at least every three years. 
The principal pension schemes are in the UK, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Together these schemes account for over  
85 per cent of the total obligations of the Group’s defined benefit schemes. 
In addition, the Group operates significant schemes in Canada which provide employees with certain other retirement benefits, such as healthcare.  
The liabilities in respect of these benefits are also assessed by qualified independent actuaries, applying the projected unit credit method. 
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows:

The actuarial gains and losses in both years principally relate to movements in the market value of scheme assets. 
Contributions to defined benefit schemes are determined after consultation with the respective trustees and actuaries of the individual externally funded 
schemes and taking into account regulatory requirements. 
Contributions in 2012 are expected to be £295 million for pension schemes and £7 million for healthcare schemes, compared to £242 million and  
£7 million, respectively, in 2011.

Discount rate 4.7 5.0 4.0 4.7 3.0
General inflation 3.0 1.7 2.5 1.5 Nil
For healthcare inflation in Canada, the assumption is 8.5 per cent reducing to 5.0 per cent by 2018. 
For the remaining pension schemes, typical assumptions are that real salary increases will be from 0 per cent to 4.5 per cent per annum and discount 
rates will be from 0 per cent to 5.25 per cent above inflation. Pension increases, where allowed for, were generally assumed to be in line with inflation.

Discount rate 5.4 4.8 4.7 5.1 3.0
General inflation 3.4 1.5 2.5 1.9 0.4
For healthcare inflation in Canada, the assumption was 9.0 per cent reducing to 5.0 per cent by 2018. 
For the remaining pension schemes, typical assumptions were that real salary increases will be from 0 per cent to 4 per cent per annum and discount 
rates will be from 1 per cent to 8 per cent above inflation. Pension increases, where allowed for, are generally assumed to be in line with inflation. 
Discount rates are determined by reference to normal yields on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date. For countries where there is not 
a deep market in such corporate bonds, the yield on government bonds is used. 
Mortality assumptions are subject to regular review. In Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands the same tables were used for both years. In 
Canada UP94 tables, in Germany Heubeck tables 2005G, in Switzerland EVK 2000 mortality tables and in the Netherlands AG Prognosetafel 2010-2060 
mortality tables have been used. In the UK the S1NA (year of birth) table with the Continuous Mortality Investigation (2009) model with a 1.5 per cent 
long term improvement rate, has been used. In 2010 the PXA92 (year of birth) table rated up two years for active and deferred members, with a  
1.2 per cent underpin on future improvements and the PXA92 (year of birth) table rated up three years for current pensioners with no underpin  
on future improvements, all with the medium cohort effect were used. 
Based on the above, the weighted average life expectancy, in years, for mortality tables used to determine benefit obligations is as follows: 
 UK Germany Canada Netherlands Switzerland 
 Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female

12 Retirement benefit schemes continued 
Valuation of post-retirement schemes involves judgments about uncertain future events. Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure 
the principal pension schemes as at 31 December 2011 are set out below. These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the 
listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions such  
as salary increases. While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and  
the impacts may offset to some extent.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £360 million (2010: £421 million) which have no expiry date and unused tax losses  
of £561 million (2010: £538 million) which will expire within the next 10 years. No amount of deferred tax has been recognised in respect of these 
unused losses. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of deductible temporary differences of £1,184 million  
(2010: £795 million), which have no expiry date and £128 million, which will expire within the next 10 years. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax credits of £80 million (2010: £80 million) which have no expiry date. No amount of deferred tax 
has been recognised in respect of these unused tax credits. 
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries which would be subject to dividend withholding tax was  
£2 billion (2010: £2 billion). No liability has been recognised in respect of this withholding tax because the Group is in a position to control the timing  
of these distributions and it is probable that these distributions will not be made in the foreseeable future.

Impairment of trade receivables, including write offs and allowances, charged during the year is included as part of other operating expenses. For 2011, 
the net impairment charged was £11 million (2010: £3 million) of which £8 million (2010: £nil), is reflected in the above table. 
As at 31 December 2011, trade and other receivables of £42 million (2010: £58 million) were past their contractual payment date but not impaired. 
These relate to a number of external parties where there is no expectation of default. The aged analysis of these trade receivables is as follows:

There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other receivables and their fair value due to the short-term duration of the 
majority of trade and other receivables. There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number of 
internationally dispersed customers.

The fair values of derivatives are determined based on market data (primarily yield curves, implied volatilities and exchange rates) to calculate the 
present value of all estimated flows associated with each derivative at the balance sheet date. In the absence of sufficient market data, fair values would 
be based on the quoted market price of similar derivatives. The classification of these derivative assets and liabilities under the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy 
is given in note 24.

The Group’s cash flow hedges are principally in respect of sales or purchases of inventory and certain debt instruments. The timing of expected cash 
flows in respect of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is broadly expected to be comparable to the time periods when the hedged item will 
affect profit or loss. 
At 31 December 2010, the Group had a receive €465 million fixed rate, pay DKK 3,468 million fixed rate cross-currency swap which was bifurcated into 
a receive €465 million fixed rate pay £368 million fixed rate cross-currency swap designated as a cash flow hedge and a receive £368 million fixed rate 
pay DKK 3,468 million fixed rate cross-currency swap designated as a net investment hedge.  
Following the maturity of the swap in 2011, the Group entered into a receive €467 million, pay DKK 3,470 million foreign exchange forward contract 
which has been bifurcated into a receive €467 million, pay £398 million foreign exchange forward contract designated as a cash flow hedge and a 
receive £398 million, pay DKK 3,470 million foreign exchange forward contract designated as a net investment hedge.  
The above table includes the timing of expected cash flows on the bifurcated foreign exchange forward contract designated as a cash flow hedge and 
the cross-currency swap designated as a cash flow hedge for 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The share premium account includes the difference between the value of shares issued and their nominal value. The increase of £3 million  
(2010: £3 million) relates solely to ordinary shares issued under the Company’s share option schemes. These schemes are described in the 
remuneration report. 
On the purchase of own shares as part of the share buy-back programme for shares which are cancelled, a transfer is made from retained earnings  
to the capital redemption reserve equivalent to the nominal value of shares purchased. Purchased shares which are not cancelled are classified as 
treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity. 
Total equity attributable to owners of the parent is stated after deducting the cost of treasury shares which include £1,278 million (2010: £523 million) 
for shares repurchased and not cancelled and £261 million (2010: £227 million) in respect of the cost of own shares held in employee share  
ownership trusts. 
Transaction costs deducted from equity for the year ended 31 December 2011 were £5 million (2010: £nil). 
In 1999, shares were issued for the acquisition of the Rothmans International B.V. Group, and the difference between the fair value of shares issued  
and their nominal value was credited to merger reserves.

Other reserves comprise: 
(a) £483 million which arose in 1998 from merger accounting in a Scheme of Arrangement and Reconstruction whereby British American Tobacco 
p.l.c. acquired the entire share capital of B.A.T Industries p.l.c. and the share capital of that company’s principal financial services subsidiaries was 
distributed, so effectively demerging them; and 
(b) In the Rothmans transaction, convertible redeemable preference shares were issued as part of the consideration. The discount on these shares was 
amortised by crediting other reserves and charging retained earnings. The £90 million balance in other reserves comprises the accumulated balance in 
respect of the preference shares converted during 2004.

The restructuring provisions relate to the restructuring and integration costs incurred and reported as adjusting items in the income statement.  
The principal restructuring activities in 2011 and 2010 are as described in note 3(e). While some elements of the non-current provisions of £72 million  
will unwind over several years, as termination payments are made over extended periods in some countries, it is estimated that one-third will unwind in 
2013 and over 80 per cent within five years. 
Employee related benefits mainly relate to long-term employee benefits other than post-retirement benefits. As the principal components of these 
provisions are long service awards and ‘jubilee’ payments due after a certain service period, they will unwind over several years. It is estimated that 
approximately 50 per cent of the non-current provisions of £28 million will unwind within five years. 
A provision of £274 million has been made for a potential claim under a 1998 settlement agreement entered into by a Group subsidiary in respect  
of the clean up of sediment in the lower Fox River. This is explained in more detail in note 30 (see page 182). 
Other provisions comprise balances set up in the ordinary course of general business that cannot be classified within the other categories, such as sales 
returns, onerous contracts, together with amounts in respect of supplier, excise and other disputes. The nature of the amounts provided in respect  
of disputes is such that the extent and timing of cash flows is difficult to estimate, and the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided. 
Amounts provided above are shown net of reversals of unused provisions which include £1 million for restructuring of existing businesses, £1 million 
for employee benefits and £17 million for other provisions.

Accrued charges and deferred income include £8 million (2010: £30 million) in respect of interest payable. Amounts payable to related parties 
including associated undertakings are shown in note 29. 
There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other payables and their fair value due to the short-term duration of  
the majority of trade and other payables. 
Trade and other payables are predominantly denominated in the functional currencies of subsidiary undertakings with less than 5 per cent in  
other currencies. 
24 Financial instruments and risk management 
Management of financial risks 
One of the principal responsibilities of Treasury is to manage the financial risks arising from the Group’s underlying operations. Specifically, Treasury 
manages, within an overall policy framework set by the Group’s Main Board and Corporate Finance Committee (CFC), the Group’s exposure to 
funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty risks. The Group’s treasury position is monitored by the CFC which meets 
regularly throughout the year and is chaired by the Group Finance Director. The approach is one of risk reduction within an overall framework of 
delivering total shareholder return. 
The Group defines capital as net debt (see note 21) and equity (see note 20). The only externally imposed capital requirement for the Group is interest 
cover as described under Interest rate risk below. The Group assesses its financial capacity by reference to cash flow, net debt and interest cover. Group 
policies include a set of financing principles and key performance indicators including the monitoring of credit ratings, interest cover and liquidity. 
These provide a framework within which the Group’s capital base is managed and, in particular, the policies on dividends (as a percentage of long-term 
sustainable earnings) and share buy-back are decided. The key objective of the financing principles is to appropriately balance the interests of equity 
and debt holders in driving an efficient financing mix for the Group.  
The Group manages its financial risks in line with the classification of its financial assets and liabilities in the Group’s balance sheet and related notes. 
The Group’s management of specific risks is dealt with as follows: 
Liquidity risk 
It is the policy of the Group to maximise financial flexibility and minimise refinancing risk by issuing debt with a range of maturities, generally matching 
the projected cash flows of the Group and obtaining this financing from a wide range of providers. The Group has a target average centrally managed 
debt maturity of at least 5 years with no more than 20 per cent of centrally managed debt maturing in a single rolling year. As at 31 December 2011, 
the average centrally managed debt maturity was 7.0 years (2010: 7.4 years) and the highest proportion of centrally managed debt maturing in a 
single rolling year was 18.3 per cent (2010: 12.5 per cent). In June 2011, the Group established an US$2 billion commercial paper programme. It is 
Group policy that short-term sources of funds (including drawings under both the US$ programme and the existing Group £1 billion euro commercial 
paper (ECP) programme) are backed by undrawn committed lines of credit and cash. At 31 December 2011 £85 million of commercial paper was 
outstanding (2010: undrawn). 
In November 2011, the Group issued a new €600 million bond with a maturity of November 2021. 
In September 2011, the Group repaid a Mexican peso 1,444 million borrowing which was due in September 2011 with a new Mexican peso  
1,444 million borrowing due 2014. 
In August 2011, the Group extended the maturity date of a US$200 million facility from 2011 to 2016, and simultaneously increased the size of the 
facility to US$240 million. This facility is drawable in Chilean peso and was drawn to the value of US$225 million at 31 December 2011. The undrawn 
element of US$15 million is available for drawing until February 2013.

In June 2011, the Group repaid a €530 million bond with the repayment financed from Group cash balances.  
During the year, the Group’s subsidiary in Brazil received proceeds of £401 million (2010: £410 million) from short-term borrowings in respect  
of advance payments on leaf export contracts and repaid £519 million (2010: £297 million). 
In December 2010, the Group negotiated a new central banking facility of £2 billion with a final maturity date of December 2015. This facility is 
provided by 22 banks. The existing central banking facility of £1.75 billion, with a final maturity date of March 2012 was cancelled at the same time.  
The facility was undrawn at both 31 December 2011 and 2010. 
On 25 June 2010, the terms of €470 million of the €1 billion bond maturing in 2011 were modified by extending the maturity to 2020; at the same 
time, the Group issued an additional €130 million bond with a maturity of 2020. In addition, €413 million of the Group’s €750 million bond maturing 
in 2012 was purchased and cancelled. At the same time, the Group issued a new £275 million bond with a maturity of 2040.  
In May 2010, the Group repaid a €525 million bond. The repayment was financed from debt issued in November 2009. 
The Group utilises cash pooling and zero balancing bank account structures in addition to intercompany loans and borrowings to ensure that there is 
the maximum mobilisation of cash within the Group. The key objectives of Treasury in respect of cash and cash equivalents are to protect the principal 
value of cash and cash equivalents, to concentrate cash at the centre to minimise the required long-term debt issuance, and to optimise the yield 
earned. The amount of debt issued by the Group is determined by forecasting the net debt requirement after the mobilisation of cash. 
The Group continues to target investment-grade credit ratings; as at 31 December 2011 the ratings from Moody’s and S&P were Baa1 (stable outlook) 
/ BBB+ (positive outlook) (2010: Baa1/BBB+) and these ratings were maintained throughout the year. The S&P outlook switched from stable to positive 
on 30 November 2011. The strength of the ratings has underpinned the debt issuance during 2011 and 2010 and, despite the impact of the turbulence 
in financial markets, the Group is confident of its ability to successfully access the debt capital markets, as demonstrated with the issue of bonds in the 
euro and sterling markets in 2011 and 2010. 
As part of its short-term cash management, the Group invests in a range of cash and cash equivalents, including money market funds, which are 
regarded as highly liquid and are not exposed to significant changes in fair value. These are kept under continuous review as described in the credit  
risk section below. At 31 December 2011, cash and cash equivalents include £558 million invested in money market funds (2010: £642 million). 
Subsidiary companies are funded by share capital and retained earnings, loans from the central finance companies on commercial terms, or through 
local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies. All contractual borrowing covenants have been met and none of them is expected  
to inhibit the Group’s operations or funding plans. 
Currency risk 
The Group is subject to exposure on the translation of the net assets of foreign currency subsidiaries and associates into its reporting currency, sterling. 
The Group’s primary balance sheet translation exposures are to the US dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Danish krone, Turkish lira, South African rand, 
Russian rouble, Brazilian real, Australian dollar and Japanese yen. These exposures are kept under continuous review. The Group’s policy on borrowings 
is to broadly match the currency of these borrowings with the currency of cash flows arising from the Group’s underlying operations. Within this overall 
policy, the Group aims to minimise all balance sheet translation exposure where it is practicable and cost-effective to do so through matching currency 
assets with currency borrowings. The main objective of these policies is to protect shareholder value by increasing certainty and minimising volatility in 
earnings per share. At 31 December 2011, the currency profile of the Group’s gross debt, after taking into account derivative contracts, was 14 per cent 
(2010: 13 per cent) US dollar, 43 per cent (2010: 47 per cent) euro, 3 per cent (2010: 3 per cent) Canadian dollar, 12 per cent (2010: 11 per cent) 
sterling, 11 per cent (2010: 10 per cent) Australian dollar and 17 per cent (2010: 16 per cent) other currencies. 
The Group faces currency exposures arising from the translation of profits earned in foreign currency subsidiaries and associates and joint ventures; 
these exposures are not normally hedged. Exposures also arise from: 
(i) foreign currency denominated trading transactions undertaken by subsidiaries. These exposures comprise committed and highly probable forecast 
sales and purchases, which are offset wherever possible. The remaining exposures are hedged within the Treasury policies and procedures with forward 
foreign exchange contracts and options, which are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk of the identified future transactions; and 
(ii) forecast dividend flows from subsidiaries to the centre. To ensure cash flow certainty, the Group hedges such flows using forward foreign exchange 
contracts designated as net investment hedges of the foreign exchange risk arising from the investments in these subsidiaries. 
IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the income statement and on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income of 
hypothetical changes of exchange rates in respect of non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities held across the Group. All other variables are 
held constant although, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation. Financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of the Group’s 
subsidiaries, as well as non-financial assets and liabilities and translation risk, are not included in the analysis. The Group considers a 10 per cent 
strengthening or weakening of the functional currency against the non-functional currency of its subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change. The 
impact is calculated with reference to the financial asset or liability held as at the year end, unless this is unrepresentative of the position during the year.

A 10 per cent strengthening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being £16 million higher (2010: 
£36 million higher) and items recognised directly in other comprehensive income being £227 million higher (2010: £273 million higher). A 10 per cent 
weakening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being £23 million lower (2010: £44 million lower) 
and items recognised directly in other comprehensive income being £277 million lower (2010: £333 million lower). 
The exchange sensitivities on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income relate to hedging of certain net asset currency positions in the 
Group as well as on cash flow hedges in respect of future transactions, but does not include sensitivities in respect of exchange on non-financial assets 
or liabilities. 
Interest rate risk 
The objectives of the Group’s interest rate risk management policy are to lessen the impact of adverse interest rate movements on the earnings, cash 
flow and economic value of the Group and to safeguard against any possible breach of its financial covenants. Additional objectives are to minimise  
the cost of hedging and the associated counterparty risk. 
The Group targets an interest cover ratio, as calculated under its key central banking facilities, of greater than 5 and for 2011 it is 12.5 times (2010:  
11.2 times). The only externally imposed capital requirement the Group has is in respect of its centrally managed banking facilities, which require  
a gross interest cover of 4.5. 
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt. The Group sets targets (within overall guidelines) for 
the desired ratio of floating to fixed rate debt on both a gross and net basis (at least 50 per cent fixed on a net basis in the short to the medium-term) as  
a result of regular reviews of market conditions and strategy by the Corporate Finance Committee and the board of the main central finance company. 
At 31 December 2011, the relevant ratios of floating to fixed rate borrowings were 38:62 (2010: 33:67) on a gross basis and 17:83 (2010: 9:91) on a net 
basis. Underlying borrowings are arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where appropriate, the Group uses derivatives, primarily 
interest rate swaps, to vary the fixed and floating mix. The interest rate profile of liquid assets is taken into account in determining the net interest  
rate exposure. 
IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the income statement and on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income of 
hypothetical changes of interest rates in respect of financial assets and liabilities of the Group. All other variables are held constant although, in practice, 
market rates rarely change in isolation. For the purposes of this sensitivity analysis, financial assets and liabilities with fixed interest rates are not included. 
The Group considers a 100 basis point change in interest rates a reasonably possible change except where rates are less than 100 basis points. In these 
instances it is assumed that the interest rates increase by 100 basis points and decrease to zero for the purpose of performing the sensitivity analysis. The 
impact is calculated with reference to the financial asset or liability held as at the year end, unless this is unrepresentative of the position during the year. 
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in pre-tax profit being £18 million lower (2010: £12 million lower). A 100 basis point decrease in 
interest rates, or less where applicable, would result in pre-tax profit being £21 million higher (2010: £8 million higher). The effect of these interest rate 
changes on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is not material in either year. 
Credit risk 
The Group has no significant concentrations of customer credit risk. Subsidiaries have policies in place requiring appropriate credit checks on potential 
customers before sales commence. The process for monitoring and managing credit risk once sales to customers have been made varies depending  
on local practice in the countries concerned. 
Certain territories have bank guarantees, other guarantees and credit insurance provided in the Group’s favour in respect of Group trade receivables, 
the issuance and terms of which are dependent on local practices in the countries concerned. 
All derivatives are subject to ISDA agreements or equivalent documentation.  
Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from the related counterparties. Generally the Group targets a 
long-term counterparty credit rating of at least A/A2. However the Group recognises that due to the need to operate over a large geographic footprint, 
sovereign risk can be the determining factor on the suitability of a counterparty. From time to time the Group may invest in short-dated corporate 
commercial paper and for this, the Group identifies specific counterparties with a minimum short-term rating of A1/P1. 
Counterparty credit risk is managed on a global basis by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty, taking into 
account its credit rating. The credit ratings of all counterparties are reviewed regularly.

24 Financial instruments and risk management continued 
The Group ensures that it has sufficient counterparty credit capacity of requisite quality to undertake all anticipated transactions throughout its 
geographic footprint, while at the same time ensuring that there is no geographic concentration in the location of counterparties. 
The maximum exposure to the credit risk of financial assets at the balance sheet date is reflected by the carrying values included in the Group’s balance 
sheet. In addition, the Group has issued guarantees to third parties, part of which has been recognised on the balance sheet in accordance with IAS 39. 
The unrecognised portion of these guarantees amounts to £28 million (2010: £64 million). 
Price risk 
The Group is exposed to equity price risk on equity investments held by the Group, which are included in available-for-sale investments on the 
consolidated balance sheet, but the quantum of such is not material. 
Hedge accounting 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document prospectively the relationship between the item being hedged and  
the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is reperformed periodically to ensure  
that the hedge has remained, and is expected to remain highly effective. 
Fair value estimation 
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities with maturities of less than one year, other than derivatives, are assumed to approximate their book 
values. For other financial instruments which are measured at fair value in the balance sheet, the basis for fair values is described below.

Level 1 financial instruments are traded in an active market and fair value is based on quoted prices at the year end. This category includes listed equity 
shares of £2 million (2010: £9 million). 
Level 2 financial instruments are not traded in an active market, but the fair values are based on quoted market prices, broker/ dealer quotations,  
or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. The Group’s level 2 financial instruments include certain money market 
securities and most OTC derivatives. 
The fair values of level 3 financial instruments have been determined using a valuation technique where at least one input (which could have a 
significant effect on the instrument’s valuation) is not based on observable market data. The Group’s level 3 financial instruments primarily consist  
of an equity investment in an unquoted entity which is valued using the discounted cash flows of estimated future dividends. The valuation assumes 
the following:  
 future dividends grow by 1.7 per cent (2010: 2 per cent) and a 100 basis points decrease in the growth rate would result in the valuation being  
£6 million lower (2010: £2 million lower); and 
 discount rate of 7 per cent (2010: 8 per cent) and a 100 basis points decrease in the discount rate would result in the valuation being £9 million 
higher (2010: £4 million higher).

in respect of current investments of £3 million (2010: £1 million outflow). 
(b) Proceeds from associates’ share buy-backs 
In 2011, the proceeds from associates’ share buy-backs reflect proceeds of £71 million in respect of the Group’s participation in the share buy-back 
programme conducted by Reynolds American Inc. 
(c) Purchase of other subsidiaries and associates 
In 2011, the net cash outflow of £295 million on the purchase of Protabaco reflects the settlement of the purchase consideration of £298 million less  
the acquired net cash and cash equivalents of £3 million, as explained in note 26(a). 
(d) Proceeds on disposal of subsidiaries 
In 2010, the proceeds on disposal of subsidiaries reflects the consideration received, less cash and cash equivalents disposed of, from the sale of the 
Group’s Belgium distribution business, Lyfra NV, as explained in note 26(b).  
Cash flows from financing activities 
(a) Cash flows from borrowings 
During the year, the Group established an US$2 billion commercial paper programme. It is Group policy that short-term sources of funds (including 
drawings under both the US$ programme and the existing Group £1 billion euro commercial paper (ECP) programme) are backed by undrawn 
committed lines of credit and cash. At 31 December 2011 £85 million of commercial paper was outstanding (2010: undrawn). 
In November 2011, the Group issued a new €600 million bond with a maturity of November 2021. 
In September 2011, the Group repaid a Mexican Peso 1,444 million borrowing which was due in September 2011 with a new Mexican peso  
1,444 million borrowing due 2014.

On 25 June 2010, the terms of €470 million of the €1 billion bond maturing in 2011 were modified by extending the maturity to 2020; at the same 
time, the Group issued an additional €130 million bond with a maturity of 2020. In addition, €413 million of the Group’s €750 million bond maturing 
in 2012 was purchased and cancelled. At the same time, the Group issued a new £275 million bond with a maturity of 2040.  
In May 2010, the Group repaid a €525 million bond. The repayment was financed from debt issued in November 2009.  
(b) Movements relating to derivative financial instruments 
The movement relating to derivative financial instruments is in respect of derivatives taken out to hedge cash and cash equivalents and external 
borrowings, derivatives taken out to hedge inter company loans and borrowings and derivatives treated as net investment hedges. Derivatives taken 
out as cash flow hedges in respect of financing activities are also included in the movement relating to derivative financial instruments, while other such 
derivatives in respect of operating and investing activities are reflected along with the underlying transactions. 
(c) Purchase of non-controlling interests 
In 2011, the cash outflow of £10 million arises from the acquisition of non-controlling interests in Chile. The cash outflow of £12 million in 2010 arises 
from the acquisition of non-controlling interests in Bentoel of shareholders who did not wish to participate in the merger of Bentoel and BAT Indonesia 
as well as non-controlling interests in subsidiaries in the EEMEA region.

26 Business combinations and disposals 
(a) Productora Tabacalera de Colombia, S.A.S. (Protabaco) 
On 11 October 2011, the Group acquired from Flentex Holdings Limited and Trioumvir Enterprises Limited, both private investor shareholders, a  
100 per cent stake in Productora Tabacalera de Colombia, S.A.S. (Protabaco), the second largest cigarette company in Colombia, for US$461 million 
(£298 million). The purchase price is subject to the final agreement of adjustments for working capital and net debt with the vendors. The completion 
follows earlier approval by Colombia’s competition authority, the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce, on 2 August 2011.  
The goodwill of £134 million on the acquisition of the cigarette business of Protabaco, stated at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction,

Acquisition costs of £3 million have been expensed as part of other operating expenses within restructuring and integration costs (note 3(e)). 
The goodwill of £134 million on the acquisition of the business represents a strategic premium to strengthen the Group’s position in Latin America’s 
fourth largest market by building on the Group’s existing business, and anticipated synergies that will arise from combining the businesses in 
Colombia, post-acquisition. 
In the period from 11 October 2011 to 31 December 2011 the acquired business contributed revenue of £9 million and a loss from operations of  
£13 million after charging £2 million for amortisation of acquired intangibles and £10 million in respect of restructuring and integration costs. 
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2011, before accounting for anticipated synergies and restructuring benefits, it is currently estimated  
that Group revenue would have been £15,452 million and Group profit from operations would have been £4,714 million for the 12 months to  
31 December 2011. These amounts have been estimated based on Protabaco’s results for the period prior to acquisition, adjusted to reflect changes 
arising from differences in accounting policies and the anticipated effect of fair value adjustments. The amounts reported for profit from operations are 
after charging £9 million for the amortisation of acquired intangibles for the period to 11 October 2011. 
(b) Lyfra NV 
On 7 April 2010, the Group announced that it had agreed to sell its Belgium distribution business, Lyfra NV, to Landewyck Group S.a.r.l. The transaction 
was completed on 25 June 2010 for a consideration of €16 million and resulted in a gain of £5 million. Lyfra contributed £215 million to revenue and 
£1 million to profit from operations to 25 June 2010 in the Western Europe region. 
(c) Items classified as held-for-sale 
At 31 December 2011, held-for-sale assets comprise mainly land and buildings in Turkey and Denmark which are being actively marketed for sale.  
At 31 December 2010, the held-for-sale assets included amounts in relation to land and buildings in Canada which were sold in early 2011.  
(d) Gauloises licence agreement termination 
With effect from the end of the first quarter in 2010, the Gauloises licence agreement applicable in Germany, was terminated. The agreement resulted 
in a revenue contribution of £37 million and a profit contribution of £5 million to the 2010 results in the Western Europe region. 
(e) Phone card distribution business in Brazil 
During 2010, the Group made the decision to withdraw from distributing phone cards in Brazil. The phone card distribution business contributed  
£134 million to revenue and £3 million to profit from operations in the Americas region in 2010.

27 Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment arrangements of which the two principal ones are: 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
Nil-cost options exercisable after three years from date of grant with a contractual life of ten years. Payout is subject to performance conditions based  
on earnings per share relative to inflation (50 per cent of grant) and total shareholder return, combining the share price and dividend performance  
of the Company by reference to two comparator groups (50 per cent of grant). Participants are not entitled to dividends prior to the exercise of the 
options. A cash equivalent dividend accrues through the vesting period and is paid on vesting. Both equity and cash-settled LTIPs are granted in March 
each year. In 2011 the Management Board LTIP award was made in May. 
Deferred Share Bonus Scheme (DSBS) 
Free ordinary shares released three years from date of grant and may be subject to forfeit if participant leaves employment before the end of the  
three year holding period. Participants receive a separate payment equivalent to a proportion of the dividend payment during the holding period.  
Both equity and cash-settled grants are granted in March each year. 
The Group also has a number of other arrangements which are not material for the Group and these are as follows: 
Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
Options exercisable three years from date of grant with a contractual life of ten years, subject to earnings per share performance condition relative  
to inflation. Participants are not entitled to receive dividends in the period prior to the exercise of the options. 
The granting of options under this scheme ceased with the last grant made in March 2004 and final outstanding awards must be exercised by  
March 2014. The awards were both equity and cash-settled.  
Sharesave Scheme (SAYE) 
Options granted in March each year from 2011 onwards (previously November until 2009 and no options were granted during 2010) by invitation at  
a 20 per cent discount to the market price. Options to this equity-settled scheme are exercisable at the end of a three year or five year savings contract. 
Participants are not entitled to dividends prior to the exercise of the options. The maximum amount that can be saved by a participant in this way is 
£3,000 in any tax year. 
Share Reward Scheme (SRS) and International Share Reward Scheme (ISRS) 
Free shares granted in April each year (maximum £3,000 in any year) under the equity-settled scheme are subject to a three year holding period. 
Participants receive dividends during the holding period which are reinvested to buy further shares. 
Partnership Share Scheme 
Open to all eligible employees, where employees can allocate part of their pre-tax salary to purchase shares in British American Tobacco p.l.c.  
The maximum amount that can be allocated in this way to any individual is £1,500 in any tax year. The shares purchased are held in a UK-based  
trust and are normally capable of transfer to participants tax free after a five year holding period. 
Further details on the operation of share-based payment arrangements can be found in the remuneration report.

Fair values determined from the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models use assumptions revised at the end of each reporting period for cash-settled 
share-based payment arrangements. 
The expected British American Tobacco p.l.c. share price volatility was determined taking account of the return index, (the share price index plus the 
dividend reinvested) over a five year period. The respective FMCG and FTSE 100 share price volatility and correlations were also determined over the 
same periods. The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions, forfeiture and historical experience. 
The risk-free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to 
exercise for each relevant grant. The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the yield from the last two declared dividends divided by 
the grant share price.  
In addition to these valuation assumptions, LTIP awards contain earnings per share performance conditions. As these are non-market performance 
conditions they are not included in the determination of fair value of share options at the grant date, however they are used to estimate the number  
of awards expected to vest. This payout calculation is based on expectations published in analysts’ forecasts.

On 26 May 2010, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, BATUS Japan Inc., entered into an American blend Cigarette Manufacturing Agreement 
(referred to as the 2010 Agreement) with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reynolds American, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (referred to as RJRTC), 
with an effective date of 1 January 2010. Under this Agreement, RJRTC has been appointed as BATUS Japan’s exclusive manufacturer of all BATUS 
Japan’s requirements for certain American-blend cigarettes intended to be distributed and sold in Japan for the five year period expiring on  
31 December 2014, subject to the early termination and extension provisions set out in the agreement. The 2010 Agreement is based on arm’s  
length terms and conditions. 
On the same date, RJRTC and BATUS Japan entered into a letter agreement terminating the existing Contract Manufacturing Agreement dated 30 July 
2004 (referred to as the 2004 Agreement), as amended between the parties, with effect from midnight on 31 December 2009. The 2004 Agreement 
was scheduled to expire on 31 December 2014, subject to early termination and extension provisions. Under the terms of the letter agreement, certain 
sections and sub-sections of the 2004 Agreement will survive the termination, and, in consideration for RJRTC agreeing to terminate the agreement  
and in settlement of all disputes at issue between the parties, BATUS Japan agreed to pay RJRTC US$21 million. The payment has been presented as an 
adjusting item and is included within the Group’s restructuring and integration costs in note 3(e). The Group’s share of the income net of tax included 
within the post-tax results of Reynolds American is also presented as an adjusting item and is credited against other (see note 5). 
In 2011, the Group acquired non-controlling interests of shareholders in Chile for £10 million. This transaction is shown as a £10 million reduction to 
reserves in note 20. In 2010, the Group acquired non-controlling interests of shareholders in Indonesia and eastern Europe for £3 million and £9 million 
respectively. These transactions are shown as a £12 million reduction to reserves in note 20.  
As explained in note 26(b), the Group sold its Belgium distribution business, Lyfra NV, to Landewyck Group S.a.r.l in 2010 for a consideration of  
€16 million. The Group’s German subsidiary has an available-for-sale investment in Landewyck Group S.a.r.l.  
The key management personnel of British American Tobacco consist of the members of the Board of Directors of British American Tobacco p.l.c. and  
the members of the Management Board. No such person had any material interest during the year in a contract of significance (other than a service 
contract) with the Company or any subsidiary company. The term key management personnel in this context includes the respective members of  
their households.

30 Contingent liabilities and  
financial commitments  
The Group is subject to contingencies pursuant to requirements 
that it complies with relevant laws, regulations and standards. 
Failure to comply could result in restrictions in operations, 
damages, fines, increased tax, increased cost of compliance,  
interest charges, reputational damage or other sanctions.  
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.  
In cases where the Group has an obligation as a result of a  
past event existing at the balance sheet date, it is probable  
that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle  
the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably 
estimated, a provision will be recognised based on best estimates 
and management judgment.  
There are, however, contingent liabilities in respect of litigation, 
taxes in some countries and guarantees for which no provisions 
have been made.
The Group has exposures in respect of the payment or recovery  
of a number of taxes. The Group is and has been subject to a 
number of tax audits covering, amongst others, excise tax, value 
added taxes, sales taxes, corporate taxes, withholding taxes and 
payroll taxes.  
The estimated costs of known tax obligations have been provided in 
these accounts in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. 
In some countries, tax law requires that full or part payment of 
disputed tax assessments be made pending resolution of the 
dispute. To the extent that such payments exceed the estimated 
obligation, they would not be recognised as an expense. In some 
cases disputes are proceeding to litigation.  
While the amounts that may be payable or receivable could  
be material to the results or cash flows of the Group in the  
period in which they are recognised, the Board does not  
expect these amounts to have a material effect on the Group’s 
financial condition.
Product liability litigation  
Group companies, notably Brown & Williamson Holdings, Inc. 
(formerly Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation) (B&W) as  
well as other leading cigarette manufacturers, are defendants, 
principally in the United States, in a number of product liability 
cases. In a number of these cases, the amounts of compensatory 
and punitive damages sought are significant.  
Indemnity
In 2004, B&W completed the combination of the assets, liabilities 
and operations of its US tobacco business with R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Company (RJRT), a wholly-owned subsidiary of  
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., pursuant to which Reynolds 
American Inc. was formed (the Business Combination). As part  
of the Business Combination, B&W contributed to RJRT all of  
the assets and liabilities of its US cigarette and tobacco business, 
subject to specified exceptions, in exchange for a 42 per cent equity 
ownership interest in Reynolds American Inc. As a result of the 
Business Combination:  
 B&W discontinued the active conduct of any tobacco business 
in the United States;
 B&W contributed to RJRT all of its assets other than the capital 
stock of certain subsidiaries engaged in non-US businesses and 
other limited categories of assets;  
 RJRT assumed all liabilities of B&W (except liabilities to the 
extent relating to businesses and assets not contributed  
by B&W to RJRT and other limited categories of liabilities) and 
contributed subsidiaries or otherwise to the extent related to 
B&W’s tobacco business as conducted in the United States on 
or prior to 30 July 2004; and  
 RJRT agreed to indemnify B&W and each of its associates  
(other than Reynolds American Inc. and its subsidiaries)  
against, among other matters, all losses, liabilities, damages, 
expenses, judgments, attorneys’ fees, etc., to the extent  
relating to or arising from such assumed liabilities or the  
assets contributed by B&W to RJRT (the RJRT Indemnification).  
The scope of the RJRT Indemnification includes all expenses and 
contingent liabilities in connection with litigation to the extent 
relating to or arising from B&W’s US tobacco business as conducted 
on or prior to 30 July 2004, including smoking and health tobacco 
litigation, whether the litigation is commenced before or after  
30 July 2004 (the Tobacco Litigation).  
Pursuant to the terms of the RJRT Indemnification, RJRT is liable for 
any possible judgments, the posting of appeal bonds or security, 
and all other expenses of and responsibility for managing the 
defence of the Tobacco Litigation. RJRT has assumed control of the 
defence of the Tobacco Litigation involving B&W, to which RJRT is 
also a party in most (but not all) of the same cases. Accordingly, 
RJRT uses or plans to use the same law firm or firms to represent 
both B&W and RJRT in any single or similar case (except in certain 
limited circumstances) as RJRT’s interests are typically aligned with 
B&W’s interests, as RJRT has substantial experience in managing 
recognised external legal counsel in defending the Tobacco 
Litigation and external counsel have independent professional 
responsibilities to represent the interests of B&W. In addition, in 
accordance with the terms of the RJRT Indemnification, associates  
of B&W have retained control of the defence in certain Tobacco 
Litigation cases with respect to which such associates are entitled  
to indemnification.  
Included in the US litigation section below are all significant cases 
where B&W and/or a UK company is named as a defendant and all 
cases where RJRT is named as a defendant as a successor to B&W 
(the RJRT Successor Cases). The RJRT Successor Cases are covered  
by the RJRT Indemnification. Of the RJRT Successor Cases, the 
section below includes details of all cases where there has been  
an adverse judgment and also notes favourable judgments.  
US litigation  
The total number of US product liability cases pending at  
31 December 2011 naming B&W was approximately 8,688  
(2010: approximately 9,458). Of these, 5,588 cases are RJRT 
Successor Cases. For all of these cases, British American Tobacco 
Group companies have the protection of the RJRT Indemnification. 
British American Tobacco (Investments) Limited (Investments)  
has been served as a co-defendant in three of those cases (2010: 
five). No other UK based Group company has been served as  
177
British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review Notes on the accounts continued 
a co-defendant in any US product liability case pending as at  
31 December 2011. In 2011, there was one US product liability 
 case tried to verdict against B&W and Investments (City of St. Louis 
– see below). There is one case (Daric Smith – see below) against 
B&W and Investments scheduled for trial on 16 July 2012. Since 
many of these pending cases seek unspecified damages, it is not 
possible to quantify the total amounts being claimed, but the 
aggregate amounts involved in such litigation are significant, 
possibly totalling billions of US dollars. The cases fall into four  
broad categories: medical reimbursement cases; class actions; 
individual cases and other claims. 
(a) Medical reimbursement cases  
These civil actions seek to recover amounts spent by government 
entities and other third party providers on healthcare and welfare 
costs claimed to result from illnesses associated with smoking. 
Although B&W continues to be a defendant in one healthcare  
cost recovery case involving a Native American tribe (see below), 
the vast majority of such cases have been dismissed on  
legal grounds.
Further, on 23 November 1998, the major US cigarette 
manufacturers (including B&W and RJRT) and the attorneys  
general of 46 US states and five US territories executed the  
Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), which settled medical 
reimbursement lawsuits that had been brought by these states  
and territories. Under the terms of the MSA, the settling cigarette 
manufacturers agreed, among other things, to pay approximately 
US$246 billion to the settling states and territories (and to  
four states that reached separate settlements of their medical 
reimbursement actions) over 25 years, and agreed to various 
restrictions on US tobacco advertising and marketing. The  
MSA includes a credit for any amounts paid by participating 
manufacturers in subsequent suits brought by the states’  
political subdivisions.  
At 31 December 2011, one US medical reimbursement suit  
was pending against B&W (2010: three). This suit has been  
brought by an Indian tribe in the Indian Tribal Court in  
South Dakota.  
Two additional reimbursement cases pending against Group 
companies as at 31 December 2010 have recently been dismissed. 
The Nat’l Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare case 
against B&W and other defendants was dismissed by the district 
court on 22 December 2010 and judgment was entered in 
defendants’ favour on 23 December 2010. The City of St. Louis  
case against B&W, Investments and several other defendants  
was dismissed following a jury verdict in defendants’ favour on  
29 April 2011. Final judgment was entered in defendants’ favour  
on 10 June 2011 and the plaintiffs waived all rights to appeal  
this judgment. 
(b) Class actions  
At 31 December 2011, B&W was named as a defendant in some 
eight (2010: eight) separate actions attempting to assert claims on 
behalf of classes of persons allegedly injured or financially impacted 
through smoking or where classes of tobacco claimants have been 
certified. If the classes are or remain certified and the possibility  
of class-based liability is eventually established, it is likely that 
individual trials will be necessary to resolve any claims by  
individual plaintiffs. Class action suits have been filed in a  
number of states against individual cigarette manufacturers  
and their parent corporations, alleging that the use of the  
terms ‘lights’ and ‘ultralights’ constitutes unfair and deceptive  
trade practices.
The Cleary putative class action complaint was filed in state  
court in Chicago, Illinois on 3 June 1998 against several defendants, 
including B&W, B.A.T Industries p.l.c. (Industries) and Investments. 
Industries was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds by an 
intermediate appellate court on 17 March 2000. The case was 
removed to the federal district court on 13 March 2009. After 
certain discovery and motion practice, the plaintiffs’ motion for 
leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint was granted on 22 April 
2010. The Fourth Amended Complaint alleged that all defendants 
fraudulently concealed facts regarding the addictive nature of 
nicotine and that defendant Philip Morris fraudulently marketed 
Marlboro Lights cigarettes, and sought disgorgement of profits.  
The defendants’ motion to dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint 
was granted on 22 June 2010. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal 
in the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on 20 August 
2010. In an order entered on 25 August 2011, the Seventh Circuit 
affirmed the federal district court’s order dismissing the case. The 
plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing with suggestion for rehearing en 
banc was denied by the Seventh Circuit on 15 November 2011.  
The plaintiffs have not sought further review of this decision. 
In a medical monitoring class action brought on behalf of  
Louisiana smokers (Scott) the jury returned a verdict on 28 July 
2003 in favour of the defendants on the plaintiffs’ claim for medical 
monitoring and found that cigarettes were not defectively designed. 
However, the jury also made certain findings against the defendants 
on claims relating to fraud, conspiracy, marketing to minors and 
smoking cessation. Notwithstanding these findings, this portion of 
the trial did not determine liability as to any individual class member 
or class representative. On 21 May 2004, the jury returned a verdict 
in the amount of US$591 million, requiring the defendants to  
fund a cessation programme to help eligible class members  
stop smoking. On 29 September 2004, the defendants posted a 
US$50 million bond, pursuant to legislation that limits the amount 
of the bond to US$50 million collectively for MSA signatories, and 
noticed their appeal. RJRT posted US$25 million (the portions  
for RJRT and B&W) towards the bond. On 7 February 2007, the 
Louisiana Court of Appeals upheld the class certification and found 
the defendants responsible for funding smoking cessation for 
eligible class members. The appellate court also ruled, however, 
that no class member who began smoking after 1 September 1988 
could receive any relief and that only those smokers whose claims 
accrued on or before 1 September 1988 would be eligible for the 
smoking cessation programme. In addition, the appellate court 
rejected the award of prejudgment interest, and struck eight of  
the 12 components of the smoking cessation programme.  
The defendants’ application to the Louisiana Supreme Court for a 
writ of certiorari was denied on 7 January 2008. The defendants’ 
petition to the US Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari was denied 
on 10 June 2008. On 21 July 2008, the trial court entered an 
amended judgment in the case. The court found that the 
defendants are jointly and severally liable for funding the cost

the defendants to deposit approximately US$263 million together 
with interest from 30 June 2004, into a trust for the funding of the 
programme. On 23 April 2010, the Louisiana Court of Appeals 
amended but largely affirmed the trial court’s amended judgment. 
Pursuant to the judgment, the defendants are required to deposit 
US$242 million with the court, with interest from 21 July 2008 until 
paid. In September 2010, the defendants’ application for writ of 
certiorari or review by the Supreme Court of Louisiana along with 
the defendants’ motion to stay execution of the judgment was 
denied. On 24 September 2010, the US Supreme Court granted  
the defendants’ motion to stay the judgment pending the US 
Supreme Court’s disposition of the defendants’ petition for a writ
of certiorari. The defendants’ petition for writ of certiorari in the  
US Supreme Court was denied on 27 June 2011. In August 2011, 
RJRT paid US$139 million (the portion of the judgment allocated  
to RJRT and B&W) into the trust. On 31 October 2011, the plaintiffs 
requested that defendants pay attorneys’ fees and litigation costs  
to plaintiffs’ counsel. The defendants filed their opposition to  
the plaintiffs’ request for attorney’s fees on 6 January 2012. 
Discovery on this issue is currently continuing. 
Black is a ‘lights’ class action filed in November 2000 in the  
Circuit Court, City of St. Louis, Missouri. B&W removed the case  
to the US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on

motion to remand, which was granted on 17 March 2006. On  
16 April 2008, the court stayed the case pending US Supreme  
Court review in Good v. Altria Group, Inc. On 28 June 2011, 
the court issued a memorandum removing the case from the  
trial docket. A status conference is currently scheduled for  
4 February 2013.  
Brown is a case filed in June 1997 in the Superior Court, San Diego 
County, California. On 11 April 2001, the court granted in part the 
plaintiffs’ motion for certification of a class composed of residents of 
California who smoked at least one of the defendants’ cigarettes 
from 10 June 1993 through 23 April 2001, and who were exposed 
to the defendants’ marketing and advertising activities in California. 
The plaintiffs seek to recover restitution, disgorgement of profits 
and other equitable relief under the California Business and 
Professions Code. Certification was granted as to the plaintiffs’ 
claims that the defendants violated the section of the California 
Business and Professions Code pertaining to unfair competition.  
The court, however, refused to certify the class under the California 
Legal Remedies Act and on the plaintiffs’ common law claims.  
On 7 March 2005, the court granted the defendants’ motion to 
decertify the class. On 5 September 2006, the California Court  
of Appeal affirmed the judge’s order decertifying the class. On  
1 November 2006, the plaintiffs’ petition for review with the 
California Supreme Court was granted. On 18 May 2009, the 
California Supreme Court reversed the decision issued by the  
trial court and affirmed by the California Court of Appeal that 
decertified the class to the extent that it was based upon the 
conclusion that all class members were required to demonstrate 
standing, and remanded the case to the trial court for further 
proceedings regarding whether the class representatives have,  
or can demonstrate, standing. On 10 March 2010, the California 
Superior Court found that the plaintiffs’ ‘lights’ claims were not  
pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labelling and Advertising  
Act, held the court’s 30 September 2004 ruling on the issue no 
longer viable and denied the defendants’ second motion for 
summary judgment. The defendants filed a motion on 9 January 
2012 requesting that the class be decertified because the class 
representatives do not meet the requisites of standing, adequacy,  
or typicality needed to represent the class. Trial is scheduled to 
begin on 5 October 2012.  
Howard is a ‘lights’ class action filed in February 2000 in the  
Circuit Court, Madison County, Illinois. A judge certified a class  
on 18 December 2001. On 6 June 2003, the trial judge issued an 
order staying all proceedings pending resolution of Price v. Philip 
Morris, Inc., a ‘lights’ class action against Philip Morris, Inc. in the 
Illinois state court. The plaintiffs appealed this stay order to the 
Illinois Fifth District Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Circuit 
Court’s stay order on 19 August 2005. There is currently no activity 
in the case.  
Jones is a case filed in December 1998 in the Circuit Court, Jackson 
County, Missouri. The defendants removed the case to the US 
District Court for the Western District of Missouri on 16 February 
1999. The action was brought by tobacco product users and 
purchasers on behalf of all similarly situated Missouri consumers. 
The plaintiffs allege that their use of the defendants’ tobacco 
products has caused them to become addicted to nicotine. The 
plaintiffs seek to recover an unspecified amount of compensatory 
and punitive damages. The case was remanded to the Circuit  
Court on 17 February 1999. There has been limited activity in 
this case.  
Parsons is a case filed in February 1998 in the Circuit Court, Ohio 
County, West Virginia. The plaintiff sued asbestos manufacturers,  
US cigarette manufacturers, including B&W, among other 
defendants, seeking to recover US$1 million in compensatory and 
punitive damages individually and an unspecified amount for the 
class in both compensatory and punitive damages. The action was 
brought on behalf of a class of persons who allegedly have personal 
injury claims arising from their exposure to respirable asbestos fibres 
and cigarette smoke. The case has been stayed pending a final 
resolution of the plaintiffs’ motion to refer tobacco litigation to  
the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation filed in In Re: Tobacco 
Litigation in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.  
On 26 December 2000, three defendants, Nitral Liquidators, Inc., 
Desseaux Corporation of North American and Armstrong World 
Industries, filed bankruptcy petitions in the US Bankruptcy Court for 
the District of Delaware. Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, Parsons 
 is automatically stayed with respect to all defendants.  
Young is a case filed in November 1997 in the Circuit Court, Orleans 
Parish, Louisiana. The plaintiffs brought an Environmental Tobacco 
Smoke (ETS) class action on behalf of all residents of Louisiana who, 
though not themselves cigarette smokers, have been exposed to 
second-hand smoke from cigarettes which were manufactured  
by the defendants, and who allegedly suffered injury as a result  
of that exposure. The plaintiffs seek to recover an unspecified 
amount of compensatory and punitive damages. On 13 October 
2004, the trial court stayed this case pending the outcome of 
appellate review in the Scott class action in Louisiana  
(discussed above).

In Engle (a case in Florida), a jury awarded a total of US$12.7 million 
to three class representatives, and in a later stage of the three-phase 
trial procedure adopted in this case, a jury assessed US$17.6 billion 
in punitive damages against B&W. On 21 May 2003, the 
intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court’s judgment and 
remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to de-certify 
the class. On 16 July 2003, the plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing 
which was denied on 22 September 2003. On 12 May 2004, the 
Florida Supreme Court agreed to review this case and, on 6 July 
2006, it upheld the intermediate appellate court’s decision to  
de-certify the class and vacated the jury’s punitive damages verdict. 
Further, the Florida Supreme Court permitted the judgments 
entered for two of the three Engle class representatives to stand,  
but dismissed the judgment entered in favour of the third Engle 
class representative. Finally, the Florida Supreme Court has 
permitted putative Engle class members to file individual lawsuits 
against the Engle defendants within one year of the court’s decision 
(subsequently extended to 11 January 2008). The court’s order 
precludes defendants from litigating certain issues of liability against 
the putative Engle class members in these individual actions.  
On 7 August 2006, the defendants filed a motion for rehearing 
before the Florida Supreme Court, which was granted in part and 
denied in part, on 21 December 2006. The Florida Supreme Court’s 
21 December 2006 ruling did not amend any of the earlier 
decisions’ major holdings, which included decertifying the class, 
vacating the punitive damages judgment, and permitting individual 
members of the former class to file separate suits. Instead, the ruling 
addressed the claims on which the Engle jury’s phase one verdict 
will be applicable to the individual lawsuits that were permitted to 
stand. On 1 October 2007, the United States Supreme Court denied 
the defendants’ request for certiorari review of the Florida Supreme 
Court’s decision.  
As at 31 December 2011, B&W has been served in approximately  
47 Engle progeny cases in both state and federal courts in Florida. 
These cases include approximately 103 plaintiffs. RJRT as a successor 
to B&W is named in approximately 5,572 Engle progeny cases. 
These 47 B&W cases and 5,572 RJRT have the benefit of the  
RJRT Indemnification. 
In the first ‘phase three’ trial of an individual Engle class member 
(Lukacs), the jury awarded the plaintiff US$37.5 million in 
compensatory damages (B&W’s share: US$8.4 million) on 11 June 
2002. On 1 April 2003, the jury award was reduced to US$25.1 
million (B&W’s share: US$5.6 million) but no final judgment was 
entered into because the trial court postponed the entry of final 
judgment until the Engle appeal was fully resolved. The trial court, 
on 14 August 2008, issued an order entering judgment for the 
plaintiff that awarded US$24.8 million to the plaintiff (plus interest), 
for which the defendants would be jointly and severally liable. On 
17 October 2008, the plaintiff withdrew her request for punitive 
damages. On 12 November 2008, the trial court entered final 
judgment. On 1 December 2008, the defendants filed a notice of 
appeal. On 17 March 2010, the Third District Court of Appeal 
affirmed the ruling of the trial court. The defendants’ motion for 
rehearing and petition for rehearing en banc was denied on 18 May 
2010. RJRT expensed and paid the final judgment in the amount of 
approximately US$15.2 million on 18 June 2010. On 21 June 2010, 
the court entered an order discharging the supersedeas bonds 
posted by the defendants. 
As at 31 December 2011, approximately 22 additional phase three 
Engle trials naming RJRT as successor to B&W have proceeded to 
verdict. There have been no additional phase three Engle progeny 
trials naming B&W individually. Of these 22 trials, approximately  
11 resulted in plaintiffs’ verdicts. Total damages awarded against 
RJRT as successor to B&W in final judgments in these cases are 
approximately US$21,493,351. This number is comprised of 
approximately US$10,593,351 in compensatory damages and 
approximately US$10,900,000 in punitive damages. As of  
31 December 2011, RJRT had appealed 10 of these adverse 
judgments and all of these appeals remained pending. As of  
31 December 2011, RJRT’s time to file a notice of appeal from the 
eleventh of these final judgments had not expired. 
In June 2009, the Florida legislature amended its existing bond cap 
statute by adding a US$200 million bond cap that applies to all 
phase three Engle progeny cases in the aggregate and establishing 
individual bond caps for individual cases in amounts that vary 
depending on the number of judgments in effect at a given time. 
In May 2011, Florida removed the provision in this legislation that 
would have permitted this bond cap to expire on 31 December 
2012. Plaintiffs in several Engle progeny cases have challenged  
the constitutionality of the bond cap. The Florida appellate courts 
upheld the constitutionality of the bond cap in each of these cases. 
One of these appellate courts has since certified to the Florida 
Supreme Court the question of whether the bond cap violates 
the Florida Constitution. The Florida Supreme Court accepted 
jurisdiction over the issue of the constitutionality of the bond cap  
on 23 January 2012.  
(c) Individual cases  
Approximately 3,091 cases were pending against B&W at  
31 December 2011 (2010: 3,161), which were filed by or on behalf  
of individuals and in which it is contended that diseases or deaths 
have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to ETS.  
Of these cases, approximately: (a) 2,586 are ETS cases brought by 
flight attendants who were members of a class action (Broin) that 
was settled on terms that allow compensatory but not punitive 
damages claims by class members; (b) 411 are cases brought in 
consolidated proceedings in West Virginia, where the first phase  
of the trial began on 19 October 2011 but ended in a mistrial on  
8 November 2011; (c) 47 are Engle progeny cases that have  
been filed directly against B&W; and (d) 47 are cases filed by  
other individuals.  
As mentioned above there are a further 5,572 Engle progeny cases 
which name RJRT as successor to B&W. In addition, there are 16 
cases filed by other individuals naming RJRT as successor to B&W. 
These cases are subject to the RJRT Indemnification and are not 
detailed here.

British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review Of the individual cases that remain pending as of 31 December 
2011, two resulted in verdicts against B&W:  
In December 2003, a New York jury (Frankson) awarded 
US$350,000 in compensatory damages against B&W and two 
industry organisations. In January 2004, the same jury awarded 
US$20 million in punitive damages. On 22 June 2004, the trial 
judge granted a new trial unless the parties agreed to an increase in 
compensatory damages to US$500,000 and a decrease in punitive 
damages to US$5 million, of which US$4 million would be awarded 
against B&W. The plaintiff agreed to a decrease in punitive damages 
but B&W has not agreed to an increase in compensatory damages. 
On 25 January 2005, B&W appealed to an intermediate New York 
State appellate court. Oral argument was heard on 8 May 2006.  
The appellate court affirmed the judgment on 5 July 2006, except 
insofar as it dismissed the plaintiff’s design defect claims. The 
intermediate appellate court denied B&W’s motion for leave to 
reargue, or in the alternative, for leave to appeal to the New York 
Court of Appeals on 5 October 2006. On 8 December 2006, the trial 
judge granted the plaintiff’s application for entry of judgment in the 
amounts of US$5 million in punitive damages and US$175,000 in 
compensatory damages. The trial court also granted the plaintiff’s 
motion to vacate that part of the 2004 order granting a new trial 
unless the parties agreed to an increase in compensatory damages 
to US$500,000. RJRT posted a bond in the approximate amount of 
US$8.018 million on 3 July 2007. B&W appealed from final 
judgment on 3 July 2007 to an intermediate New York State 
appellate court. Oral argument was heard on 28 January 2009. On 
29 September 2009, the appellate court issued a decision modifying 
the final judgment by deleting the award of punitive damages, and 
remanding the case to the trial court for a new trial on the issue of 
punitive damages. On 15 January 2010, the appellate court denied 
the plaintiff’s motion for additional time to seek leave to appeal to 
the New York Court of Appeals, but granted the plaintiff more time 
to file a motion for leave to reargue to the appellate court. The 
plaintiff’s motion for leave to reargue was denied by the appellate 
court on 12 March 2010. As at 31 December 2011, no date has 
been set for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages.  
On 1 February 2005, a Missouri jury (Lincoln Smith) awarded 
US$500,000 in compensatory damages against B&W and then, on  
2 February 2005, awarded US$20 million in punitive damages, also 
against B&W. On 1 June 2005, B&W filed its notice of appeal. Oral 
argument was heard on 31 August 2006. On 31 July 2007, an 
intermediate Missouri appellate court affirmed the compensatory 
damages award but it reversed the punitive damages award, 
reasoning that the plaintiffs failed to produce sufficient evidence to 
justify the verdict. The majority of the court would have remanded 
the case for a second trial, limited to punitive damages, but a 
dissenting judge transferred the case to the Missouri Supreme 
Court, as permitted by Missouri law. Oral argument was heard by 
the Missouri Supreme Court on 13 February 2008. On 31 July 2008, 
the Missouri Supreme Court transferred the case back to the 
intermediate appellate court for further proceedings. In a decision 
entered on 16 December 2008, the intermediate appellate court 
again upheld the award of compensatory damages and reversed the 
jury’s award of US$20 million in punitive damages, sending the 
case back to the trial court for a new trial on punitive damages. 
Following a new trial, on 20 August 2009, a Missouri jury returned 
a verdict awarding US$1.5 million in punitive damages against 
B&W. On 24 September 2009, B&W filed a motion for a new trial 
and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On the 
same date, the plaintiffs filed a motion for additur, asking the court 
to increase the amount of punitive damages from US$1.5 million to 
US$20 million, and a motion to vacate, modify or set aside 
judgment, or in the alternative, for a new trial. On 21 December 
2009, the court denied the plaintiffs’ and B&W’s post-trial motions. 
On 30 December 2009, B&W filed a notice of appeal. On  
31 December 2009, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. The 
appeals were consolidated and oral argument was held with respect 
to both appeals on 28 September 2011. A decision remains pending. 
(d) Other claims  
The Flintkote Company (Flintkote), a US asbestos production and 
sales company, was included in the acquisition of Genstar 
Corporation by Imasco Limited in 1986 and became a Group 
subsidiary following the restructuring of Imasco Limited (now 
Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (Imperial), the Group’s operating 
company in Canada) in 2000. Soon after this acquisition, and as 
part of the acquisition plan, Genstar Corporation began to sell most 
of its assets, including the non-asbestos related operations and 
subsidiaries of Flintkote. The liquidation of Flintkote assets produced 
cash proceeds and, having obtained advice from the law firm of 
Sullivan & Cromwell LLP (S&C) and other advice that sufficient 
assets would remain to satisfy liabilities, Flintkote and Imasco 
Limited authorised the payment of a dividend of US$170.2 million 
in 1986 and a further dividend of US$355 million in 1987. In 2003, 
Imperial divested Flintkote and then, in 2004, Flintkote filed for 
bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy court for the District of 
Delaware. In 2006, Flintkote, representatives of both the present 
and future asbestos claimants, and individual asbestos claimants 
were permitted by the bankruptcy court to file a complaint against 
Imperial and numerous other defendants including S&C, for the 
recovery of the dividends and other compensation under various 
legal and equitable theories. S&C and Imperial filed cross 
complaints against each other. The case remains in the discovery 
phase, but over the last 18 months the court has resolved multiple 
issues that will narrow the case. Firstly, following a multi-day bench 
trial, the court issued a preliminary decision dismissing S&C. 
Flintkote settled with S&C for a nominal sum before the decision 
was made final. The settlement is subject to bankruptcy court 
approval but is expected to become final. Secondly, after a series of 
bench trials, on 5 October 2011, the court issued orders deciding 
multiple preliminary issues regarding Flintkote’s claims to recover 
the dividends and Flintkote’s claim that Imperial is its ‘alter ego’ for 
purposes of asbestos liabilities. Among other things, the court’s 
rulings largely remove Flintkote’s claim to the US$355 million 1987 
dividend. The court also concluded that Flintkote cannot pursue its 
alter ego claim (such claims must instead be pursued by individual 
asbestos plaintiffs). These rulings were made final on 6 January 
2012. The remaining preliminary issue pending is whether Flintkote 
is stopped from pursuing certain fraudulent conveyance remedies 
as a result of contrary statements it made early in the litigation. 
Discovery is ongoing and is likely to continue throughout 2012. 
Flintkote intends to press the court to set a trial date in mid-2012 
but it appears unlikely that a trial could be held before late 2012 or 
early 2013.

In Wisconsin, the authorities have identified potentially responsible 
parties (PRPs) to fund the clean up of river sediments in the lower 
Fox River. The pollution was caused by discharges of 
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) from paper mills and other 
facilities operating close to the river. The cost of the clean up work 
has been estimated to be in excess of US$900 million. Among the 
potentially responsible parties is NCR Corporation (NCR) which is 
liable for the clean up costs in a large portion of the river under the 
terms of a consent decree and a unilateral administrative order 
issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
In 1978, a subsidiary of Industries, later known as Appleton Papers 
Inc. (Appleton), purchased what was then NCR’s Appleton Papers 
Division from NCR. In 1978, Industries also incorporated a US entity 
by the name of BATUS, Inc. (BATUS), which in 1980 became the 
holding company for all of Industries’ US subsidiaries, including 
Appleton. As the holding company, BATUS obtained insurance 
policies for itself and its subsidiaries that included coverage for 
certain environmental liabilities. Industries/BATUS spun off the 
Appleton business in 1990 via a Demerger Agreement with Wiggins 
Teape Appleton p.l.c., now known as Windward Prospects Ltd 
(Windward), and Wiggins Teape Appleton (Holdings) p.l.c., now 
known as Arjo Wiggins US Holdings Ltd (together, the AWA 
Entities), obtaining what Industries believes were full indemnities 
from the AWA Entities and Appleton for past and future 
environmental claims.  
Disputes between NCR, Appleton, and Industries as to the 
indemnities given and received under the original purchase 
agreement in 1978 have been the subject of litigation that was 
commenced in 1995, a settlement agreement executed in 1998 (the 
Settlement Agreement), and an arbitration award in 2005. Under 
the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the arbitration award, 
Industries and Appleton generally have an obligation to share the 
costs of Fox River environmental claims with NCR (60:40), but 
Industries has never been required to pay any sums in this regard 
because Appleton and the AWA Entities have paid the non  
NCR (60 per cent) share of the clean up costs to date, and the 
governmental authorities have not identified Industries or BATUS  
as PRPs. Windward also separately, and indirectly, indemnified 
Appleton in respect of the clean-up costs. 
A trial is currently scheduled to begin in Wisconsin on 21 February 
2012 to determine whether NCR/Appleton is liable for the clean-up 
costs in the upper portion of the Fox River. This trial is expected to 
address issues as to whether NCR/Appleton is liable as a result of the 
sale, by a predecessor of NCR’s Appleton Papers Division, of scrap 
paper, or “broke”, to other paper companies which in turn 
discharged PCBs into the river in the course of recycling the broke.  
Industries has become aware that Windward settled the majority  
of Appleton’s insurance claims (over which it had control) at what 
Industries believes constituted a significant discount, and has made 
dividend payments to its former and current shareholders of 
approximately US$810 million, leaving it holding, according to  
its latest accounts, approximately US$100 million of net assets. 
Accordingly, there may be a greater risk that the assets of Windward 
are insufficient to meet its obligations under the indemnities 
Industries believes it has been granted. Appleton’s own accounts 
indicate limited financial resources. 
In December 2011, Windward asserted that it did not indemnify 
Industries pursuant to the terms of the 1990 Demerger Agreement 
in respect of Industries’ obligations under the Settlement 
Agreement. Industries disputes Windward’s position and has 
commenced proceedings. 
While Industries believes it may have defences to claims by NCR 
against it under the Settlement Agreement and arbitration award 
and remains hopeful that Appleton and the AWA Entities will satisfy 
their obligations with respect to the Fox River cleanup, taking into 
account court decisions, sums paid to date on the clean-up and 
other available information, Industries believes it may have an 
exposure of some US$426 million (equivalent to £274 million) in 
clean up related costs. Accordingly, Industries has made a provision 
of £274 million, which has been treated as an adjusting item in the 
income statement. This figure is necessarily subject to uncertainty. 
Industries has become aware that NCR is also being pursued by 
Georgia-Pacific LLC (Georgia-Pacific), the owner of a facility on the 
Kalamazoo River in South-West Michigan which released PCBs into 
that river. Georgia-Pacific has been designated as a PRP in respect of 
that river. Georgia-Pacific contends that NCR is responsible for, or 
should contribute to, the clean-up costs, because (i) a predecessor 
to NCR’s Appleton Paper Division sold “broke” containing PCBs to 
Georgia Pacific or others for recycling; (ii) NCR itself sold paper 
containing PCBs to Georgia Pacific or others for recycling; and/or 
(iii) NCR is liable for sales to Georgia Pacific or others of PCB 
containing broke by Mead Corporation, which, like the predecessor 
to NCR’s Appleton Papers Division, coated paper with the PCB-
containing emulsion manufactured by NCR. Industries understands 
that NCR does not believe that NCR has any liability in relation to 
the Kalamazoo River and that it will vigorously contest Georgia-
Pacific’s claim. Industries itself believes that Industries only has 
potential exposure under the Settlement Agreement or arbitration 
award if NCR is unsuccessful in its defence of the claim and it  
is found that PCB contamination in the Kalamazoo River is due  
to “broke” supplied by a predecessor of NCR’s Appleton  
Papers Division. 
Industries is taking active steps to protect its interests, including 
seeking to confirm its indemnities and to procure the repayment  
of the Windward dividends, with a view to restoring value to 
Windward and, accordingly, the indemnities it believes were 
granted to Industries. 
UK-based Group companies  
Investments has been served in the following US cases pending at 
31 December 2011: one smoking and health class action (Cleary – 
see above); one class action alleging violations of Kansas antitrust 
and consumer protection laws (Daric Smith – see below); and two 
individual actions (Eiser and Perry). Two other cases which had been 
pending against Investments as at 31 December 2010 were no 
longer pending as at 31 December 2011 (City of St. Louis – see 
above, and the US Department of Justice case – see below). The 
Company and Investments have been served in one individual 
action alleging misappropriation of novel ideas and breach of 
contract (Gero), although on 7 November 2011, the trial court 
dismissed the Company and Investments from the case, which 
order the plaintiff appealed on 7 December 2011.

On 22 September 1999, the US Department of Justice brought an 
action in the US District Court for the District of Columbia against 
various industry members, including RJRT, B&W, Industries and 
Investments. Industries was dismissed for lack of personal 
jurisdiction on 28 September 2000. The government sought to 
recover federal funds expended in providing healthcare to smokers 
who have developed diseases and injuries alleged to be smoking-
related, and, in addition, sought, pursuant to the Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), disgorgement of 
profits the government contends were earned as a consequence of 
a RICO ‘enterprise’. On 28 September 2000, the federal district 
court dismissed the portion of the claim which sought recovery of 
federal funds expended in providing healthcare to smokers who 
have developed diseases and injuries alleged to be smoking-related. 
The non-jury trial of the RICO portion of the claim began on  
21 September 2004, and ended on 9 June 2005. On 17 November 
2004, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit heard an appeal  
by the defendants against an earlier district court decision that 
disgorgement of profits is an appropriate remedy for the RICO 
violations alleged by the government. On 4 February 2005, the DC 
Circuit allowed the appeal, ruling that the government could not 
claim disgorgement of profits. On 17 October 2005, the US 
Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal by the US government 
in respect of the claim for disgorgement of US$280 billion of past 
profits from the defendants.  
On 17 August 2006, the federal district court issued its Final 
Judgment and Remedial Order, consisting of some 1,600 pages of 
factual findings and legal conclusions. The court found in favour of 
the government, and against certain defendants, including RJRT, 
B&W and Investments. The court also ordered a wide array of 
injunctive relief, including a ban on the use of ‘lights’ and other 
similar descriptors. In addition, the Final Judgment and Remedial 
Order ordered the defendants to pay the government’s costs, which 
were US$1.9 million plus interest.  
On 10 August 2007, the defendants filed their initial appellate briefs 
to the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. All defendants filed a 
joint appellate brief, and Investments also filed its own brief which 
raised the issue of whether Congress intended for RICO to apply to 
extraterritorial conduct by a foreign defendant. On 19 November 
2007, the government filed its opposition and cross-appeal brief, 
seeking to reinstate certain remedial relief, including its 
disgorgement claims. On 22 May 2009, a three-judge appellate 
panel unanimously affirmed the federal district court’s RICO liability 
judgment against Investments, Altria, Philip Morris, RJRT and 
Lorillard, ordered the dismissal of Counsel for Tobacco Research 
(CTR) and Tobacco Institute (TI) (two defunct US trade associations 
that were not covered by the district court’s injunctive remedies), 
and remanded for further factual findings and clarification as to 
whether liability should be imposed against B&W, based on 
changes in the nature of B&W’s business operations. The panel also 
remanded on four discrete issues relating to the injunctive 
remedies, including for the district court “to reformulate” the 
injunction on the use of low-tar descriptors “to exempt foreign 
activities that have no substantial, direct, and foreseeable domestic 
effects”. The government’s cross-appeal seeking disgorgement of 
past profits and the funding of smoking education and cessation 
programmes was denied. Investments’ petition for panel rehearing 
and rehearing en banc was filed on 31 July 2009 and was denied on 
22 September 2009 by the DC Circuit.  
On 19 February 2010, the defendants and the government filed 
certiorari petitions with the US Supreme Court. On 28 June 2010, 
the US Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari on all petitions. 
On 23 July 2010, Investments filed a petition for rehearing of its 
certiorari petition before the US Supreme Court, on the basis of an 
intervening decision by the US Supreme Court that invalidated the 
“effects” test the federal district court and DC Circuit both used in 
concluding that the RICO statute applied to Investments’ foreign 
conduct. The US Supreme Court denied Investments’ rehearing 
petition on 3 September 2010.  
On 7 July 2010, the DC Circuit issued its remand returning the case 
to the federal district court for further proceedings. At a status 
conference on 20 December 2010, the CTR and the TI were 
dismissed by consent of the parties and B&W was deemed “not to 
be a defendant” and was therefore not subject to the Final 
Judgment and Remedial Order.  
On 28 December 2010, the government filed a motion to compel 
Investments to comply with injunctive remedies being sought in the 
case. On 21 January 2011, Investments filed its brief in opposition 
and its motion for reconsideration of the liability judgment and 
remedial relief against it based on intervening change in controlling 
law governing the extraterritorial application of US statutes. The 
government filed its reply in support of its motion to compel and  
its opposition to Investments’ motion for reconsideration on  
7 February 2011. Investments filed its reply in further support  
of its motion for reconsideration on 21 February 2011.  
On 28 March 2011, the federal district court issued an opinion 
granting Investments’ motion for reconsideration in part and 
denying it in part and granting the government’s motion to compel 
in part and denying it in part. The district court determined that  
a decision by the US Supreme Court in an unrelated case issued 
several years after the district court’s 2006 Final Judgment and 
Remedial Order, “rejected the ‘effects’ test for extraterritorial 
application”, and therefore “invalidated the sole basis for 
[Investment’s] liability” in this litigation”. As a result, the district 
court held that the Final Judgment and Remedial Order no longer 
applied to Investments prospectively, and for this reason, 
Investments would not have to comply with any of the remaining 
injunctive remedies being sought by the government. The district 
court determined, however, that there was no basis for it to 
retrospectively modify Investments’ obligation to pay the 
government’s costs as a prevailing party under the Final Judgment 
and Remedial Order, and therefore ordered Investments to 
contribute its one-sixth share of the government’s costs. 
Investments paid its share of the government’s costs (a total of 
US$404,243.88 inclusive of interest) on 25 May 2011. (RJRT paid 
approximately US$782,000 in costs on behalf of itself and B&W on 
28 September 2010.)

The government did not appeal the 28 March 2011 opinion. This 
means that Investments is no longer in the case and will not be 
subject to any injunctive relief that the court is expected to order 
against the remaining US defendants.  
In the Daric Smith case, purchasers of cigarettes in the state of 
Kansas brought a class action in the Kansas State Court against 
B&W, Investments and certain other tobacco companies seeking 
injunctive relief, treble damages, interest and costs. The allegations 
are that the defendants participated in a conspiracy to fix or 
maintain the price of cigarettes sold in the US, including in the state 
of Kansas, in violation of the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act.  
Prior discovery disputes involving Investments have now been 
resolved by motion and fact discovery is now closed. In late October 
2010, the parties participated in a court-ordered mediation but the 
case was not resolved. In late October and early November 2010, all 
defendants, including Investments, moved for summary judgment. 
On 13 May 2011, Investments supplemented its summary 
judgment motion on the basis of its de minimis market share  
and the inapplicability of the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act to a 
nonresident (such as Investments) that did not purchase, sell  
or manufacture goods in the state of Kansas. The defendants’ 
summary judgment motions were heard on 18 January 2012  
and the Court reserved ruling. 
On 22 July 2011, the plaintiff filed his own summary judgment 
motions. These will be briefed and argued, if necessary, after a 
decision on the defendants’ summary judgment motions is issued. 
If the case is not dismissed on summary judgment, trial of the 
matter is scheduled to begin on 16 July 2012. 
In December 2011, the plaintiff filed a motion to file a second 
amended petition. The defendants’ arguments in opposition  
to this motion were heard on 18 January 2012 and the Court 
reserved ruling. 
Product liability outside the United States  
At 31 December 2011, active claims against the Group’s companies 
existed in 17 markets outside the US (2010: 22) but the only 
markets with more than five claims were Argentina, Brazil, Canada, 
Italy, Nigeria, and the Republic of Ireland (2010: seven). Medical 
reimbursement actions are being brought in Canada, Argentina, 
Brazil, Israel, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Spain.  
(a) Medical reimbursement cases  
Argentina 
In 2007, the non-governmental organisation the Argentina Tort Law 
Association (ATLA) brought a reimbursement action against Nobleza 
Piccardo S.A.I.C.y.F. (Nobleza) and Massalín Particulares. A defence 
was filed by Nobleza on 1 October 2009. Nobleza and the federal 
government’s preliminary objections were considered by the Civil 
Court in late 2009 and, on 23 December 2009, the Civil Court 
declared its lack of jurisdiction to hear the claim. On 11 March 2010, 
the case was sent to the Contentious-Administrative Court, which 
determined that it had jurisdiction over the case. On 24 June 2011, 
the Contentious-Administrative Court issued an Order stating that it 
would decide defendants’ outstanding procedural objections 
together with the merits of the case. The case will now enter the 
evidentiary stage. 
Brazil 
In August 2007, the São Paulo Public Prosecutors office filed a 
medical reimbursement claim against Souza Cruz S.A. (Souza Cruz). 
A similar claim was lodged against Philip Morris. Souza Cruz’s 
motion to consolidate the two claims was rejected and instead this 
case was removed to a different lower court. Souza Cruz filed a 
motion to reconsider the refusal for consolidation and an 
interlocutory appeal against assignment to the lower court. At the 
same time, the Public Prosecutor filed a motion challenging the 
connection between the two cases, which argument the State Court 
of Appeals accepted in August 2010 and ordered the two cases to 
progress independently. On 4 October 2011, the court dismissed 
the action against Souza Cruz, with a judgment on the merits.  
The plaintiff filed an appeal on 9 January 2012. 
Canada
In Canada there are four pending statutory actions for recovery of 
healthcare costs arising from the treatment of smoking and health 
related diseases. These proceedings name various group 
companies. Legislation enabling provincial governments to recover 
the healthcare costs has been enacted in all 10 provinces and two of 
three territories in Canada but has only been proclaimed into force 
in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, 
Ontario and Quebec. Actions have begun against various Group 
companies, including Imperial, in British Columbia, New Brunswick, 
Newfoundland and Labrador, and Ontario. In Quebec, three 
Canadian manufacturers, including Imperial, are challenging the 
legislation and the Quebec government has yet to issue a statement 
of claim.  
The government of British Columbia brought a claim pursuant to 
the provisions of the Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs 
Recovery Act 2000 (the Recovery Act) against domestic and foreign 
‘manufacturers’ seeking to recover the plaintiff’s costs of healthcare 
benefits. Imperial, Investments, Industries and other former 
Rothmans Group companies are named as defendants. The 
constitutionality of the Recovery Act was challenged by certain 
defendants and, on 5 June 2003, the British Columbia Supreme 
Court found the Recovery Act to be beyond the competence  
of the British Columbia legislature and, accordingly, dismissed  
the government’s claim. The government appealed the decision  
to the British Columbia Court of Appeal which, on 20 May 2004, 
overturned the lower court’s decision and declared the Recovery  
Act to be constitutionally valid. The defendants appealed to the 
Supreme Court of Canada in June 2005 and the court gave its 
judgment in September 2005 dismissing the appeals and declaring 
the Act to be constitutionally valid.
The federal government was enjoined by a Third Party Notice and 
presented a motion to strike out the claim. The hearing took place 
during the week of 3 March 2008 and the court found in favour of 
the federal government. The defendants appealed that decision  
and the hearing was held during the week of 1 June 2009. On  
8 December 2009, the British Columbia Court of Appeal handed 
down its decision in both this case and the Knight class action  
(see below). This appeal was granted in part. The Court of  
Appeal held that it was not “plain and obvious” that the federal 
government did not owe a duty of care to tobacco manufacturers  
or consumers when it implemented its tobacco control strategy.

184
British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review On 8 February 2010, the federal government sought leave to  
appeal this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. On  
10 March 2010, the defendant filed response materials and a cross 
appeal. The government of British Columbia sought leave to 
oppose the defendants’ cross appeal in part. On 20 May 2010, the 
Supreme Court of Canada granted leave to appeal both in respect 
of the federal government’s application and the defendants’ 
conditional cross applications. The appeal was heard on  
24 February 2011. On 29 July 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada 
delivered its opinion, which struck out the third party claims against 
the federal government.  
The underlying medical reimbursement action remains at a 
preliminary case management stage. Damages have not yet been 
quantified by the plaintiff. Given the prior pendency of the Supreme 
Court application, and a number of other factors including delay on 
the part of the plaintiff in producing damages modelling materials, 
the trial date has been postponed and no trial date is currently set.  
Non-Canadian defendants challenged the personal jurisdiction of 
the British Columbia Court and those motions were heard in the 
Supreme Court of British Columbia. On 23 June 2006, the court 
dismissed all defendants’ motions, finding that there is a “real and 
substantial connection” between British Columbia and the foreign 
defendants. Subsequently, the defendants were granted leave to 
appeal that ruling to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. The 
appeal was dismissed on 15 September 2006. The defendants filed 
leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on 10 November 2006, and 
that application was denied on 5 April 2007.  
The government of New Brunswick has brought a medical 
reimbursement claim against domestic and foreign tobacco 
‘manufacturers’, pursuant to the provisions of the Recovery Act 
passed in that Province in June 2006. The Company, Investments, 
Industries, Carreras Rothmans Limited (the UK Companies) and 
Imperial have all been named as defendants. The government filed a 
statement of claim on 13 March 2008. The Group defendants were 
served with the Notice of Action and Statement of Claim on 2 June 
2008. A case management conference was held on 8 January 2009  
so that other defendants could challenge the use of a contingent fee 
arrangement (CFA) for the plaintiff’s lawyer. This challenge was 
refused at first instance. Leave to appeal was granted on limited 
grounds. These grounds, upon which leave was denied, were 
appealed directly to the Supreme Court of Canada. On 13 May 2010, 
the New Brunswick Court of Appeal dismissed Imperial’s appeal. The 
Supreme Court of Canada subsequently denied leave on all aspects of 
the CFA challenge, thus ending this preliminary challenge. The appeal 
was dismissed and an application to appeal to the Supreme Court 
was denied on 21 October 2010.  
The UK Companies’ challenge to the New Brunswick court’s 
jurisdiction was heard in June 2010. The court of Queen’s  
Bench dismissed the UK Companies’ jurisdictional motions on  
15 November 2010. The UK Companies sought leave to appeal this 
decision in the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick, which leave was 
denied on 11 April 2011 by a single judge of the Court of Appeal. 
The UK Companies’ applications for leave to appeal the 11 April 
2011 decision of the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick were 
dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada on 13 October 2011. 
No damages have yet been quantified by the plaintiff. The UK 
Companies filed demands for particulars on 15 November 2011. 
The government of the Province of Ontario has also filed a  
C$50 billion medical reimbursement claim against domestic and 
foreign tobacco ‘manufacturers’, pursuant to the provisions of the 
Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act 2009. The 
UK Companies have all been named as defendants. Imperial was 
served on 30 September 2009 and the UK Companies were served 
on 8 October 2009. A case management judge has been appointed 
and the hearing on the UK Companies’ jurisdiction motions 
commenced on 23 November 2011. The jurisdiction motion  
was heard in November 2011. Judgment was handed down on  
4 January 2012 in favour of the plaintiff in respect of all the UK 
Companies. The effect of this order is that the court has determined 
that it has jurisdiction to hear the claim against the UK Companies. 
There is however an automatic right to appeal the judgment to the 
Court of Appeals.  
The government of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador 
filed a health care reimbursement claim in February 2011 against 
domestic and foreign tobacco ‘manufacturers’, pursuant to the 
provisions of the Tobacco Health Care Costs Recovery Act enacted  
in that Province. The UK Companies have all been named as 
defendants. Imperial was served on 1 April 2011, and the UK 
Companies were served on 22 March 2011. A case management 
judge has been appointed. The UK Companies have challenged  
the personal jurisdiction of the Newfoundland and Labrador court. 
These jurisdictional challenges are currently scheduled for hearing 
in May 2012. 
Colombia
A medical reimbursement action pending as at 31 December 2010 
against British American Tobacco (South America) Limited in 
Colombia was dismissed on 10 June 2011.  
Israel 
In Israel, a medical reimbursement claim was brought against 
Industries, B&W, Investments and B.A.T (U.K. and Export) Limited 
(BATUKE), amongst others, by Clalit Health Services. The plaintiff 
claimed damages of NIS7.6 billion and sought injunctive relief.  
On 13 July 2011, the Israeli Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s 
ruling and dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds of remoteness.  
On 28 August 2011, the plaintiff filed a petition for the holding of 
an additional hearing before an expanded bench of the Supreme 
Court. A response on behalf of the Group company defendants  
was filed by 27 November 2011. The Supreme Court denied the 
plaintiff’s petition for an additional hearing on 28 January 2012.  
The case is now closed. 
Nigeria
Medical reimbursement actions have also been brought by eight 
Nigerian states (Lagos, Kano, Gombe, Oyo, Akwa Ibom, Ogun, 
Ondo and Ekiti) and by the federal government of Nigeria, each 
seeking the equivalent of billions of pounds sterling for costs 
allegedly incurred by the state and federal governments in treating 
smoking-related illnesses. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) 
Limited (BAT Nigeria) has been named as a defendant in each of  
the cases; the Company and Investments have been named as 
defendants in seven of the cases.

On 9 October 2009, the actions that had been filed by the Attorneys 
General of Ondo State and of Ekiti State were voluntarily 
discontinued by the plaintiffs without prejudice to refile by notices 
dated 5 October 2009 and 18 June 2009, respectively. The action 
filed by the Attorney General of Akwa Ibom was struck out without 
prejudice on 19 October 2009 for lack of prosecution. 
On 21 February 2008, the Lagos action was voluntarily 
discontinued by the plaintiffs. On 13 March 2008, the Lagos 
Attorney General filed a substantially similar action which was 
marked as “qualified” under Lagos State’s “Fast-Track” system, 
seeking approximately £10.9 billion in damages, including special, 
anticipatory and punitive damages, restitution and disgorgement of 
profits, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. The “Fast-Track” 
system provides for resolution of the dispute within an eight-month 
time-period after filing. BAT Nigeria, the Company and Investments 
have all been served in the new action, and have filed preliminary 
objections. At a hearing on 16 September 2008, the court directed 
that the case no longer qualified to be heard on the “Fast Track” 
because service was yet to be completed on other non-BAT 
defendants. On 18 September 2009, the court issued a ruling 
denying the preliminary objections filed by the Company and 
Investments on the basis that the court was competent to hear the 
case as it related to the Company and Investments, that the 
Company and Investments are necessary parties to the action and 
that the suit therefore was not liable to be struck out as against the 
Company and Investments. On 2 October 2009, the Company and 
Investments filed notices of appeal from the entirety of the court’s 
ruling as it related to their respective objections. The Company and 
Investments filed their appeal briefs and, on 8 February and 6 July 
2011, respectively, the plaintiff filed responding briefs in these 
appeals with motions for extensions of time. As at 31 December 
2011, the appeals and plaintiff’s motions for extensions of time 
remain pending before the Court of Appeal. On 15 October and  
19 October 2009, respectively, the Company and Investments filed 
motions to stay all proceedings pending the resolution of their 
appeals, which motion was granted by the High Court on  
20 September 2010. On 15 June 2011, the Lagos Attorney General 
filed a notice of appeal from the High Court’s order granting a stay 
of proceedings, which remains pending as at 31 December 2011.  
On 8 July 2008, the High Court of Gombe State issued a ruling on 
the preliminary objections filed by the Company, Investments and 
other defendants in the case, setting aside the service on all 
defendants and striking out the Gombe suit. In its decision, the 
court held that the writs served on the defendants were invalid, the 
plaintiff had failed to pay the requisite filing fees, and based on 
these filing defects, the court was not competent to assume 
jurisdiction. The court also stated, however, that the plaintiff, 
through its statement of claim and affidavit evidence filed in support 
of its ex parte motion for leave to serve outside the jurisdiction, had 
satisfied the requirements for service outside the jurisdiction. 
Although the plaintiff has not appealed from the court’s decision, 
the plaintiff has filed a renewed action in the High Court of Gombe 
State. The plaintiff seeks approximately £2.4 billion in damages, 
including special, anticipatory and punitive damages, restitution 
and disgorgement of profits, as well as declaratory and injunctive 
relief. BAT Nigeria, the Company and Investments filed notices of 
preliminary objection in the renewed action. On 10 February 2011, 
the High Court denied the preliminary objections filed by the 
Company and Investments and the companies appealed the court’s 
ruling on 24 February 2011. The companies also filed motions to 
stay proceedings in the High Court pending the appeals, and  
on 19 December 2011 the High Court adjourned sine die pending 
resolution of the defendants’ appeals. On 8 July 2011, the 
Company and Investments filed their respective appeal briefs  
and their appeals remain pending as at 31 December 2011. 
Oyo State seeks approximately £1.5 billion in damages, including 
special, anticipatory and punitive damages, restitution and 
disgorgement of profits, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. 
The High Court partially granted the preliminary objections filed by 
the Company and Investments on 22 June 2010 and set aside the 
service of the writ of summons. The Company and Investments 
appealed the court’s order insofar as it denied the remainder of the 
relief requested, including the High Court’s decision not to set aside 
the issuance of the writ. As at 31 December 2011, the Court of 
Appeal has yet to set a date for hearing of the appeals.  
In Kano, the plaintiff seeks approximately £7.6 billion in damages, 
including special, anticipatory and punitive damages, restitution 
and disgorgement of profits, as well as declaratory and injunctive 
relief. Preliminary objections filed by the Company and Investments 
were dismissed on 16 April 2010. The Company and Investments 
have appealed the decision and sought a stay of proceedings in the 
High Court pending appeal. On 13 May 2010, the plaintiff filed a 
motion in the High Court for preliminary injunctive relief, seeking, 
inter alia, orders to restrain the defendants from various alleged 
marketing and distribution practices in Kano State including the sale 
of tobacco products within 1,000 metres of any public places that 
are predominately a location for minors. On 3 February 2011, the 
Company and Investments filed motions in the Court of Appeal to 
stay further proceedings in the High Court. On 14 February 2011, 
the plaintiff moved to dismiss the stay motions filed by the 
Company and Investments before the Court of Appeal. The Court  
of Appeal hearing on the stay motions filed by the Company and 
Investments and the plaintiff’s motions to dismiss was adjourned  
on 26 January 2012. No new hearing date has been set. As at  
31 December 2011, no date has been set for continuation of 
proceedings in the High Court. 
In Ogun, the preliminary objections filed by BAT Nigeria, the 
Company and Investments were denied by the court on 20 May 
2010. All three BAT defendants have filed appeals and the Company 
and Investments have sought a stay of proceedings pending their 
appeals. On 24 May 2010, the plaintiff filed a motion for 
preliminary injunctive relief in the High Court, seeking, inter alia, 
orders to restrain the defendants from committing various alleged 
marketing and distribution practices in Ogun State, including the 
sale of tobacco products within 1,000 metres of any public places 
that are predominately a location for minors. On 21 October 2010, 
the High Court adjourned proceedings sine die pending resolution 
of the defendants’ stay motions before the Court of Appeal. On  
18 October 2011, the Court of Appeal set 8 May 2012 for hearing of 
the Company’s appeal and reserved hearing of the Company’s stay 
motion. BAT Nigeria’s and Investments’ appeals stand adjourned to 
30 May 2012 for hearing of the Ogun Attorney General’s motions 
for extensions of time to file responding briefs on appeal.

British American Tobacco
Annual Report 2011
Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review The Attorney General of the Federation filed suit on 6 November 
2007 against the Company, Investments, BAT Nigeria and two other 
defendants, seeking approximately £21.3 billion in damages, 
including special, anticipatory and punitive damages, restitution 
and disgorgement of profits, as well as declaratory and injunctive 
relief. The Company, BAT Nigeria, and Investments, respectively, 
were served on 16, 18, and 19 December 2007, and filed 
preliminary objections. On 27 January 2010, the Attorney General 
of the Federation filed a notice of discontinuance of the action as 
against another defendant, and the court struck out the action as 
against that defendant.  
Saudi Arabia 
In Saudi Arabia, in 2007 there were reports that the Ministry  
of Health was pursuing a medical reimbursement action in the 
Riyadh General Court against a number of distributors and agents. 
According to these reports, the Ministry of Health would reportedly 
seek damages of at least 127 billion Saudi Riyals. As at 31 December 
2011, no Group company has been served with process. A separate 
medical reimbursement action was reportedly filed by the King 
Faisal Specialist Hospital in the Riyadh General Court, naming ‘ 
BAT Company Limited’ as a defendant. As at 31 December 2011,  
no Group company had been served with process in the action.  
Spain 
In early 2006, the Junta de Andalucia, in Spain, filed a medical 
reimbursement action against the State and tobacco companies 
(including BAT España S.A.) before the contentious-administrative 
courts. The State filed preliminary objections to the Junta’s claim, 
with tobacco companies filing supporting briefs. The court upheld 
these preliminary objections and dismissed the claim in November 
2007. The Junta’s appeal of this ruling to the Supreme Court was 
dismissed in September 2009. However, in May 2009, the Junta 
filed a new contentious-administrative claim with similar 
allegations. The defendants filed procedural objections, which were 
rejected by the court. The next procedural step is for the Junta to file 
its exhibits to the claim which were not attached to the Writ.  
(b) Class actions 
Brazil 
There are currently four class actions being brought in Brazil. One 
class action recently ended in a final defence judgment (see below). 
One is also a medical reimbursement (São Paulo), and is therefore 
discussed above.  
In 1995, the Associação de Defesa da Saúde do Fumante (ADESF) 
class action was filed against Souza Cruz and Philip Morris in the 
São Paulo Lower Civil Court alleging that the defendants are liable 
to a class of smokers and former smokers for failing to warn of 
cigarette addiction. The case was stayed in 2004 pending the 
defendants’ appeal from a decision issued by the lower civil court 
on 7 April 2004. That lower court decision held that the defendants 
had not met their burden of proving that cigarette smoking was not 
addictive or harmful to health, notwithstanding an earlier 
interlocutory order that the São Paulo Court of Appeals had issued, 
which directed the trial court to allow more evidence to be taken 
before rendering its decision. On 12 November 2008, the São Paulo 
Court of Appeals overturned the lower court’s unfavourable 
decision of 2004, finding that the lower court had failed to provide 
the defendants with an opportunity to produce evidence.  
The case was returned to the lower court for production of  
evidence and a new judgment. On 19 March 2009, the Lower  
Civil Court ordered designation of court-appointed medical and 
advertising experts. The parties submitted questions to these court-
appointed experts who subsequently delivered their reports. Each 
party also provided expert reports commenting on the court-
appointed experts’ conclusions. On 16 May 2011, the court granted 
Souza Cruz’s motion to dismiss the action in its entirety on the 
merits. Plaintiffs filed an appeal of the dismissal on 22 July 2011. 
Souza Cruz filed its response on 5 October 2011. On 10 November 
2011, the case records were sent to the Public Prosecutor Office.  
On 20 December 2011, the Public Prosecutor Office presented a 
non-binding, advisory opinion that rejected most of Souza Cruz’s 
legal defence arguments. The case records were sent to the São 
Paulo State Court of Appeals. The appellate court has not yet  
issued a ruling. 
The Brazilian Association for the Defense of Consumers’ Health 
(Saudecon) filed a class action against Souza Cruz in the City of 
Porto Alegre, Brazil on 3 November 2008. The plaintiff purports to 
represent all Brazilian smokers whom, it alleges, are unable to quit 
smoking and lack access to cessation treatments. The plaintiff is 
seeking an order requiring the named defendants to fund, 
according to their market share, the purchase of cessation 
treatments for these smokers over a minimum period of two years. 
Souza Cruz was served with this complaint on 19 November 2008. 
On 18 May 2009, the case was dismissed with judgment on the 
merits. The plaintiffs appealed in August 2009 and Souza Cruz  
and Philip Morris both responded. On 22 July 2011, the Public 
Prosecution Office issued a non-binding opinion saying that  
the favourable first instance ruling should be vacated based on 
procedural issues. On 25 August 2011, the reporting justice of the 
appellate court rejected the Public Prosecution Office’s opinion, 
finding that the trial court ruling should not be nullified. On  
1 November 2011, the 9th Chamber of the Rio Grande do Sul State 
Court of Appeals granted the Public Prosecution Office special 
appeal, ordering the remittance of the case records in the first 
instance to complete proper notification to the Public Prosecutor 
Office of the sentence. On 14 December 2011, the Public 
Prosecution Office filed a special appeal. Souza Cruz’s counter-
arguments were submitted on 10 February 2012. 
A class action was filed against Souza Cruz by the Association of 
Exploited Consumers of the federal District, requesting a court order 
to prevent Souza Cruz selling cigarettes in Brazil. In December 
2006, the federal District Court of Appeals confirmed a favourable 
lower court decision which had found the claim groundless and 
unlawful. The plaintiff appealed that ruling, but on 12 March 2009 
the Superior Court affirmed the ruling and rejected the plaintiff’s 
appeal. The plaintiff appealed again, but on 23 March 2009, in a 
unanimous decision, the Superior Court rejected the plaintiff’s 
appeal. On 25 November 2011, the Reporting Justice confirmed the 
Superior Court of Justice and the Federal District State Court of 
Appeals favourable decisions. The case is now closed.

In 2004, the State of Sergipe instigated a class action seeking 
compensation for smokers in Sergipe State who purportedly tried to 
quit smoking. The lower court denied the plaintiffs’ request for early 
relief and determined ANVISA (a federal government health agency) 
be ordered to join the case as co-defendants. As ANVISA is a federal 
agency, the case was removed to the federal court where ANVISA 
successfully argued that it lacked standing to be sued. The claim 
against ANVISA was dismissed and the federal court sent the case 
back to the lower state court for proceedings to continue. However, 
the action was stayed on 18 December 2009 pending a decision by 
the Superior Court on which court has jurisdiction. On 26 March 
2010 the Superior Court determined that the civil court had 
jurisdiction of the matter. On 19 October 2011, the court dismissed 
the action with judgment on the merits. The plaintiff filed an appeal 
on 9 January 2012. 
Bulgaria 
In March 2008, Mr Nikolay Benchev Yochkolovski filed a smoking-
related consumer fraud class action in the Sofia City Court of 
Bulgaria against 21 defendants, including the following British 
American Tobacco-affiliated companies: British-American Tobacco 
Polska S.A., British-American Tobacco (Romania) Investments SRL, 
House of Prince A/S, and Scandinavian Tobacco S.A. On 24 
September 2008, the claim was dismissed on procedural grounds 
and the plaintiff appealed this ruling. On 11 November 2008, the 
Court of Appeal granted the plaintiff’s appeal. On 2 December 
2008, the Sofia City Court ordered the plaintiff to meet various 
evidentiary and procedural conditions before proceeding further 
with this claim. The Sofia Court of Appeal upheld this decision. 
Following a hearing before the Sofia City Court, the court denied 
the plaintiff’s request to allow a class action to proceed on  
26 November 2010. The plaintiff appealed that decision and on  
20 January 2011, the Sofia Court of Appeal, rejected plaintiff’s 
appeal and affirmed termination of the proceedings. Thereafter,  
the plaintiff appealed the decision to the Bulgarian Supreme Court 
of Cassation. The Court rejected this appeal on 3 May 2011. 
Canada
There are 10 class actions being brought in Canada against  
Group companies.  
Knight is a ‘lights’ class action in which the plaintiff alleges that the 
marketing of light and mild cigarettes is deceptive because it 
conveys a false and misleading message that those cigarettes are 
less harmful than regular cigarettes. Although the claim arises from 
health concerns, it does not seek compensation for personal injury. 
Instead it seeks compensation for amounts spent on ‘light and mild’ 
products and a disgorgement of profits from Imperial.  
The Supreme Court of British Columbia certified a class of all 
consumers of cigarettes bearing ‘light’ or ‘mild’ descriptors since 
1974 manufactured in British Columbia by Imperial. Imperial filed 
an appeal against the certification which was heard in February 
2006. The appellate court confirmed the certification of the class but 
has limited any financial liability, if proven, to the period from 1997.  
The motion of the federal government to strike out the third party 
notice issued against them by Imperial was heard in February 2006 
and was granted but was appealed by Imperial. The appeal was 
heard in June 2009 in conjunction with the British Columbia health 
care reimbursement claim. The Court of Appeal went so far as to say 
that it was not “plain and obvious” that the federal government did 
not owe a duty of care to manufacturers or indeed to the class itself 
and, therefore, the federal government could face potential liability 
to claims of product liability or misrepresentation. The federal 
government appealed the Court of Appeal’s decision. On 29 July 
2011, the Supreme Court unanimously granted the federal 
government’s appeal and dismissed the third party claim on the 
basis that the federal government’s impugned conduct constituted 
valid policy benefiting public health and is therefore not subject to 
civil liability. 
On 9 December 2009, Imperial was served with a class action filed 
by Ontario tobacco farmers and the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco 
Growers’ Marketing Board (the Growers’ Claim). The plaintiffs 
allege that, during the timeframe, Imperial improperly paid lower 
prices for tobacco leaf destined for duty-free products that was 
smuggled back into Canada and sold in the domestic market, as 
opposed to the higher domestic leaf price. Imperial deposited the 
amount owing to the government of Ontario pursuant to the 
Comprehensive Agreement into an escrow account, alleging that 
the Comprehensive Agreement permitted Imperial to set-off that 
amount against costs incurred as a result of the claim (including 
damages, if any). In response, the Ontario government commenced 
an application against Imperial, seeking the release of the funds (the 
Ontario Claim). No monetary damages are being claimed against 
Imperial by the government of Ontario.  
On 26 July 2010, Imperial argued its preliminary motion in the 
Ontario claim. Imperial was successful in its application and the 
court ordered that the Ontario claim be stayed in favour of the 
arbitration provisions stipulated in the Comprehensive Agreement 
and raised by Imperial in its Notice of Arbitration. The Ontario 
government appealed this decision and the hearing date originally 
scheduled for 4 January 2011 was heard by the Ontario Court of 
Appeal on 17 February 2011. The Canadian government intervened 
in the appeal to support the Ontario government’s position. 
On 20 July 2011, the Court of Appeal gave judgment in Imperial’s 
favour and held that the funds would remain in escrow pending a 
decision by an arbitrator on the issue pursuant to the 
Comprehensive Agreement. The court also ruled that the question 
of whether the Growers’ Claim constitutes a ‘Released Claim’ under 
the Comprehensive Agreement must be determined by the courts, 
thereby splitting the issues. In the meantime, Imperial will proceed 
with the arbitration. As yet, no hearing date has been set.  
Imperial was recently served with certification materials in the 
underlying Growers’ Claim. This case remains at a very preliminary 
stage and no hearing date has been set. 
There are currently two class actions in Quebec. On 21 February 
2005, the Quebec Superior Court granted certification in two class 
actions against Imperial and two domestic manufacturers, which 
have a combined value of C$23 billion plus interest and costs. The 
court certified two classes, which include residents of Quebec who 
suffered from lung, throat and laryngeal cancer or emphysema as at 
November 1998 or developed these diseases thereafter and who 
smoked a minimum of fifteen cigarettes a day for at least five years, 
and residents who were addicted to nicotine at the time the 
proceedings were filed and who have since remained addicted. In

Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review Quebec, there is no right of appeal for a defendant upon 
certification. The plaintiffs have served a Statement of Claim. The 
trial in this matter has been set for 5 March 2012. 
In June 2009, four new smoking and health class actions were filed 
in Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, against 
Canadian manufacturers and foreign companies, including the UK 
Companies and Imperial. In Saskatchewan, a number of UK 
companies have been released from the action. In Nova Scotia the 
proceedings have not progressed. There are service issues in 
relation to the UK Companies for Alberta and Manitoba.  
In June 2010, two further suits were filed in British Columbia. 
Imperial was served with the British Columbia suits on 16 July 2010. 
The Bourassa claim is allegedly on behalf of all individuals who have 
suffered chronic respiratory disease and the McDermid claim 
proposes a class based on heart disease. Both claims state that they 
have been brought on behalf of those who have “smoked a 
minimum of 25,000 cigarettes”. The UK companies were served on 
20 July 2010. The UK Companies and Imperial proceeded to 
challenge jurisdiction.  
Italy 
In 2010, British American Tobacco Italia S.p.A (BAT Italia) was served 
with notice of a class action suit filed by an Italian consumer 
association (Codacons) and three representative individuals. The 
main allegations made in the class action relate to addiction claims 
and failure to warn. In April 2011, the class action suit was declared 
inadmissible by the First Instance Civil Court of Rome. The Court of 
Rome considered the action to be manifestly without merit and held 
that it was inadmissible on that basis as well as others. Plaintiffs filed 
an appeal against the decision issued by the Court of Rome, 
challenging the grounds of inadmissibility. The parties presented 
their final arguments to the Court of Appeal on 25 January 2012. 
On 27 January 2012, the Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s 
decision confirming the inadmissibility of the case. 
Venezuela
The Venezuelan Federation of Associations of Users and Consumers 
filed a class action against the Venezuelan government seeking 
regulatory controls on tobacco and recovery of medical expenses 
for future expenses of treating smoking-related illnesses in 
Venezuela. On 19 January 2009, C.A Cigarrera Bigott Sucs. 
(Cigarrera Bigott) notified the court of its intention to appear as a 
third party. The court adjourned a public hearing, initially scheduled 
for 28 July 2009, where Cigarrera Bigott’s status as a third party 
would be determined and parties would present evidence and 
make arguments. On 16 September 2009, the Venezuelan Republic 
ordered the court to continue the judicial process. A new date has 
yet to be scheduled by the court.
On 12 April 2011, however, the Constitutional Chamber of the 
Supreme Court of Justice issued decision number 494, which 
established the rules for class action procedures. The court must 
therefore decide whether Cigarrera Bigott’s intervention may be 
admitted under the new procedure prior to the public hearing. This 
decision has not yet been issued. 
(c) Individual personal injury claims  
Aside from the US there are approximately 353 individual smoking 
cases pending world-wide as at 31 December 2011 against Group 
companies that are not detailed here. Over three-quarters of these 
cases are in Brazil.
At 31 December 2011, there were only three (compared to 
approximately 1,000 cases in July 2008, which decreased to 634 in 
July 2009) individual ‘lights’ cases in Italy pending against BAT Italia 
before the justice of the peace courts and 43 ‘lights’ cases on 
appeal. In addition, in 2007, 2,230 cases were filed by a single 
plaintiff’s counsel in one jurisdiction (Pescopagano). The court has 
confirmed the withdrawal of all of these claims. Because of the type 
of court involved, the most that any individual plaintiff can recover 
in damages is €1,033, plus €1,000 in costs and an additional €3,000 
for enforcement proceedings. As at 31 December 2011, more than 
4,000 cases (including 2,230 Pescopagano cases) had been 
withdrawn, suspended or resulted in decisions given in favour of 
BAT Italia.  
As at 31 December 2011, there are 27 smoking and health cases 
pending before Italian first instance civil courts, filed by or on behalf 
of individuals in which it is contended that diseases or deaths have 
been caused by cigarette smoking. There are two labour cases for 
alleged occupational exposure pending in Italy. In addition, there 
are 12 cases on appeal, including two appeals that relate to the 
same labour court decision (Serafini) but based on different 
grounds.  
On 23 June 2003, an individual action was brought in the 
 Danish High Court against House of Prince A/S and Skandinavisk 
Tobakskompagni A/S seeking DKK485,450 (currently approximately 
€65,215) for alleged smoking-related diseases and loss of earnings. 
On 8 December 2011, the Court issued Judgment in favour of the 
defendants and ordered costs against the plaintiff. On 31 January 
2012, the plaintiff filed an appeal.  
On 14 September 2011, an individual action was brought in the 
Zheleznodorozhny District Court of Khabarovsk, Russia against 
British American Tobacco-STF (BAT-STF) and British American 
Tobacco-Yava (BAT-Yava) among others. The plaintiff seeks to 
compel defendants, including BAT-STF and BAT-Yava, to cease 
production and sale of tobacco products and to remove their 
tobacco products from circulation within the Russian Federation. 
On 20 October 2011, a statement of defence was filed for BAT-STF 
and BAT-Yava. The plaintiff filed to withdraw his claim and the court 
accepted the withdrawal of the claim on 22 November 2011. The 
plaintiff did not file an appeal within the time permitted. However, 
the plaintiff may still be allowed to file an appeal if he can show that 
there was a valid reason for missing the appeal deadline.

Conclusion
While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular 
case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, the Group 
believes that the defences of the Group’s companies to all these 
various claims are meritorious on both the law and the facts, and a 
vigorous defence is being made everywhere. If an adverse judgment 
is entered against any of the Group’s companies in any case, an 
appeal will be made. Such appeals could require the appellants to 
post appeal bonds or substitute security in amounts which could in 
some cases equal or exceed the amount of the judgment. In any 
event, with regard to US litigation, the Group has the benefit of the 
RJRT Indemnification. At least in the aggregate, and despite the 
quality of defences available to the Group, it is not impossible that 
the Group’s results of operations or cash flows in particular 
quarterly or annual periods could be materially affected by this and 
by the final outcome of any particular litigation.
Having regard to all these matters, the Group (i) does not consider it 
appropriate to make any provision in respect of any pending 
litigation, save insofar as stated above and (ii) does not believe that 
the ultimate outcome of this litigation will significantly impair the 
Group’s financial condition.

To the members of British American Tobacco p.l.c. 
 
We have audited the Parent Company financial statements of 
British American Tobacco p.l.c. for the year ended 31 December 
2011 which comprise the Parent Company Balance Sheet, and 
the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibility statement 
set out on page 108, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Parent Company financial statements  
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to  
the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we 
read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:  
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs  
as at 31 December 2011; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and  
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies Act 2006.  
 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion:  
 the part of the remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and  
 the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial 
year for which the Parent Company financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the Parent Company  
financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters  
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:  
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or  
 the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with  
the accounting records and returns; or  
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or  
 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.  
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements  
of British American Tobacco p.l.c. for the year ended  
31 December 2011.

Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Business review Notes on the Accounts  
 
 
1 Accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The Parent Company financial statements have been prepared on the 
going concern basis, under the historical cost convention except as 
described in the accounting policy below on financial instruments 
and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice. 
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and  
is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. 
Cash Flow Statement 
The cash flows of the Company are included in the consolidated cash 
flow statement of British American Tobacco p.l.c. which is included  
in this Annual Report. Consequently the Company is exempt under 
the terms of FRS 1 (Revised) from publishing a cash flow statement. 
Foreign Currencies 
Transactions arising in currencies other than sterling are translated at 
the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction. Assets and 
liabilities expressed in currencies other than sterling are translated at 
rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year. All exchange 
differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year. 
Accounting for income 
Income is included in the profit and loss account when all contractual 
or other applicable conditions for recognition have been met. 
Provisions are made for bad and doubtful debts, as appropriate. 
Taxation 
Taxation provided is that chargeable on the profits of the year, 
together with deferred taxation. Deferred taxation is provided in full 
on timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses  
in the financial statements and their recognition in tax computations. 
However, the Company does not discount deferred tax assets  
and liabilities.  
Fixed asset investments 
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, together with subsequent 
capital contributions, less provisions for any impairment in value. 
Dividends 
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are 
recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders 
while the interim dividend distributions are recognised in the period  
in which the dividends are declared and paid. 
Similarly, dividend income is recognised at the same time as the 
paying company recognises the liability to pay a dividend. 
Repurchase of share capital  
When share capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, 
including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction  
from equity. Repurchased shares which are not cancelled, or shares 
purchased for the employee share ownership trusts, are classified  
as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity. 
Related Parties 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under 
paragraph 3(c) of FRS 8 from disclosing transactions with related 
parties that are wholly owned subsidiaries of British American Tobacco 
p.l.c. Group. 
Financial instruments 
The financial instrument disclosures of the Company are included  
in the Group financial statements which are included in this Annual 
Report. Consequently, the Company is exempt under paragraph 2D 
(b) of FRS 29 from publishing these financial instruments disclosures. 
Financial guarantees are recorded at fair value less  
accumulated amortisation.  
2 Investments in Group companies 
The Company’s directly owned subsidiaries are British American Tobacco (1998) Limited, B.A.T. International Finance p.l.c., B.A.T Capital Corporation 
and BATMark Limited. 
The Directors are of the opinion that the individual investments in the subsidiary undertakings have a value not less than the amount at which they are 
shown in the Balance Sheet.

Cautionary statement 
The business review and certain other sections of the Annual Report 
contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risk factors 
associated with, among other things, the economic and business 
circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries and 
markets in which the Group operates. It is believed that the 
expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable but they 
may be affected by a wide range of variables which could cause  
actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated.

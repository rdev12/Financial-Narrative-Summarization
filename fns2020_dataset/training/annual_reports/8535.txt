ITE Group plc 
Annual Report 2006
Group performance
The Group has produced another impressive trading and
financial performance for the 2006 financial year . 
T urnover of £82.4 million was a 5% improvement on last year’ s
reported turnover of £78.5 million, and Headline profit before tax
of £26.0 million was ahead of the restated result for last year
(£25.3 million). This result was achieved despite lower interest
income following last year’ s share buyback and the £4.9 million
contribution in 2005 from non-annual events. Reported profit
before tax was £24.8 million (2005: £25.2 million) and fully
diluted earnings per share improved to 6.7p per share 
(2005: 6.6p).
Strategic progress
During the year the Group has continued to implement 
its strategy of pursuing organic growth and strengthening 
ITE’ s market leadership in key industry sectors supplemented
through selective earning enhancing acquisitions. In addition,
the excellent long-term relationships with our venues continue
to be of significance to our business. In Moscow the construction
event, MosBuild, grew into the newly constructed exhibition
space at Crocus, and in Almaty , Kazakhstan, the KazBuild
construction event was able to expand into the newly completed,
ITE supported, pavilion. In Kyiv the larger events, KievBuild 
and AgriHort, were both able to grow into the second phase
development at the IEC venue which was completed in 
January 2006. 
It is through the proven and established success of our 
sales and organising teams that ITE is now the independent
exhibition organiser of choice for venues in our markets.
Looking forward, I see another year of continued growth built
upon the relationships and contracts we have established. 
Board and management
There have been a number of changes to the Board during the
year . Marco Sodi stepped down in January following the sale 
by Veronis Suhler Stevenson of its remaining shareholding in
the Company . Malcolm Wall joined the Board as a non-executive
Director on 4 May 2006, and is a member of the Audit and
Remuneration Committees. Malcolm brings extensive
experience in the international B2B media and exhibitions
business. Since the year-end Ceyda Erem has tendered her
resignation as an ITE Board Director , although she will remain
Managing Director of our associate business in T urkey .
Ian T omkins has informed the Board that he wishes to relinquish
his role as Chief Executive at the end of 2007 for personal
reasons. The Nomination Committee will shortly be starting a
process to find his successor and will be meeting both internal
and external candidates. During his tenure Ian has made an
immense contribution to the remarkable success of the Group.
I would like to express my thanks to the management and staff
throughout the territories who have worked so hard to make
this result achievable. We employ 650 people of whom over
75% are local nationals, employed and working in Russia, 
the CIS and T urkey .
Chairman’ s statement
drive our business forward
Well placed to Dividend
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 2.5p per share,
making a total dividend for the year of 3.5p. This reflects an
increase of more than 25% over last year’ s total dividend and 
is in line with the Board’ s policy of increasing dividends in line
with the underlying earnings growth. 
Outlook
The continued expansion of the exhibition industry in Russia
and the CIS which has fuelled ITE’ s growth over the last few
years is set to continue. Strong economic conditions, ITE’ s
recognised international brands, our market leading position
and our dedicated and conscientious staff all place us in a 
very strong position to drive our business forward.

Annual Report 2006
Shareholder performance
ITE is committed to maximising Headline earnings per
share and through that, the return to shareholders. ITE has
a strong record of growth in Headline profit before tax over
the last five years, and through the Company’ s policy of
increasing dividends in line with underlying growth, ITE
has returned a significant proportion of its post tax profits
to shareholders over this period. Last year the Company
returned an additional £30 million to shareholders through
a purchase and cancellation of its own share capital.
ITE’ s record in returning cash to shareholders through
dividend distributions and through the purchase of its 
own shares is illustrated below together with the Group’ s
post-tax profits for the same years. Over the five year
period from 2001 to 2006, the Company has returned 
to shareholders £63 million in cash.
Through its strong trading performance and policy of
increasing dividends in line with underlying growth, 
the ITE share price has increased from a low point of 15p
during 2001-02 to a value of 122p at 30 September 2006.
During the year ended 30 September 2006 the high point of
the share price was 147p. ITE’ s share price has significantly
outperformed its benchmark index, the FTSE Small Cap,
over the five year period as set out in the graph below .

ITE Group plc 
Annual Report 2006
This business review has been prepared for ITE
Group as a whole and highlights matters which are
relevant in the context of the Group’s business and
financial results.
Results for 2006 financial year
T urnover for the year was £82.4 million (2005: £78.5 million).
After making adjustment for the effect of biennial events this 
is a 16% improvement over last year’ s comparable turnover .
This year’ s turnover includes an initial £2.7 million contribution
of revenue from the Footwear and Kiev AgriHort acquisitions
made in the last financial year . These events contributed 
£1.2 million to gross profits. The ‘like for like’ revenue growth
(excluding the effect of biennial events and acquisitions in the
year) achieved this year on our portfolio of events was 13%.
The direct costs of exhibitions were well controlled in 2006 and
as a result the gross margin of 46.7% was circa 1% higher than
the gross margin achieved on last year’ s portfolio of events.
Operating costs before amortisation charges of £14.1 million
were 10% higher than the comparative charge for last year
(2005: £12.8 million). Operating costs this year include the
higher costs of expensing Performance Share Plans and Option
Plans of £1.6 million (2005: £1.1 million), but this is partially
offset by the release of a £0.3 million provision, originally 
made in 2003 against a venue loan.
The associate business in T urkey delivered a result of £0.6
million (2005: £0.4 million) despite a reduced contribution
from its textile exhibitions.
Income from interest and finance was reduced following the 
£30 million share buyback executed in August 2005. Interest
income was consequently reduced by approximately £1.3
million. Finance income includes the release of £0.4 million 
of ‘notional imputed interest receipts’ relating to certain venue
loans under IFRS fair value accounting standards.
Headline profit before tax this year of £26.0 million was ahead 
of last year’ s headline profit before tax of £25.3 million and,
after adjusting for the effect of biennial events, represents a
25% increase over the comparable result for 2005.
The Group’ s overall operating metrics for its events business
(excluding publishing) are set out below:
Square Gross Average

2005 Results from Events 340.9 77.3 35.6

Non annual 2006 45.0 2.3 0.4
2006 Results from Events 425.6 80.6 37.7
In 2006 the Group organised 146 events (2005: 152 events) 
in fifteen countries (2005: sixteen countries) from its nineteen
dedicated offices. There were sixteen new launches in the year
contributing a total £2.0 million in revenue and £0.5 million in
gross profits. 
The Group sold 425,600m
2
of exhibition space in 2006 (2005:
340,900m
2
). After adjusting for the effect of biennial events the
Group achieved a 20% increase in volume sales, a 16% increase
in revenues and a 21% improvement in gross profits from the
events it organised in 2006.
The average yield across the Group achieved on comparable
sales was 3% lower this year at £206 per m
2
(2005 comparable
yield: £212 per m
2
). This was expected as half of the dilution 
in yield was attributable to the average yields of the new
acquisitions; a quarter of the dilution in yield related to the 
re-pricing of the Moscow International Motor Show , and the
remaining quarter was caused by strong volume growth 
from regions outside Moscow , where in general, average 
yields are lower .

Business to business specialists
Business to business (‘B2B’) exhibitions and conferences
are modern marketplaces for business. Face to face
meetings to conduct business are a key marketing
medium for international and local businesses to 
open sales channels in new territories. 
B2B exhibitions and conferences generate the majority 
of their revenues in advance of the event and do not rely
upon a consumer audience for their success. 
ITE is a specialist in organising B2B exhibitions and
conferences, and its focus on emerging and developing
markets adds an extra dimension to its position in the media
industry . These markets are by definition dynamic, and their
fast moving, constantly changing nature means that trade
events are in high demand as participants maximise their
exposure to new commercial opportunities and stay one
step ahead within their field.

The market conditions in Moscow and St Petersburg were strong
with most exhibitions reflecting higher demand. In Moscow the
second pavilion at Crocus, which was completed in 2005, added
an extra 60,000m
2
of available gross space to the market’ s
international quality exhibition space. Accordingly there was
resultant change in the Moscow market with new launches and
venue changes across the industry , as organisers responded to
the increase in space and increased choice of venue. In St Petersburg
there has been relative stability and little change in established
trading patterns. However the draw of Moscow’ s large events 
for the major international exhibitors is causing St Petersburg 
to evolve into a more regional exhibition business.
In ITE’ s Moscow business the highlight of the year was the
further expansion of the market leading construction event,
MosBuild. At 68,300m
2
(2005: 54,400m
2
) across the two
leading exhibition venues this event is now Moscow’ s, and
Russia’ s, largest trade exhibition.
Of our other major international events in Moscow the Moscow
International T ravel and T ourism exhibition held in Expocentr
was solid in response to competition this year from a new
event launch at Crocus. It recorded marginal growth to
19,600m
2
(2005: 19,300m
2
) at a slightly reduced overall yield.
The Moscow International Motor Show , focused on the B2B
motor accessories, service and parts industries, took place 
for the first time in the new Crocus venue alongside the OICA
consumer motor show , Autosalon. As part of this re-positioning
the Moscow International Motor Show agreed a common
pricing policy with the Autosalon event together with a lower
venue cost to ITE. The event was bigger at 17,700m
2
(2005:
16,900m
2
) but yields were lower than the 2005 comparatives. 
However the new format was well received by visitors and
exhibitors alike. Following the move to Crocus, pricing for the
Moscow International Motor Show is likely to stabilise.
Worldfood Moscow , held in Expocentr , continues to perform
well and has become the leading specialist event in the trade
food sector now occupying 22,200m
2
of space (2005:
20,300m
2
). Expoelectronica, the leading electrical components
event, moved to the Crocus venue to secure more and better
quality space. The event grew by over 20% to 9,000m
2
(2005:
7,400m
2
) and is now one of ITE’ s top five contributing events 
in Moscow . 
There have been a number of successful new launches in
Moscow this year . Babytime is a consumer focused event; MIBS
Autumn an ‘on the water’ summer boat event supplementing
our Spring Boat Show . Since the year end a new launch of an
Autumn travel event, Select T ravel, and the transfer of our
pharmaceuticals event to Crocus have both proved successful
initiatives. Additionally ITE acquired two new events in June this
year . Expoclean Moscow has a focus on the industrial cleaning
industry and Bytchimexpo focuses on household chemicals.
Expoclean took place in November and performed ahead of
expectations; Bytchimexpo will take place in March next year .
In St Petersburg most of the exhibitions reported steady 
growth. The major event in the calendar is BalticBuild which
was unchanged in size at 10,200m
2
(the event is space
constrained), but improved its revenues and profits. There 
was one small new launch, Subcontracting, supported by 
the City Government.
Looking forward there is a new pavilion being built at
Expocentr which will provide much needed space for our
Expocentr based events to expand. This will add a further
8,000m
2
gross space and is due for completion in early 2007.
Crocus has also commenced construction of a third pavilion,
designed to provide at least 60,000m
2
gross. With more new
space available the Moscow exhibition business is well
positioned to deliver further growth.

All offices in Central Asia experienced strong demand and
excellent year on year revenue growth of more than 25% was
achieved across the whole region. There have been no marked
changes in the competitive environment. In Almaty , Atakent,
the venue owner , successfully completed a new pavilion ready
for our use in September 2006, but there have been no other
significant changes in venue facilities elsewhere in Central Asia.
A new office was opened in Kyrgyzstan in the year . 
One highlight of the year was the new launch of KazBuild
Spring in Almaty which delivered 4,100m
2
. Our regular
KazBuild (Autumn) event was able to utilise the newly
constructed pavilion and grow to 10,800m
2
(2005: 8,300m
2
).
T otal sales to the construction sector in Almaty have almost
doubled in this financial year , testimony to the underlying
strong demand. The strength of the construction sector was 
in evidence throughout the region with revenue growth at
AtyrauBuild (10%), AstanaBuild (21%), BakuBuild (30%) and
UzBuild (14%) all recording positive year on year growth. 
In October 2005, the Kazakhstan International Oil & Gas
exhibition and conference grew by 7% to 7,900m
2
(2005:
7,400m
2
). Since the year-end the October 2006 edition has
been held and grew by 20% into the newly constructed pavilion.
Oil & gas events have again been strong performers
throughout the region with the North Caspian event in Atyrau,
Kazakhstan, Oil & Gas Uzbekistan and the Caspian Oil & Gas
exhibition in Azerbaijan all recording good year on year
revenue growth.
New launch activity continued its momentum. The eight small
start up events and conferences across the regions will assist to
secure ITE’ s future presence in these markets as the economic
infrastructure evolves. Events were launched in construction,
banking and financial services and the power industry
(Kazakhstan); and telecoms and travel (Uzbekistan). 
The current pattern of business growth in line with economic
growth and assisted by venue development looks set to
continue for the foreseeable future.

ITE staff by region
ITE was established in 1991 and since its early years has
been a pioneer amongst trade event organisers through 
its expertise in launching and organising new events to
international standards in places where the exhibition 
and conference industry is under developed.
ITE retains its innovative spirit today , but now the
Company benefits from the depth of experience of its
many staff who have worked at the forefront of their
profession for several years.
ITE has a flat management structure and a philosophy 
of promoting responsibility throughout the workforce.
Working for ITE is a rewarding experience and staff
retention levels are high. 
ITE’ s operational management is decentralised, with
emphasis placed on local offices managing their own
business with international support. This structure is
designed to recognise the value of the expertise that has
been developed throughout the Group and allows ITE to be
more aware of, and responsive to, local market conditions. 08/09

In the Ukraine the second phase development of ITE’ s preferred
venue, IEC, was completed in January 2006 allowing the newly
acquired AgriHort event to expand into the new space. The
2006 edition of the event was 9,500m
2
, significantly larger
than the 2005 pre-acquisition edition. The construction event,
KievBuild, also benefited from the new space and reported
strong growth of 47% over last year’ s show to 7,750m
2
. The
Ukraine International T ravel and T ourism event reported 
growth of 20% in revenue and profit in selling 5,100m
2
(2005:
4,200m
2
). A strong overall result from the Ukrainian business
was achieved in delivering 20% ‘like for like’ growth in revenues
over the year .
In T urkey our wholly owned business delivered its best
contribution to date. The construction plant and machinery
exhibition, Ankomak was held, for the first time since 2003;
this event is over 40,000m
2
but at relatively low yields. The
T urkish business saw good growth in its other exhibitions and
in its outbound sales activity into ITE events across the regions.
Our 50% owned associate business reported total sales of
200,000m
2
and made a contribution to ITE Group’ s profits after
tax of £0.6 million. The furniture, house textiles and machinery
tools events all grew well but the decline in the textile fabric
exhibition, as previously advised, held back the overall result.

The principal businesses carried out in the UK are the Spring
and Autumn Fashion events, MODA, held at the NEC Birmingham
and the related magazine publishing business. During the year
the recently acquired Footwear UK events were integrated into
the MODA UK business and operational structures. The core 
UK fashion events having enjoyed a successful February show ,
recorded a decline in demand in the Menswear section of its
August event, reflecting seasonal patterns as well as circumstances
in the UK retail market. The shortfall was more than compensated
for by strong growth in the Footwear event over its pre-acquisition
size. Magazine publishing also recorded a good result with revenues
up 7% over the prior year on its portfolio of titles. 
This ITE business unit has established a successful model of
complementing magazine advertising and exhibition participation.
The business has been quick to adapt to industry trends and 
to grow and consolidate exhibition and magazine revenue. 
36 staff are employed in the North England office running 
the exhibition and magazine business. 
Of the total staff employed in Western Europe and the UK, 
28 are based in Germany contributing specialist sales onto
Russia and the CIS. The London office of ITE employs 91 staff
split evenly between sales teams and corporate ‘head office’. 
Rest of the World 
Offices: Algeria (Algiers), China (Beijing)
The principal event running in Africa this year was in Algeria
where we continued our relationship with U.N.C.T .A.D.
Following on from our initial success we opened a small office
in Algiers and entered into a joint venture with Sonatrach to
organise the national oil & gas exhibition and conference in
Oran in November 2006.
ITE has recently opened a small sales office in Beijing with 
a view to developing a greater participation from Chinese
exhibitors into ITE’ s Russian and CIS events. Initial successes
have been encouraging.

ITE’ s strategy of focussing on achieving maximum organic
revenue growth by leveraging its market leading position in
markets where we have expertise advantage has yielded
another strong set of results.
The growing strength and stability of the Russian and the CIS
economies, underpin the growth of domestic and international
trade business conducted within these regions. International
and local businesses are increasingly looking to exhibit their
goods and services at the exhibitions which ITE owns. Growth
in the exhibition business has been constrained until recently ,
by the lack of suitable international quality exhibition space. In
2006 the completion of 75,000m
2
of new venue space across
Moscow , Kazakhstan and Ukraine will help support growth of
our exhibition portfolio into 2007 and beyond. We anticipate
further additional space will become available for use in 2007
in Moscow and Ukraine. ITE has, in its markets, a series of
recognised market leading brands across a number of
international exhibition sectors. The Group’ s well established
office and infrastructure network throughout the region means
that it is well placed to fully participate in the anticipated
growth of the exhibition business. 
The new financial year has started well with trading in line with
the Board’ s expectations. As of 1 December 2006 advance sales
for the 2007 financial year were £54 million (2005: £43 million)
an increase in excess of 10% on the comparable forward sales
position this time last year . The Board remains confident of the
prospect for the current financial year .

Strong brands in key sectors
Brand strength at group and event level is a growing 
asset for ITE. This strength is built on a sustained 
record of presenting high quality events which meet 
customer expectations.
Acknowledged and growing brand recognition combined
with positive brand values is helping ITE to realise the true
potential of its leading exhibitions and conferences and
leverage its leading brands to quickly develop new events
across the Group’ s sectors and territories.
ITE events serve many key industries such as oil & gas,
food & drink, construction & interiors, motor & transport,
travel & leisure, medical & healthcare and IT & telecoms.
Many of these sectors are critical to the continued
development of the domestic economies where 
ITE operates. 
Consequently , ITE occupies a favourable position
organising market leading events in key industry 
sectors with significant long term prospects.

new markets and events, which is important for the growth
and future of these events.
Acquisitions
ITE pursues potential acquisitions that have a fit with either
market or geographic sector , if not both. Each acquisition must
meet minimum return on a range of investment criteria including
Internal rates of return and payback. ITE pursues opportunities
where the Group can add value through its existing infrastructure
and skills, and so increase profits post acquisition. In 2006 ITE
acquired a Gift & Décor event in Ukraine and two events in
Moscow , Expoclean and Bytchimexpo (which will both make 
their first contribution in the financial year 2007). The Gift 
& Décor events (bi-annual) performed consistently with their 
pre-acquisition results, but have potential for good growth in 
the future.
ITE’ s acquisitions in the prior year are showing strong results 
with the Caspian Oil & Gas event growing revenues by 14% in 
its second year with ITE. The Footwear UK events increased
revenues by over 10% and has strengthened the overall MODA
brand and offering. Kiev AgriHort in Ukraine also increased its
volume sales significantly . In all three of these acquisitions 
ITE was able to increase profitability by leveraging its existing
relationships with service and venue suppliers and 
reducing costs.

In Ukraine ITE’ s office organises a portfolio of 23 events. 
The exhibitions include leading events in the construction,
agriculture and travel sectors. The Ukraine business has 
grown significantly in recent years, from 14,000m

to 43,000m

ITE has a growing operation in Istanbul, T urkey .
In the UK ITE owns the leading fashion exhibition, covering

Under ITE’ s stewardship this event, which takes place twice a

to over 12,000m

over a five
year period.
Organic growth
In the last year the Group launched 16 new events, generating
a profit of £0.5 million. Notable new launches in 2006 were
‘KazBuild Spring’ in Kazakhstan which offered an alternative
Spring dateline to the established September event;
‘Subcontracting’ a new event launched in St Petersburg;
Babytime – a consumer exhibition targeting the infant and 
baby equipment buyer in Moscow , and after the year-end 
Select T ravel, an experience based travel exhibition in Moscow . 
This activity complements ITE’ s established events and is driven
by its strong local knowledge and presence, from a network 
of offices in touch with local developments and opportunities. 
Out of the portfolio of 146 events in 2006 over 50 have been
launched by ITE in the last five years. 
Every new launch is planned to break even in its first year 
of operation, with profit growth being established over
subsequent events. Whilst new launches typically have lower
profits and gross margins initially , this strategy helps renew 
the event portfolio in response to changes in market demand
and is a proven and cost effective way of developing the

ITE is committed to maximising shareholder return and is a
leading performer in its sector . ITE’ s progressive dividend policy
has resulted in total dividends in 2006 of 3.5 pence per share,
up more than 25% over 2005 (2.75p). Since 2002 the dividend
has increased on a compound basis by more than 20% per 
year . Set out below is a graph showing total cash returned to
shareholders (including the share buyback in August 2005)
against the post tax profits earned by ITE over the last five years.
Risks and uncertainties
Political uncertainty and regulatory risk
The Group’ s business is principally carried out in Russia and the
CIS. Changes in law or the regulatory environment could have
an effect on some or all of the exhibitions of the Group. ITE has
reduced the risk by establishing its business as independent
Russian and CIS companies fully contributing to the local
economy . A regulatory change effecting the trading prospects
of a particular sector could effect short term prospects, but ITE’ s
diversity of businesses across sectors and geography provides
protection for the longer term prospects of the Group.
Commercial relationships
The Group has key commercial relationships with venues
which secure the Group’ s rights to run its exhibitions in the
future. These key relationships are regularly reviewed and 
the Group seeks to maintain its exhibition rights for at least
three years forward for significant exhibitions.
Venue availability
Damage or unavailability of a particular venue could impact the
Group’ s short term trading position. Accordingly the Group
carries business interruption insurance policies which protect
profits against such an event in the short term.
Competitor risk
Competition has existed in ITE’ s markets for some years. 
ITE faces competitive pressures on a market by market basis.
Recent increases in venue space available in Moscow has
increased the potential for new market entrants in the Moscow
exhibition business. In Central Asia, ITE has a strong position in
all its markets as the largest international organiser . In Kyiv ,
Ukraine, there are a number of exhibition venues and directly
competitive events exist in most of ITE’ s favoured sectors. 
In all of its overseas markets ITE has a strong position as an
international organiser achieved through effective use of its
international sales network and its established brands for
major events. A single exhibition or sector in a market could
have its prospects curtailed by a strong competitor launch;
however the breadth of ITE’ s portfolio of events with its
geographic and sector diversity reduce the risk of a 
competitive threat to the Group’ s overall business.
Foreign currency
ITE’ s business is priced in Euros, Dollars and Sterling but
collected in a range of currencies, including the ‘soft’ currencies
of the regions in which it operates. The Group maintains 
short term hedging and forward option positions to protect
foreseeable ‘hard’ currency receipts. Significant cash balances
held in Russian and CIS trading companies are translated into
Euro, Sterling or dollar deposits which are held in approved
banks until remitted to the UK.
People
ITE’ s employees have longstanding relationships with customers
and unique knowledge of their exhibitions business. Loss of 
key staff to a competitive event could impact the short term
prospects of a specific event or sector . ITE has sought to build
loyalty in its staff well by ensuring remuneration is competitive
and through a wide distribution of the Group’ s long term
incentive plans. ITE has a good record to date of retaining its 
key staff.

International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’)
The 2006 Financial Statements are reported under IFRS. 
The comparative figures for 2005 have been re-stated onto 
a consistent basis as required. A full statement reconciling 
the reported 2005 Financial Statements to the re-stated 2005
Financial Statements is available on the Company’ s website:
www.ite-exhibitions.com.
Revenue and gross profit 
A detailed analysis of the main changes in revenues and gross
profits of the business is set out in the Chief Executive’ s review
of the business, on pages 4 to 9.
Other operating income
Other operating income represents rental income earned from
subletting surplus office space, principally at ITE’ s London offices.
Finance income 
Finance income for the year was £1.4 million (2005: £2.1
million). This includes £0.4 million of ‘notional interest’ imputed
in applying IFRS fair value principles to certain venue loans. A
further amount of £0.05 million of ‘notional interest’ remains to
be credited to the income statement in the next financial year .
The interest from bank deposits reduced to £0.8 million in the
year (2005: £2.0 million) following ITE’ s £30 million buyback 
of its own shares in August 2005. The Group held average 
net cash balances of £14.8 million through the year (2005: 
£32.9 million).
Finance costs
Finance costs of £0.6 million (2005: £0.6 million) represent the
interest cost of the Group’ s borrowings in Euro and US Dollar .
The Group enters into these borrowing arrangements as part 
of its currency hedging activity . At 30 September 2006 the
Group had borrowings of c13.0 million, and US$3.7 million.
Tax charge
The tax charge of £7.4 million represents 30% of profit before
tax. In this financial year tax losses of c7 million which the
Group had previously treated as being available to offset future
tax charges, were disallowed by the Dutch tax authority ,
leading to an increase in the deferred tax liability in the period.
There has been a reduction in the Group’ s overall level of tax
provisions. The Group anticipates that for the next 
year the tax rate will be in line with the UK Corporation tax 
rate of 30%, whereby the lower tax rates typically experienced
in our major overseas markets are offset by withholding tax
charges on dividends back to the UK.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share increased to 6.9p (2005: 6.7p). Fully
diluted earnings per share increased to 6.7p from 6.6p in the
prior year .
The Group achieved Headline diluted earnings per share 
of 7.0p per share compared with 6.6p for the year to 
30 September 2005. Headline diluted earnings per share is
based upon profit for the financial year before amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets and any profits or losses on
disposal of Group undertakings.
Dividends
The Group has recommended a final dividend of 2.5p 
for 2006, to bring the total dividend for the year to 3.5p 
(2005: 2.75p).
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations in the year was £34.2 million
(2005: £29.4 million). The principal applications of cash were 
of £7.4 million applied to venue loans and advances (2005: 
net receipt £0.4 million); £9.1 million was paid in tax; (2005:
£8.4 million); £3.0 million was applied to acquisitions in the
year (2005:£5.8 million) and £7.1 million was distributed 
as dividends (2005: £7.1 million). The net increase in cash
balances at 30 September 2006 was £8.1 million.
Business and financial review – Group financial review
continued 14/15
ITE Group plc 
Annual Report 2006
Net cash at 30 September 2006 was £21.2 million (2005: £13.0
million). Of the £21.2 million of cash £4.5 million was held in a
trust account, which will be released as certain creditors are paid
in full. At 30 September 2006 £0.5 million of the cash in trust
was expected to be released within one year .
Acquisitions & disposals
On 1 March 2006 ITE acquired the Kiev Gift & Décor exhibition
from Expo UA for consideration of £0.4 million. The event is
held in the Spring and Autumn each year .
On 29 June 2006 ITE acquired the Expoclean and Bytchimexpo
exhibitions in Moscow from PIK Maxima for a consideration of
£1.8 million. Both events will be held by ITE for the first time in
the year ending 30 September 2007.
On 20 September 2006, ITE bought the remaining 10% 
minority shareholding in ITE Moda Limited for consideration 
of £1.0 million. ITE now owns 100% of the Moda fashion and
publishing business. 
On 29 September 2006 ITE disposed of a subsidiary in
Azerbaijan, Caspian Freight Services LLC, for £0.2 million to
Meritex International Freight Services Limited. The company
provided freight services to the Group’ s exhibitions in
Azerbaijan. The consideration will be received over the 
12 months ending 30 September 2007.
The final deferred receipts of £0.1 million from the sale of ITE’ s
interests in ACG have been received in the year . No further
amounts remain outstanding.

Net assets increased to £43.6 million. The main changes are in

Investment and capital expenditure
The Group’ s capital expenditure on plant and equipment for 
the year was £0.4 million (2005: £0.4 million) and included
exhibition equipment, computer equipment and 
associated software. 
The Group funds the development of venues and facilities
where improved facilities will enhance the prospects and
profitability of our organising business. The funding can take
the form of a prepayment of future venue fees (‘advance
payments’), or a loan which can be repaid by cash or by offset 
against future venue fees (‘venue loan’). Generally the funding
brings rights over future venue use and advantageous pricing
arrangements. Venue loans and advance payments are included
under non-current and current assets in the balance sheet. 16/17

Capital
Following the cancellation of the share premium account 
and buy back and cancellation of its own shares last year , 
the Company has a Share Premium account of £698,000 
as at 30 September 2006. During the year the Company 
has purchased 975,833 shares to be held in T reasury . The
Company has also issued 1,013,194 ordinary shares of 1p 
in the year . Of the total new issues 983,000 were pursuant 
to the exercise of options and yielded aggregate consideration
of £0.6 million. The remaining shares were issued as part of
Directors’ remuneration.
The Employees Share Option T rust (‘ESOT’) held 9,372,100
(3.6%) of the Company’ s issued share capital at the year end
(2005: 11,127,000; 4.3%).
Post balance sheet events
There have been no significant post balance sheet events. 
Financial risk
The main financial risk facing the Group is foreign currency
risk. The Board has reviewed and agreed policies to manage
financial risk as follows:
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange 
rates against Sterling for both trading transactions and for the
translation of net assets and the profits and loss accounts of
overseas operations. The principal exposure is to the Euro and
Dollar exchange rates which form the basis of invoicing for our
international customers. During the year the Group experienced
net foreign exchange losses of £0.2 million (2005: £0.7 million).
The exchange rate for the Euro at 30 September 2006 was c1.48:
£1 (30 September 2005: c1.46:£1); the exchange rate for the US
Dollar at the year end was $1.88:£1 (30 September 2005:
$1.76:£1).
The bulk of the Group’ s business is in emerging and developing
markets and to minimise the currency risk, the Group prices
predominantly in Euros and US Dollars. A proportion of total
invoicing amount is settled in local currency equivalent,
translated at prevailing rates at the date of settling invoices. 
In 2006 64% of the Group’ s sales were priced in Euros and 22% 
in US Dollars. Overall 61% of the Group’ s cash receipts in financial
year ending 30 September 2006 were in hard currency 
and 39% was in various local currencies. The Group has a 
large proportion of its revenues and costs denominated in 
non-Sterling currencies. Sterling costs exceed Sterling revenues
due to the level of UK based costs – in particular London sales
and head office costs. 
The Group uses derivative instruments and currency
borrowings to protect itself against the effect of currency
fluctuations on its balance sheet. The Group’ s policy on
derivative instruments is that:
• it will only hedge up to 80% of the value of anticipated 
cash flows; and
• it will not enter into derivative transactions more than 
18 months ahead.
Business and financial review – Group financial review
continued 16/17
ITE Group plc 
Annual Report 2006
At 30 September 2006 the Group had options to sell c15 million
spread over the 12 months to 30 September 2007 at a rate of
c1.43:£1 (the ‘Option Rate’). Were the exchange rate for the 
Euro to fall below c1.38:£1 then the Group would be obliged 
to sell Euros at the Option Rate.
Over the course of the year the Group has entered into currency
borrowing arrangements to minimise it’ s exposure to foreign
exchange risk. The currency borrowings can be offset against
the matching Sterling deposits. At 30 September 2006 the
Group had borrowings of c13.0 million, and US$3.7 million. 
The cash balance of £21.2 million at 30 September 2006 is
presented net of these borrowings.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through cash holdings 
and debt facilities. The objective of the Group is to maximise
investment income and minimise interest costs bearing in 
mind its liquidity requirements. 
For short term debt, such as overdraft facilities or debt with a
term of less than six months, fixed or floating rates of interest
are used. For debt with a term of greater than six months, it is
policy that at least 75% must have fixed rates of interest so as
to minimise the Group exposure to interest rate movements. 
It is Group policy that surplus cash is not invested in instruments
that would put the capital value at risk. All invested funds have a
determinable rate of interest.
Liquidity risk
The Group policy is to ensure continuity of funding for
operational needs through cash deposits and debt facilities 
as appropriate. The key requirement for the business is to
maintain flexibility to allow the Group to take advantage of
opportunities that could arise over the short term. The needs 
of the business are determined on a rolling cash flow forecast
basis, covering weekly , monthly and twelve monthly
requirements. Short term flexibility is maintained by holding
cash in current accounts and high liquidity money market
funds. The Group has overdraft facilities in place both to permit
currency borrowing as part of its foreign exchange management
and to allow flexibility in where it holds its cash balances.
Going concern
After considering the current financial projections for the
Group, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Company has adequate resources to continue its operations 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.

purchases of up to 25,989,182 of the Company’ s Ordinary Shares at a price between 1p (exclusive of expenses) and 105% of the
average middle market price of a share for the five business days immediately preceding the date on which the share is purchased. 
Since that date the Company has purchased 975,833 of its own shares which are held in treasury . The shares have a nominal
value of £9,758.33p representing 0.4% of the issued share capital and were purchased for a consideration of £1.1m. The reason
for the purchase was to reduce surplus cash balances and enhance earnings per share. The Company has a remaining authority
to purchase a further 25,013,349 of its own shares which will expire at the next annual general meeting on 22 February 2007.
Donations
The Group made charitable donations of £3,000 (2005: £5,000) during the year . No political donations were made.
Employees
The Group’ s human resources strategy is to attract and retain talented, high calibre employees focused on achieving excellent
results. Remuneration policy is designed to achieve this aim.
It is the Group’ s policy to consider fully applications for employment by disabled persons, bearing in mind the aptitude of the
applicant concerned. In the event of a member of staff becoming disabled, every effort would be made to ensure their continued
employment and progression in the Group. It is Group policy that training, career development and promotion of disabled
employees match that of other employees as far as possible. 
The Group places great importance in the development of its staff to support the business in meeting its objectives. This is
reflected in the training initiatives in place for staff, both internally and externally . The Group keeps employees informed on
matters effecting them and on matters effecting the Group’ s performance through regular newsletters and through meetings,
both formal and informal. Employees are able and are encouraged to move around the Group in order to experience the
business environment in other offices. The Group actively encourages the participation of employees in activities of offices other
than their own. The Group distributes long term incentives widely to staff in all offices. At 2006 approximately 60% of staff held
long term incentives in some form. As a result the, the Group’ s employees identify strongly with ITE’ s overall objectives.  22/23

Supplier payment policy
The Company’ s policy , which is also applied to the Group, is to agree payment terms with suppliers when entering into each
transaction to ensure that suppliers are made aware of the terms of payment and to abide by the terms of payment. The Company
has no trade creditors.
Corporate social responsibility
Social interaction
The Board of the Company is aware of both the benefits to its business of engaging with its various constituencies in a socially
responsible manner and the risks of failing to do so. As an operator of internationally focused businesses in emerging markets
the Company ensures that it is culturally sensitive in its dealings with the local community and that its employment and
development policies are non discriminatory and encourage the employment of local nationals at all levels in the Company .
Those employees are encouraged to participate in and support their respective communities.
The Company has a policy of encouraging employees, and especially those from the locations in emerging markets, to move
around the offices of the Group thus providing development opportunities for all staff. In addition, employees are assisted in 
their career development through an annual appraisal scheme. All staff are eligible for issues of share options or awards under
the Employee’ s Performance Share Plan as the Board feels that it is important for them to take an active part in the success of 
the Company .
Ethics
The Company actively promotes integrity in its dealings with its employees, customers and suppliers and with the authorities of
the countries in which it operates and recognises that a reputation is a valuable and fragile asset gained over a substantial period.
The leadership position of its exhibitions and the continued growth of its core shows is evidence of the success of its practices.
The Company maintains high ethical standards in carrying out its business activities and has clear guidelines for dealing with
gifts, hospitality , corruption, fraud and the use of inside information.
Environment
As a media services company , the Group acknowledges that its business has an impact on the environment, albeit relatively
minor . The Company does not manufacture or sell any tangible products. The Company actively controls its energy costs and 
the office and other waste generated by its business.
As a media services business the Group’ s activities do not directly effect the environment through emissions to air , water or land.
The Group’ s activities, mostly through its customers and suppliers have an impact on waste and natural resources usage through
materials used in assembling exhibition stands and participating in the exhibition. Presently , practice in controlling waste at
different exhibitions centres varies widely through the different regions in which the Group operates. 
Annual General Meeting
Shareholders will see from the Notice of the Annual General Meeting on pages 74 to 75 that they are to consider and, if thought
fit, to pass three resolutions as special business. These resolutions have become routine business at the annual general meeting
of most public companies. The resolutions relate to:
• renewal of the authority for the Directors to allot relevant securities
• renewal of the powers of the Directors to allot equity securities as if pre-emption rights did not apply
• renewal of the authority for the Company to purchase certain of its own shares, and to hold them as treasury shares 22/23

Annual Report 2006
Auditors
The Directors will place a resolution before the Annual General Meeting to reappoint Deloitte & T ouche LLP as auditors for the
ensuing year .
In the case of each of the persons who are directors of the Company at the date when this report was approved:
• so far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined in the Companies Act 1985) of which
the Company’ s auditors are unaware; and
• each of the directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant
audit information (as defined) and to establish that the company’ s auditors are aware of that information.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for the Group financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements. The Directors are required to prepare
financial statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and have chosen to
prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). 
In the case of UK GAAP company financial statements, the Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each
financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for
that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the financial statements. 
In the case of IFRS financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for
each financial year the Group’ s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation
of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets,
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’ s ‘Framework for the preparation and
Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all
applicable International Financial Reporting Standards. Directors are also required to: 
• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards 
is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s
financial position and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company , for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a Directors’ report and Directors’ remuneration report which comply with
the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The report of the Directors has been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:

Report on corporate governance 
Statement of compliance with the revised Combined Code on corporate governance
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the Combined Code.
During the financial year the Company complied in all material respects with the provisions set out in section 1 of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code (‘Combined Code’) insofar as it applies to the Company .
Statement about applying the Principles of Good Governance
The Company has applied the principles of good corporate governance as set out in the Combined Code. The explanation of how
the principles have been applied is set out below and in connection with Directors’ remuneration, in the Report on remuneration. 
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors meets not less than seven times a year . The Board considers a range of matters for its approval, including
setting Group strategy , acquisition policy , the budgets, major capital expenditure and material contracts. The Board monitors the
performance of the businesses against appropriate forecasts and key performance indicators. The Board is supplied with financial
and operational information on a timely basis to enable it to discharge its duties and carry out its responsibilities. All Directors
have access to the Company Secretary and there is a procedure to enable them to take additional independent professional
advice at the expense of the Company . The Senior Independent non-executive Director is Sir Jeremy Hanley .
In addition to the Chairman the Board comprised two or three non-executive Directors and four executive Directors during 
the year . The Board currently has four non-executive Directors (including the Chairman) and three executive Directors which 
it considers to be an appropriate balance of executive and non-executive Directors. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive 
are separate, and each has defined roles and responsibilities approved by the Board.
The Nomination Committee considers all appointments made to the Board. The only appointment in the year was Malcolm Wall
on 4 May 2006, for an initial period of three years subject to one month’ s notice by either party . The full terms and conditions 
of the appointment are available for inspection at the Company’ s registered office and will be available for review before the
Annual General Meeting. The Nomination Committee and Chief Executive agreed the specifications for the position and an
external search company was appointed to provide a shortlist of candidates. The candidates were all interviewed by the
Chairman and the Chief Executive and the recommended candidate was seen by all members of the Nomination Committee, 
who then collectively recommended his appointment to the Board.
The Directors’ diversity of experience and knowledge of the markets in which ITE operates are key to the development of a robust
strategy for the Group and to its execution. The non-executive Directors contribute an independent and objective view to the
management of the Company and play a full and active part in the various Board committees. The names and biographies of the
Directors are on pages 18 and 19.
The Board considers Iain Paterson, Michael Hartley , Sir Jeremy Hanley and Malcolm Wall to be independent. Until his resignation 
in January 2006, Marco Sodi had been appointed by Veronis Suhler Stevenson pursuant to the terms of its subscription agreement,
who were a major shareholder of the Company . For his time in office the Board did not consider that Mr Sodi was independent 
in all matters but did consider that his independent judgment as a Board member and his participation on the Nomination
Committee was not affected by his relationship with Veronis Suhler Stevenson. 
Any Directors appointed since the last General Meeting are required to offer themselves for re-election at the first available annual
general meeting. In accordance with the Articles of the Company all Directors are required to stand for re-election at least every
three years. 
The non-executive Directors met formally without the executives present twice during the year . On one of those occasions the
non-executives carried out a formal evaluation of the Board and of its Committees. In addition, the Chairman met individually
with each of the directors. The Chairman’ s performance was evaluated by the Senior Independent Director . A number of matters
were discussed at these meetings which served to enhance further the satisfactory performance of the Board. 24/25

Communication with shareholders
The Board considers communication with all shareholders to be extremely important. Shareholders are provided with full year
and interim accounts to help them keep up to date with the performance of the Group and are given the opportunity to ask
questions directly of the Board at the Annual General Meeting. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees are available at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions. The Chairman and the Senior Independent Director
are generally available to discuss shareholders’ concerns as and when required. The Group’ s website (www .ite-exhibitions.com) 
is regularly updated with copies of all Group press releases and presentations given to shareholders.
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional shareholders 
by making strategic presentations to institutional investors every six months following the publication of the half year and 
annual results, by meeting shareholders to discuss long-term issues and obtain their feedback and by communicating regularly
throughout the year . 
Board Committees
The Board has established three committees all of which have written terms of reference. The terms of reference for the
committees are available on the Company’ s website at www .ite-exhibitions.com.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises only non-executive Directors. The Committee is chaired by Sir Jeremy Hanley whom the Board
considers has appropriate financial expertise to fulfil this role. The other members are Michael Hartley and Malcolm Wall. The
meetings are also attended by the Chairman, the Finance Director , the deputy Finance Director and the auditors together with any
other member of staff considered necessary by the Committee to complete its work. The Committee meets at least four times a
year and at the end of each meeting, meets with the auditors without any executives or other members of staff present to discuss
matters relating to its remit and any issues arising.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing accounting procedures and the internal control environment. The Committee 
also reviews announcements of the Company’ s results and monitors compliance with accounting standards and Company law . 
In addition the Committee considers the appointment of the Auditors, the scope of the audit and any issues arising, their fees 
and the nature, extent and costs of any non audit services provided by them. The Committee has access to any employee and 
is able to obtain external advice on any matter as required. The auditors are able to request additional meetings at any time. 
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises only non-executive Directors. The Committee, which is chaired by Michael Hartley ,
meets at least three times a year . The other members are Iain Paterson, Sir Jeremy Hanley and Malcolm Wall. The meetings 
are attended by the Chief Executive Officer and external advisers as appropriate. 
Further information about the Committee is set out in the Report on remuneration on page 27. 26/27

The Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises the non-executive Directors Iain Paterson, Sir Jeremy Hanley , Michael Hartley and 
Malcolm Wall and, up until his resignation on 23 January , Marco Sodi. The Committee, which is chaired by Iain Paterson, 
is responsible, if requested by the Board, for nominating candidates to the whole Board for approval, recommending the 
re-appointment or continuation in office of any Director , and for considering and making recommendations to the Board 
on its composition and balance.
The Company Secretary is secretary to each of the above Committees.
Independence of external auditors
The Audit Committee has established clear guidelines concerning the levels of discretionary non-audit fees it considers are
appropriate to safeguard the independence of the auditors. The Committee has implemented review and approval processes
relating to the provision of non-audit services by the auditors, and undertakes an annual assessment of the auditors’ independence 
and effectiveness. The Audit Committee is satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure auditor independence.
Whistle blowing arrangements
The Company has a set policy to enable and encourage staff to report in confidence any possible improprieties in matters 
of financial reporting or otherwise. The procedure for reporting any such matter has been communicated to all staff. 
Internal audit function
The Company does not currently have an internal audit function. The Audit Committee annually considers whether an internal
audit function is appropriate and makes an appropriate recommendation to the Board. The central finance function is responsible
for checking, monitoring and reporting on the control environment in the Group’ s accounting centres. The Committee considers
that at present the central finance function has sufficient independence to report objectively on the control environment in the
accounting centres. The Board has concluded that an internal audit function is not currently required. The Audit Committee will
continue to monitor this matter and make appropriate recommendations to the Board.
Review of Internal controls and of risk management process
The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management to provide them with reasonable assurance
regarding effective and efficient operations, internal control and compliance with laws and regulations.
A system of internal controls has been established to allow the Board, in conjunction with management, to identify , evaluate 
and manage the significant risks faced by the Company on an on-going and pro-active basis. The system also seeks to monitor
the Company’ s overall financial, operational and compliance positions and to help safeguard shareholders investments and to
protect the Company’ s assets. The Board is responsible for this process and for ensuring that it remains effective and, in order 
to facilitate it, it has established a single organisational structure with clearly drawn lines of accountability , appropriate
delegation of authority and open lines of communication. 
The Company has a comprehensive system of financial reporting. There is a thorough budgeting system for all lines of income
and expenditure, with an annual budget approved by the Board. Historical financial performance and revised forecasts for the 
full year are reported against budget and considered by the Board at each meeting. The Board pays particular attention to those
matters which, by their nature, expose the Company to significant risks and uncertainties, including exchange rates which can 
be subject to considerable volatility and can have a material impact on the Company’ s operating results.
The Company has established procedures to deal with authorisations for expenditure. The Board is committed to ensuring 
that the Company’ s data and infrastructure, and its information technology systems, are as secure as is reasonably practicable.
Security controls and procedures are in place to prevent unauthorised access to the Company’ s premises. Hardware and software
controls have also been instigated to prevent unauthorised access to the Company’ s computer system and network. Regular
back-ups of electronic information are taken with copies being stored offsite.
This system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
This system of internal control has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of approval. It is reviewed regularly 
by the Board and complies with the T urnbull guidance. The Board has performed a specific assessment of internal controls 
for the purpose of this Annual Report. The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities. 26/27

Report on remuneration
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Michael Hartley (Chairman), Sir Jeremy Hanley , Iain Paterson and Malcolm
Wall. All the members are non-executive Directors. The Board considers Michael Hartley , Sir Jeremy Hanley and Malcolm Wall 
to be independent Directors.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for:
• recommending to the Board the remuneration and terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman, executive Directors
and key members of senior management; 
• measuring subsequent performance as a prelude to determining the executive Directors’ and key managers’ total
remuneration on behalf of the whole Board; and
• granting awards under the ITE Group’ s Performance Share Plans and options under the various ITE Group Share Option
Schemes detailed below . 
During the year the Committee consulted with New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to advise on executive remuneration and the
operation of the various ITE group share option schemes. New Bridge Street Consultants LLP have provided no other advice to 
the Company , having been appointed by the Committee. 
Remuneration policy 
The Company’ s principal remuneration policy aim is to ensure that compensation offered is appropriate to attract, retain 
and motivate executive Directors and staff with the ability and experience to deliver the Company’ s strategy and grow the
business, having regard to the challenging economic conditions and competition for such people in the markets in which 
the Company operates. 
In formulating its policies the Committee has regard to and balances the following factors:
a) the remuneration packages offered to executives in companies competing in the same markets as the Company;
b) the remuneration practice in the markets in which the executive is principally based;
c) the need to align the interests of the executive with those of the shareholders;
d) the performance of the individual executive and of the Company as a whole; and
e) any amounts payable to executives in respect of services performed for the Associates of the Company .
The remuneration packages of the executives comprise base salary and benefits, a performance related bonus (save for Ceyda
Erem) and longer term share-based incentive arrangements. A significant proportion of executive Directors’ remuneration is
performance-related. 
The fees of the non-executive Directors are proposed by the Chief Executive and approved by the Board, taking account 
of practice adopted in other companies and the time commitment required. The fees of the Chairman are determined by the
Committee taking account of the role and the time commitment required. The Chairman does not take part in those discussions.
Policy criteria for various components 
Base salary 
Base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee. Base salary levels are set by the Committee taking into account each
executive Director’ s role, experience, performance and the markets in which they perform their duties. For the year commencing
1 October 2006 the base salaries for Ian T omkins and Russell T aylor , and the consultancy remuneration for Edward Strachan 
were set following a benchmarking exercise. Comparators were a ‘Sector Group’ drawn from the FTSE All-Share Media sector 
with market capitalisations between half to double that of ITE (median £223m); and a ‘General Group’ drawn from the FTSE 
All-Share who share the following characteristics: Market capitalisation between £150m and £600m (median £241m); turnover
up to £200m (median £111m); and at least 50% of turnover generated outside the UK (median 69%). Details of the executive
Directors’ base salaries for the year commencing 1 October 2006 are set out under ‘Directors’ service contracts’. 
The Committee have revised the Group’ s policy on additional fees earned by executive Directors from associate companies, 
and from 1 October 2006 any such fees will be for the benefit of the Company .  28/29

agreement with Kyzyl T an Consultants Limited (‘Kyzyl T an’) is on a similar basis to the Executive Bonus Plan, and for the financial year
commencing on 1 October 2006 is capped at 85% of the Kyzyl T an consultancy fee and his remuneration as a Director . In addition
to this annual bonus Edward Strachan (through his contract with Kyzyl T an) is entitled to a bonus based upon the profitability 
of certain events in the financial years commencing 1 October 2005 and 2006. This bonus scheme which was established in
Kyzyl T an’ s preceding consultancy agreement, will be in its last year of operation for the year ending 30 September 2007 and will
not be effective thereafter . Ceyda Erem did not participate in an annual bonus scheme as her remuneration (other than her Board
fees of £15,000 per annum) was paid by ITE’ s 50% owned associate company , and her remuneration package was agreed by 
its board of directors in accordance with the terms of the shareholders’ agreement, to which ITE is party . 
The bonus caps for the year commencing on 1 October 2006 are unchanged from the caps that applied previously . In the
financial year ending 30 September 2006, maximum bonus was achieved by Ian T omkins, Russell T aylor and Edward Strachan
under the Executive Bonus Plan.
The Executive Bonus Plan applying to Ian T omkins, Russell T aylor and Edward Strachan (through Kyzyl T an) for the 2006-07
financial year is based upon achievement of a sliding scale of compound growth targets based upon Headline profits before 
tax (as it was last year). No bonus is payable unless the minimum growth target is achieved. 
Long term incentives 
The Company has in the past operated Performance Share Plans and Share Option Schemes. It is the Committee’ s present
intention to issue only Performance Share Plan awards in the future and to restrict the use of options except where exceptional
circumstances merit their use.
The Committee will regularly review the Company’ s share-based long-term incentive policy in light of market practice, best
practice and the Company’ s particular circumstances.
Performance Share Plans
The Company operates the ITE Group plc Employees Performance Share Plan 2004 and the ITE Group plc Key Contractors’
Performance Share Plan 2004. Awards can be made to executives and senior management over shares worth up to 100% of base
salary each year , and under the latter scheme to key individuals who are not technically Group employees. There is no intention
to issue new awards to executive Directors in the financial year commencing 1 October 2006. 
The performance targets set for awards to be made in the financial year commencing 1 October 2006 are set out below . 
Aggregate Headline EPS for the financial years 
ending 30 September 2007, 2008 and 2009 Percentage of award that vests
Below 22.7p Nil
22.7p 30% 
22.7p – 25.3p Between 30% and 100%
These performance conditions have been chosen by the Committee to take account of the Company’ s biennial business cycle 
and to incentivise management to deliver sustained EPS performance over the relevant three year period. The Committee will, 
for the purposes of third party verification, confirm the extent to which these targets are met with external advisers. For the
purposes of these targets, the Company’ s aggregate fully diluted Headline EPS will be used (awards granted in 2004 and 2005
used an ‘adjusted’ fully diluted Headline EPS which excluded the costs associated with awards made under the Plan and any 
other Share awards).
Executive Directors will be required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards
under the Plans, until they have built up a shareholding equal to 1 x salary . 28/29

Annual Report 2006
Share Option Plans
The Company has previously operated the following option schemes: the ITE Group 1998 Company Share Option Plan; the ITE
Group 1998 Discretionary Share Option Scheme; the ITE Group 1998 Key Contractor Share Option Scheme, and the ITE Group
Employee Share T rust Unapproved Share Option Scheme. 
Options can be granted under the ITE Group 1998 Company Share Option Plan and the ITE Group 1998 Discretionary Share
Option Scheme to ITE Group employees. Options can be granted under the ITE Group 1998 Key Contractor Share Option Scheme
to key individuals who are not Group employees. The ITE Group Employee Share T rust Unapproved Share Option Scheme can
grant options to ITE Group employees over shares held in the ITE Group Employees’ Share T rust (the ‘ESOT’).
As stated above, it is the Committee’ s present intention not to grant further options under these arrangements, save in
exceptional circumstances. The last grant of options made by the Company under these schemes was in January 2005. 
Pensions
The Company offers a stakeholder pension to its employees but currently makes no company contribution under this scheme. 
Directors’ service contracts 
Executive Directors
Ian T omkins (Chief Executive) and Russell T aylor (Finance Director) have UK contracts of employment which reflect market and
best practice for senior management serving in the UK and have no fixed term, save for the specific arrangements agreed with
Ian T omkins at the time of his appointment in relation to termination following a change of control. Notice periods and base
salary details for all directors are outlined in the tables set out below . There are no contributions to pension schemes or fringe
benefits such as company cars. 
Ian T omkins’ contract provides that if within 12 months of a change in control of the Company his contract is terminated without
payment of his contractual notice period then the Company shall pay him in lieu of such notice (less statutory deductions) an
amount equal to 95% of salary , contractual benefits and bonus that he would have received had he remained in employment
during the notice period. For the purposes of calculating the bonus amount it will be assumed that the maximum target has 
been achieved. 
In the event of early termination of an executive Director’ s contract it is the Committee’ s policy that (subject to the provisions 
of each contract) the amount of compensation (if any) paid to the executive Director will be determined by reference to the
relevant circumstances that prevail at the time. The Committee’ s objective will be to avoid rewarding poor performance.
Furthermore, the Committee will take account of the executive Director’ s duty to mitigate his loss.
Edward Strachan’ s remuneration as a Director from 1 October 2006 is £37,000. In addition Edward Strachan is remunerated 
as a consultant through the Company’ s agreement with Kyzyl T an. The agreement with Kyzyl T an is a 3 year contract to provide
the services of Edward Strachan to the Company from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2008. The base consultancy fee under
this agreement for the year commencing on 1 October 2006 is £303,000. Kyzyl T an is entitled to a bonus based upon the same
targets and criteria as Ian T omkins and Russell T aylor , which is capped at 85% of Kyzyl T an’ s base consultancy fee and Edward
Strachan’ s remuneration as a director i.e £340,000 for the year ending 30 September 2007. In addition for the financial years
ending 30 September 2006 and 2007 Kyzyl T an is entitled to a bonus based upon the profitability of certain events. Edward
Strachan is required to reside in the markets where his management responsibilities are based and Kyzyl T an is entitled 
to a living away from home allowance of $90,000 for its employee for each year of the contract, all of which may be payable 
in advance. 
The Remuneration Committee considers that Edward Strachan’ s unique knowledge and skills of managing the exhibition
business in the regions for which he is responsible together with the requirement for him to reside abroad warrants the Company
entering into a consultancy contract with a fixed term in excess of one year . The Committee firmly believes that this contract 
is in the best interest of the Company . The arrangement will be reviewed on its termination to ascertain whether this basic
approach remains, at that time, in the interests of shareholders.
Consistent with market practice, other than Edward Strachan’ s arrangements that have been established to take account of his
specific circumstances and criticality to the Company , there are no service contracts or other employment arrangements with any
of the executive Directors with fixed terms or notice periods in excess of one year or terms which would expose the Company to
compensation payments in excess of one year’ s total remuneration. 30/31

Independent auditors’ report
We have audited the group financial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 2006 which comprise 
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated
statement of recognised income and expenses and the related notes 1 to 28. These group financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration 
report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the individual company financial statements of ITE Group for the year ended 30 September 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a body , in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’ s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law , we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’ s members as a body , for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the group financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use in 
the European Union are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as 
having been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial statements give a true and fair view , in accordance with the
relevant financial reporting framework, and whether the group financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4
of the IAS Regulation. We report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the
group financial statements. We also report to you if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ transactions with the company and other members of the group is
not disclosed.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not complied with any of the four directors’ remuneration disclosure
requirements specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority . These comprise the amount of 
each element in the remuneration package and information on share options, details of long term incentive schemes, and money
purchase and defined benefit schemes. We give a statement, to the extent possible, of details of any non-compliance.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company’ s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003
FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority , and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the board’ s statement on internal control covers all risks and controls, or form an opinion
on the effectiveness of the group’ s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained in the annual report for the above year as described in the
contents section including the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report and we consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the group financial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the group financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the group financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’ s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 34/35
ITE Group plc

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information 
in the group financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the group financial statements give a true and fair view , in accordance with IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union, 
of the state of the group’ s affairs as at 30 September 2006 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited have been

Notes to the consolidated accounts
General information
ITE Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is given on page 76. 
The nature of the Group’ s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 1 and in the Business and financial review 
on pages 10 to 13.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out below .
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following key Standards and Interpretations which have not been
applied in these financial statements were in issue not yet effective:
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures; and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of this Standard in future periods will have no material impact on the financial
statements of the Group when the standard comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Basis of accounting
ITE Group plc is a UK listed company and together with its subsidiary operations is hereafter referred to as ‘the Company’. The
Group is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
as endorsed by the European Union for its accounting period beginning on 1 October 2005. As the Company is also required 
to publish comparative information for this period on a consistent basis its effective transition date to IFRS is 1 October 2004. 
A reconciliation between the financial statements reported for the year ended 30 September 2005 under UK GAAP and IFRS 
is set out in note 28. 
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses. These estimates
and associated assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time and are used 
to make judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to estimates and assumptions 
are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are made. 
The statements are presented in pounds sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, 
except for the revaluation of financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below . 
IFRS 1 exemptions
IFRS 1 (First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards) allows a number of exemptions from the full requirements
of IFRS for those companies adopting IFRS for the first time. ITE has taken advantage of certain of these exemptions as follows:
Business combinations
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 (Business combinations) retrospectively to business combinations prior to 1 October 2004.
Goodwill arising on consolidation prior to October 2004 has not been restated for currency impacts.
Share-based payments
The Group has not applied IFRS 2 (Share-based payment) to share-based payments granted prior to 7 November 2002 that have
not vested by 1 January 2005.
Cumulative equity translation differences
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 (The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates), cumulative translation differences
for all foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero. Consequently any gain or loss on disposal will
exclude translation differences that arose prior to 1 October 2004.
Valuation of property , plant or equipment
ITE has elected not to use the fair value of an item of property , plant and equipment at the transition date as its deemed cost. 40/41
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2006
Financial Instruments
The Group has elected not to apply IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) and IAS 32 (Financial Instruments:
Disclosure and presentation) in respect of the year ended 30 September 2005. UK GAAP has continued to be applied in accounting
for financial instruments in this period. The Group adopted IAS 39 and IAS 32 with effect from 1 October 2005 and consequently
restated the balance sheet at that date in accordance with the requirements of these standards, which will generally mean a
recognition of financial instruments at fair value.
The Company adopted IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation) and IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement) prospectively from 1 October 2005. As a consequence of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39, the
Company recognised a loss of £0.5 million in equity at that date. Additionally certain put options have been reclassified as
financial liabilities resulting in a £1.0 million reduction in reserves (see note 23).
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company drawn
up to 30 September each year . Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess 
of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. The interest of minority
shareholders is stated at the minority’ s proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently , any 
losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary , adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into 
line with those used by the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. 
The acquiree’ s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held
for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations), which are recognised and
measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the
business combination over the Group’ s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’ s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’ s identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit and loss.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minority’ s proportion of the net fair value of the
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’ s interest in the fair value of the
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and
reviewed for impairment at least annually . Any impairment is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account and is not
subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’ s cash-generating units expected to benefit from
the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually,
or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.  42/43
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2006
Notes to the consolidated accounts
continued
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss
on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated
and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group
has elected to treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling denominated assets.
Intangible assets
Computer software, trademarks, brands and customer lists are measured initially at purchase cost. Computer software, trademarks,
brands and customer lists have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated
using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are typically between
3 and 5 years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset
belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication
that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment is recognised immediately 
as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. 
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately , unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount,
in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Property , plant and equipment
Property , plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, 
on the following bases:
Leasehold improvements – term of lease
Plant and equipment – 4 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where
shorter , over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in income. 42/43
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2006
Associates
Associates are entities over which the Group has a significant influence but not control or joint control. In the Group accounts the
results and assets and liabilities of associates are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in associates are carried in
the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’ s share of the net assets of the associate, less any
impairment. The consolidated income statement includes the Group’ s share of associates’ profits less losses. The share of profits
of associates included in the income statement is the net profit after interest, tax and minority interests of the associate. Losses 
of associates in excess of the Group’ s interest in those associates are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’ s share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the
date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill within the Group’ s investment in associates.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’ s interest in the
relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision 
is made for impairment.
Venue advances
Where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either off-setting against future venue hire or 
by cash repayment, the fair value is recognised based on the discounted value of future cash receipts. The loan balance is
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the ‘effective interest rate method’. As the Group has taken advantage of the
exemption in IFRS 1 (First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards) that enables the Group to apply these
standards from 1 October 2005, an adjustment to reserves has been recognised at 1 October 2005.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are recognised 
at cost as prepayments within debtors due within one year .
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of
resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions
are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’ s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
T rade receivables and payables
T rade receivables and payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges 
are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. Where bank overdrafts are deemed to be integral to the Group’ s cash
management activities they are presented within net cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement. Overdrafts that 
are considered to be financing in nature are presented as financing activities in the cash flow statement.
Hedging instruments
The Group’ s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group uses foreign
exchange forward contracts and options to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments 
for speculative purposes.
Cash flow hedges are carried at fair value in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in the hedging reserve and any ineffective portion is recognised in profit 
or loss. 44/45
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2006
Notes to the consolidated accounts
continued
Fair value hedges are carried at fair value in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as effective fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in fair value of the hedged
item that is attributable to the hedged risk. Any ineffective portion is also recognised in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the 
income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is
retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur , the net
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the period.
The Group’ s use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’ s financial policies. Further details on these policies can be
found in the Business Review on pages 16 and 17.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business net 
of discounts, VA T and other sales related taxes.
Revenue and profit is recognised over the course of an event. Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable costs
relating to future events are deferred. The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event income and
prepaid event costs respectively . Losses anticipated at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions
Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space, revenue is only recognised if it can be demonstrated
that the transaction would have occurred regardless of the barter agreement. If this cannot be shown no revenue or cost is
recognised in the profit and loss account.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after the share of results of associates and profit or loss on disposal of Group undertakings and before
investment income and finance costs. 
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date. T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences
and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises
from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction
that does not effect the tax profit or the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 44/45
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2006
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity , in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity .
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
T ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual rate
where applicable. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated 
at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the 
date the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, 
are included in profit or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried 
at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items
in respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity . For such non-monetary items, any exchange component 
of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity .
Details of the Group’ s accounting polices for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative 
financial instruments.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their
balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange
rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the date
of transaction are used. Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’ s translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate.
Employee Share Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share T rust (‘ESOT’). Shares in the Company held by 
the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity . The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to profit or loss
as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Company’ s
equity holders.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied IFRS 2 (Share-based payment). IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 
7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (excluding 
the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’ s estimate
of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects 
of non-transferability , exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management’ s best estimate. 46/47

Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not
made on such a basis. Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’ s accounting policies, the following judgements and assumptions have been made by
management and have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or have the most risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year .
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-generating
units to which goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an estimation of future
cash flows expected from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The carrying
value of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 September 2006 is £34.4 million and £5.9 million respectively .
Intangible assets
The valuation of intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future cash flows
arising from customer relationships and trademarks to determine the value of those intangible assets. This involves estimating
the period over which the customer relationships and trademarks effect future cash flows.  46/47

11 Goodwill acquired through business combinations
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit
from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:
2006 2005
£000 £000
UK & Western Europe 10,740 9,886
Central Asia & Caucasus 6,080 6,080
Russia 15,122 14,341
Eastern & Southern Europe 2,464 2,464
34,406 32,771
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for 
the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to cash flows during the
period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of
money and risks specific to the cash generating units. The growth rates are based on management forecasts. The Group prepares
cash flow forecasts based upon the most recent financial plans approved by the Board and extrapolates the planned cash flows.
Assumed growth rates of between 2% and 9% are applied for the first three years beyond the detailed plans, which rates do not
exceed the average long term growth rate for our business in the relevant markets, and a rate of 3% is applied thereafter .
The discount rates applied to the cash generating units are between 1 0% and 15%.

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2006
11 Goodwill acquired through business combinations (continued)
The acquisition of businesses relates to the purchase of two events from Maxima Inc in June 2006, for a total cash consideration
of £1.8 million. The fair value of assets acquired amounted to £1.1 million, being brand names and customer relationships.
Goodwill arising of £0.7 million is attributable to the anticipated future profitability that ITE can bring to the events. The two
events are Bytchimexpo and Expoclean and will both be organised by ITE for the first time in the year ended 30 September 2007.
If the acquisition had taken place on the first day of the financial year , it is estimated that Group revenues for the year would have
been $1.4 million higher and the Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been $0.65 million.
The additional acquisition of businesses cost of £0.1 million relates to additional costs in relation to the purchase of ITE Exhibitions
BV and ITE Moda Footwear Limited.

The additions to customer relationships and trademarks of £1.5 million relates to the purchase of the Gift & Décor event in 
the Ukraine and the Bytchimexpo and Expoclean events in Russia. The Gift & Décor event was purchased in March 2006 for £0.4
million from Expo UA. The event is biannual, held in Kyiv , Ukraine. The event has been held once since acquisition, making 
a profit of £40,000. The fair value of the customer relationships and trademarks was £0.4 million.
The Bytchimexpo and Expoclean events were purchased from Maxima Inc in June 2006, for a total consideration of £1.8 million.
The fair value of the customer relationships and trademarks was £1.1 million, with £0.7 million being recognised in goodwill.
Neither event has been held since acquisition. 54/55

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from trade receivables of £0.4 million. The directors consider
that the carrying amount of other receivables approximates their fair value. The trade receivables are held in different currencies
with £1.7 million in Sterling, £3.8 million is US Dollars, £16.2 million in Euros and £0.3 million in other currencies.
The cash at bank and in hand comprises cash held by the Group and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months
or less. The carrying value of these assets approximates their fair value. The cash balance is represented by £22.3 million of
Sterling, £1.4 million of Euros, £1.0 million of US Dollars, £1.2 million of Roubles and £1.5 million of other currencies. Surplus
funds are placed on short term deposit with floating interest rates.
As a result of the capital reduction in August 2005, £4.5 million is held in a trust account, which will be released as certain creditors
are paid in full. At 30 September 2006 £0.5 million of the cash in trust was expected to be released within one year and £4.0 million
was expected to be released after 30 September 2007 at approximately £0.5 million a year .
The venue advances and other loans of £3.0 million due after one year is all due within five years (2005: £0.3 million due 
after more than five years). The venue loans repayable by cash are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow model.
The venue prepayments are held at cost. All venue advances are stated net of allowance for doubtful receivables. The venue
advances are denominated in either Euros or US Dollars and are analysed as follows:

Credit risk
The Group’ s principal financial assets are bank balances, trade receivables, prepayments and venue advances. The Group’ s credit
risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and venue advances. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net 
of allowances for doubtful receivables. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high
credit-ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
1 7 Bank overdraft
The bank overdrafts are all repayable on demand. Of the total borrowing, £8.8 million (2005: £6.8 million) is denominated 
in Euros, £1.9 million (2005: £3.9 million) is denominated in US Dollars. The borrowings are arranged at floating interest rates,
thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Euro and US Dollar borrowings are taken out to act as a partial hedge
against the UK trade receivables in those currencies.
The overdraft has been secured by a guarantee between ITE Group plc, ITE Exhibitions & Conferences Limited, International T rade
and Exhibitions (JV) Limited, ITE Overseas Limited and ITE Enterprises Limited and a charge over the account of International
T rade and Exhibitions (JV) Limited. The average interest rate on the bank overdrafts approximates 3.6% per annum (2005: 2.6%)
and are determined by reference to base rate plus 0.5%. The directors estimate the carrying value of the overdrafts approximates
their fair value.
At 30 September 2006 the Group had £9.3 million (2005: £9.3 million) of gross undrawn committed borrowing facilities.

20 Deferred tax (continued)
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in the above table. The following is the analysis of deferred tax
balances for financial reporting purposes:
2006 2005
£000 £000
Deferred tax liabilities (2,145) (1,673)
Deferred tax assets 2,022 1,395
(123) (278)
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £1.3 million (2005: £1.3 million) available for offset against future
profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the unpredictability of future
profit streams. These losses may be carried forward indefinitely .
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries
for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £5.1 million (2005: £3.5 million). No liability has been recognised
in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences
and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
21 Derivative financial instruments
Currency derivatives
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows. The Group is party to a foreign
currency forward plus contract in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The instruments purchased are denominated
in Euros which represents the Group’ s primary billing currency .
Under the forward plus contract the Group has a right but not an obligation, to sell Euros for Sterling at a specified strike rate at
specified dates. However , if the spot rate is at or below the specified barrier rate on any business day during the barrier period the
right to sell Euros becomes an obligation, at the specified strike rate.
As at 30 September 2006 the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward-plus contracts that the Group has
committed to are as follows:
2006 2005
€000 €000
Foreign currency forward plus contracts 1 5,000 1 6,000
These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the year ended 30 September 2007 and are
renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing the Group to less than 6 months or more than 18 months 
in the future.
At 30 September 2006 the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be approximately £0.3 million. These amounts
are based on market valuations. Amounts of (£0.1) million and £0.3 million have been transferred to the income statement and
reserves respectively during the period.
The Group has taken out foreign currency overdrafts in Euros and US Dollars to act as a natural hedge against certain currency
trade receivable balances. These borrowings have not been designated as hedging instruments by management. All foreign
exchange movements on these borrowings and trade receivables are recognised directly in the income statement. 58/59

IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation) and IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement)
have been applied with effect from 1 October 2005. As a result of these standards a number of financial instruments have been
revalued as at 1 October 2005 decreasing retained earnings by £0.5 million. Additionally certain put options have been reclassified
as financial liabilities resulting in a £1.0 million reduction in reserves. Subsequently this has reversed on exercise of the put option.
At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 17 November 1998, shareholders approved the establishment of the ITE Group
Employee Share Ownership T rust (ESOT). The terms of the ESOT allow the trustees to transfer shares to employees who exercise
options under the Company’ s Share Option Schemes, to grant options to employees and to accumulate shares by buying in the
market or subscribing for shares at market value. The ESOT is capable of holding a maximum of 5% of the Company’ s issued
ordinary share capital. The ESOT reserve arises in connection with the Employee Share Ownership T rust. The amount of the
reserve represents the deduction in arriving at shareholders funds for the consideration paid for the Company’ s shares 
purchased by the T rust which had not vested unconditionally in employees at the Balance Sheet date.
The ESOT held 9,372,100 shares in ITE Group plc at 30 September 2006 (2005: 11,127,000 shares). No grants of share options
have been made during the financial year . The market value of the ordinary shares held by the ESOT at 30 September 2006 was
£11.4 million (2005: £11.9 million).
The Company has agreed to make available to the ESOT an interest-free loan of up to £7.5 million for the purpose of buying
shares. At 30 September 2006, the amount of the loan drawn down was £2.6 million. The ITE Group plc company only profit 
and loss account and balance sheet include the results of the ESOT for the year ended 30 September 2006. 
The trustees have waived their current and future rights to all dividend entitlement on the shares held by the ESOT . 1,704,900
options were exercised during the year . Of the total shares held by the ESOT , all are under option as at 30 September 2006.
Details of the options in issue and their exercise dates can be seen at note 26 to the accounts.
The Company purchased 975,833 shares at a cost of £1,142,000 to be held in T reasury during the period. 60/61

Share option plans
The Company operates a share option plan for all employees of the Group. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the 
average quoted market price of the Company’ s share on the date of grant. The vesting period is either three or five years and 
are exercisable up to ten years from granting. The options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Performance share plans
The Company operated a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for executives and staff. Awards under the PSP are at an exercise value 
of either 1p or nil. Awards can be made to an employee over shares up to a maximum of 100% of base salary each year based 
on market value. The vesting period is three years and are exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant. The options 
are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. The awards are also subject to a performance target.
Further details of the performance targets can be found in the Report on remuneration. 62/63

The analysis below sets out the most significant adjustments arising from the transition to IFRS.
Share-based payments
IFRS 2 (Share-based payment) states that an expense for equity instruments granted should be recognised in the financial
statements based on their ‘fair value’ at the date of grant. This expense, which is in relation to employee option and performance
share plans, is then recognised over the vesting period of the relevant scheme. IFRS 2 has been applied to all options granted
after 7 November 2002 and not fully vested by 1 January 2005.
Leases
IAS 17 (Leases) requires that the expense is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term, including any rent-free 
or reduced rent periods given at the inception of a lease. The income statement has been adjusted to take into account the
amortisation of lease incentives over a longer period than the UK GAAP , which recognises incentives over the period to the 
first rent review date.
Goodwill and acquired intangible assets
IAS 38 (Intangible assets) states that goodwill is not amortised. Instead goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review . 
As the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations prior to 1 October 2004, the original 
UK GAAP goodwill balance at 1 October 2004 (£29.3m) has been included in the opening IFRS consolidated balance sheet and 
is no longer amortised, but continues to be subject to impairment reviews.
Business combinations since 1 October 2004 have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business combinations), with
intangible assets recognised and amortised over their useful economic lives where they are separable or arise from a contractual
or legal right. Intangible assets relating to customer lists and databases and brand trademarks, are being amortised over their
estimated useful lives. 64/65
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2006
28 Transition to IFRS (continued)
Under UK GAAP , capitalised computer software is included within tangible fixed assets on the balance sheet as property , plant and
equipment. Under IAS 38 only computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware can be included as property , plant
and equipment. All other computer software is recorded as an intangible asset.
Income from associates
IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements) requires the aggregated profit or loss of an associate to be disclosed as a single line
item within the income statement. Under UK GAAP , the Group separately presented its share of operating profit, interest, tax and
minority interest from associate undertakings.
Deferred and current taxes
IAS 12 (Income taxes) requires deferred tax to be provided on all temporary differences rather than just timing differences under
UK GAAP . IAS 12 also requires deferred tax to be provided in respect of the Group’ s employee benefits such as share option schemes. 
Holiday pay accrual
IAS 19 (Employee benefits) requires a liability to be recognised for the amount of accrued holiday pay of employees at the balance
sheet date in respect of any holiday amounts which they are still entitled to at that time.
Dividends
IAS 10 (Events after the Balance Sheet date) requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be
recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by 
IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets).
There are no material adjustments to the cash flow statement. 66/67

Independent auditors’ report
We have audited the individual company financial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 2006 which
comprise the balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 8. These individual company financial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein.
The corporate governance statement and the directors’ remuneration report are included in the group annual report 
of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 2006. We have reported separately on the group financial statements 
of ITE Group plc for the year ended 30 September 2006 and on the information in the directors’ remuneration report that 
is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a body , in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’ s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law , we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’ s members as a body , for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the individual company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are 
set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the individual company financial statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal 
and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the individual company financial statements give a true and fair view , in accordance
with the relevant financial reporting framework, and whether the individual company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
directors’ report is consistent with the individual company financial statements. We also report to you if the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained in the annual report for the above year as described in the
contents section and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the individual company financial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the individual
company financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors
in the preparation of the individual company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
company’ s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the individual company financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the individual company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the individual company financial statements give a true and fair view , in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’ s affairs as at 30 September 2006; 
• the individual company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985;
• the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2006
Notes
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law
and accounting standards and have been applied consistently , with the exception of the restatement of dividends under the
revised requirements of FRS 21.
Changes in accounting policies
In accordance with FRS 21 (Events after the Balance Sheet Date), the Company now recognises dividends in the period they are
declared. Dividends declared after the balance sheet date are no longer included in the accounts. Adopting FRS 21 has resulted 
in a prior year adjustment. The total effect of this has been to increase opening shareholders’ funds by £4.6 million, but there 
has been no effect on reported profit.
During the year the Company has also adopted FRS 23 (The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates), FRS 25 (Financial
instruments: disclosure and presentation), and FRS 26 (Financial instruments: recognition and measurement). This has had 
no effect on the financial statements.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets
T rademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. 
The estimated useful lives are up to 20 years.
Provisions
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation.
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’ s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
T rade debtors and creditors
T rade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value. T rade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual
basis to profit or loss.
Hedging instruments
Cash flow hedges are carried at fair value in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in the hedging reserve and any ineffective portion is recognised in profit 
or loss.
Fair value hedges are carried at fair value in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as effective fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in fair value of the hedged
item that is attributable to the hedged risk. Any ineffective portion is also recognised in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income
statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for
hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity
until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur , the net cumulative gain or loss
recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the period. 68/69
ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2006
The Company’ s use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’ s financial policies.
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date. T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences
and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not effect the tax profit or the accounting profit.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly
to equity , in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity .
Foreign currencies
T ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. Gains and
losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets are included in profit or loss for the period.
Employee Share Trust
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share T rust (‘ESOT’). Shares in the Company held by 
the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity . The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to profit or loss
as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Company’ s
equity holders.
1 Profit for the year
The profit before dividends for the year ended 30 September 2006 was £10.3 million (2005: £17.8 million). As permitted by
Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the Company .
The audit fee for the Company was £40,000 (2005: £38,000). 70/71

Notes:
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy or proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote instead of them. A proxy need not be a member of the Group.
2. A form of proxy is provided with this notice and instructions for use are shown on the form. T o be effective, the form duly signed must be deposited at or posted to the offices of the
Company’ s registrar , Capita Registrars,The Registry , 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting. Deposit 
of the form of proxy shall not preclude a member from attending and voting in person at the meeting or any adjournment of the meeting.
3. The Company specifies pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 that only those members registered in the register of members of the Company as at
6.00 p.m. on 20 February 2007 or , in the event that this meeting is adjourned, in the register of members 48 hours before the time of any adjournment meeting, shall be entitled to attend 
or vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their respective names at that time. Changes to entries on the register after 6.00 p.m. on 20 February 2007 or , in the
event that this meeting is adjourned, in the register of members 48 hours before the time of the adjourned meeting, will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or
vote at the meeting.
4. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) of the
meeting by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting
service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in
accordance with CRESTCo’ s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it
constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the
Company’ s agent (ID RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as
determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’ s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner
prescribed by CREST . After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that CRESTCo does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular
messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take 
(or , if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)
take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular , to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system 
and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
5. Although only CREST members can use the electronic proxy system at this stage, the Company hopes to adopt a more general regime to allow for electronic communication with
shareholders and is awaiting the implementation of the new electronic communications provisions of the Companies Act 2006 so as to assess the best way of implementing such a regime. 76/77

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

Chairman’s Statement 
 
I am delighted to present the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2011.  The Group performance 
has again been driven by the IVA division which doubled the number of new IVAs arranged during the year. 
 
The Group increased revenue to £7,776,362 (2010: £6,633,995) producing a much increased gross profit of 
£3,963,959 (2010: £3,300,688).  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation increased to £2,222,411 
(2010: £1,515,271) resulting in a pre-tax profit for the year of £227,219 (2010: £465,709).  This was after finance 
charges of £532,404 (2010: £206,660) relating to the convertible secured loan note issued in 2010 and other loans 
together with amortisation relating to the acquisition of back books and other intangibles of £1,388,809 (2010: 
£993,980).   
 
During the year the Group acquired two further back books of Debt Management Plans (DMPs) and completed the 
purchase of a sizeable IVA book from Invocas Group plc (Invocas) just prior to the year end.  The acquisitions 
resulted in a gain on bargain purchase of £54,985 which was offset by the write off of £55,612 of goodwill relating 
to the Debt Advice Portal acquisition in January 2009.  A tax charge of £156,183 for the year includes a £75,000 
provision against holding company tax losses previously recognised as a deferred tax asset which, although they 
may ultimately be recoverable, will take a number of years to be fully utilised. 
  
In June 2011, just prior to the year end,  a decision was made in favour of  Paymex Limited against HM  Revenue & 
Customs (HMRC) which ruled that fees for services in relation to IVAs should be treated as exempt from VAT. 
HMRC confirmed in July that they would not appeal the outcome of the case.  Accordingly, as a result of the ruling, 
we have put a protective claim into HMRC to recover net output tax of some £850,000 incorrectly paid to HMRC 
over the last 4 years. A proportion of this VAT may be due to us and a proportion due to creditors. The timing, 
quantum and split of any refunds received will very much be dependent on the stance that HMRC adopt in relation 
to such reclaims by us and many other companies in the sector. No entries have been made in the accounts due to the 
uncertainty on the timing and recoverability of any claim. We expect the loss of input tax recovery on our costs 
going forward to be broadly neutral. 
 
At the year end the group had net assets of £5,150,582 (2010: £5,016,621) including cash of £336,636 (2010: 
£541,504) after spending some £1.1m on acquisitions (2010: £2.7m) in the year financed out of cash flow and net 
new loans of £315,000. 
 
The Group finances continue on a sound footing and I am pleased to report continued growth in the number of new 
IVAs being passed since the year end with a record number of cases passed in August 2011.  Client retention of debt 
management clients remains excellent which is a testament to the service our teams provide to creditors and clients 
alike.  Growth in new debt management clients remains limited going forward, given an increasing acceptance by 
debtors and creditors alike that the IVA product is generally more appropriate to debtor’s circumstances than a 
DMP. 
 
I look forward to another profitable year as we continue to nurture and expand our referral base whilst maintaining 
our web marketing presence and we continue to look for opportunities to acquire back books of clients wherever 
possible at sensible prices.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT 
 
3 
 
The Group has enjoyed another excellent year underpinned by further substantial growth in the numbers of new IVA 
cases arranged during the past financial year, which doubled to 1,601 (2010: 799). In addition 953 IVAs were 
acquired from Invocas in June 2011 and as at 30 June 2011 the total number of IVAs and PTDs generating income 
was 5,893 (2010: 4,894). 
 
This is a pleasing result against a backdrop of an IVA market that has remained flat over the last 2 years at 
approximately 50,000 new IVAs per annum with slight declines in case numbers being seen in the first 2 quarters of 
2011. 
 
During the year, two books of DMPs totalling approximately 1,000 clients were acquired and as at 30 June 2011, the 
total number of active DMPs was 5,761 (2010: 6,316). Client retention rates remain at excellent levels although the 
fall in numbers reflects natural attrition in the DMP books, the majority of new clients opting for an IVA rather than 
DMP, together with existing DMP clients converting to an IVA where appropriate.  
 
For the majority of clients we see, the IVA remains the most appropriate solution freezing interest and charges and 
writing off the balance of debts generally after 5 years. Whereas in previous years clients have preferred to opt for 
the DMP solution as a short term fix awaiting improved prospects to clear their debts, there is now general 
acceptance that this will not happen in the short to medium term and the IVA solution is now the preferred option. 
ClearDebt has always felt that DMP’s are only applicable for clients who expect to see a rapid recovery in their 
finances. 
 
In November 2010 we rationalised the debt management operation in Staveley and closed the office transferring the 
DMP book to our main operation in Timperley where it was absorbed without the need for any additional staff 
recruitment. 
 
The IVA operation in Staveley continues to perform well and is now receiving new IVAs drafted by Timperley as 
spare capacity has been freed up through the natural completion of the older IVA cases acquired in 2009. The 
Invocas cases acquired in June have been transferred to Staveley and the electronic case management data will 
shortly be migrated onto our standard systems. In addition we are continuing to purchase new cases referred to us by 
Invocas on a monthly basis over the next few months on a trial basis. We continue to balance our workload between 
the two sites as required.   
 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our staff for their dedication and hard work over the last year and I 
am proud of the work they do to provide continuing advice and assistance to our thousands of clients - as well as 
advice to many others to whom we have spoken over the same period. We continue to train and encourage all of our 
staff to obtain the Certificate of Debt Resolution (CertDR), exclusively offered by the DRF and presently all of our 
client advisers who have been with us over 3 months are qualified, which we believe is one of the highest rates in 
the industry. Industry regulation and consultation are increasingly focusing on the formal training and qualification 
of staff and we are therefore well placed to deal with the ever changing demands being made by the regulatory 
authorities. 
 
Cash flow from the former Relax cases remains good and well ahead of our expectations at the time of acquisition in 
December 2009. Total fees of £5.7m have been received to the end of June 2011 against a purchase price inclusive 
of costs of circa £3.2m, showing the value that can be generated by acquisitions bought at the right price and 
successfully and efficiently integrated into our systems and processes. 
 
We continue to maintain our internet activities across the Group acquiring web leads at cost effective rates wherever 
possible although we continue to see competitors paying for leads at prices we view as uneconomic. We have in the 
last year actively expanded our referral base and continue to explore new opportunities for lead sources and 
referrals. We have a strong pipeline of potential referrers whom we are currently in discussions with, some of whom 
may substantially boost the numbers of leads to our sales operation. We are also investing in new software to 
manage our sales operation which we expect to be in place in the next month or so which we anticipate will boost 
conversion and allow the marketing of more products to our substantial databases of leads and clients.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT

We are closely monitoring consolidation opportunities within our industry and will finance smaller acquisitions 
through cash flow. Our successful history in profitably integrating acquired back books - both operationally and 
financially means we are confident of raising additional finance for larger acquisitions, although the cost of such 
funding in the current economic climate is high. 
 
THE CONSUMER DEBT MARKET 
 
ClearDebt Group operates within the debt resolution sector, an established sub-category of financial services. 
Personal insolvencies saw a step change in 2006 with a 58% increase in individual insolvencies to over 100,000 per 
annum which has grown steadily each year to 136,000 in 2010.  In 2010 IVAs showed growth of 6% although the 
first half of 2011 has seen a decline of 13% on the same period last year.  
 
Traditional refinancing options through secured or unsecured lending remain closed to the majority of people 
leading us to believe that demand in our sector will remain robust although slightly off its peak in 2011/12.  
 
Against this background the government is actively looking to increase regulation and has already started to enforce 
much stricter compliance monitoring of companies in the sector and it is now much more difficult to renew existing 
consumer credit licences or obtain new ones. We continue to see this as an opportunity for ourselves and those 
larger organisations with cash who maintain the highest standards to purchase back books and consolidate the sector 
as the many smaller players are unwilling or unable to comply with the increased regulation.  
 
THE CLEARDEBT MODEL – IVAs and PTDs 
  
Unlike most of its major competitors in the consumer IVA market, ClearDebt has developed a low overhead, high 
quality model, based on Kaizen manufacturing principles and an intelligent internet interface - www.cleardebt.co.uk. 
This model allows the company’s cost base to be kept to a minimum level whilst still providing high levels of 
service even on lower levels of debt and disposable income.   
 
Demand for lower value IVAs has been evident which favours our low cost model allowing us to service levels of 
the market other providers will not touch. Due to this distinctive operating model, ClearDebt is able to offer a more 
effective debt resolution solution than many of its rivals.  
 
THE ABACUS MODEL – Debt Management Plans 
 
Abacus provides services to indebted individuals by negotiating and putting in place a debt management plan with 
their creditors. The debtor makes a monthly payment to Abacus who then distributes the payment to the creditors as 
agreed in the plan less an administration fee at an agreed percentage of the debtor’s monthly payment. An initial set 
up fee is also charged.   
 
Such plans are suitable for individuals whose debts are more manageable and rely on the goodwill of creditors as 
they are not a formal insolvency procedure and interest usually continues to accrue on outstanding debts although 
today the majority of creditors that we work with are prepared to waive the interest for short periods.  
 
Many clients are cross referred between ClearDebt and Abacus allowing the Group to offer an appropriate advice 
solution to all individuals.  
 
As a leading member of the trade body, The Debt Resolution Forum, ClearDebt has been in regular communication 
with the creditor community, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), the Department of Business Innovation and Skills 
and the Ministry of Justice who have issued several consultation papers intending that stricter guidance on practices 
in the debt resolution industry which will need to be adhered to if operators wish to maintain their Consumer Credit 
Licence without which they cannot operate.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW 
 
ClearDebt – IVA Division 
 
Since 1 July 2010 (2010: 1 July 2009), the following numbers of new IVAs have been arranged through ClearDebt:- 
 
 Year ended Year ended 
 30 June 2011 30 June 2010 
First quarter 355 176 
Second quarter 407 173 
Third quarter 411 184 
Fourth quarter 428 266 
 ____ ____ 
 1,601 799 
 ____ ____ 
 
The growth of new IVAs continues to be strong and ClearDebt enjoyed an excellent year with a 100% increase in 
the number of IVAs passed in the year with 1,601 new cases (2010: 799).  I am pleased to say this growth has 
continued and case numbers in the first quarter of our current financial year are expected to be ahead of the fourth 
quarter with 362 cases already passed by the end of August. 
 
In addition we purchased 953 IVAs from Invocas in June 2011 which will generate additional income in the new 
financial year and we continue to be referred a number of new cases by them going forward. Including this purchase, 
we had as at 30 June 2011 a total of 5,893 (2010: 4,894) IVAs and PTDs generating income.  
 
The Board monitors several key performance indicators  (“KPIs”) for the business on a monthly basis including the 
number of cases passed, various conversion ratios from lead to cases passed, the cost per case acquired and the staff 
to caseload numbers. Your Board is pleased to advise that these KPIs continue to deliver positive messages about 
the business and we are hopeful of gaining additional referral sources in the first half of the current year. 
 
Revenue in respect of nominee fees is recognised on the approval of the IVA whilst supervisory fees are recognised 
evenly over the expected life of the IVA. 
 
Abacus– Debt Management Division  
 
The division made a profit in the period although we have seen a slowdown in the recruitment of new clients and an 
increase in the number of plans that cease as the age of the relatively young DMP book at Abacus matures.  There 
have also been a number of clients who have ceased a DMP and commenced an IVA with us.  
 
In the year 2010/11, Abacus has arranged 1,570 new plans (2009/10: 2,366). During the year two books of DMPs 
totalling approximately 1,000 were acquired and as at 30 June 2011 the total number of DMPs generating income 
was 5,761 (2010: 6,316). Our attrition rates on DMPs are well within our normal expectations and we are actively 
looking for further back books to acquire as a means of boosting income over the short and medium term. 
 
The Board has KPIs to monitor the number of active income generating plans as well as the value of monthly 
payments made by debtors.  Revenue is only recognised by Abacus upon receipt of fees which are drawn from 
debtor payments as received.  
 
Generally the costs of acquisition of cases and plans are also monitored closely. We continue to resist the temptation 
to grow the book through lead sources providing leads at what are, in our view uneconomic prices.

ClearCash – prepaid MasterCard 
  
Steady progress continues to be made with our Pre-Paid MasterCard, ClearCash, as the new version of the card, 
without a monthly fee, is taken up in larger numbers than the original which included the monthly fee.  The rate of 
new card signings continues to grow and as at 30 June 2011 there were 5,749 ClearCash cards in issue (2010: 
1,662).  The card currently makes a small loss each month after referral costs, but revenue from card usage has 
increased steadily month on month since inception. 
  
The card can effectively be used as a bank account with the exception of direct debit and we see the ClearCash card 
as an integral service offering to our clients who often find it difficult to obtain normal banking facilities. As 
numbers increase we expect it to produce a profit in due course. 
 
FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Group turnover increased by 17% to £7,776,362 (2010: £6,633,995) and gross profit by 20% to £3,963,959 (2010: 
£3,300,688). The performance was driven by good demand for IVAs and the benefit of the increased supervisory 
revenue which is growing steadily as the number of IVA cases under management grows. Amortisation charges in 
respect of acquisitions and impairment amounted to £1,388,809 (2010: £993,980). 
 
Finance costs rose to £532,404 (2010: £206,660 ) reflecting a full years charge of £467,960 (2010:£91,147) in 
respect of the 3yr 10% secured convertible loan notes issued in April 2010. Actual interest paid in respect of the 
convertible totalled £230,000 with the balance being an accounting charge for the redemption premium due on 
maturity in 2013. 
 
Cash resources at the year end amounted to £336,636 (2010: £541,504) after acquisitions of £1.1m in the year 
financed with net new loans of £315,000 advanced by David Mond. Operational cash flow remains strong and 
£350,000 of loans have been repaid since the year end. 
 
GOING CONCERN 
  
As part of its going concern review the Board has followed the guidelines published by the Financial Reporting 
Council entitled “Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for UK Companies 2009.  The Board has prepared 
detailed financial forecasts and cash flows for the three years to 30 June 2014 and in drawing up these forecasts the 
Board has made assumptions based upon its view of the current and future economic conditions in the UK that will 
prevail over the forecast period - given that the business is likely to be solely focused on the UK market for the 
foreseeable future. The timing of the cash flows and covenants to the debt holders in respect of loans provided have 
been taken into consideration and in addition to the forecasts we have also produced sensitivities to these forecasts 
to test our ability to trade as a going concern for at least the following 12 months based upon a 12% rise or fall in 
projected turnover without any reduction in overhead costs. In practice the Board believes that it can quickly realign 
overheads, in particular marketing spend, to allow for any reduced levels of activity within the business that may 
occur going forward. 
 
The Board believes that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate and there are no material 
uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the company to 
continue as a going concern. 
 
FUTURE OUTLOOK 
 
The IVA market is still at high levels and we continue to gain market share as our monthly run rate for new IVAs 
grows against the background of a static to slightly declining IVA market. 
 
The last quarter of the financial year produced a record number of IVAs for the Group and the first two months of 
the current year have continued in a similar vein. 
  ClearDebt Group plc 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT 
 
7 
 
We continue to look for acquisitions of client books wherever we can at reasonable prices to supplement our growth 
as we know these can be highly profitable given the ease with which we can assimilate them into our scaleable 
business model and systems.  
 
Given the current economic outlook in the UK with unemployment showing no signs of falling together with high 
taxation and continued public sector cuts I believe the Group is well placed for another highly profitable and 
successful year.  
 
Once again I would like to pay tribute to all our employees who continue to offer the highest standards of service 
and commitment to all our clients at all levels.

Going Concern 
As part of its going concern review the Board has followed the guidelines published by the Financial Reporting 
Council entitled “Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for UK Companies 2009”.  The Board has prepared 
detailed financial forecasts and cash flows for the three years to 30 June 2014 and in drawing up these forecasts the

The Board believes that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate and there are no material 
uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the company to 
continue as a going concern.  
 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
All businesses face a range of risks and uncertainties, being subject to risk factors from internal and external 
sources. The Board considers the likelihood and significance of risk factors when putting in place risk management 
procedures to ensure risk mitigation. 
 
The following are considered to be the key risks facing the Group:- 
 
1. Competition - the market for debt resolution solutions remains highly competitive. The Group seeks to 
manage the risk of losing referrers through providing innovative solutions supported by high quality 
delivery. The Group’s main marketing channel still continues to be the internet and the Group monitors 
closely the strategies of competitors and the prices paid in the market place and reacts appropriately 
where necessary.  
 
2. Credit risk – the Group’s credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and is managed by daily 
monitoring of client’s payments into their programmes versus agreed contracted terms. 
 
3. Funding arrangements – the Group monitors cash flow as part of its normal activities. Cash flow 
positions are discussed with the Board on a monthly basis to ensure that all possible treasury benefits are 
being taken and facilities are available if necessary. Advertising and marketing spend is monitored 
closely as it is a key component of funding requirements. 
 
4. Economic environment – the current economic climate is extremely favourable and the market for 
indebted consumers is likely to grow in the next few years. 
 
5. Creditor Pressure – Creditors can restrict the market for personal debt resolutions by refusing to agree to 
proposals which they do not deem acceptable. This can have the effect of restricting approvals and 
therefore the timing of fees. The Group is actively involved in talking to creditors constantly to ensure 
that all Group products are in line with creditor approval criteria as much as possible.   
 
Risks associated with financial instruments entered into by the Group are detailed in note 20.  ClearDebt Group plc

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Principles of Corporate Governance 
 
The Group’s Board appreciates the value of good corporate governance not only in the areas of accountability and 
risk management but also as a positive contribution to business prosperity. It believes that corporate governance 
involves more than a simple “box ticking” approach to establish whether a company has met the principles 
(including those set out in the corporate governance guidelines for AIM companies published by the Quoted 
Companies Alliance in September 2010) of a number of specific rules and regulations. Rather the issue is one of 
applying corporate governance in a sensible and pragmatic fashion having regard to the individual circumstances of 
a particular company’s business. The key objective is to enhance and protect shareholder value.  
 
Board Structure 
 
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group. A statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the accounts is set out on page 14.   
 
The Non-Executive Directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the Executive 
Directors are fully considered.   
 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors have full and timely access to all relevant information and 
there is a procedure for all Directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice, if 
necessary, at the expense of the Group. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and meets 
monthly. It is responsible for overall group strategy, approval of major capital expenditure projects and 
consideration of significant financing matters.   
 
The following Committees have been set up, which have written terms of reference and deal with specific aspects of 
the Group’s affairs.   
 
1. The Remuneration Committee, includes D E M Mond and the two Non-Executive Directors, is responsible 
for making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s framework of executive remuneration and its 
cost.  The Committee determines the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits for each of the 
Executive Directors, including pension rights and compensation payments. The Board itself determines the 
remuneration of D E M Mond and the Non-Executive Directors. The Committee meets as required.  
 
2. The Audit Committee includes the two Non-Executive Directors.  Its prime tasks are to review the scope of 
the external audit, to receive regular reports from Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP, and to review the half-yearly 
and annual accounts before they are presented to the Board, focusing in particular on accounting policies 
and areas of management judgment and estimation. The Committee is responsible for monitoring the 
controls, which are in force to ensure the integrity of the information reported to the shareholders. The 
Committee acts as a forum for discussion of internal control issues and contribute to the Board’s review of 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems and processes. It advises the 
Board on the appointment of external auditors and on their remuneration for both audit and non-audit work, 
and discusses the nature and scope of the audit with the external auditors. It reviews and monitors the 
independence of the auditors especially with regard to non audit work. It meets at least twice a year 
including immediately before the submission of the annual and interim financial statements to the Board.   
 
Any new Non-Executive Directors will be asked to join both Committees.   
 
No formal nomination Committee exists in view of the stage of development of the Group. Instead appointments to 
the Board by the Chief Executive and other Executive Directors are discussed with the Non-Executive Chairman. 
Appointments are made after an evaluation of the skills, knowledge, and expertise required ensuring that the Board 
as a whole has the ability to ensure that the Group can continue to compete effectively in its market place.

Internal Control 
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. The Board 
has designed the Group’s system of internal control in order to provide the Directors with reasonable assurance that 
its assets are safeguarded, that transactions are authorised and properly recorded and that material errors and 
irregularities are either prevented or would be detected within a timely period. However, no system of internal 
control can eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives or provide absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.  The key elements of the control system in operation are: 
 
a. The Board meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision and has put in place 
an organisational structure with clear lines of responsibility defined and with appropriate delegation of 
authority;  
 
b. There are procedures for planning, approval and monitoring of capital expenditure and information systems 
for monitoring the Group’s financial performance against approved budgets and projections;  
 
The process adopted by the Group accords with the guidance contained in the document “Internal Control Guidance 
for Directors on the Combined Code” issued by the ICAEW. 
 
The Audit Committee receives reports from the external auditors on a regular basis and from Executive Directors of 
the Group. During the period, the Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control as described 
above. The Board has considered whether the Group’s internal controls processes would be significantly enhanced 
by an internal audit function and has taken the view that at the Group’s current stage of development, this is not 
required. The Board will continue to review this matter each year. The Board receives periodic reports from all 
Committees. 
 
There are no significant issues disclosed in the financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2011 and up to the 
date of approval of the report and financial statements that have required the Board to deal with any related material 
internal control issues. 
 
Relations with Shareholders 
The Group values its dialogue with both institutional and private investors. Effective two-way communication with 
fund managers, institutional investors and analysts is actively pursued and this encompasses issues such as 
performance, policy and strategy. During the period the Directors have had meetings with analysts and institutions 
and will continue to do so. 
 
There is also an opportunity, at the Company’s Annual General Meeting for individual shareholders to raise general 
business matters with the full Board and notice of the Company’s Annual General Meeting is circulated to all 
shareholders at least 20 working days before such meeting. The Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
14 
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
  
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company Financial Statements for each financial year.  
The directors are required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange to prepare Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) 
and have elected under company law to prepare the company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
  
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial 
position and performance of the group; the Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements 
that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to 
their achieving a fair presentation. 
 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period.  
  
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
  
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
  
b. make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
  
c.  for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
adopted by the EU;  
 
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue in business; 
 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Group’s and the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the ClearDebt Group plc website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 
 
15 
 
The Board’s Remuneration Committee, which currently comprises Gerald Carey (Non-Executive Chairman), 
Anthony Leon ( Non-executive director) and David Mond (Chief Executive Officer), makes recommendations to the 
Board within agreed terms of reference in determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Directors, 
including pension rights. 
 
Members of the Committee who have a personal financial interest in the matters to be decided are not involved in 
decisions.  In arriving at its recommendations, the Committee has access to professional advice from both within and 
outside the Company.   
 
Remuneration Policy 
Each remuneration package is reviewed against a background of published comparative information on the 
remuneration of Executive Directors in similar positions, taking into account the industry, the region of 
employment, the type of work and the size of the Company.  The extent to which the recommended remuneration is 
above or below average takes account of the Director’s qualifications and length of service with the Company, the 
Director’s actual performance and the performance of the Company.  This will remain the policy for forthcoming 
years. 
 
Directors’ Emoluments 
The emoluments of the Directors during the financial year ended 30 June 2011 were as follows:

IAS 27 (revised), “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” requires the effects of all transactions with non-
controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control.  These transactions no longer result in 
the recognition of goodwill or gains and losses.  When control is lost, any remaining interest in the entity is re-
measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.  The Company has applied the revised 
standard from 1 July 2010 with no material impact in the year ended 30 June 2011. The revision to IAS 27 
contained consequential amendments to IAS 28, “Investments in Associates” and IAS 31 “Interests in  Joint 
Ventures”. 
 
The following accounting standards, interpretations and amendments have been adopted by the Company since 1 
July 2010 with no significant impact on its results or financial position:

2. Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Basis of Preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRS) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis for the reasons outlined in the Directors’ 
Report on page 10. 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historic cost basis.  The principal accounting policies adopted 
are set out below. 
 
Critical Accounting Estimate and Judgements 
The preparation of the financial information in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various 
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of 
making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are both readily apparent from other 
sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.  The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if  
the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods in the revision affects both 
current and future periods. 
 
The principal balances that have been estimated relate to:- 
- estimates of future cash flows for the goodwill impairment review ( see note 10) 
- estimates in respect of the future recoverability of the deferred tax asset in respect of losses brought 
forward ( see note 15) 
- estimates of the fair value of intangible assets acquired ( see note 18) 
 
Basis of Consolidation 
Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of 
another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary.  The consolidated 
financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed a single 
entity.  Inter-company transactions are therefore eliminated in full. 
 
Business Combinations 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method.  
In the consolidated statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.  The results of acquired operations are 
included in the consolidated income statement from the date on which control is obtained. 
 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.  Cost comprises the fair values of assets given, liabilities 
assumed and equity instruments issued, plus any direct costs of acquisition. 
 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries or business is recognised as a separate asset on the statement of 
financial position after the recognition at fair value of any other intangible assets identified at the time of 
acquisition. 
 
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being recognised immediately 
and charged to the consolidated income statement.  Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities exceeds the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the Group income

statement on the acquisition date.  The Group carries out annual impairment tests for goodwill.  Impairment losses 
in respect of goodwill are not reversed. 
 
Negative Goodwill 
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries or business is recognised in full on the date of acquisition 
and is recorded in the consolidated income statement. 
 
Impairment 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangibles and property, plant and equipment 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.  If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any).  Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent of other assets, the Group estimates 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value is use.  In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future 
cash flows have been adjusted. 
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount, in which case the 
impairment loss is treated as expenses in the consolidated income statement.  
 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
(cash-generating unit) in prior years.  A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless 
the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation increase. 
 
Other Intangible Assets 
Internal and externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised over 
their useful economic lives.  The amortisation expense is shown separately on the face of the Consolidated Income 
Statement.  The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the methods used 
to determine the cost of intangibles acquired in a business combination are as follows:- 
 
Development costs   - 4 years straight line 
Software development costs  - 4 years straight line 
Intangible assets - Debt management back books - 12-18 months straight line 
Intangible assets – Insolvency back books  - 3-4 years straight line  
Other intangibles   - 1 year straight line 
 
Expenditure arising from the Group’s development costs and software development is recognised only if all of the 
following conditions are met: 
 
- an asset is created that can be identified; 
- it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; 
- the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably; 
- the Group has the intention to complete the asset and the ability and intention to use or sell it; 
- sufficient resources are available to complete the development and to either sell or use the asset. 
 
Where the criteria have not been achieved, software development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which it is incurred.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Segmental Reporting  
Management determines its operating segments by identifying components: 
 
a) That engages in business activities that earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses 
relating to transactions with other components of the Group),  
b) Whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker, the board of 
directors of ClearDebt Group plc, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment, and 
c) For which discrete financial information is available. 
 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of amounts receivable or received in relation to a range of services provided 
to clients as follows: 
 
Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVA) 
Fees are earned for arranging and administering IVAs on behalf of individuals experiencing debt problems.  
Generally, revenue is accrued based upon the stage of completion of specific client contracts where the outcome can 
be assessed with reasonable certainty and the value for that service has been agreed between the Group and the 
client. 
 
Nominee fees 
Nominee fees are recognised upon the approval of an IVA proposal at a creditors meeting. 
Supervisory fees 
Supervisory fees are accrued on a monthly basis over the duration of the arrangement as the service is provided. 
 
Protected Trust Deeds (PTD) 
Fees earned in respect of PTDs are recognised when received. 
 
Debt management services 
Fees are receivable for the management of debts on behalf of clients experiencing financial difficulties.  Fees are 
recognised upon receipt of client payments on the basis that these arrangements are informal and there is no 
certainty that economic benefits will accrue until a payment is received. 
 
Commissions 
The Group also receives commission income from the referral of loans and other products.  Commissions are 
recorded as they become due. 
 
Prepayment Card services 
The Group receives a revenue share from the issue and usage charges in respect of the ClearCash prepaid 
MasterCard. Income and charges are recognised in the period in which they were incurred by the card user.   
 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
All property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost.  Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write 
off the cost less residual value of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows: 
 
Leasehold improvements  - 25% straight line 
Fixtures and fittings   - 25% straight line 
 
Residual value and estimated remaining lives are reviewed annually. 
 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event 
which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reliably estimated.  If the effect of 
time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows as a pre-
tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.  ClearDebt Group plc

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Share-based Compensation 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of services received in exchange for the grant of 
options or warrants.  The fair value determined is recognised as an expense if it relates to trading activities or in the 
share premium account if it relates to the issue of equity instruments.  The total amount to be expensed over the 
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options or warrants granted, excluding the impact 
of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and growth targets).  Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in the assumptions about the number of options or warrants that are expected to become 
exercisable.   
 
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options or warrants that are expected to 
become exercisable.  It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
and a corresponding adjustment to reserves over the remaining vesting period. 
 
The proceeds received net of any attributed transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options or warrants are exercised. 
 
Non vesting conditions which are not satisfied during the vesting period, are treated as cancellations and any 
remaining expense is accelerated in the period of failure. 
 
Share based payments associated with share options granted to employees of subsidiaries of the parent company are 
treated as an expense of the subsidiary company to be settled by equity of the parent company. The share based 
payment expense increases the value of the parent company’s investment in the subsidiaries and is credited to the 
Share based payment reserve. 
 
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations. 
 
Leasing 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant 
lease. 
 
Financial Instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has 
become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are classified as loans and other receivables in accordance with IAS 39, measured on initial 
recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the consolidated income statement 
when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.  The allowance recognised is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective 
interest rate computed at initial recognition. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are classified as other loans and 
receivables in accordance with IAS 39. 
 
For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts as defined above.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  An 
instrument will be classified as a financial liability when there is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another 
financial asset to another enterprise. 
 
Trade and other payables  
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. They are classified as “Other liabilities” in accordance with IAS 39. 
 
Borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loads and overdrafts are classified as “other liabilities” in accordance with IAS 39.  They are 
initially recorded at their fair value, net of any issue costs associated with borrowings.  Borrowings are subsequently 
stated at amortised cost. 
 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, are expensed to the income statement 
over the term of the instrument using an effective rate of interest and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. 
 
Secured Convertible Loan notes 
Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity 
component. At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market 
interest rate for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan 
notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the 
liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity. 
 
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their 
relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.  The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly 
against equity. 
 
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for 
similar non-convertible debt to the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to 
the carrying value of the convertible loan note. 
 
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense.  Taxable losses differ from 
net profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are next taxable or deductible.  The 
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the reporting date. 
 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements are the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, 
and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.  Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences  and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probably that taxable profits will 
be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.  Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled based upon tax rates that have been exacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.  
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
 
3. Segmental Information 
 
The Group’s total income, profit before taxation and net assets were all derived from its principal activities being 
the provision of IVA and other financial advice and appropriate solutions to individuals experiencing personal debt 
problems.  All the Group’s activities were undertaken wholly in the United Kingdom.

The calculation of the basic earnings per ordinary share of 0.02p (2010:  0.11p) each has been based on the profit 
for the relevant financial year and on 308,340,567 shares (2010: 308,340,567).  This represents the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue.  The profit for the period for the purpose of calculating the diluted 
earnings per share is the same as for the basic earnings per share calculation adjusted in respect of the interest 
charges in relation to the convertible loan notes. After using this adjusted profit the diluted earnings per share is 
higher than the basic earnings per share and would therefore not be dilutive under the terms of IAS 33.

Impairment reviews 
 
The total carrying value of £4,402,280 relating to goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.  This comprises 
£3,013,374 relating to the insolvency business and £1,388,906 relating to the debt management business.  
 
During the year the goodwill of £55,612 relating to the acquisition of the Debt Advice Portal was provided for in 
full. Whilst the software is still available for use the referrals that might be received are not presently being 
channelled through the Portal and accordingly the goodwill has been written down.  
 
For the purposes of impairment review the recoverable amount has been calculated as the value in use based on 
discounted future cash flow projections for a five year period based on approved budgets for 3 years and assuming 
no growth for the remaining 2 years. 
 
Goodwill arising on ClearDebt acquisition (insolvency business) – critical accounting estimates and 
judgements in relation to the impairment review on the insolvency business 
 
Monthly revenue projections assume that the number of IVA cases approved will double over the next 2 years 
through the acquisition of new lead sources and remain steady thereafter. Nominee fees per case are expected to 
remain at current levels together with average supervisory fees, and IVAs lasting a maximum of 5 years.  Expenses 
are expected to rise 25% in the first year and remaining steady thereafter.  The appropriate discount factor used in 
the calculations is 10%. 
 
Assumptions are based on recent experience and estimates of how economic conditions may affect levels of activity 
in the business taking into account managements strategy for growth.  
 
The Group’s cost of capital could increase to 43% or insolvency income fall short of projections by 31% without a 
matching fall in expenses before the carrying value of this part of goodwill would exceed the value in use.

Impairment review on the debt management business 
 
Projections have been produced covering a five year period.  Revenues are expected to fall by 10% in the first and 
second year and remain flat over the remaining period.  Expenses are expected to increase by 10% in year 1 and 
remain constant in the remaining years.  
 
The assumptions are based on recent experience of monthly growth and estimates of how economic conditions will 
affect levels of activity in the business.  The discount factor used in the calculations is 10%. 
 
The Group’s debt management income would need to fall short of projections by 68% without a matching fall in 
expenses or the Group’s cost of capital increase to 34% before the carrying value of this part of goodwill would 
exceed the value in use.

On 16 April 2010 £2.3m of 3 year 10% Secured Convertible Loan notes were issued by CDG (Guernsey) Limited,  a 
wholly owned subsidiary of ClearDebt Group plc, to investors. Holders of the loan notes are entitled to interest on 
the loan notes at a rate of 10% per annum payable on a quarterly basis and have an option to convert all or part of 
their holdings at par into ordinary shares at any time in ClearDebt Group plc at a price of 1.8p per share. At the end 
of the 3 year period the principal is repayable in cash plus a premium of 25% in respect of any holdings that are not 
converted into ordinary shares at the loan note holder’s option. 
 
The Loan Notes are secured by way of a debenture dated 19 April 2010 over the assets of the Group. The Company 
has also entered into a cross guarantee with CDG (Guernsey) Limited in respect of the convertible loan notes. 
 
In 2010 the directors determined the financial liability component of this compound instrument by calculating the 
net present values of the cash flows in respect of the interest and principal payments (assuming all are redeemed in 
cash and not taken as shares) over the next three years using a discount rate of 17% which the directors consider 
would have been the interest payable on a bank loan without the convertible element. Accordingly the loan notes are 
recorded at £2,303,309 (2010:  £2,065,350).  
 
At 30 June 2011 D E M Mond was interested in £500,000 of the secured convertible loan notes (2010: £500,000). 
 
The loan from D E M Mond of £1,015,000 ( 2010: £700,000) is repayable on 31 March 2013 or earlier at the 
Group’s discretion although there is a confirmation in place that this support will continue should the Group not be 
in a position to repay the loan and continue to meet other liabilities as they fall due.  Loan repayments may only be 
made with permission of the secured convertible loan note holders on condition that forecasts show minimum 
working capital of £500,000 for the 6 months following repayment.  Interest at a rate of 10.5% totalling £64,444 
(2010: £115,513) was paid by the Group to D E M Mond in the year in respect of his loans. Interest of £230,000 was 
paid to the secured convertible loan note holders in the year (2010: £44,924).  ClearDebt Group plc

The deferred tax asset primarily relates to tax losses available to offset against future taxable profits in ClearDebt 
Group plc. Forecasts have been prepared for the next 5 years which show that there will be insufficient profits in the 
holding company to enable all of the losses brought forward to be utilised in this time frame. Accordingly an 
additional provision of £75,000 has been charged to the income statement in respect of these losses carried forward. 
It is the directors’ opinion that the remaining losses will be recoverable over this time period.

During the year the Group purchased goodwill and assets from certain companies (see note 18). Following the 
estimation of the fair values of the assets purchased the Group provided £19,514 (2010:£105,840) in respect of 
deferred taxation in relation to the acquisitions. During the year £49,986 (2010: £37,101) of provision relating to 
acquisitions has been released to the profit and loss account based upon the revenue received to date as a 
proportion of the total estimated revenue to be received at the time of acquisition.

The Deferred Ordinary Shares of 1.5p each carry the same rights as the Ordinary 0.5p shares save that they do not 
carry any rights to vote at general meetings or any rights to receive dividends. The Deferred Ordinary Shares are not 
capable of transfer at any time without the prior written consent of the Directors and have the right to repayment of 
the paid up capital only on any winding up or return of capital. It is the intention of the Board to seek Court approval 
to cancel the Deferred Ordinary Shares and the Share Premium Account in due course.   
 
The Company has granted equity settled share options to selected directors and employees under an EMI scheme. 
The exercise price is the market value of the shares at the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the 
options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant then they are forfeited. 
  
At 30 June 2011 there were 11,312,500 (2010: 11,750,000) share options outstanding over the Company’s ordinary

18. Acquisition (continued) 
 
Included in the results for the year are revenues of £193,995 and a pre-tax profit of £9,038 excluding the gain on 
purchase of a bargain asset of £54,985. 
 
We have estimated the timing of, and the expected future income due, from the back books acquired less a provision 
for future expected delinquency together with the estimated costs necessary to collect in the income. This has been 
produced on a net present value basis to provide an estimate of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.  
 
The fair value of the net assets acquired was £1,143,768 which is in excess of the £1,088,783 cost of acquisition. 
Accordingly under IFRS the Consolidated Income Statement has been credited with a gain on bargain purchase of 
£54,985 in the period.

20. Financial instruments 
 
It is not the Group’s policy to enter into financial derivatives.  The nature of the Group’s operating activities exposes 
it to credit risk.  The Group finances its operations from cash resources, short term loans and convertible debt. At 
present the financial risks arising from the Group’s financing arrangements are considered to be minimal but the 
Board will continue to review its existing policies on an ongoing basis. 
 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s objective is to minimise its exposure to the effects of fluctuations in interest rates whilst balancing this 
against the need to minimise borrowing costs.  To manage exposure to interest rate risk the Group has taken all 
borrowings on a fixed interest rate.  The only assets that attract a cash flow risk are cash and cash equivalents. 
 
Liquidity risk 
It is the Group’s policy to manage liquidity in order to achieve continuity of funding.  This is managed by detailed 
projections and monitoring of expenditure with significant items of expenditure requiring approval of senior 
management.

20. Financial instruments (continued) 
 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group has no overseas assets or liabilities. 
 
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets 
All the financial assets of the Group were floating rate or non interest bearing assets.  Floating rate financial assets 
comprise cash deposits on call and interest was received at a rate of 1.25%.  At 30 June 2011 interest bearing 
financial assets of the Group totalled £53,489 (2010: £30,016). 
 
Credit risk 
The Group’s objective is to minimise credit risk as far as possible whilst maximising returns on financial assets.  
The financial assets of the Group are placed on money markets with the Group’s bankers and other banks.  As such 
the Group is exposed to counter party risks with respect to deposits placed with its bankers.  Financial institutions in 
which deposits are made are selected based on their credit rating as well as the returns offered. 
 
There is an inherent risk of default in trade receivables.  The Group minimises its risk by ensuring that IVAs are 
only entered into appropriately to minimise the risk of failure of the IVA.  The risk of default will generally only 
arise if an IVA fails in the first 6 months. 
 
Details of exposure of the trade receivables are shown at note 12.  The total exposure to the Group at 30 June 2011 
in respect of trade receivables and cash amounts to £1,756,786 (2010: £1,546,667). 
 
Capital 
The Group defines capital as equity and long term debt. 
 
The Group’s objective for managing capital is to balance the risk and reward to shareholders by ensuring an 
appropriate level of gearing.  There are no restrictions on the makeup of the Group’s capital. 
 
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities 
The financial liabilities of the Group are all non interest bearing other than the loans which attract a fixed rate of 
interest as described in note 14. 
 
 
Maturity of financial liabilities 
The maturity profile of the Group’s loans as at 30 June 2011 was as follows:

22.   Contingent Liabilities  
 
In December 2009 certain insolvency assets of Relax were purchased from its Administrator and the insolvency 
related employees were taken on as part of the purchase. Claims have been received from four former employees of 
Relax Group plc who did not work in the insolvency businesses alleging that they should have transferred to 
Company as a result of the acquisition. These claims are being vigorously defended and are listed for tribunal 
hearings over the coming months. We are confident of success given the legal advice received at the time of the 
acquisition. To date all legal costs have been borne by the Company’s employment insurers although there may be 
potential liabilities in respect of any awards that may ultimately be made against the Company.  
 
The directors are satisfied on the basis of information presently held that no provision is required at the present time.  ClearDebt Group plc

1.     Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Basis of Accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). 
 
Deferred Taxation 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less 
tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.  Timing differences are the differences between the 
Company taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and 
losses in tax arrangements in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that 
there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be 
deducted. 
 
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  Deferred tax is measured on a 
non-discounted basis. 
 
Cash Flow Statement 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by FRS1 not to present a cash flow statement. 
 
Investments  
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost except where in the opinion of the directors, there has been permanent 
diminution in the value of the investments, in which case an appropriate adjustment is made. 
 
Share-Based Compensation 
Equity-settled share based payments are measured at the fair value of services received in exchange for the grant of 
options or warrants.  The fair value determined is recognised as an expense if it relates to trading activities or in the 
share premium account if it relates to the issue of equity instruments.  The total amount to be expensed over the 
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options or warrants granted, excluding the impact of 
any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and growth targets).  Non-market vesting conditions 
are included in the assumptions about the number of options or warrants that are expected to become exercisable.  At 
each balance sheet date, the company revises its estimates of the number of options or warrants that are expected to 
become exercisable.  It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
and a corresponding adjustment to reserves over the remaining vesting period. 
 
The proceeds received net of any attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options or warrants are exercised. 
 
Non vesting conditions which are not satisfied during the vesting period are treated as cancellations and any 
remaining expense is accelerated in the period of failure. Share based payments associated with share options 
granted to employees of subsidiaries of the parent company are treated as an expense of the subsidiary company to 
be settled by equity of the parent company. The share based payment expense increases the value of the parent 
company’s investment in the subsidiaries and is credited to the Share based payment reserve. 
 
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations.  ClearDebt Group plc

1.   Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Tangible Fixed Assets  
All tangible fixed assets are initially recorded at cost.  Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the 
cost less residual value of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows: 
 
Fixtures and fittings   -  25% straight line 
 
Residual value and estimated remaining lives are reviewed annually. 
 
Other Intangible Assets 
Internal and externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised over 
their useful economic lives. The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the 
methods used to determine the cost of intangibles acquired in a business combination are as follows:- 
 
Other intangibles – websites and databases  - 3 years straight line 
 
Loss attributable to the Members of the Parent Company 
 
The Company has taken advantage of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own profit 
and loss account for these financial statements.  The loss dealt with in the accounts of the parent company was 
£701,807 (2010: £435,574).

carry any rights to vote at general meetings or any rights to receive dividends. The Deferred Ordinary Shares are not 
capable of transfer at any time without the prior written consent of the Directors and have the right to repayment of 
the paid up capital only on any winding up or return of capital. It is the intention of the Board to seek Court approval 
to cancel the Deferred Ordinary Shares and the Share Premium Account in due course.

12.   Contingent Liabilities  
 
In December 2009 certain insolvency assets of Relax were purchased from its Administrator and the insolvency 
related employees were taken on as part of the purchase. Claims have been received from four former employees of 
Relax Group plc who did not work in the insolvency businesses alleging that they should have transferred to 
Company as a result of the acquisition.  These claims are being vigorously defended and are listed for tribunal 
hearings over the coming months. We are confident of success given the legal advice received at the time of the 
acquisition. To date all legal costs have been borne by the Company’s employment insurers although there may be 
potential liabilities in respect of any awards that may ultimately be made against the Company.  
 
The directors are satisfied on the basis of information presently held that no provision is required at the present time.  ClearDebt Group plc

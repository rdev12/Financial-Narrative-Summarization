Following the upheaval of our
major US reorganisation last year ,
2002/3 has been a period of
consolidation and steady progress
for the Plasmon Group. Despite
poor economic conditions in the
US and uncertainty created by the
war in Iraq, our full year revenues
fell by only 2% to £60. 1m compared
to £61 .6m the previous year .

Pre-tax profit before goodwill amortisation,
UDO development costs and exceptional
costs increased 29% to £4.7m and the
retained loss for the full year reduced 41%
to £3.4m. Having incurred a loss of £2.4m
in the first half, the retained loss in the
second half fell to £1 .0m as post
reorganisation cost savings were realised.
Despite the poor trading conditions our
channel sales in the US increased by 4%
in dollar terms. As expected, sales to IBM
decreased a further 35% in 2002/3
resulting in an overall US revenue decline
of 3% in local currency terms, translating
into a fall of 10% after unfavourable foreign
exchange movements. Our US business
represented 66% of Group sales in 2002/3
and the level of activity in the US market
therefore remains a critical driver of our
overall business performance.
Having achieved 6% revenue growth last
year , our European channel sales grew a
further 15% in 2002/3 as we continue to
increase market share in our core 5.25"
library business. In August we secured
Siemens as a major new DVD library
customer and we expect this relationship
to drive further growth in the coming year .
European economic conditions were 
more favourable than the US last year 
and we also benefited from a stronger
European regional presence than many 
of our US competitors.
Our UDO development programme
continues to make excellent progress and
we successfully demonstrated working
UDO drives at the Comdex trade show in
Las Vegas in November . The overall cost of
the UDO development programme
remains broadly in line with our plans and
we are on schedule to begin initial
shipments in September this year . 
We are receiving an excellent response from
potential OEM customers and expect UDO
technology to establish a leading position in
professional optical storage solutions.
Recent changes in financial compliance
regulations are also driving the market
requirements for secure data archival
solutions like UDO and we look forward to
commencing deliveries of this exciting new
product in the coming financial year .
In June 2002 we raised a further £1.7m net
of expenses, by way of a 5% Placing, to
support the purchase of capital equipment
for UDO at a time when equipment leasing
was proving difficult to secure. In February
2003 we further improved our available
financial resources with a £7m structured
finance facility that provides us with ample
liquidity to complete our UDO
development and launch plans. Our
financial position remains comfortable with
gearing of 34% at year end.
Although trading in the past year was
difficult, we start the new financial year
well positioned to complete the UDO
development and capitalise on its
significant potential. Our UDO launch
plans are well advanced and we believe
the timing is excellent to deliver a
performance leading data archival solution
at a time of growing compliance
regulation. After a period of significant
contraction the IT market is also forecast
to return to modest growth, which we
expect to drive increased revenue and
profitability in our core business in the
coming year .
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank
all our employees for their dedication and
hard work over the past year .

2002/3 has been another challenging
year for Plasmon with difficult economic
conditions and the continuing decline 
in our business with IBM depressing
overall revenues from £61 .6m to £60. 1 m.
In contrast to the disappointing trading
performance, our UDO development
programme made excellent progress in
2002/3 and we completed successfully
the transfer of our library business from
Minneapolis to Colorado Springs.

T urnover £ million In the first half of 2002/3, the Group
returned to modest growth with revenues
3% ahead at £30.1m. As we experienced
last year , our European operations
performed better than our business in the
US where economic conditions remained
difficult. In the final quarter of 2002/3 our
US business was further impacted by
events in the Middle East, and coupled
with a 10% movement in the average £:$
exchange rate our overall second half
revenues declined 7% from the previous
year . Since the cessation of hostilities we
are seeing increasing signs of activity in
the US, but we remain cautious about the
timing of any upturn in business. In
contrast, our European business grew
17% in 2002/3 and we expect to make
further progress in the coming year .
In light of the difficult trading conditions
our US reorganisation has proved both
timely and extremely necessary. The
reorganisation was finally completed in
September 2002 when the last library
engineers left our Minneapolis engineering
operation. These engineers were retained
for six months longer than the
manufacturing group to complete the new
Enterprise DVD library range that we
developed specifically for our major
medical imaging customers such as
Siemens Medical. From a peak of some
314 US employees in 2001, the US
reorganisation programme reduced the
headcount to 225 by April 2003. In
addition, we reduced our European
headcount by some 20 employees as part
of our overall cost control programme.
In 2002/3 our overall product mix remained
broadly constant and, in line with the sales
shortfall, our gross margins declined
slightly to 36.3% from 36.7% the previous
year . Following our reorganisation,
operating expenses before UDO
development expenditure, goodwill
amortisation and exceptional costs fell by
£2.0m to £16.4m. At the adjusted pre-tax
level we achieved a profit of £4.7m
compared to the £3.7m we achieved the
previous year . At the pre-tax level we
significantly reduced our full year loss to
£3.4m from £6.3m, after goodwill
amortisation of £1.1m and the final £0.5m
of US reorganisation costs.
UDO development expenditure increased
by 24% to £6.5m in 2002/3 as we entered
the final development phase of the drive
and media. The increased expenditure
was slightly ahead of our original
expectations and reflected additional
costs in reworking ASIC parts and the
consequent increase in quick-turn
prototype costs to keep the project on
schedule. In addition to fully expensed
development costs of £6.5m, we invested
a further £3.9m in capital equipment in
2002/3 as the UDO media production
facility in Melbourn neared completion.
Despite maintaining significant levels of
investment in 2002/3, our year-end gearing
remained comfortable at 34% compared
to 24% the previous year .
In March 2003 we secured new £7m
banking facilities with Venture Finance Plc,
the UK structured finance subsidiary of
ABN Amro. These new financing
arrangements have increased our
immediate liquidity by some £3.4m and
will provide sufficient funding to
complete UDO development and enter
volume production. Plasmon Plc

UDO Development
Ultra Density Optical (‘UDO’) is the next
generation of 5.25" drives and media that we
are developing to succeed the existing
9.1GB MO products we source from Sony .
UDO employs the latest blue laser
technology that provides an increased 30GB
capacity and a five-fold decrease in
incremental storage cost over existing MO
systems. Since commencing development
in 1999 we have worked closely with HP on
the project and expect them to become the
major OEM customer for UDO technology .
Since the successful demonstration of
working drives at Comdex last November ,
we have continued to make good progress
with our UDO development programme and
are now reading and writing data reliably in
form-factor drives. The final phases of the
development are now underway and involve
manufacturing increasingly large batches of
prototype drives and media to de-bug the
system fully and maximise performance
and reliability.
The UDO drive employs four ASIC chips that
have been specifically designed by Plasmon
and our development partners. Successful
development of these ASICs represented
one of the major risks in the UDO
programme but three of them are now
complete and fully tested. The final Optical
Disc Controller (ODC) chip has exhibited
some speed limitations during testing but a
revised design has now been released to
fabrication which should solve the
outstanding issues. Our total capital
investment in the ASICs will be some £3m
but they are critical to achieving the low
volume production costs that will allow UDO
to compete effectively in the market. 
Another area of significant risk in the UDO
programme was the availability of blue lasers
UDO optical media will be
manufactured in Cambridge and
will be available in both write-once
and rewritable formats  Plasmon Plc 
Annual Report 2003
Chief Executive’s Review

from Nichia, our Japanese supplier . In
December 2002 Nichia announced a new
agreement to collaborate with Sony on blue
laser development for use in Sony’ s ‘Blu-ray’
consumer video products. Nichia also
informed Plasmon that due to yield problems
with their existing laser , they were moving to
a revised laser design employing elements of
Sony technology . W e have now successfully
integrated the new lasers into our UDO
drives and we are confident that their
performance and reliability will comfortably
exceed our requirements.
The opto-mechanical assembly (‘OMA ’) for
the UDO drive is being developed by Pentax,
the leading Japanese optical technology
company . The hard tooling for the OMA is
now complete and we are currently
integrating production quality units into our
prototype drives. Our working relationship
with Pentax continues to be excellent and we
have recently despatched one of our
Japanese speaking engineers to Japan for
18 months to help transition the OMA to a
low cost volume production facility .
UDO media development is also making
good progress and we now have the majority
of the disk manufacturing equipment
installed at our facility in Melbourn. The new
cleanroom is fully commissioned and when
complete the production line will have a total
capacity of some 80,000 write-once and
rewritable UDO disks per month.
Development of the phase change recording
layers for UDO media is proceeding well and
the specification of the write-once disk is
now finalised for volume production. This will
employ a four layer structure based on phase
change technology licenced from Kodak that
we also use on our existing 12-inch optical
disk products. W e are therefore very familiar
with the manufacturing process for this
material and are confident a high yield
process will be achieved.
The rewritable phase change disk is in its final
testing phase and will employ an eight layer
structure to optimise rewrite cycle
performance, environmental longevity and
manufacturability . In January 2003 we signed
a licence agreement with Mitsubishi
Chemical Media (‘MCM’) for their patents
and technologies for improving rewrite cycle
and cross erase performance in phase
change rewritable media. Using MCM’ s
technology we have already exceeded the
UDO specification of 10,000 rewrite cycles
and with further optimisation, believe that
25,000 cycles may be achievable.
MCM are the world’ s largest optical disk
manufacturer and as well as first class
technical know-how , they have an excellent
quality reputation with the major OEM
customers such as HP and IBM. W e
continue to work closely with HP on their
UDO plans and as they move towards UDO
endorsement they are pressing MCM to be
the second source media manufacturer .
Major partners such as HP and MCM will be
critical in establishing UDO as the de-facto
standard in professional optical storage and
we continue to use every effort to secure
their endorsement of UDO.
Having established the UDO media
production facility and commenced trial
production runs, we are now working on
improvements to the 0.1mm cover layer
process to reduce volume production costs.
W e have recently approved a European
supplier of optical grade 0.1mm film that has
reduced our material costs by some 75%
over Far East suppliers. In addition, we are
also working on a new liquid spin coating
technique that is now providing excellent
uniformity and will dramatically reduce future
production costs.
The media cartridge is an important
component in the overall robustness and
reliability of UDO technology and has been
an area of intense focus over the last year .
W e have recently taken delivery of initial
samples from the final production tooling and
are now working with Dai-Nippon, our
Japanese supplier , to move volume
production to China to minimise long term
cartridge manufacturing costs.
Overall, the UDO development programme
is progressing well and we are on schedule
to make initial product deliveries in
September 2003. As expected, UDO’ s
common technology base with consumer
Blu-ray products continues to provide
technology leverage opportunities and will
ensure our long-term manufacturing costs
remain competitive.

UDO launch plans
In addition to the drive and media
development programme, during the past
year we have invested considerable time
and resources on our UDO launch plans.
We successfully recruited new marketing
leadership in both the US and Europe and
are now adding business development
resources specifically focused on UDO to
our sales and marketing teams.
The launch programme for UDO initially
focused on trade shows and started with
the first demonstration of working UDO
drives at Comdex in November 2002. We
also demonstrated the products at the
AIIM show in New Y ork and Cebit in
Hanover , which is the largest IT trade show
in Europe. In addition to the product
demonstrations, we also presented a
series of seminars that explained UDO
technology and its positioning in the
overall storage market. We received a
considerable level of interest from these
initial activities and UDO is now well
known in the storage industry.
We are now commencing the second
phase of our launch activities with a
technical conference for third party
software vendors to enable them to
understand the technology and integrate it
into their software applications. We are
also planning a series of press and media
tours later in the year to generate general
awareness of UDO and increase its
exposure as we move into initial
production shipments.
The final element of our UDO launch plan
has focused on potential OEM customers
and our efforts to educate them and
support their integration activities. The
overall response to UDO has been
excellent and we believe the superior cost-
UDO drives will be manufactured 
in our Colorado Springs facility and
will have an initial capacity of
30GB. Future generations of UDO
products will have capacities of 60
and 120GB Plasmon Plc

performance benefits of the technology
should attract significant OEM
endorsement over the coming months. 
Storage market overview
The storage market continues to be a
significant portion of the overall IT market
and the revenue declines of the last few
years stabilised in 2002/3. Storage
technology is now entering a period of
significant change that will provide a
number of opportunities and challenges
for Plasmon in the near future.
The drive towards networked storage
continues to gather momentum with the
goal of eradicating ‘islands of information’
and making all data available across the
enterprise. Networked storage is therefore
driving the requirements for storage area
networks (‘SAN’) and network attached
storage (‘NAS’) solutions and the
consequent need for Plasmon’s optical
library solutions to integrate seamlessly
into these environments.
Another important development in the
storage market last year was the arrival of
cheap, high performance Serial-A T A hard
disk drives. Due to their low cost, these
products are now being promoted in 
disk-to-disk back-up solutions that are
challenging the traditional market for 
back-up using tape libraries. In addition, the
low-end tape library market largely moved
to a commodity model last year with the
large PC brands beginning to promote
products directly to the end user , bypassing
traditional storage hardware channels.
From Plasmon’s perspective, the most
important development in the storage
market has been the recognition of the
importance of secure archival storage
following the high profile corporate and
securities fraud cases in the US last year .
There are now growing compliance
regulations in most industry sectors to
mandate how electronic records must be
archived. These regulations are driving
strong interest in data archival products
such as UDO. These developments have
also attracted the attention of traditional
hard disk vendors such as EMC and
Network Appliance, who are offering
Serial-A T A disk based solutions with
enhanced software to prevent data
deletion as an alternative to traditional
write-once optical archive solutions.
These changes and developments in the
storage market are generally very
beneficial for Plasmon as we launch our
UDO archive solutions in the coming year .
However , the downside is in our tape
business where we expect revenue growth
to remain difficult in a market under severe
margin pressure. In addition, the trend
towards networked storage solutions will
require updating of Plasmon’s NAS
connectivity offerings to improve the ease
of deployment of our UDO products.
5.25" T echnology
Over the past few years, our sales of 5.25"
optical libraries to IBM have declined by
some 60% as they continue to sell last
generation 5.2GB write-once solutions
and have not adopted the latest 9.1GB
technology. In December 2002 we signed
a new contract with IBM to provide native
support for Plasmon libraries on their
iSeries (AS400) server platforms. In the
future, this new agreement will enable
Plasmon to sell UDO libraries directly to
the IBM customer base to replace sales of
the previous generation products we
currently supply to IBM on an OEM basis.
Plasmon brand channel sales of 5.25"
products continued to grow last year but
failed to make up the IBM shortfall. Overall
sales of 5.25" technology declined some
6% to £24.9m as cheaper DVD solutions
increased their market penetration but we
also increased our market share in 5.25"
libraries at the expense of Hewlett
Packard. Our strengthening position 
will serve as an ideal launch point for 
UDO solutions in 2003 when we expect
the increased capacity and fivefold
decrease in incremental cost of UDO 
will drive renewed growth in our core 
5.25" business.
During the past year we continued to migrate
customers to our new G-Series range of
5.25" libraries and away from the older 
M-Series products. We now plan to end of
life the M-Series at the end of 2003 which
is also planned to be the last shipment date
for the IBM 3995 variant of the product.
In late 2002 our automation engineering
team in Colorado Springs commenced
development of a new range of entry level
G-Series libraries. These products will
have capacities from 24 to 180 cartridges
and provide market leading features at a
lower cost than our existing products. 
First shipments are scheduled to coincide
with initial UDO shipments in September
2003 and we are already seeing strong
OEM interest in the cost/performance
attributes of the new range. The new
products have also been designed to
accommodate our next generation NAS
hardware internally to provide integrated
network storage solutions.
The market for 5.25" products has been 
in slow decline in recent years as lower
cost DVD solutions have emerged.
However , UDO will redress this cost
disadvantage and we expect some major
OEM’s to endorse the technology in 2003,
which will lead to renewed growth for 
5.25" products and the establishment of
UDO as the de-facto professional optical
storage standard. Plasmon Plc
Annual Report 2003
Chief Executive’s Review

12" T echnology
The 12" business continues to be a major
part of Plasmon’s total revenue mix but
overall sales declined some 17% to
£19.6m. The majority of the reduction
was in sales of new drives that declined
58% to £1.4m as 12" solutions become
prohibitively expensive and customers
wait for UDO technology. Sales of 12"
media and service declined a more
modest 12% in total to £7.5m and
£10.1m, respectively.
The change in our 12" business was in line
with our expectations and the rate of
decline should slow as new drive sales
cease and the business becomes a media
and service annuity. The 12" customer
base is firmly wedded to write-once optical
storage solutions and is showing strong
interest in the significant cost advantages
of UDO technology. We are now working
on upgrade and conversion programmes
to migrate these customers to UDO but
still expect to enjoy significant revenues
from 12" media and service for several
more years.
CD/DVD
In response to demand from our major
medical imaging customers such as
Siemens Medical and GE Medical, we
introduced the Enterprise D-Series library
last year with a capacity of up to 2,175
discs. The library is derived from our G-
Series 5.25" platform and its development
was completed ahead of schedule in late
2002 by the outgoing Minneapolis
engineering team. 
The response to the Enterprise D has been
excellent and helped CD/DVD sales grow
139% to £6.5m last year . In mid-year we
secured Siemens Medical as a major new
customer for this product and the medical
imaging market in general is adopting DVD
technology because of its low cost. The low
performance of DVD solutions also
matches the infrequent access
requirements of the medical imaging
market, but the reduced reliability and ease
of use of DVD remains a major concern.
However , we expect UDO to regain market
share in this area as it offers higher
performance and reliability at the same
price point as DVD based solutions.
Consultancy
Our optical media consultancy business
had another excellent year in 2002/3 with
revenue growth of 9% to £3.9m compared
to £3.6m the previous year . During the year
we signed significant new agreements
with Intel Research to develop high-
density phase change storage technology
and with Unaxis AG, to develop 0.1mm
cover layer technology for volume Blu-ray
disc production.
Our CD-R and DVD-R consultancy
business with Ciba Specialty Chemicals
also performed well in 2002/3 and we
estimate the Plasmon-Ciba Ultragreen CD-
R dye has a 65% share of the world-wide
market for CD-R dyes. After a considerable
delay due to technical issues, Ciba will
finally launch a new DVD-R dye in mid 2003
and we expect this to drive significant future
royalty growth as recording video to DVD’ s
becomes a mainstream application.
L TO T ape
Our L TO tape library business was a major
disappointment in 2002/3 with revenues flat
at £1.4m. Although we successfully
completed our product range with the
Exabyte autoloader acquisition and
secured the necessary software support,
the market has since commodotised with
the entry of major PC brands such as Dell
with very aggressive pricing. In light of these
changes, we are reviewing our overall tape
strategy to position our products as part of
higher value added solutions and
consequently expect to achieve only
modest growth for this part of our business.
Software and Connectivity
Sales of our connectivity solutions, which
are included in the relevant major product
category, returned to growth last year with
revenues increasing 60% to £0.8m. During
the year we secured Siemens Medical as a
major new customer for our integrated
NAS connectivity solution to integrate with
the Enterprise DVD libraries they also
purchase from Plasmon. We expect this
trend for major customers to purchase
integrated connectivity and library
solutions from one vendor to increase in
the future and are already discussing
another major opportunity in the medical
imaging market.
We believe the move to networked storage
solutions will continue to be a major trend
within the storage market. Late in 2002 we
commenced development of a new range
of NAS-RAID products that will integrate
internally in our new G-Series libraries and
will provide industry standard connectivity
and performance to optical archive
solutions. The new solutions will be based
on Serial-A T A RAID and Linux software
and will significantly reduce the cost and
complexity of deploying UDO technology.
Other
The majority of this business sector
relates to our optical mastering business
in Caen which had an excellent year in
2002/3 and grew revenues by 31% to
£2.9m. The majority of production is now
CD-R and DVD video masters which we
supply to most of the major disc
manufacturers in the Far East. We are
now entering volume production of DVD-
R masters and expect this to drive further
growth in the coming year.
Longer term we plan to manufacture
masters for Blu-ray video discs and during
the past year we commenced
development of these products. Our
experience with UDO is proving highly
beneficial in this area and should enable
Plasmon to become a leading supplier of
masters and stampers for consumer disc
formats based on blue laser technology. Plasmon Plc

Outlook
2002/3 has been a year of consolidation
for Plasmon in which we maintained stable
revenues and significantly reduced our
cost base at a time of industry and
economic downturn. We also made
excellent progress with our UDO
development programme and we are
confident of delivering a world-class
product and securing major OEM support
for our technology in the coming year .
Due to the high profile corporate fraud
cases of the past few years, the market for
secure archival storage products that
provide unalterable records of business
transactions and agreements is very
strong. We are therefore launching UDO at
an ideal time and we believe the inherent
cost and performance features of UDO will
ensure it is highly competitive in the
archival storage market. On this basis we
look forward to the future with confidence
and expect UDO technology to deliver
long-term growth in revenues and
profitability for the Plasmon Group.
Sales of integrated storage solutions
comprising libraries, servers and
Plasmon storage management
software are expected to increase

Finance Director’s Review

The US reorganisation was finally
completed in September 2002 when the
Minneapolis library development
operations were relocated to Colorado
Springs at an exceptional cost of £0.5m,
principally comprising employment related
severance costs. 
The UDO drive and media development
programmes continue to make good
progress with working prototypes being
demonstrated at trade shows in both the
US and Europe. During the year ended 31
March 2003, £6.5m of UDO development
costs were fully expensed and a further
£3.9m was spent on related capital
purchases. T o assist in the funding of the
UDO capital expenditure, £1.7m of cash
was raised through a successful 5%
placing completed in June 2002. 
In March 2003 we completed a new £7m
debt and working capital facility with
Venture Finance PLC that is committed for
three years. We also renewed the $10m
facility with Silicon Valley Bank for a further
year in May 2003 and we now have
sufficient funds to complete the UDO
development project and marketing
launch initiatives. 
Turnover
Turnover fell by 2% to £60.1m from
£61.6m in the previous year, after a
£1.6m adverse foreign exchange
movement on US sales. Sales to IBM
also declined a further £4m as
anticipated, however, this was largely
offset by increased channel sales. 
In geographical terms, US origin revenues
decreased by 11% to £39.6m due to the
adverse foreign exchange impact
compounded by the decline in IBM sales.
In contrast, European origin sales rose by
17% to £20.5m due to strong channel
sales, particularly in the UK and Germany,
and increased sales by our mastering
business in Caen, Northern France.
Operating profit
Operating profits excluding UDO
development costs, goodwill amortisation
and exceptional costs rose by 30% to
£5.5m with a £0.7m reduction in gross
profits being more than offset by a £2.0m
decrease in operating expenses. In
percentage terms, gross margin fell slightly
to 36.3% in 2002/3 from the 36.7%
achieved in the previous year , primarily due
to the reduced revenue. The 11%
reduction in overheads was primarily due
to the savings from the US reorganisation
combined with the weaker dollar . 
First half operating profits excluding UDO
development costs, goodwill amortisation
and exceptional costs of £2m were
followed by a second half adjusted profit of
£3.5m with the benefits of the US
reorganisation accounting for the majority
of the improvement.
Losses before tax and interest in North
America totalled £5.2m compared to the
prior year loss of £6.4m with the reduced
reorganisation costs more than offsetting
the increased UDO expenditure. In Europe
profits before tax and interest rose by
269% to £2.5m due to a strong
contribution by our mastering business, a
return to profitability in the European sales
business as a result of the sales growth
and the non-reoccurrence of the prior year
£0.6m exceptional bad debts. 
Interest
Net interest payable of £0.7m in the
current year compared to £0.5m incurred
during the previous year , largely as a result
of the increased debt levels arising from
the UDO expenditure.  Plasmon Plc
Annual Report 2003
Finance Director’s Review

Tax
The tax charge for the year mainly related
to the overseas European subsidiaries with
the UDO costs significantly reducing the
tax charge at the principal operating
entities. During the year a £0.5m cash
refund was received in the US from the
prior year tax credit that arose under the
Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act
of 2002. 
Full details of potential deferred tax
assets, which all arise in the US, are
given in Note 18, although these have 
not been recognised in the financial
statements as they will not be utilised in
the short-term. The deferred tax liabilities
arising from accelerated capital
allowances in the UK have been
recognised in full during the year.
Earnings per share
For the year ended 31 March 2003, 
basic losses per share totalled 6.41p,
significantly better then the 12.28p
recorded during the previous year even
though the weighted average number of
shares in issue rose by 6.2m to 53.1m.
Excluding UDO development costs,
exceptional costs and goodwill
amortisation, earnings per share fell
slightly to 8.86p from 8.96p the 
previous year.
Dividends
The dividend policy of the Group
continues to be monitored by the Board
with no dividend being proposed in the
short-term given the funding requirements
of the Group’s UDO development plans.
Financial instruments
Although kept under consideration during
the past year the Group did not use any
derivative financial instruments with the
principal financial risks being addressed
as follows:
Interest rate risk
The Group’s objective is to minimise
exposure to interest rate fluctuations by
maximising the amount of fixed rate
borrowings whilst retaining sufficient
overdraft facilities to match short-term
debt fluctuations. Anticipated interest rate
movements are taken into consideration
before fixed rate transactions are
concluded. At 31 March 2003, 13% of
financial liabilities were of a fixed nature. 
Foreign currency exposures
The Group’s objective is to minimise
exposure to translational losses arising
on the net assets of overseas subsidiaries
by borrowing in local currencies at the
subsidiary level where possible. At the
year-end, 28% of the net operating
assets of the Group’s US operations were
hedged by US dollar denominated
financial liabilities.
With respect to transactional risks, the
Group continues to monitor its foreign
currency exposures in its major trading
currencies. Matching trading relationships
and debt with the currency cash flows
largely covers transactional exposures
within acceptable levels, thereby reducing
the need for additional hedging.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to ensure sufficient
headroom is maintained in its debt
facilities to enable the achievement of
strategic objectives, whilst taking into
account the impact of short-term business
cycle fluctuations on liquidity. Facilities are
reviewed on at least an annual basis or as
changes in business circumstances
require. At 31 March 2003, £6.2m of
headroom was available under the Group’s
banking agreements.
The Group also aims to ensure that
reasonable proportions of its financial
liabilities are of a long-term nature. At 31
March 2003, 55% of financial liabilities
mature in more than one year , compared
to 44% the previous year , and 20% mature
in more than five years broadly in line with
the previous year .
Cash flow and net debt
Net debt increased during the year ended
31 March 2003 by £3.1m to £13m. Group
gearing rose from 24% to 34% with the
equity issued following the 5% placing
partially offsetting the losses incurred
during the year . The major currency
movements during the year resulted in a
£1.6m loss being recorded on the
translation of the foreign currency net
investments and net assets decreased to
£38.2m at 31 March 2003 from £41.2m at
the end of the previous year . 
Excluding currency movements, stock
decreased by £1.2m as the transition
stock held at 31 March 2002 as part of the
US reorganisation was sold. This reduction
was also the main reason why trade
creditors fell by £2.3m. The £1.2m
reduction in provisions for liabilities and
charges resulted from the payment of
transitional costs, mainly relating to
employee severance. Excluding UDO
related expenditure, fixed assets additions
totalled £2.6m, which included the
purchase of the adjacent site to our UK
facilities for £0.8m. This facility
unexpectedly became available and will
ensure we have adequate space once
UDO is in full production. In the short-term
we have sub-let the building to cover the
related costs.
Employees
The average number of employees
during the year ended 31 March 2003 fell
to 458 from 496 during the previous year.
The decrease mainly resulted from the
reductions that followed the US
reorganisation that was completed by
the end of September 2002. The full
impact of the restructuring is more
accurately reflected in the 422
headcount in April 2003. Plasmon Plc

Board of Directors
Board of Directors
& Senior Management Corporate governance
The Directors recognise the importance of adopting good governance
practices in the best interests of the shareholders. 
Throughout the year the Company has been in compliance with the
provisions set out in the Combined Code for Corporate Governance
appended to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, with the
exception that a Senior Non-Executive Director, Henri Zinsli, was only
appointed on 19 September 2002. The Board continues to monitor
the latest corporate governance guidance to ensure that the Group
maintains the appropriate standards. 
As outlined below, the Board has considered the independence of the
non-executive directors and believes that all the non-executive
Directors are currently independent of management and free from any
business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement. 
The following narrative statement explains how the Group has applied
the Principles of Good Corporate Governance contained in the
Combined Code.
The Board
The Board comprises two executive Directors and three non-executive
Directors. It is headed by a non-executive Chairman and is responsible
to shareholders for leading and controlling the Group. It meets at least
six times a year, reviewing trading performance, ensuring adequate
funding facilities are in place, setting and monitoring strategy,
reviewing risk management processes, examining business expansion
opportunities and shareholder reporting.
When appointing new directors, the Board principally considers their
experience and knowledge of the technology sector together with
their ability to contribute to a specific area of importance to the
Company. Due to the infrequent changes to the Board there is no
formal induction policy for new directors, with appropriate
arrangements being made as required.
To enable it to carry out its responsibilities, the Chief Executive and
Finance Director supply detailed information on the Group’s
operations to the Board on a monthly basis.
It is the Company’s policy that all directors should submit themselves
for re-election at regular intervals and at least every three years. The
Director submitting himself for re-election this year is shown on
page 23.
The Board has both an audit committee and a remuneration
committee, details of which are outlined below, but does not consider
a nomination committee to be necessary due to the small size of the
Board.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, which is chaired by John Barrie Morgans,
comprises all the non-executive Directors and meets not less than
twice annually. The Audit Committee provides a forum for reporting by
the Group’s Auditors and, by invitation, meetings are attended by the
Chief Executive and the Finance Director. It is responsible for reviewing
a wide range of financial matters, including the Interim and Annual
Report prior to their submission to the Board, and monitoring the
controls that are in force to ensure the integrity of the financial
information reported to the shareholders. The Audit Committee
advises the Board on the appointment of external Auditors and on
their remuneration for audit and non-audit work, and discusses the
nature and scope of the audit with the external Auditors.
The members of the Audit Committee are:
John Barrie Morgans (Chairman)
Henri Zinsli
Christopher McFadden
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the
contract terms, remuneration and other benefits of the executive
Directors, including their performance-related pay. The Remuneration
report, which includes details of Directors’ remuneration and beneficial
interests in the Company’s share capital, together with information on
their service contracts, is set out on pages 18 to 22
The members of the Remuneration Committee are:
Christopher McFadden (appointed Chairman 19 September 2002)
John Barrie Morgans (resigned as Chairman 19 September 2002)
Henri Zinsli
Relations with shareholders
As part of the Company’s communication activities, detailed
presentations are made to major institutional investors on a regular
basis, including whenever a major event occurs. The Board takes
feedback received from these presentations and other
communications for shareholders, into consideration wherever
appropriate.
The Annual General Meeting is the occasion when the Directors are
routinely available to answer questions from shareholders, and the
Directors view this public accountability for their actions as being the
main purpose of the meeting.

Corporate governance
18 Accountability and Audit
Following the publication in September 1999 of the guidance for
Directors on internal control reviews and disclosures prepared by the
Internal Control Working Party of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales (the Turnbull Guidance), the
Directors confirm that processes have operated throughout the year,
and continue to operate, to identify, evaluate, monitor and manage the
significant risks to the Group’s strategic objectives.
These processes are reviewed at each Audit Committee meeting with
the Executive Directors who present a report detailing the significant
Group risks identified by senior management during the day-to-day
running of the business. The senior management review the risks and
related control procedures at their regular meetings.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal
control and for monitoring their effectiveness. The Audit Committee
reports to the Board on the results of their review of the risk
management processes with the Board implementing additional
controls and monitoring processes as considered necessary. Such
processes can only provide reasonable assurance of the management
of risk and cannot eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s
business objectives. The key elements of the Group’s internal controls
are outlined below.
Control environment – the existence of a clear organisational structure
and well-defined lines of responsibility and delegation of appropriate
authority. The integrity and competence of personnel are ensured
through high recruitment standards, training and development
programmes.
Risk management – business strategy and plans are reviewed by the
Board. Detailed appraisals and evaluations of financial implications are
undertaken prior to commitments on major projects. In addition to the
Audit Committee presentations, the monthly report to the Board
includes commentary on the key risk areas.
Financial reporting – comprehensive systems of budgeting and
forecasting including monthly reporting of actual results against
budgets.
Control procedures and monitoring systems – ensuring authorisation
levels, procedures and other systems of internal financial control are
documented, applied and regularly reviewed. Many of the processes
are documented in the Group’s quality manuals and are subject to
audit by external compliance agencies on a regular basis. In addition,
the Audit Committee meets with the Group’s external Auditors to
discuss the results of their audit work. The Group does not currently
have an internal audit function but as the Group continues to grow this
is kept under review.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.

Annual Report 2003
Remuneration report
20
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule B of the Combined Code and only the details of Directors’
emoluments, pension entitlements and share options have been
subject to audit.
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is composed entirely
of the non-executive Directors identified on page 17. On
19 September 2002, Christopher McFadden was appointed Chairman
of the Committee, replacing John Barrie Morgans who remains a
member of the Committee. In determining its remuneration policy,
service contracts and compensation for Directors, full consideration
has been given to the provisions of the Combined Code. 
The Committee meets as required during the year and its terms of
reference are to determine the Company’s policy on executive
remuneration and to consider and approve the individual terms and
conditions of employment for the executive Directors. The Committee
takes advice where appropriate from the Chief Executive of the
Company on matters other than his personal remuneration. No
external advice was sought during the year ended 31 March 2003.
Remuneration policy
Basis of the remuneration policy 
In forming the remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of
the executive Directors, the Committee balances the requirement to
align the interest of the Directors with those of the shareholders, with
the creation of a culture of linking reward to the Company’s
performance and with the need to recruit and retain management of
the highest calibre.
The executive Directors’ remuneration consists of four components –
basic salary, performance-related bonus, share options and pension
provisions. The performance related components comprising the
annual bonus and share option schemes are designed to incentivise
the executive Directors to perform at the highest level, and to align
executive rewards with enhanced shareholder value in both the short
and long-term.
Basic salary is reviewed annually by the Committee after a review of
the individual executive Director’s performance and the overall
performance of the business. Where appropriate, the Committee has
regard to published remuneration information and to specific advice
from independent remuneration consultants. Inflation is also taken into
consideration.
The Committee determines a bonus for each executive Director based
on criteria agreed with that executive Director at the beginning of the
financial year. These criteria include the achievement of budgeted
profits and earnings per share. Bonuses are uncapped. The
Committee also awards one-off bonuses for any major activities, such
as acquisitions, not taken into consideration in the budget.
Performance chart
The chart below compares the growth in value of £100 invested in
ordinary shares in Plasmon Plc on 1 April 1998 with the performance
of a similar investment in the shares of the constituents of the FTSE
Small Cap index. The Directors are of the view that this constitutes a
relevant broad equity market. 
Pension provisions 
The executive Directors receive pension contributions equal to 15 per
cent of basic salary which are paid into their personal money purchase
pension plans. Details of the schemes are given in Note 26.
Service contracts 
The executive Directors are employed under the terms of service
agreements dated 19 July 1996 which may be terminated by
12 months’ notice from either party. None of the Directors’ service
contracts provides for predetermined amounts of compensation in the
event of early termination. 
Policy on outside appointments 
It is the policy of the Committee that executive Directors should not
take more than one outside appointment, which it is believed can
provide valuable experience. Nigel Street is a non-executive Director of
Streason Limited, the holding company of his family’s business
interest.
Non executive fees 
The Board determines remuneration of the non-executive Directors.
The Company has a contract with MAHE-Morgans Limited, dated
1 July 1997, which provides the services of John Barrie Morgans as a
non-executive Director and which can be terminated by 6 months’
notice from either party. Henri Zinsli and Christopher McFadden have
contracts with the Company, dated 1 April 1999 and 19 July 2001,
respectively, terminable by three months’ notice from either party.

to achieve a common awareness on the part of all employees of the
financial and economic factors affecting the Group’s performance. The
employee share scheme encourages the involvement of employees in
the Group’s performance.
It is the policy of the Group that disabled people, whether registered or
not, should receive full and fair consideration for all job vacancies for
which they are suitable applicants. Employees who become disabled
during their working life will be retained in employment wherever
possible and will be given help with any necessary rehabilitation and
retraining. The Group is prepared to modify procedures and
equipment, wherever this is practicable, so that full use can be made
of an individual’s abilities. Training, career development and promotion
are, as far as practicable, identical for all employees according to their
skills and abilities.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s current policy concerning the payment of creditors for
revenue and capital suppliers for goods and services is as follows:
• to pay in accordance with its contractual and legal obligations;
• wherever it is reasonable to do so, to settle the terms of payments
with those suppliers when agreeing terms for each transaction and
to ensure that those suppliers are made aware of the terms of
payments by their inclusion in the relevant contracts.
Creditor days for the Company and Group at 31 March 2003 were 43
and 49, respectively (2002: 14 and 54) as calculated in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are required by UK company law to prepare financial
statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the
financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
The Directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been
applied consistently, and reasonable and prudent judgements and
estimates have been made in the preparation of the financial
statements for the year ended 31 March 2003. The Directors also
confirm that applicable accounting standards have been followed and
that the financial statements have been prepared on the going
concern basis.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records,
for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the Company
and the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregular
activities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s websites are the
responsibility of the Directors. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Auditors
Following the conversion of our auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers to a
Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) from 1 January 2003,
PricewaterhouseCoopers resigned on 30 January 2003 and the
Directors appointed its successor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , as
auditors.
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to
the Company will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ report
for the year ended 31 March 2003 Plasmon Plc
Annual Report 2003
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Plasmon Plc
24
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the profit
and loss account, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement, the
statement of recognised gains and losses and the related notes and
the accounting policies set out in the statement of accounting policies.
We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule
7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the Remuneration report
(“the auditable part”).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities. The directors are also responsible for
preparing the Remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable
part of the directors’ remuneration report in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing
Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving
this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands
it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in
writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
auditable part of the Remuneration report have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report
to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the
financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’
report, the unaudited part of the Remuneration report, the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s review, Finance Director’s review and
the Corporate Governance statement. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all
risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control
procedures. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a
test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration
report. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to
the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration report
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group at 31 March 2003 and of the loss
and cash flows of the group for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
• those parts of the Remuneration report required by Part 3 of
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

29 Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2003
1 Principal accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom. A summary of the more
important Group accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost basis of accounting.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Plasmon Plc and all of its subsidiaries, made up to 31 March 2003. The
results of subsidiaries and businesses acquired are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date control passes to the
Group. Intra-Group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Turnover
Turnover, which excludes sales between Group companies and trade discounts, represents the invoiced value of goods and services net of value
added tax. Turnover in respect of the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are dispatched to the customer, whilst turnover in respect of the
sale of services is recognised over the period the related work is performed. Turnover from longer-term development work is recognised in
proportion to the costs of the development work undertaken. Turnover in respect of royalties receivable is recognised on an accruals basis as
earned.
Development expenditure
Expenditure on research or development is written off as incurred.
Tangible fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on fixed assets when placed into effective use, on a straight-line basis, at rates calculated to reduce each asset at the
end of its effective useful life to its estimated net realisable value. The rates used are as follows:
Land Not depreciated
Buildings 2%
Building improvements 4%–15%
Short leasehold improvements 20%–33%
Office equipment 20%–33%
Research and development, manufacturing and test plant and machinery 10%–25%
Motor vehicles 25%–33%
Leased assets
Assets acquired under finance leases and hire purchase agreements are capitalised and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the
useful life of the asset. The capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as obligations under finance leases. The lease rentals are treated
as consisting of capital and interest elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element is
charged against profit so as to give a constant periodic charge on the remaining balance outstanding for each accounting period.
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis.
Purchased goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions represents the excess of the fair market value of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities acquired.
FRS 10 “Goodwill and intangible assets” has been adopted from 1 April 1998 and purchased goodwill arising from acquisitions after this date has
been capitalised as intangible assets and is amortised over its useful economic life. 
The useful economic life of goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 April 1998 is estimated to be between eight and ten years from the date of
acquisition which is primarily based on the number of future generations of products expected to be based on the acquired technologies.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the adoption of FRS10 remains eliminated against reserves. This goodwill will be charged in the
profit and loss account on any subsequent disposal of the related business.
Licences
Licences acquired for use in proprietary software or manufacturing processes are capitalised at cost. Amortisation commences when the related
product is commercially launched with the cost being amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected life cycle of the product. Current
licences are being amortised over five years.
Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any amount written-off to reflect a permanent impairment.
Plasmon Plc
Annual Report 2003
Notes to the financial statements
30 Notes to the financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 March 2003
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises expenditure incurred in bringing stocks and work in progress to
their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less further production costs to completion and
appropriate selling and distribution costs. Provision is made where necessary for obsolete, slow-moving and defective stocks.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or
events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets
are recognised to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future
reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Provision is made for the tax that would arise on the remittance of the retained
earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable. Deferred tax is
measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, based on
the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency translation
Assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the results of foreign subsidiaries are
translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Foreign currency trading transactions are translated at the rate ruling at the time of the
transaction. All foreign currency exchange differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account for the period with the exception of those arising
on consolidation which are shown as movements on reserves.
Patent fees
Costs of acquiring patents are written off as incurred.
Pension costs
Pension costs in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme are accounted for on the basis of charging the expected cost of providing
pensions over the period during which the Group expects to benefit from the employees’ services. This treatment follows the requirements of
SSAP 24 “Accounting for pension costs”. In addition, the notes to the financial statements provide the transitional disclosures prepared under the
accounting standard FRS 17 “Retirement benefits”. As permitted by this standard, the Group has decided to defer full implementation until the
financial year ending 31 March 2005.
Pension costs in respect of defined contribution schemes and employees’ personal pension plans are charged on an accrual basis in line with
amounts payable in respect of the accounting period.
National Insurance and Share Options
Provision is made for future employer’s National Insurance liabilities in respect of certain outstanding unapproved employee share options. The
provision is calculated at the current National Insurance rate applied to the difference between the market value of the underlying shares at the
balance sheet date and the option exercise prices.

The Group operates in one business segment, professional data storage solutions. The Group derives income of a consultancy nature from the
sale of “know-how” as a result of and incidental to its normal production activities and therefore, this is not considered to be a separate business
segment. Consultancy income in the year amounted to £3,935,000 (2002: £3,607,000). Intra segment turnover for year ended 31 March 2003
was £5,325,000 (2002: £7,487,000) from Europe to the United States of America and £4,033,000 (2002: £5,072,000) from the United States of

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing earnings (loss on ordinary activities after tax) by the weighted average number of Ordinary
shares in issue during the year.
Given the losses incurred during the year, there is no dilution of earnings per share in the year ended 31 March 2003 or in the previous year.
Adjusted earnings per share figures are presented which exclude the effect of goodwill amortisation, UDO development costs and exceptional
operating costs. The Directors consider that the adjusted earnings per share figures provide a useful additional indication of performance.

1,469,500 share options were granted during the year under the 1998 Employee Share Option Scheme (the "1998 Scheme"). The 1998
Scheme allows for the granting of share options up to 15% of the issued ordinary share capital, normally within 42 days following the
preliminary announcement of the final or interim results of the Company. No payment is required for the grant of the share options and
subscription price per share is set at prevailing market rates. These options, as with those issued during the previous year, require the launch of
UDO drives and media before the options can be exercised.
The share options granted in the four years ended 31 March 2001 (at subscription prices per share of £0.465, £0.77, £1.37, £2.74 and £1.14)
also have performance criteria attached to them. Exercise of these share options is conditional on earnings per share for the Group over any
three consecutive years following grant having grown by an average of at least 6 percentage points above inflation. The earnings per share
criteria will be adjusted to remove the impact of the UDO programme. In addition group profits for any financial year have to exceed the levels
shown in the table below:
Granted during Subscription price 
the year ended per share Measure of group profits Level of group profits
31 March 1998 £0.465 Before interest and tax £1 million
31 March 1999 £0.77 Before goodwill amortisation,

£2.74 interest, tax and exceptional items £4.0 million
31 March 2001 £1.14 Before goodwill amortisation, £7.0 million
interest, tax and exceptional items
The performance criteria attached to the share options granted during the year ended 31 March 1998 and 1999 have been met. The share
options granted at £1.25 and £2.50 do not have performance conditions attached to them.

their book and fair values.

provision of £3,000.
26 Pension Commitments
The Group operates three pension schemes of a defined contribution nature (including two 401K plans in the United States) and also makes
contributions to the private pension plans of a small number of employees (including the two executive Directors). The total pension cost charge
relating to these arrangements was £515,000 (2002: £596,000). There were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions in respect of these
arrangements at either 31 March 2003 or 31 March 2002.
The Group also operates a pension scheme of a defined benefit nature for the US employees who transferred from Philips as part of the
acquisition of Philips LMS. In May 2002, the Group announced the freezing of benefits in this scheme, before on 31 December 2002, announcing
the termination of the scheme, which should be completed by 31 March 2004. As a result of the termination, a net pension credit was recorded in
the year ended 31 March 2003 of £91,000 (2002 cost: £285,000). In setting the funding policy of the scheme, the actuarial method used was the
projected unit cost method and the main actuarial assumptions used were that the investment return will be 8.00% (2002: 8.75%) and that the
pensionable salaries would increase by a weighted average of 4.69% (2002: 4.69%). As part of the termination planning, a formal actuarial
valuation has been performed that shows there is no material difference between the fund’s assets and its accrued liabilities. There were
outstanding contributions of £167,000 in respect of this scheme at 31 March 2003 (2002: £460,000).
The assets of all the Group’s pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The Company has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 “Accounting for Pension Costs”. The new standard for pension
accounting, FRS 17 “Retirement Benefits”, is not yet mandatory, however, the Company is following the extended transitional arrangements under
which additional disclosures on retirement benefits are required. These disclosures are as follows:
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme in the US. A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2003 by qualified independent

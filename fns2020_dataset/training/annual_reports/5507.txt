OPERATING SCALE
At the end of 2014, including its new team in 
Malaysia, EnQuest had a direct workforce of 
approximately 900, or 2,000 with offshore 
contractors. EnQuest has a breadth and 
depth of in-house expertise which is 
matched by few, if any, UK based oil 
companies of its size. 
FINANCIAL STABILITY
EnQuest’s funding facilities include a 
$1.2 billion committed credit facility, 
with a $500 million accordion. EnQuest 
renegotiated covenants with its lending 
banks and these have been relaxed until 
mid-2017. With this credit facility, a long 
dated debt maturity profile for the 
Company’s bonds and a hedging 
programme in place for 2015 and 2016, 
the Company is positioned to meet its 
investment programme as set out in the 
Financial Review on page 38. STRATEGIC

REVIEW OF OUR 
ACHIEVEMENTS
Extending the lives 
of maturing assets and 
optimising production.
IN 2014, ENQUEST WON THE OIL & GAS  
UK AWARD FOR BUSINESS INNOVATION.
ENQUEST’S FIRST FIVE YEARS AND BEYOND
EnQuest won the Business Innovation title in the Large Enterprise 
category at Oil & Gas UK’s 2014 awards. EnQuest’s Thistle life 
extension project is at the heart of a strategy to recover 35 million 
barrels of oil from the Thistle and Deveron fields, to extend the life 
of the Thistle field to 2025 and beyond.
This award recognises the Thistle project as a proven template for 
mature field development in the North Sea. The first phase of the 
Thistle life extension programme started in 2010 with a successful 
rig reactivation project which saw EnQuest bring Thistle drilling 
back online to drill its first new wells in 20 years.
Neil McCulloch, EnQuest’s President, North Sea, said: “Oil & Gas 
UK’s award is a welcome acknowledgement of how our strategy of 
extending the life of ageing assets and optimising production is 
succeeding. These achievements, which have been made with an 
exemplary safety record, are credit to everyone in the management, 
operational and support teams because a huge amount of 
commitment, focus, collaboration and drive goes into delivering 
such exceptional safe results.
It is also an important endorsement of how the right level of 
investment, combined with the right vision, technical expertise and 
innovative thinking can breathe new life into an ageing asset and 
give it a sustainable future”. STRATEGIC

OUR STRATEGY
STRATEGIC 
FRAMEWORK
Market opportunity
EnQuest targets opportunities in maturing basins, to acquire 
development and production assets which are not large 
enough to be of interest to the major global oil companies. 
In-house, EnQuest has the full spectrum of integrated technical 
capabilities needed to successfully deliver new oil field 
developments and to optimise assets which are already in 
production; the capabilities include subsurface, facilities 
planning and drilling. In 2014, EnQuest again delivered 
production efficiency levels which we believe rank it as one of 
the best operators in the North Sea. EnQuest believes that 
these technical skills, combined with its operational scale and 
its financial stability leave EnQuest uniquely well positioned to 
deliver its sustainable growth strategy. 
EnQuest is a company of substantial operational size, with high 
levels of cash generated from operations. EnQuest has always 
been focused on controlling its cost base. In recent years 
EnQuest was able to keep its unit operating costs broadly flat, 
while average costs in the North Sea doubled. Since the oil 
price decline started in the middle of 2014, EnQuest made 
further significant cuts to its cost base and continues to work 
with the supply chain and contractors to achieve additional 
savings. EnQuest’s production efficiency and cost control skills 
are particularly valuable in the current macro environment, 
where sellers of oil field assets need buyers who have the 
technical and operational capabilities essential for the 
subsequent safe and effective management of the assets, 
and who can do so cost effectively. EnQuest is managing its 
business in a manner which will allow it to withstand a 
prolonged period of low oil prices.
DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
EnQuest intends to deliver sustainable 
growth by focusing on exploiting its 
existing reserves, commercialising 
and developing discoveries, converting 
contingent resources into reserves and 
pursuing selective acquisitions.
Exploiting our 
existing reserves
DONS, THISTLE/
DEVERON, HEATHER/
BROOM, ALBA
In EnQuest’s first five years, 
EnQuest increased its net 2P 
reserves by a net 30.7 MMboe, 
as a result of revisions to 
reserve estimates, reflecting 
the benefits of our infill drilling 
programme and our increased 
reservoir knowledge.
See pages 10, 18 et seq and 
26 et seq.
Making  
selective 
acquisitions
GREATER KITTIWAKE 
AREA, PM8/SELIGI 
In 2014, EnQuest increased its net 
2P reserves by 22.8 MMboe, 
through acquisitions.
See pages 10, 14 and 18 et seq 
and 34 et seq.
Converting 
contingent 
resources into 
reserves
SCOLTY/CRATHES, ALMA/
GALIA, KRAKEN
Through the promotion of Scolty/
Crathes to 2P reserves following 
development planning, and through 
promotion to reserves of additional 
amounts at both Alma/Galia and 
Kraken, EnQuest promoted 13.6 
MMboe to net 2P reserves from 
contingent resources in 2014. 
See page 12, pages 18 et seq 
and 26 et seq.
Commercialising 
and developing 
discoveries
YTHAN
Through the approval of the 
Ythan discovery for development, 
EnQuest further increased the 
level of its net 2P reserves in 2014.

GROWING 
ENQUEST’S 
ASSET BASE
EnQuest’s principal UK assets at the 
end of 2014 were its interests in the 
producing operated oil fields Heather/
Broom, Thistle/Deveron, West Don, Don 
Southwest, Conrie, Kittiwake, Goosander, 
Gadwall, Grouse, and Mallard along with 
the producing non-operated Alba oil 
field, also in the Alma/Galia, Kraken 
and Ythan developments, with further 
development opportunities in the Scolty/
Crathes and Avalon discoveries. 
In early 2014, EnQuest was awarded a licence in the Don North East 
area, within which Area 24 was subsequently renamed Ythan. 
At the end of 2014, EnQuest had working interests in 34 UK 
production licences, covering 45 blocks or part blocks, and was the 
operator of 29 of these licences. Including the 28th round awards, 
awarded in Q1 2015, the totals increase to 38 licences and 54 blocks 
or part blocks, of which EnQuest operates 33 licences.
During 2014, EnQuest continued 
to expand its position in maturing 
hydrocarbon basins outside the 
UK North Sea. 
In Q2 2014, EnQuest secured a 70% interest in a small field 
development project with PETRONAS, for the Tanjong Baram field 
offshore Sarawak. Also in Q2 EnQuest completed the acquisition of 
a 50% interest in the Seligi oil field, once the largest producing oil 
field in peninsular Malaysia, and of an interest in the nearby PM8 
Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’). In Q1 2015, EnQuest Norge AS 
was awarded two additional production licences in the Norwegian

PERFORMANCE
THE GREATER 
KITTIWAKE AREA
In Q1 2014, EnQuest completed its 
acquisition of the Greater Kittiwake 
Area (‘GKA’) assets, fitting within 
EnQuest’s goals of managing 
mature fields and of exploiting 
nearby discoveries and near field 
exploration opportunities. 
EnQuest’s Scolty and Crathes discoveries are within the area 
and stand to benefit from a potential tie-back to Kittiwake. 
Within weeks of completing the acquisition, EnQuest added to 
its potential through the successful nearby Avalon discovery. 
Having assumed operatorship, EnQuest took action to enhance 
operational efficiency, delivering a marked rise in production, 
up from a gross 2,500 Boepd in early 2014, to over 5,500 
Boepd gross by October. These improved efficiencies, 
combined with the substantially increased production volumes, 
resulted in operating expenditure per barrel being significantly 
reduced, as planned. 
Central to the programme was the successful workover of 
the Mallard well, which resulted in that field being returned to 
production in September. Gas export was also brought back on 
line and produced water processes were optimised; all key to 
positively transforming GKA’s performance efficiency. 
Strategically, the focus is now on the development of our 
longer term life-of-field plan, alongside short and medium term 
asset management programmes, all shaping a successful future 
for GKA.
HIGHLIGHTS
 ` GKA comprises a network of fields, and offers a series 
of hub development opportunities
 ` The Goosander and Grouse wells performed well 
throughout 2014 
 ` In 2014, a successful workover brought Mallard back online 
 ` Preparatory work on the proposed tie-back to link the GKA 
facilities with the Scolty/Crathes discoveries progressed well 
during 2014
 ` Following the success of the Mallard workover, a Gadwall 
sidetrack is expected in mid-2015 
 ` With continuing efficiency improvements, opex per barrel 
will be further reduced in 2015

In Q1 2014, EnQuest completed its 
acquisition of the Greater Kittiwake 
Area (‘GKA’) assets, fitting within 
EnQuest’s goals of managing 
mature fields and of exploiting 
nearby discoveries and near field 
exploration opportunities. 
EnQuest’s Scolty and Crathes discoveries are within the area 
and stand to benefit from a potential tie-back to Kittiwake. 
Within weeks of completing the acquisition, EnQuest added to 
its potential through the successful nearby Avalon discovery. 
Having assumed operatorship, EnQuest took action to enhance 
operational efficiency, delivering a marked rise in production, 
up from a gross 2,500 Boepd in early 2014, to over 5,500 
Boepd gross by October. These improved efficiencies, 
combined with the substantially increased production volumes, 
resulted in operating expenditure per barrel being significantly 
reduced, as planned. 
Central to the programme was the successful workover of 
the Mallard well, which resulted in that field being returned to 
production in September. Gas export was also brought back on 
line and produced water processes were optimised; all key to 
positively transforming GKA’s performance efficiency. 
Strategically, the focus is now on the development of our 
longer term life-of-field plan, alongside short and medium term 
asset management programmes, all shaping a successful future 
for GKA.
HIGHLIGHTS
 ` GKA comprises a network of fields, and offers a series 
of hub development opportunities
 ` The Goosander and Grouse wells performed well 
throughout 2014 
 ` In 2014, a successful workover brought Mallard back online 
 ` Preparatory work on the proposed tie-back to link the GKA 
facilities with the Scolty/Crathes discoveries progressed well 
during 2014
 ` Following the success of the Mallard workover, a Gadwall 
sidetrack is expected in mid-2015 
 ` With continuing efficiency improvements, opex per barrel 
will be further reduced in 2015

KRAKEN
The Kraken development is a 25 year 
life project, with approximately 
140 MMboe of gross reserves. 
Material advances across key areas of the project defined 2014 
as a year of significant progress for EnQuest’s Kraken 
development in the northern North Sea. 
The major greenfield project has remained on schedule and on 
budget as work continues apace on the Floating Production, 
Storage and Offloading (‘FPSO’) vessel, subsea infrastructure 
and planning of the development wells. 
Modification and upgrade work on the FPSO vessel that will 
form the field hub is progressing at the Keppel shipyard in 
Singapore. The facility has an extensive track record in FPSO 
conversion work, having already completed more than 100 
such programmes.
Equally, the subsea infrastructure is taking shape, with key 
elements delivered and installed during the year and more 
scheduled for 2015. 
A semi-submersible rig is under contract to begin development 
well drilling operations at Kraken during the second half of 
2015; this is a ‘harsh environment’ rig and should therefore have 
good operational uptime. 
The Kraken development team, operating in both Aberdeen 
and Singapore, is focused on delivering what will become 
EnQuest’s sixth UK North Sea hub.

In Q2 2014, EnQuest announced the 
acquisition of an operated interest in 
the PM8 PSC fields and the Seligi oil 
field from ExxonMobil. EnQuest also 
signed an agreement with PETRONAS 
to extend the term of the production 
sharing contract, comprising PM8 PSC 
assets and the Seligi oil field, to 2033 
(‘PM8 PSC Extension’). The Seligi oil 
field was once the largest oil field in 
Peninsular Malaysia. 
This acquisition builds on EnQuest’s core skill of enhancing value 
from maturing fields and provides EnQuest a platform to pursue 
further prospective development opportunities in the longer 
term. This expansion of EnQuest’s Malaysian operation also 
represents a further deepening of our relationship with 
PETRONAS, following the signing of the Tanjong Baram risk 
service contract. 
EnQuest formally assumed operatorship of PM8/Seligi at the 
end of 2014, following a swift and efficient transition process.
PM8/Seligi has already materially increased EnQuest’s overall 
production levels; by Q4 2014, these new fields were producing 
approximately 15,000 Boepd, gross. EnQuest is focused on an 
ongoing programme to target efficiency improvements and to 
maximise recovery from the fields.

ENQUEST VALUES
RESPECT 
Respect is key to everything that EnQuest does, both 
personally and professionally. It represents who we are, how 
we operate within the business, and how we interact with our 
external business partners and associates. Respect for safety, 
personnel and the environment is critical to how we are 
perceived by our competitors as the Company strives to 
succeed to be the best at what we do. 
JULIA WALKER, EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT STRATEGIC 
REPORT

17 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
EnQuest’s performance
During 2014, EnQuest delivered a strong operational performance 
and reacted swiftly to the oil price declines witnessed in the second 
half of the year. The Company has a significant capital programme 
associated with its Kraken investment in 2015 and 2016 and looks 
forward to 2017, when Kraken is planned to be onstream.
Despite the recent downturn in the oil price, since EnQuest’s 
inception five years ago, we have grown our original net 2P 
reserve base by over 173%, representing a replacement ratio of 
514%. Consequently, EnQuest started 2015, with a reserve life of 
over 20 years. During these first five years, EnQuest generated 
c.$2.7 billion in cash flow from operations. 
Industry background 
From the outset, EnQuest has worked closely with the industry 
and the UK Government to bring about structural changes to 
the business environment in the North Sea, which we believe are 
essential to the future of the industry. The North Sea needs a stable 
and incentivising fiscal regime with regulation that encourages new 
development activity and promotes greater collaboration between 
operators, leading to a lower cost base. The steep decline in 
oil prices during the latter part of 2014 has acted as a catalyst 
for action. 
EnQuest’s response to lower oil prices
In response to declining oil prices, EnQuest took action to 
protect against further oil price falls and to maximise cost reduction. 
EnQuest accelerated its oil price hedging programme and worked 
closely with the supply chain to reduce operating and capital 
expenditure. While we remain confident about the long term 
prospects for the oil price, we are managing our business so as to 
allow us to withstand a more prolonged period of lower oil prices. 
EnQuest’s funding facilities include a $1.2 billion committed 
credit facility, with a $500 million accordion. EnQuest renegotiated 
covenants with its lending banks and these have been relaxed until 
mid-2017. Ongoing continued compliance with its covenants is a 
priority for 2015 and beyond. With its credit facility and a long 
dated debt maturity profile, the financial position of the Company 
remains resilient. 
At the same time, EnQuest delivered very good operational 
performance in 2014, with strong production growth and 
industry leading levels of production efficiency. The Alma/Galia 
development project recovered from delays in the first half of 2014, 
and since then it has remained on schedule. Since its sanction at the 
end of 2013, the Kraken development project has consistently been 
on schedule and on budget. 
The EnQuest Board
The composition of the Board remained constant during 2014. The 
Directors assess and evolve EnQuest’s strategy, taking key decisions 
on its implementation. In 2014 these included the acquisition of 
EnQuest’s first producing assets outside the North Sea, and in 2015 
the Board also took measured actions in light of the lower oil price 
environment, in terms of setting the new business plans for 2015 
and beyond. 
EnQuest’s results are a reflection of the quality of our people and on 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank my EnQuest colleagues for 
their continued hard work, commitment to our values, and 
successful pursuit of the Company’s development plans. 
 
Governance 
In 2014, EnQuest complied in full with the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code. In September 2014, the Financial Reporting 
Council published the revised 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code, compliance with which will continue to be reported annually by 
EnQuest. We are well advanced in implementing our responses to the 
changes brought in by the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Corporate governance for EnQuest is not merely following a set of 
rules, but embedding a framework which supports our core values 
and, provides structure for how we are organised, how we manage 
risk, how we behave and how we provide assurance in respect of 
performance. In 2014, the Board strengthened a number of areas 
of corporate governance including the risk management framework 
and corporate responsibility. We work to ensure that all elements of 
corporate governance are part of our corporate culture and we have 
developed an environment which nurtures, develops and maintains 
our approach. 
The Board reviewed the Company’s corporate responsibility model. 
We ensured that we have strong relevant policies in place, covering 
the areas of Health and Safety, People, Business Environment, 
Business Conduct and Community. We will be working towards 
monitoring the impact and progress of these areas in the coming 
period. Our UK Health and Safety policy has now also been 
implemented in our international projects in Malaysia, with 
supplemental policies as required by local legislation.
Dividend
The Company has not declared or paid any dividends since 
incorporation in January 2010 and does not intend to pay dividends 
in the near future. Any future payment of dividends is expected to 
depend on the earnings and financial condition of the Company and 
on such other factors as the Board of Directors of the Company 
considers appropriate.
Delivering sustainable growth
We are managing our business to withstand a prolonged period 
of low oil prices and I am confident that EnQuest will emerge from 
this down cycle in even better shape to implement our strategy 
successfully. The life of the Alma/Galia field is over ten years and the 
Kraken field has a twenty five year life, this is a long term business.  18 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014

ENQUEST VALUES
PASSION
With the right level of passion people remain motivated and 
energised to perform at the highest level. I am passionate 
about my performance, continuously challenging the way I, 
and the organisation do things. This is important when working 
at EnQuest. Passionate people work hard to chase the next 
result, and will go that extra yard to deliver. 
DEREK ELLINGTON, HEATHER OPERATIONS MANAGER
EnQuest’s performance, business model and strategy
EnQuest’s core competency in controlling costs and managing 
operations efficiently is particularly important in the current climate 
of low oil prices. Despite challenging macro conditions, EnQuest 
delivered a strong operational performance in 2014, with production 
of 27,895 Boepd, whilst EBITDA was $581 million. 2014 was a record 
year for production and was up 15% on the prior year. The acquisition 
of the Seligi and PM8 oil fields in Malaysia provided EnQuest with its 
first contribution from outside the North Sea, countering the impact 
of delay to the Alma/Galia project. 
EnQuest delivered an increase in its net 2P reserve base, up by 
25.2 MMboe to 220.0 MMboe, reflecting a reserve replacement 
ratio of approximately 350% for 2014. The increase resulted partly 
from positive revisions to reserve estimates from infill drilling and 
an improved knowledge of the reservoirs. Approval of the Ythan 
discovery for development, and the promotion of the Scolty and 
Crathes discoveries following development planning, also 
contributed to the increase in EnQuest’s reserve base. Further 
additions arose from 2014 acquisitions, including interests in the 
Greater Kittiwake Area (‘GKA’) and PM8/Seligi in Malaysia. 
During the latter part of 2014, EnQuest acted quickly to counter 
the impact of a rapid decline in oil prices, increasing the hedging 
programme and significantly cutting 2015 cash capital expenditure 
to c.$600 million, with reductions from both developments and 
existing fields. We are targeting a reduction in EnQuest’s operating 
cost per barrel of c.10%, from $42.1/boe in 2014 to an average of 
c.$38/boe in 2015. This is being achieved through lower cost barrels 
coming onstream, reducing opex per barrel in newly acquired fields, 
and through substantial direct cost savings. We are targeting cost 
savings across the business, through the supply chain and by 
improving efficiencies in our operations, through maximising 
production and minimising waste. We have cut limited company 
contractor rates and reduced our headcount in the UK and logistics 
costs are down significantly. This agile focused approach enabled 
EnQuest to hold unit operating costs flat during its first five years, 
while average costs in the North Sea doubled. EnQuest continues to 
work with the supply chain and contractors to achieve further cost 
savings and optimisation. 
Given the low oil price environment, EnQuest negotiated a 
relaxation of covenants to its revolving credit facility until mid-2017. 
This continued commitment from our lenders recognises the cash 
flow generation of EnQuest’s business and in particular the 
expected increases in cash flow from the Alma/Galia and Kraken 
developments.
EnQuest has achieved a 173% increase in net oil reserves over the last 
five years, having converted more than half of the original reserves 
into flowing barrels. Despite the reductions to the investment 
programme, EnQuest remains on course to achieve annual net 
production from the UK North Sea of 50,000 Boepd, with six 
operated producing hubs in the UK. In Malaysia, PM8/Seligi has the 
potential to increase international production significantly over the 
coming years. 
Health, safety, environment and assurance (‘HSE&A’)
In 2014, EnQuest met its commitment to deliver safe results, with 
the best HSE performance since formation in April 2010. EnQuest 
achieved a Lost-Time Incident Frequency Rate (‘LTIFR’) of zero and 
a Recordable Incident Frequency Rate (‘RIFR’) below the industry 
average. There were no High Potential Incidents (‘HIPO’s): the last 
recorded HIPO was in April 2013.
In addition, the producing northern North Sea assets achieved a 
total of 11 years without a Lost-Time Incident (‘LTI’) and 11 million 
man hours LTI-free. Health and Safety Executive inspections were 
performed on all the assets, and no major issues were identified. 
These results are a testament to the focus given to HSE&A. 
North Sea operations
In 2014, EnQuest delivered good production of 24,436 Boepd in 
the UK, marginally ahead of the 24,222 Boepd in 2013. This reflects 
the continuing strength of field reservoir performance and high 
production efficiency from EnQuest’s existing UK assets. With 
production efficiency from existing assets averaging 88% in 2014, 
EnQuest is likely to have further improved its position in the Oil & 
Gas UK rankings.
EnQuest delivered 12 wells in 2014, including successful wells at 
Heather and Don South West. At the Dons, the Ythan development 
in Don North East, moved from licence award, through Field 
Development Plan submission and approval, to spudding of the 
first well in less than 12 months. The Thistle life extension project 
continued to improve production levels in 2014. Thistle produced 
over three million barrels of oil for the first time since 1997. The 
Greater Kittiwake Area (‘GKA’) assets were acquired early in 2014. 
Subsequent to the acquisition of GKA, the discovery of Avalon 
further enhanced the potential of GKA.  20 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
REPORT 
CONTINUED
North Sea developments
Alma/Galia 
During 2014, both the subsea and the drilling programmes for the 
Alma/Galia project were delivered on time. By the end of the year, 
five production wells were fully completed and ready for tie-in and 
the subsea infrastructure was in place. However, delays to the 
programme for the Floating Production, Storage and Offloading 
vessel (‘FPSO’, the ‘EnQuest Producer’) had moved the earliest 
possible ‘sailaway’ date into the winter months. This would have 
significantly increased the operational risks and costs of waiting for 
appropriate weather conditions. Sailaway and first oil were therefore 
rescheduled to spring 2015 and to mid-2015 respectively. Since 
August 2014, the FPSO construction has remained on track and 
following first oil, initial net peak production of c.13,000 Boepd is 
expected, significantly increasing EnQuest’s production profile. 
Plateau unit operating cost is expected to be approximately $15/bbl 
to $20/bbl. 
Delays and cost increases for the EnQuest Producer initially 
stemmed from changes to the implementation of safety codes, 
such as for moorings and also other regulatory imposed scope 
changes. The extent of work required on the vessel was also 
greater than anticipated. 
The FPSO is essentially now a new vessel with all the topsides 
having been replaced. Ownership of the vessel at first oil provides 
EnQuest with a range of additional funding options, such as a 
potential sale and leaseback. 
EnQuest’s net 2P reserves for Alma/Galia increased slightly to 
c.26 MMboe at the start of 2015, following the positive results 
from the wells which have been drilled. 
Kraken 
During 2014, the Kraken project progressed well, on budget and 
on schedule. 
In Q2 2014, the FPSO donor vessel arrived at the shipyard in 
Singapore and its conversion scope commenced. In H2 2014, 
EnQuest commenced installation of the subsea structures at the 
first drill centre, where the initial wells for the development will be 
drilled. Detailed engineering, procurement and manufacture for all 
equipment relating to wells, subsea infrastructure and the FPSO 
continued throughout 2014.
With the Kraken project on budget, its anticipated net capital 
expenditure estimate is unchanged at $1.4 billion to first oil. The full 
cycle breakeven cost for the project continues to be in the region of 
$55/bbl. In addition, with $512 million invested to the end of 2014, 
the forward economics of the 25 year life project are strong with an 
internal rate of return in the mid thirties per cent, net to EnQuest 
using the forward curve in early March 2015. 
North Sea acquisitions
In Q1 2014, EnQuest applied for and was offered an ‘out of round’ 
licence in the Don North East area (‘Don NE’) for blocks 211/18e 
and 211/19c. This included the Area 23 and Area 24 discovered oil 
accumulations and an undrilled extension to the Don NE field. 
Following the award of this licence a Field Development Plan for 
‘Ythan’ was submitted and approved.
In Q1 2014, EnQuest announced the acquisition of the Greater 
Kittiwake Area assets. The acquisition fits within the goals of 
managing mature fields and of exploiting nearby discoveries and near 
field exploration opportunities. The Scolty and Crathes discoveries 
are within the GKA area, with potential to benefit from a tie-back to 
Kittiwake. The combination of these opportunities also facilitates the 
extension of the GKA field life itself.
The base consideration for the acquisition was $39.9 million, 
which following working capital and other adjustments resulted 
in the payment of a cash consideration of $30.3 million. When the 
acquisition was announced, the additional net 2P reserves were 
recorded as 4.7 MMboe as at the economic date of 1 January 2013. 
Following GKA post acquisition production of a net 0.5 million barrels 
of oil in 2014, EnQuest recorded net 2P reserves of c.8 MMbbls in 
GKA as at the end of 2014. Reasons for the net increase included not 
only the addition of Scolty/Crathes, but also improved performance 
and the lengthening of the field life. 
In Q4 2014, EnQuest was offered and accepted eight licences as 
part of the UK 28th North Sea licensing round.

International
2014 was a transformational year for EnQuest’s international 
business, particularly with the acquisition of the PM8/Seligi fields, 
delivering our first production from outside the North Sea. 
In Q2 2014, EnQuest announced the signing of a small field risk 
service contract with Petroliam Nasional Berhad (‘Petronas’), the 
national oil company for Malaysia, for the development and 
production of petroleum from the Tanjong Baram field offshore 
Sarawak, Malaysia. Start-up is expected in mid-2015. Separately, the 
Kitabu prospect, was drilled in Q1 2014, however the well failed to 
encounter hydrocarbons; this was in the SB307/SB308 contract area 
where EnQuest has a non-operated interest.
Later in Q2 2014, EnQuest announced a significant expansion 
of its footprint in Malaysia, through the acquisition of the PM8 
Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’) fields and the Seligi oil field, 
from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Malaysia Inc; both 
EnQuest and Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd to hold participating 
interests. EnQuest also signed an agreement with Petronas to 
extend the term of the PSC, comprising PM8 PSC assets and the 
Seligi oil field to 2033 (formally ‘PM8 PSC (Extension)’ or simply 
‘PM8/Seligi’). This acquisition has a good strategic fit and offers 
considerable potential for EnQuest to use its core skills in enhancing 
value from maturing fields. 
The base consideration for the acquisition was $67.0 million, which 
following interim period adjustments resulted in the payment of a 
cash consideration of $24.7 million. Following strong production of 
a net 0.8 million barrels of oil in 2014, EnQuest recorded net 2P 
reserves of c.15 MMbbls in PM8/Seligi as at the end of 2014. In 
December 2014, following a short transition period, EnQuest took 
over operatorship and is working on an ongoing programme to 
target further efficiency improvements and to maximise recovery. 
Production in the last six months of 2014 was approximately 7,000 
Boepd net, on a working interest basis and this continued to 
improve into 2015. 
In February 2015, EnQuest announced that it had exited from its 
small investment in Tunisia, retention of which had been subject to 
conditions which were not satisfied within the relevant timeframe. 
Consideration of $22 million had been kept in escrow and was duly 
returned to EnQuest. 
In 2014, EnQuest was offered and accepted 2 licences as part 
of the 2014 Awards in Pre-Defined Areas (‘APA’) Norwegian 
Licensing Round.
Financial performance 
In 2014, EnQuest generated EBITDA of $581 million, benefiting from 
further action taken on costs in H2 2014 and also from its full year 
currency hedging programme. 
Following the delays to the Alma/Galia project in early 2014, 
EnQuest’s net capex cost for the first phase of the project is 
expected to be c.$55/bbl.
EnQuest’s funding facilities include c.$900 million of bonds and a 
committed credit facility of $1.2 billion plus an accordion of up to a 
further $500 million. 2014 year end net debt was $933 million, with 
$218 million drawn on the credit facility utilisation before taking into 
account cash balances. 
Total full year 2014 unit operating costs of $42.1 per barrel reflected 
the initial benefit of cost reduction initiatives taken in H2 2014 and 
the lower exchange rate and generally a year of good operational 
performance and strong control of direct costs. 
There were non-cash post-tax impairments of $335.3 million, due to 
lower near term oil price assumptions.
2015 year to date
EnQuest has performed well at the start of 2015; production 
efficiency has again been very strong on our North Sea assets and 
our focus on operational efficiencies in PM8/Seligi has been 
delivering excellent daily production. 
The EnQuest Producer programme is proceeding according to 
schedule in Q1 2015; the boilers were ignited and fired, notice 
was given to moor and hook up the vessel in the field. The FPSO 
recently left the yard in Newcastle, and has successfully completed 
marine performance trials in deeper water nearby, on schedule for 
first oil from Alma/Galia in the middle of this year. 
The drilling of an appraisal well in Kraken West has confirmed 
the presence of oil, with potential for upside. Further evaluation 
is ongoing. 
 
Hedging for 2015 was already in place and hedging is now also in 
place for 2016, currently with 10 million barrels hedged through puts 
averaging c.$68 per barrel in 2016. 
Outlook for the rest of 2015 and beyond
EnQuest is focused on performance and execution. Safety will always 
be a priority and we are focused on operational efficiency and further 
reducing costs. Alma/Galia is on track for first production in the 
middle of the year. Production for 2015 is expected to be an average 
of between 33,000 Boepd and 36,000 Boepd, a 24% increase over 
2014 at the mid-point of the range. With unit operating expenditure 
of approximately $15/bbl to $20/bbl during the period of initial net 
peak volumes, Alma/Galia will also contribute towards a reduction in 
EnQuest’s 2015 unit operating costs of c.10% over 2014. 
2015 priorities also include delivering the $600 million cash capital 
expenditure programme, focused on the Kraken development 
project. The drilling programme has been rationalised to existing 
commitments and to projects with high margin barrels, including the 
drilling of three low cost near field production wells on Thistle, a 
Gadwall sidetrack and bringing Alma/Galia onstream. 
In Malaysia, the 2015 work programme on PM8/Seligi will be 
focused on well intervention activities and improving the field 
infrastructure. For Tanjong Baram, the implementation of our 
development plan is well underway, with first oil targeted by the end 
of H1 2015. 
In Q1 2015, covenants of the credit facility were relaxed giving 
significant flexibility in a lower oil price environment. EnQuest’s focus 
in 2015 will be on near term profitable cash flow and optimising the 
long term value of the business. If the low oil price environment 
continues, then beyond existing development commitments, capital 
expenditure will continue to be rationalised.
The speed and size of changes made to the business in response 
to deteriorating energy market conditions was achieved through 
the agility and focus inherent in EnQuest’s business model. EnQuest 
delivers material improvements to mature fields and we will continue 
doing so in 2015 and beyond.  22 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
BUSINESS REVIEW
RISKS AND 
UNCERTAINTIES
Management of risks and uncertainties 
The Board has articulated EnQuest’s strategy 
to deliver shareholder value by:
 ` exploiting its hydrocarbon reserves;
 ` commercialising and developing 
discoveries;
 ` converting its contingent resources into 
reserves; and 
 ` pursuing selective acquisitions.
In pursuit of this strategy, EnQuest has to face and manage a variety of risks. Accordingly, the 
Board has established a risk management framework to enhance effective risk management 
within the following overarching statement of risk appetite approved by the Board:
 ` We aim to deliver consistently above median investment performance 
 ` We will manage the investment portfolio against agreed key performance indicators 
 ` We seek to avoid reputational risk by ensuring that our operational processes and 
practices reduce the potential for error as far as practical 
 ` We seek to embed a risk culture within our organisation which does not encourage 
excessive risk taking activities and is in line with overall risk appetite 
 ` We seek to manage operational risk by means of a variety of controls to prevent or 
mitigate occurrence 
 ` We set clear tolerances for all material operational risks to minimise overall operational 
losses, with zero tolerance for criminal conduct
A Risk Committee periodically reviews and updates the Group Risk Register based on the 
individual risk registers of its members. The Group Risk Register, along with an assurance 
mapping exercise and a risk report (focused on the most critical risks and emerging and 
changing risk profiles), is periodically reviewed by the Board (with senior management), to 
ensure that key issues are being adequately identified and actively managed. In addition, 
a system of risk reviews has been established to provide oversight in respect of 
prospective significant commitments.
Key business risks 
The Group’s principal risks are those which could prevent the business from executing its 
strategy and creating value for shareholders or lead to a significant loss of reputation.
Set out below are the principal risks and the mitigations together with an estimate of the 
potential impact and likelihood of occurrence after the mitigation actions and how these 
have changed in the past year. 
RISK
Health, safety and environment (HSE)
Oil and gas development, production and exploration 
activities are complex and HSE risks cover many areas 
including major accident hazards, personal health and 
safety, compliance with regulatory requirements and 
potential environmental harm.
Potential impact – Medium (2013 Medium)
Likelihood – Low (2013 Low)
There has been no material change in the potential 
impact or likelihood and the Group’s overall record 
on HSE remains robust. 
MITIGATION
The Group maintains, in conjunction with its core contractors, a comprehensive programme of 
health, safety, environmental, asset integrity and assurance activities and has implemented a 
continual improvement programme, promoting a culture of transparency in relation to HSE 
matters. The Group has established a Corporate HSE Committee which meets quarterly. HSE 
performance is discussed at each Board meeting.
In addition, the Group has a positive, transparent relationship with the UK Health and Safety 
Executive and Department of Energy & Climate Change.
EnQuest’s HSE&A Policy and Principles are now fully integrated across our operated sites and 
this has enabled an increased focus on Health, Safety and the Environment. There is a strong 
assurance programme in place to ensure EnQuest complies with its Policy and Principles and 
regulatory commitments. 
Production
The Group’s production is critical to its success and 
is subject to a variety of risks including subsurface 
uncertainties, operating in a mature field 
environment and potential for significant 
unexpected shutdowns and unplanned expenditure 
to occur (particularly where remediation may be 
dependent on suitable weather conditions offshore).
Lower than expected reservoir performance may 
have a material impact on the Group’s results.
The Group’s delivery infrastructure in the UKCS is 
mostly dependent on the Sullom Voe Terminal.
Longer term production is threatened if low oil 
prices bring forward decommissioning timelines.
Potential impact – High (2013 High)
Likelihood – Low (2013 Low)
There has been no material change in the potential 
impact or likelihood.
The Group’s programme of asset integrity and assurance activities provides leading indicators of 
significant potential issues which may result in unplanned shutdowns or which may in other respects 
have the potential to undermine asset availability and uptime. The Group continually assesses the 
condition of its assets and operates extensive maintenance and inspection procedures designed to 
minimise the risk of unplanned shutdowns and expenditure. The Group monitors both leading and 
lagging KPIs in relation to its maintenance activities and liaises closely with its downstream operators 
to minimise pipeline and terminal production impacts.
Production efficiency is continually monitored and identified remedial and improvement 
opportunities, undertaken as required. A continual, rigorous cost focus is also maintained. 
Life of asset production profiles are audited by independent reserves auditors. The Group also 
undertakes regular internal reviews. The Group’s forecasts of production are risked to reflect 
appropriate production risks.
The Sullom Voe Terminal has a good safety record and its safety and operational performance 
levels are regularly monitored and challenged by the Group and other terminal owners and 
users to ensure that operational integrity is maintained. Nevertheless, the Group actively 
continues to explore the potential of alternative transport options and developing hubs that 
may provide cost savings.  STRATEGIC

RISK
Project execution 
The Group’s success will be dependent upon 
bringing new developments, such as Alma/Galia 
(which was not delivered to schedule or budget) and 
Kraken, to production on budget and on schedule. 
To be successful, the Group must ensure that project 
implementation is both timely and on budget. 
Failure to do so may have a material negative impact 
on the Group’s performance.
Potential impact – High (2013 High)
Likelihood – Medium (2013 Medium)
The likelihood of occurrence of an event impacting 
project execution will have increased to an extent by 
virtue of the commencement of the capital works on 
Kraken, as at 13 March 2015. However, It should be 
noted that project execution risk on Alma/Galia is 
diminishing as the project enters its final stages, with 
Hook-up and Commissioning (HUC) of the FPSO now 
underway (as at 13 March 2015). All wells required for 
first oil are already drilled, completed and tied in. 
MITIGATION
The Group has project teams which are responsible for the planning and execution of new 
projects with a dedicated team for each development. The Group has detailed controls, systems 
and monitoring processes in place to ensure that deadlines are met, costs are controlled and 
that design concepts and Field Development Plans are adhered to and implemented. These 
are modified when circumstances require and only through a controlled management of change 
process and with the necessary internal and external authorisation and communication. The Group 
also engages third party assurance experts to review, challenge and, where appropriate, make 
recommendations to improve the processes for project management, cost control and governance 
of major projects. EnQuest ensures that responsibility for delivering time-critical supplier 
obligations and lead times are fully understood, acknowledged and proactively managed by the 
most senior levels within supplier organisations.
The Kraken development was sanctioned by DECC and EnQuest’s partners in November 2013. First oil 
production is scheduled for 2017. The development involves the drilling of 25 new subsea horizontal 
wells which will be connected to an FPSO. Prior to sanction, EnQuest identified and optimised the 
development plan using EnQuest’s pre-investment assurance processes. Six appraisal wells have 
been drilled in the area, new seismic data was completed, considerable subsurface modelling was 
undertaken and front end engineering and design (FEED) studies were carried out for the FPSO and 
subsea integrated equipment. The first two subsea template structures were successfully installed on 
schedule in September 2014. In order to reduce project cost risk, more than 75% of the capital 
expenditure has been defined by actual tendering and placing of contracts. The FPSO involves 
conversion of an existing tanker which will be under a leased contracting arrangement for a fixed price. 
Reserve replacement
Failure to develop its contingent and prospective 
resources or secure new licences and/or asset 
acquisitions and realise their expected value.
Potential impact – High (2013 High)
Likelihood – Medium (2013 Low)
The likelihood has increased as oil price volatility 
limits business development activity. Low oil prices 
can potentially affect development of contingent 
and prospective resources and can also affect 
reserve certifications. 
The Group puts a strong emphasis on subsurface analysis and employs industry leading 
professionals. The Group continues to recruit in a variety of technical positions which enables it to 
manage existing assets and evaluate the acquisition of new assets and licences. 
All analysis is subject to internal and, where appropriate, external review. All reserves are currently 
externally audited by a Competent Person. In addition, EnQuest has active business development 
teams both in the UK and internationally developing a range of opportunities and liaising with 
vendors/government.
Financial
Inability to fund financial commitments. 
The Group’s revolving credit facility and retail bond 
contain certain financial covenants (each containing 
covenants based on the ratio of net indebtedness 
to EBITDA and finance charges to EBITDA) and in 
the case of the revolving credit facility, a requirement 
for liquidity testing. Prolonged low oil prices, cost 
increases and production delays or outages could 
threaten the Group’s ability to comply with 
relevant covenants.
Potential impact – High (2013 High)
Likelihood – Medium (2013 Medium)
Low oil prices have impacted cash flow adversely, 
increasing the potential impact and likelihood. 
However, it is considered that the risk is being 
appropriately mitigated and remains controlled. 
Further information is contained in the Going Concern 
paragraph on pages 42 and 43 of the Financial Review. 
During the year, the Group issued a $650m High Yield Bond which can be used to fund its 
development activities, and agreed a commercial loan of £31.8m in order to fund its Aberdeen office 
development. This funding is supported by operating cash inflow from the Group’s producing assets. 
The Group reviews its cash flow requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure it has suitable resources 
for its needs. Post year end, the Group renegotiated certain financial covenants under its revolving 
credit facility to provide greater flexibility for its capital investment programme. The net debt / 
EBITDA covenant has been increased to five times and the ratio of financial charges to EBITDA is 
reduced to three times, both until mid-2017. Ongoing compliance with the financial covenants under 
all of the Group’s lending arrangements (including the $650m High Yield Bonds and £155m Retail 
Bonds) is actively monitored and reviewed.
The Group is maintaining a focus on costs through supplier renegotiations, cost-cutting and 
rationalisation. Where costs are incurred by external service providers, e.g. at Sullom Voe Terminal, 
the Group actively challenges operating costs. 
Human resources
The Group’s success is dependent upon its ability 
to attract and retain key personnel and develop 
organisational capability to deliver strategic growth. 
Industrial action across the sector could also impact 
on the operations of the Group.
Potential impact – Low (2013 Medium)
Likelihood – Low (2013 Low)
There has been a reduction in the potential impact 
due to low oil prices impacting the buoyancy of the 
employment market. 
The Group has established a competent employee base to execute its principal activities. In addition 
to this, the Group, which seeks to maintain good relationships with its employees and contractor 
companies, regularly monitors the employment market to provide remuneration packages, bonus 
plans and long term share-based incentive plans that incentivise performance and long term 
commitment from our employees to the Group.
EnQuest is undertaking a number of human resource initiatives. These initiatives are part of the overall 
People and Organisation strategy and have specific themes relating to Organisation, People, 
Performance and Culture. It is a Board-level priority that the Executive and senior management have 
the right mix of skills and experience. 
The Group also maintains market-competitive contracts with key suppliers to support the execution of 
work where the necessary skills do not exist within the Group’s employee base.
The focus on Executive and senior management retention, succession planning and development 
remains an important priority for the Board and an increasing emphasis will continue to be placed 
on this.  24 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
BUSINESS REVIEW
RISKS AND 
UNCERTAINTIES
CONTINUED
RISK
Reputation
The reputational and commercial exposures to a 
major offshore incident are significant.
Potential impact – High (2013 High)
Likelihood – Low (2013 Low)
There has been no material change in the potential 
impact or likelihood.
MITIGATION
Operational activities are conducted in accordance with approved policies, standards and 
procedures. Interface agreements are agreed with all core contractors.
The Group undertakes regular audit activities to provide assurance on compliance with established 
policies, standards and procedures.
Oil price
A material decline in oil and gas prices 
adversely affects the Group’s operations and 
financial condition. 
Potential impact – High (2013 High)
Likelihood – High (2013 Low)
The potential likelihood has increased due to 
declining and volatile oil prices. 
This risk is being mitigated by a number of measures including hedging production, renegotiating 
supplier contracts and lending arrangements and reducing costs and commitments.
The Group monitors oil price sensitivity relative to its capital commitments and has a policy which 
allows hedging of its production. The Group has hedged significant amounts of its production in 
2015 and 2016 using puts and calls. This ensures that the Group will receive a minimum oil price for 
its production.
In order to develop its resources, the Group needs to be able to fund substantial levels of 
investment. The Group will therefore regularly review and implement suitable policies to hedge 
against the possible negative funding impacts of changes in oil prices whilst remaining within the 
limits set by its revolving credit facility.
The Group has established an in-house trading and marketing function to enable it to enhance its 
ability to mitigate the exposure to volatility in oil prices. 
Political and fiscal
Unanticipated changes in the regulatory or fiscal 
environment can affect the Group’s ability to deliver 
its strategy and potentially impact revenue and 
future developments.
Potential impact – High (2013 High)
Likelihood – Medium (2013 Medium)
Although the referendum on Scottish independence 
has taken place, there is a general election in May 
2015. Whilst it appears unlikely that a new UK 
government will unexpectedly burden the industry 
in the current low oil price environment, the 
outcome of the general election is still uncertain. 
It is difficult for the Group to predict the timing or severity of such changes. However, through Oil 
& Gas UK and other industry associations the Group does engage with government and other 
appropriate organisations in order to ensure the Group is kept abreast of expected potential 
changes and takes an active role in making appropriate representations.
All business development or investment activities recognise potential tax implications and the 
Group maintains relevant internal tax expertise.
At a more operational level, the Group has procedures to identify impending changes in relevant 
regulations to ensure legislative compliance.
Joint venture partners
Failure by joint venture parties to fund 
their obligations.
Dependence on other parties where the Group is 
not the operator.
Potential impact – Medium (2013 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2013 Medium)
There has been no material change in the potential 
impact or likelihood.
The Group operates regular cash call and billing arrangements with its co-venturers to mitigate the 
Group’s credit exposure at any one point in time and keeps in regular dialogue with each of these 
parties to ensure payment. Risk of default is mitigated by joint operating agreements allowing the 
Group to take over any defaulting party’s share in an operated asset and rigorous and continual 
assessment of the financial situation of partners.
The Group generally prefers to be the operator. The Group maintains regular dialogue with its 
partners to ensure alignment of interests and to maximise the value of joint venture assets.  STRATEGIC 
REPORT

RISK
Competition
The Group operates in a competitive environment 
across many areas including the acquisition of oil 
and gas assets, the marketing of oil and gas, the 
procurement of oil and gas services and access to 
human resources.
Potential impact – Medium (2013 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2013 Low)
There has been an increase in the perceived potential 
likelihood due to recent emergence of new 
competitors for acquisitions (e.g. private equity) and 
the increased leverage of the Group. 
MITIGATION
The Group endeavours to have a resilient balance sheet, which puts it in a position to be able to 
compete effectively and move quickly when looking to acquire assets.
The Group also has strong technical and business development capabilities to ensure it is well 
positioned to identify and execute potential acquisition opportunities.
The Group maintains good relations with oil and gas service providers and constantly keeps the 
market under review.
Portfolio Concentration
The Group’s assets are concentrated in the UK North 
Sea around a limited number of infrastructure hubs 
and existing production (which is principally only oil) 
is from mature fields. This amplifies exposure to key 
infrastructure, political/fiscal changes and oil 
price movements.
Potential impact – Medium (2013 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2013 Low)
This risk is mitigated in part through acquisitions. For all acquisitions, the Group uses a number of 
business development resources to evaluate and transact acquisitions in a commercially sensitive 
matter. This includes performing extensive due diligence (using in-house and external personnel) 
and actively involving executive management in reviewing commercial, technical and other 
business risks together with mitigation measures. During 2014, EnQuest acquired the PM8/Seligi 
producing asset in Malaysia as well as the Greater Kittiwake Area. 
The Group also constantly keeps its portfolio under rigorous review and accordingly, actively 
considers the potential for making disposals, executing development projects (Alma/Galia, 
Kraken), making international acquisitions and expanding hubs. 
International business
Whilst the majority of the Group’s activities and 
assets are in the UK, the international business is 
becoming more material. The Group’s international 
business is subject to the same risks as the UK 
business (e.g. HSE, production and project 
execution); however, there are additional risks that 
the Group faces including security of staff and 
assets, political, foreign exchange and currency 
control, taxation, legal and regulatory, cultural and 
language barriers and corruption.
Potential impact – Medium (2013 Medium) 
Likelihood – Medium (2013 Low)
The expanded international business has increased 
the likelihood of the overall risk. In addition, oil 
price uncertainty has increased the potential 
impact and likelihood of a slowdown in 
international growth plans. 
Prior to entering into a new country, EnQuest evaluates the host country to assess whether there is 
an adequate and established legal and political framework in place to protect and safeguard first 
its expatriate and local staff and, second, any investment within the country in question.
When evaluating international business risks, executive management reviews commercial, technical 
and other business risks together with mitigation and how risks can be managed by the business 
on an ongoing basis.
EnQuest looks to employ suitably qualified host country staff and work with good quality local 
advisers to ensure it complies within national legislation, business practices and cultural norms 
whilst at all times ensuring that staff, contractors and advisers comply with EnQuest’s business 
principles, including those on financial control, cost management, fraud and corruption.
Where appropriate, the risks may be mitigated by entering a joint venture with partners with local 
knowledge and experience.
After country entry, EnQuest maintains a dialogue with local and regional government, particularly 
with those responsible for oil, energy and fiscal matters, and may obtain support from appropriate 
risk consultancies. When there is a significant change in the risk to people or assets within a 
country, the Group takes appropriate action to safeguard people and assets.  26 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Overview 
In 2014, EnQuest had its best Health, 
Safety & Environment (‘HSE’) performance 
since it was formed in April 2010, with its 
focus on HSE culture and performance. 
Good HSE performance drives good business performance, and the 
Production Efficiency (‘PE’) has been excellent. In 2014, EnQuest 
achieved an overall UK production efficiency of 88% excluding the 
new GKA assets, or of 86% including GKA. This, together with the 
delivery of successful wells at Heather and Don South West, 
enabled production of 24,436 Boepd in the North Sea in 2014. 
Looking forward to 2015, with Alma/Galia on track for first oil in the 
middle of the year, the North Sea operations team is ready to take 
control of the development as it is handed over by the projects 
team. With net peak production of c.13,000 Boepd, Alma/Galia is 
set to increase daily UK production levels by over 50%. The Gadwall 
sidetrack and other barrel adding activities will continue on the 
existing hubs. Work to finalise the best development solution for 
Scolty/Crathes will also continue.

Operations summary
On Heather, the return to drilling programme was completed in 
Q1 and drilling operations have been continuous throughout the 
year with production from the platform peaking at more than 
7,000 Boepd (gross) in November, the first time such levels have 
been reached since January 2013. Heather achieved high levels 
of operational uptime, with an exceptional run of 136 continuous 
days without a production trip, due to the focus of the 
operations teams onshore and offshore. 
Substantial progress has also been made on Kittiwake. The 
return of the Mallard field to production following its workover in 
the summer added 3,000 Boepd, increasing overall Greater 
Kittiwake Area field rates to around 5,500 Boepd, less than six 
months after acquisition. 
On the Don fields, high levels of water injection were achieved 
and the drilling of the TJ production well and the scale dissolver 
programme at Don Southwest were delivered. The Don North 
East located Ythan field has progressed from open acreage 
to development in six months, with the well spudded ahead 
of schedule.
Thistle/Deveron achieved year on year production growth 
of 14%. The Thistle life extension project itself made further 
progress in 2014 and a major industry award highlighted 
recognition of this project as a proven template for successfully 
extending the life of ageing assets. 
On exploration, the Avalon well was drilled faster than scheduled 
and was under budget, and the Cairngorm appraisal well yielded 
positive initial results. In the 28th licensing round EnQuest was 
awarded acreage it had applied for around its hubs.
At the end of 2014, EnQuest started the process for the return of 
32% of its interests in Crawford to the previous owner, following 
which EnQuest will hold a 19% working interest.  STRATEGIC

2014 
Thistle delivered 14% production growth 
year on year, reflecting continuing benefit 
from new production wells brought 
onstream during the course of H2 2013 
and the programme of investment in the 
Thistle life extension project.
The A57 and A60 wells continued to outperform expectations 
with watercut rising slower than anticipated. The commissioning 
of the ‘D’ turbine on gas and the reinstatement of the refurbished 
‘B’ turbine gave improved power stability and improved water 
injection efficiency in the second half of the year. The second of two 
new cranes was fully installed and made operational in Q3 2014, 
reducing risk and operating expenditure. These elements of the life 
extension investment programme, alongside EnQuest’s focused 
operating strategy, have continued to improve production 
efficiency at Thistle. 
2015 and beyond
Drilling will restart at Thistle in 2015, with three new production 
wells being brought onstream, one in the middle of the year and 
two more in H2 2015. The Thistle life extension project will be 
mechanically complete during 2015, with full completion scheduled 
for 2016. A planned maintenance shutdown of the Sullom Voe 
Terminal (‘SVT’) will stop export from Thistle for three weeks at 
the end of H1 2015; EnQuest has scheduled its own maintenance 
programme for the same dates and will additionally use it for some 
extra life extension works.

2014 
Production efficiency remained 
very strong, at almost 90%, with high 
levels of water injection efficiency 
supporting production. 
Production from Area 22 of Don Southwest was boosted by a 
successful acid stimulation treatment on Well S2z and by the 
completion in August of a new production well. The new production 
well, TJ, delivered initial rates in line with expectations but 
production chemistry issues prevented successful gas lift, and 
medium term rates were below expectation. The acid stimulation 
and scale inhibition programme also benefited Don SW wells S11 
and S10Y. An upgrade of the water injection system is underway 
which will allow better operability and increased injection rates. On 
West Don, the W4 well suffered from scale build up and was shut-in 
in November awaiting a remedial acid treatment. Bad weather 
delayed this work into Q1 2015. In Q1 2014, EnQuest applied for 
and was offered an ‘out of round’ licence (P.2137) in the Don North 
East area for blocks 211/18e and 211/19c, including the Area 23 and 
Area 24 discovered oil accumulations and an undrilled extension to 
the Don North East field. The Area 24 discovery which lies adjacent 
to the Don Southwest field, progressed rapidly to development with 
the Field Development Plan, for the renamed ‘Ythan’ field approved 
by DECC and the first well spudded in November.
2015 and beyond
A phased development of the Ythan field is planned, with drilling 
operations on the first well continuing through Q1 2015 and first 
production from the field by mid-2015. The drilling of the Ythan AA 
injector well is planned for around the end of 2015. Following W4 
scale build up in winter it was brought back online in Q1 2015 and is 
performing well. The SVT shutdown will similarly be used for 
planned EnQuest maintenance on the Northern Producer.
During 2015, the natural rates of decline will reduce production.

2014 
Production at Heather/Broom delivered 
4,081 Boepd in 2014. This was down 
slightly after a strong performance 
in 2013.
Following the completion of the 2013 rig reactivation project, rig 
operations in Q1 2014 commenced with a workover of the H56 well, 
which was brought onstream in May and has continued to deliver 
planned levels of oil production. This was followed by the sidetrack 
of shut-in well H44 as a new injection well in the B2 block. The H64 
injector was brought on in July, which resulted in an increase from 
the nearby producer, H62Y, over the following months. Crestal 
producer, H47, was sidetracked in place of the planned workover, 
and was brought onstream in November, delivering an initial rate 
significantly above expectation. New producer H66, a sidetrack of 
suspended well H48, was being drilled at year end. 
High levels of operational uptimes and a production efficiency of 
over 90% have been achieved and 136 consecutive days without any 
production interruptions were achieved in H2 2014. The Broom water 
injection flowline failed at the end of August; replacement options 
were assessed and a contract awarded for the design, procurement 
and installation of a replacement line.
2015 and beyond
Beyond the completion of the Heather H48 sidetrack as the H66 
production well, there will be no further drilling on Heather in 2015. 
Broom injection will be reinstated by the middle of 2015. The SVT

(‘GKA’)
Post acquisition programme in 2014 
EnQuest took over as the operator at 
the end of Q1 2014 with the duty holder 
remaining in place. The focus was on 
integrating GKA and delivering an early 
workover programme on Mallard, which 
has led to a near doubling of production. 
Next steps will include progressing the proposed Field 
Development Plan (‘FDP’) submission for the nearby Scolty/Crathes 
discoveries, with a tie-back to GKA with potential exploration of 
nearby prospects. 
The Mallard workover was successfully completed and was brought 
online at the end of Q3 2014, GKA production peaked at 7,300 
Boepd, shortly after. Following inspection and routine testing the 
existing tree was reinstalled, which reduced expenditure and allowed 
early production from Mallard. Since acquiring GKA, EnQuest has 
been applying its proven skills for managing mature fields. Improved 
operational efficiency and the benefit of the workover, has increased 
production from just over 2,500 Boepd gross in the first few months, 
to over 5,500 Boepd gross in October. The Mallard workover also 
facilitated the opportunity for an accelerated Gadwall workover. 
Production from Gadwall will be reinstated mid-2015, following the 
sidetracking of the existing well in H2 2014. The Grouse well now 
benefits from stable gas-lift supply. 
EnQuest made substantial improvements in operating efficiency, 
with opex per barrel significantly reduced from pre-acquisition 
levels. Front End Engineering Design (‘FEED’) studies were being 
completed on the proposed development of Scolty/Crathes. 
2015 and beyond
Goosander, Grouse and Mallard will all be online in 2015 and 
production from Gadwall is expected to be reinstated in mid-2015.
We are conducting studies on future development scenarios for 
Avalon, and have considered options for Avalon in FEED 
engineering on Scolty/Crathes. 
Further reductions in GKA unit opex are anticipated during 2015.

2014 
At the end of 2014, the Alma/Galia 
development project was on track for 
first oil in mid-2015. 
Systems required for first oil were mechanically complete, with 
commissioning well underway. 
Control systems (marine, subsea, electronic submersible pumps) 
had been installed and commissioned. Five production wells were 
fully completed and ready for FPSO tie-in. The pre-first oil drilling 
programme for the production wells was successfully completed, 
with five wells meeting or exceeding expectations. The subsea 
infrastructure was in place, with risers and mooring systems 
wet-stored awaiting the arrival of the FPSO. 
2015 
In January the EnQuest Producer boilers were lit, one of the final 
steps ahead of completing onshore commissioning. The FPSO 
recently left the yard in Newcastle and has successfully completed 
marine performance trials in deeper water nearby, on schedule 
for first oil in the middle of the year. Oil tank commissioning is 
undertaken in the field, just ahead of commercial production coming 
onstream. Alma/Galia is on course for first oil in mid-2015. Five wells 
are now available to come onstream in mid-2015; a phased start up 
is planned, with one well coming onstream per week, for the first 
month. Drilling on the Galia production well is to be completed and 
tied in during H2 2015.

ENQUEST VALUES
CREATIVITY
Creativity for me means being innovative and novel when 
tackling problems and that is why I enjoy working at EnQuest. 
I joined EnQuest not for a job, but to build a dynamic career in 
an entrepreneurial oil and gas producer. It is highly fulfilling to 
work with colleagues who are not only open to new ideas and 
methods but also ask all the right questions when facing 
unconventional challenges.

Head of Major Projects
During 2014, the work that was required to prepare the 
donor tanker for conversion to FPSO was largely completed; 
hull and deck modifications began, alongside other workscopes, 
including accommodation upgrades and helideck fabrication. 
All the principal contracts have now been placed for individual 
modules, including the power, water injection and

KRAKEN
2014 
During 2014, the Kraken project 
progressed well, on budget and 
on schedule. 
In Q2 2014, the FPSO donor vessel arrived at the shipyard in 
Singapore for the conversion scope to commence. The programme 
of conversion work continued throughout the rest of the year. 
The initial focus was on the hull conversion and the marine system 
refurbishment. Fabrication progressed for key elements of the 
FPSO, including the topside modules, accommodation and 
the helideck.
In H2 2014, EnQuest conducted the installation of two integrated 
templates (subsea structures) at the first drill centre, where the initial 
wells for the development will be drilled. A survey vessel successfully 
completed coring work at the FPSO mooring anchor locations. 
Delivery of the hydraulic submersible pumps (‘HSP’) used to provide 
the artificial lift commenced in Q3 2014. Detailed engineering, 
procurement and manufacture for all equipment relating to wells, 
subsea infrastructure and the FPSO continued throughout 2014.
Further appraisal drilling was undertaken to the west of the Kraken 
field in H2 2014, to assess potential there.
2015 and beyond 
The Kraken programme for 2015 includes the installation of subsea 
hardware, including the manifolds for the first drill centre which 
connect to the templates already installed and two templates for the 
second drill centre and six subsea trees. The mooring system for the 
FPSO and the batch drilling programme will also commence. 
The drilling of an appraisal well and sidetrack to the west of the 
Kraken Field has confirmed the presence of oil. Preliminary analysis 
indicates that the primary well (Tyrone) found oil bearing reservoir 
with a net vertical thickness of approximately 25 feet. The sidetrack 
(Tiree) also confirmed oil bearing reservoir, with net vertical 
thickness of approximately 83 feet. Further evaluation is ongoing. 
 
The new drilling rig is expected on location at Kraken by Q3 2015, 
to commence the Kraken batch drilling programme.
The FPSO programme also continues, with a dry docking scheduled 
to install the FPSO turret by the end of Q1 2015.

Our Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’) 
for PM8/Seligi in Malaysia includes the 
Seligi oil field, once the largest oil field off 
Peninsular Malaysia. PM8/Seligi combined 
has over 200 wells. 
Faysal Hamza
Head of International
This is a substantial opportunity for EnQuest to replicate the 
success of its strategy on Thistle, potentially on a considerably 
larger scale, significantly increasing production, extending PM8/
Seligi’s field life and increasing reserves. 
PM8/Seligi has already materially increased EnQuest’s overall 
production levels and by Q4 2014, the new fields were producing 
approximately 15,000 Boepd gross. Having taken over 
operatorship, EnQuest is focused on an ongoing programme to 
target efficiency improvements and to maximise recovery.

EnQuest assumed offshore field operations in October, while the 
overall transition completed in December 2014. Production from the 
fields has been strong and continues to increase. Going forward, 
EnQuest intends to enhance production through well interventions, 
facilities rectification and upgrades, and subsurface programmes 
that will lead to new wells. 
2015 and beyond
The work programme is focused on well interventions and 
improving the field infrastructure, including gas compressors, power 
generators and ongoing integrity management of topside facilities 
and pipelines. 
2014
In March 2014, EnQuest signed a Small Field Risk Service Contract 
with PETRONAS for the development of the Tanjong Baram field, 
offshore Sarawak. Tanjong Baram is being developed as an 
unmanned platform with production tied back to the Petronas 
Carigali operated West Lutong A complex. The development plan 
is based on a two well programme, with capacity for one additional 
well in the facilities design. Work on the development of the project 
is proceeding according to plan. 
2015 and beyond
Development of the field is underway, with first oil targeted by end 
of H1 2015, to be followed by steady state operations.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW 
The Group has delivered a strong 
operational performance in 2014 against a 
backdrop of falling oil prices and general 
industry cost pressures. Significant capital 
investment in growth projects continued 
throughout the year. 
Jonathan Swinney 
Chief Financial Officer 
Financial Overview
In the year ended 31 December 2014, the Brent crude oil price 
averaged $98.9 per barrel compared to $108.7 per barrel for 2013. 
Total production volumes were 15% higher for the year ended 
31 December 2014 which resulted in revenue of $1,009.9 million 
compared with $961.2 million in 2013.

Intangible impairments and write-offs 0.6 2.0
Net foreign exchange (gains)/losses (27.2) 20.5
EBITDA 581.0 621.3
EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2014 was $581.0 million 
compared with $621.3 million in 2013. The lower EBITDA is mainly 
due to lower oil prices in H2 2014 and higher tariff and 
transportation costs.
In H1 2014 the Group successfully raised a $650 million high 
yield bond. The eight year bond further diversified the Company’s 
capital base and gives long term maturities for its debt profile. At 
the year end $217.6 million was drawn on the $1.2 billion Revolving 
Credit Facility (RCF) before taking into account cash balances of 
$176.8 million. In addition, during the year, the Group also entered 
a £31.8 million two year development loan facility to finance the 
construction of the Group’s Aberdeen office building.
Following receipt of the bond proceeds EnQuest entered into a 
number of foreign exchange transactions to swap $550 million of 
the US Dollar proceeds into Sterling to enable it to repay Sterling 
drawings under the RCF. The transactions required EnQuest to swap 
Sterling back into US Dollars between October and December 2014 
at a fixed rate. In early October 2014 the transactions were closed 
out realising a gain of $46.7 million.

The Group’s operating costs comprise production costs and tariff 
and transportation costs which were $436.5 million for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 compared with $308.0 million in 2013. 
Transportation costs increased from $73.5 million to $140.0 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2014 mainly due to significantly 
higher unit costs per barrel at SVT. Production costs increased by 
$61.7 million to $296.2 million for the year ended 31 December 
2014, partly attributable to the acquisition of the GKA asset on 
1 March 2014 and the PM8/Seligi Malaysian asset acquired at the 
end of June. In the other producing assets, higher costs in Thistle 
and Heather related to diesel usage and increased logistics and 
maintenance costs.
There has been a significant increase in SVT tariff costs. Costs are 
$28.9 million higher than the prior year due to a higher base level 
of costs incurred by the operator and also EnQuest being allocated 
a higher proportion of SVT costs in 2014. This reflects EnQuest’s 
increased production and therefore higher share of throughput at 
SVT. In addition, the exceptional items include a charge of $32.8 
million in respect of 2012 and 2013 costs which were only notified 
to EnQuest by the operator in 2014. Working collaboratively with 
the SVT operator and co-owners, gross costs are expected to be 
reduced going forward and also a lower proportion of these will 
accrue to EnQuest. The project to define the medium to long term 
future is maturing in its definition and we expect the SVT operator 
to define the project fully in 2015. Finally, the unit operating cost per 
barrel has been adjusted for a 40% allocation of the gain from the 
bond proceeds currency transactions, which reflects the 
approximate ratio of operational expenditure to capital expenditure 
for the year.
Due to the above factors, the Group’s average unit production and 
transportation cost has increased by $6.6 per barrel.
The Group’s depletion expense per barrel for the year is consistent 
with the previous year with a higher rate in Heather and Thistle as a 
consequence of a higher capex profile offset by lower production in 
the Don fields.
The Group’s change in lifting position was an $8.2 million expense 
for the year ended 31 December 2014, compared with an expense 
of $2.6 million in 2013. The net overlift during 2014 has increased 
mainly due to the UK operated assets being in an overlift position 
offset with an underlift in Alba and Malaysia.
Exploration and evaluation expenses
Exploration and evaluation expenses were $4.0 million in the 
year compared with $8.6 million reported in the previous year. The 
expenses in 2014 primarily relate to South West Heather, Norway’s 
pre-licence costs and costs relating to the 28th Licence Round in 
the UK.
General and administrative expenses 
General and administrative expenses were $16.5 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2014 compared with $25.0 million reported in 
the previous year. A reduction in business development specific costs 
and higher Parent Company Overhead (PCO) recovery accounts for 
the majority of the movement.
Other income and expenses
Other income is comprised of net foreign exchange gains 
of $27.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2014 relating 
to exchange rate fluctuations relating to the retail bond and 
bank loans.
Taxation 
The tax charge for the year of $105.8 million, excluding exceptional 
items, represents an effective tax rate of 43.5% compared with 43% 
in the previous year. The small increase in the Group’s effective tax 
rate for the year is due primarily to foreign exchange losses relieved 
at the mainstream tax rate, partly offset by an increase in the Ring 
Fence Expenditure Supplement on UK activities. 
Through these facilities, EnQuest has a diversified and long term 
funding base providing financing for current projects.
 
As a result of the continued capital investment, UK corporate 
tax losses at the end of the year increased to approximately $1,818 
million. The effective tax rate for the year excluding exceptional 
items is 43.5% which reflects the blend of UK and international 
assets. In the current environment, no material corporation tax or 
supplementary corporation tax is expected to be paid on UK 
operational activities before 2025. The Group paid cash corporate 
income tax on assets acquired in Malaysia and this is expected to 
continue throughout the life of the production sharing contract (PSC).
Income Statement
Production and revenue
Production levels, on a working interest basis, for the year ended 
31 December 2014 averaged 27,895 Boepd compared with 24,222 
Boepd in 2013. The increase reflects a substantial initial contribution 
from PM8/Seligi in Malaysia, higher production in the Thistle field 
which has been experiencing high production efficiency and ten 
months of production from the newly acquired Greater Kittiwake 
Area (GKA) assets. This was partially offset by the expected natural 
decline in the Don fields.
The Group’s blended average realised price per barrel of oil sold 
was $100.6 for the year ended 31 December 2014, below the $109.7 
per barrel received for 2013, reflecting the decline in the oil price in 
Q4 2014. Revenue is predominantly derived from crude oil sales and 
for the year ended 31 December 2014 crude oil sales totalled $970.5 
million compared with $953.8 million in 2013. The increase in 
revenue was due to the higher production and an overlift of $8.2 
million in 2014 compared with an overlift of $2.6 million in 2013 and 
partly offset by a reduction in the oil price. Within revenue in 2014 
there is $31.7 million of realised income relating to oil commodity 
hedges and call options.
Operating costs
Cost of sales comprises cost of operations, tariff and transportation 
expenses, change in lifting position, inventory movement, derivative 
and foreign exchange hedging movements and depletion of oil and 
gas assets. Cost of sales for the Group (pre-exceptionals and 
depletion of fair value adjustments) were as follows:

Cost of sales pre-exceptionals and depletion of fair value 
adjustments was $654.1 million for the year ended 31 December 
2014 compared with $526.3 million in 2013. An increase of $85.3 
million was due to costs relating to the GKA and PM8/Seligi 
acquisitions and an increase of $34.0 million was due to increased 
transportation costs. The significant increase in the latter was partly 
due to increased volumes, but mainly due to an increase in the costs 
per barrel at the Sullom Voe Terminal (SVT). This has been partially 
offset by an overall gain relating to the bond proceeds currency 
transactions and realised mark to market valuations on foreign 
exchange trades.  40 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Cash flow and liquidity
The Group’s reported cash generated from operations in 2014 was 
$637.1 million compared with $562.7 million in 2013. The reported 
cash flow from operations per share was 82.3 cents per share 
compared with 72.3 cents per share in 2013. The increase is mainly 
due to a decrease in trade receivables and joint venture debtors, an 
increase in trade payables, accrued payables and a decrease in the 
opening underlift position. 
During the year ended 31 December 2014, $2.1 million was received 
in relation to an exploration refund for EnQuest Norge AS’s activities 
in Norway. In addition, $7.9 million was paid during the year ended 
31 December 2014 in relation to EnQuest Group’s UK tax liabilities 
for non-operational activities and petroleum revenue tax (PRT). $6.6 
million was paid in relation to the Group’s operations in Malaysia. 
It is anticipated that the underlying effective tax rate for 2015 will be 
materially below the UK statutory tax rate of 60%, excluding one-off 
exceptional tax items, mainly due to the impact of Ring Fence 
Expenditure Supplement. In the current environment and with the 
investment in the North Sea, the Group does not expect a material 
cash outflow for UK corporation tax on operational activities before 
2025. This is due to the projected level of capital expenditure, which 
benefits from tax deductible first year capital allowances in the UK, 
available field allowances and accumulated tax losses which are largely 
attributable to the Group’s capital investment programme to date. 
Cash outflow on capital expenditure is set out in the table below:
2014
$ million
2013

Expenditure on producing oil and 
gas assets 318.0 294.5

Exploration and evaluation capital 
expenditure 69.7 36.6
Other capital expenditure 44.5 21.2
1,060.3 984.3
Significant projects were undertaken during the year, including:
 ` the Alma/Galia development including spending on the FPSO 
and further drilling of the production wells;
 ` the Kraken development;
 ` the Thistle life extension programme;
 ` the Dons drilling programme on the TJ production well and the 
scale dissolver programme at Don Southwest;
 ` Ythan JT well; 
 ` the acquisition of GKA and successful workover of Mallard;
 ` the Heather/Broom drilling programme was completed and 
drilling programmes on H44, H47 and H56; and
 ` PM8/Seligi acquisition.
Net debt at 31 December 2014 amounted to $932.8 million 
compared with net debt of $381.1 million in 2013.
In H1 2014, the Group successfully issued a $650 million high yield 
bond, with a 7% coupon and a 2022 maturity.
In 2015, the Group renegotiated financial covenants under its RCF to 
provide greater flexibility for its capital investment programme. The 
net debt/EBITDA covenant has been increased to five times and the 
ratio of financial charges to EBITDA has been reduced to three 
times, both until mid-2017. Compliance with ongoing covenants 
continues to be a priority for the Group.
Exceptional items and depletion of fair value uplift 
Exceptional losses totalling $821.9 million before tax have been 
disclosed separately in the year ended 31 December 2014. Tangible 
oil and gas assets have been impaired by $678.8 million relating to 
the Don fields and Alma/Galia. The impairment is primarily due to 
the significant fall in the oil price in the latter part of 2014. 
Exceptional items also includes an impairment of $152.0 million 
to intangible costs for the year ended 31 December 2014. The 
majority of the costs relate to the Crawford, Porter, Kildrummy and 
Cairngorm licences and some GKA acreage in the UK. In current 
market conditions some of these interests do not merit sufficient 
funds to progress them to economic development. The impairment 
also includes costs on the unsuccessful exploration well in the 
SB307/308 block in Malaysia.
The remaining balance is made up of SVT costs of $32.8 million 
invoiced by the operator in 2014, but relating to 2012 and 2013 
production, $6.9 million of depletion on the fair value uplift on 
acquisitions and $19.2 million unrealised mark to market losses on 
derivative contracts offset by negative goodwill of $28.6 million 
relating to the acquisition of PM8/Seligi in Malaysia.
The tax impact of the exceptional items is a tax credit of $508.1 
million, resulting in an overall tax credit for the year of $402.3 million 
and an overall effective tax rate of 69.5%.
Finance costs
Finance costs of $121.1 million include $52.1 million of bond 
and loan interest payable, $12.1 million unwinding of discount on 
decommissioning provisions and $41.4 million relating to the time value 
of the closed out puts. Other financial expenses of $18.5 million are 
primarily commitment and letter of credit fees of $11.6 million as well as 
arrangement fee amortisation relating to the bank facilities and bonds 
of $6.8 million. The Group capitalised interest of $3.2 million for the 
year ended 31 December 2014 in relation to the interest payable on 
borrowing costs on its capital development projects.
Finance income
Finance income of $1.8 million includes $0.3 million of bank 
interest receivable, $0.4 million VAT interest received and $0.9 million 
unwinding on the financial asset created in 2012 as part of the 
consideration for the farm out of the Alma/Galia development to 
KUFPEC.
Earnings per share
The Group’s reported basic earnings per share was (22.8) cents for the 
year ended 31 December 2014 compared with 24.4 cents in 2013. The 
decrease of 47.2 cents was attributable to higher operating, finance 
and exceptional impairment costs offset slightly by a lower tax charge 
for 2014. The Group’s reported diluted earnings per share excluding 
exceptional items was 17.8 cents for the year ended 31 December 
2014 compared with 24.0 cents in 2013. The decrease of 6.2 cents 
was mainly attributable to lower gross profit and higher finance costs 
offset by a lower effective income tax rate.  STRATEGIC

Balance Sheet
The Group’s total asset value has increased by $545.4 million to 
$4,095.9 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: $3,550.5 million).
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) has increased to $3,116.4 
million at 31 December 2014 from $2,871.2 million at 31 December 
2013. The increase of $245.2 million is mainly due to oil and gas 
asset capital additions of $839.5 million. The main spend relates 
to Kraken ($112.7 million) and Alma/Galia ($415.8 million). There 
was also $82.1 million in relation to changes in estimates on the 
decommissioning provisions and $206.1 million of acquisition costs 
mainly relating to GKA ($55.0 million) and Malaysia ($150.9 million). 
Depletion and depreciation charges of $252.0 million were incurred 
as well as an impairment charge of $678.8 million.
The oil and gas asset capital additions, including carry 
arrangements, during the year are set out in the table below:
2014 
$ million
Dons hub 53.1
Thistle hub 79.8
Heather and Broom hub 96.4

Alba 4.5
GKA 95.7
PM8/Seligi 160.8

1,045.7
On 1 March 2014, EnQuest completed the acquisition of the GKA 
assets including an interest in the Kittiwake to Forties oil export 
pipeline. In June 2014, EnQuest completed the acquisition of the 
Seligi oil field and the PM8 PSC, located offshore Malaysia. 
Intangible oil and gas assets
Intangible oil and gas assets decreased by $65.2 million to 
$65.7 million at 31 December 2014. The decrease mainly relates to 
impairments on the Crawford, Porter, Kildrummy and Cairngorm 
licenses and some GKA acreage in the UK.
 
Investments
The Group holds an investment of 160,903,958 new ordinary shares 
in Ascent Resources plc which is valued at $0.7 million based on the 
quoted bid price as at 31 December 2014.
Inventory
Inventory increased by $42.6 million, the increase relates to the 
purchase of xmas trees of $22.0 million and drilling and operational 
inventory.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables have increased by $19.0 million to 
$286.2 million at 31 December 2014 compared with $267.2 million 
in 2013. Prepayments and accrued income include the initial 
payment of $100 million to Armada Kraken PTE Limited for the lease 
of an FPSO vessel for the Kraken field. Trade receivables and joint 
venture receivables have both decreased in line with normal 
business activity. 
Cash and bank
The Group had $176.8 million of cash and cash equivalents at 
31 December 2014 and $217.6 million was drawn down on the 
$1.2 billion RCF.
Provisions
The Group’s decommissioning provision increased by $221.3 million 
to $449.7 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: $228.4 million). The 
acquisition of GKA and PM8/Seligi have an associated provision of 
$124.3 million. EnQuest has a 50% interest in the GKA area, but is 
only responsible for approximately 25% of the decommissioning 
liability for the platform. The decommissioning provision for GKA 
is $77.6 million. For the PM8 PSC, EnQuest’s estimated share of the 
decommissioning provision is approximately $46.7 million, for which 
the PSC contractors are required to make annual cost recoverable 
contributions into a sinking fund based on a pro-rata production basis. 
The Group has re-evaluated the discount rate to be used when 
discounting the Group’s decommissioning liabilities. The liability 
is discounted at 3% (2013: 5%) and this is included as a change in 
estimate, resulting in an increase of $77.4 million. The underlying 
costs for the UK assets remain consistent with the third party report 
that was commissioned in 2013 to complete the detailed triennial 
study to review decommissioning cost estimates for the operated 
producing hubs. 
The Group acquired 40% of the Kraken field from Nautical 
Petroleum plc and First Oil plc in 2012 through payment of the 
development costs (other than operator costs) incurred from 
1 January 2012 in respect of the development programme for the 
Kraken discovery which would otherwise have been payable by 
those partners.
A provision was initially recognised in 2013 for the contingent 
carry (additional consideration) which is dependent on a reserves 
determination. The reserves determination would be triggered by the 
carried parties, based on drilling work or, if later, the date on which 
the ‘firm’ carry expires. The contingent carry is pro-rated between 
100–166 million barrels of 2P reserves. The field development plan 
which was approved in November 2013, stated 137 million barrels. 
This would give rise to a contingent carry of approximately $80 
million which is included as a provision. The carry is estimated to 
be paid 12 months after the ‘firm’ consideration has expired in 
early 2015.
Income tax
The Group had no UK corporation tax or supplementary corporation 
tax liability at 31 December 2014, which remains unchanged from the 
prior year. The Group had PRT recoverable of $4.4m at 31 December 
2014 compared with a $4.0 million liability at 31 December 2013. The 
decrease is due to over paid PRT instalments on Alba in the second 
half of 2014. The income tax asset at 31 December 2014 represents 
the expected refund on exploration activities undertaken in Norway, 
a pre-acquisition corporate income tax overpayment in Malaysia and 
the expected PRT refund.
Deferred tax liability
The Group’s deferred tax liability (net of deferred tax assets) has 
decreased by $283.7 million to $462.6 million at 31 December 2014 
from $746.3 million in 2013. The decrease is mainly due to the 
impairment charge, partly offset by the capital expenditure 
programme undertaken by the Group during the year which provides 
the Group with 100% first year capital allowance claims as well as an 
increase in ring fence taxation losses carried forward and deferred tax 
liabilities arising on the acquisition of assets in Malaysia. Total UK tax 
losses carried forward at the year end amount to approximately 
$1,818.2 million. 
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables have increased to $429.1 million at 
31 December 2014 from $363.3 million at 31 December 2013. 
The increase of $65.8 million is mainly due to an increase in trade 
payables of $57.8 million in line with increased activity in the year 
and an increase in the overlift position of $13.1 million.  42 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW 
CONTINUED
EnQuest’s functional currency is US Dollars. Foreign currency risk 
arises on purchases and the translation of assets and liabilities 
denominated in currencies other than US Dollars. To mitigate the 
risks of large fluctuations in the currency markets, the hedging 
policy agreed by the Board allows for up to 70% of the non-US 
Dollar portion of the Group’s annual capital budget and operating 
expenditure to be hedged. For specific contracted capital 
expenditure projects, up to 100% can be hedged. During the first 
half of 2013, the Group entered into a structured product to hedge 
a portion of its Sterling, and Norwegian Krone (NOK) exposure 
throughout 2013 and 2014. During 2014, a total of £182 million of 
Sterling exposure was hedged using this structured product with an 
average strike price of $1.46:£1. If the spot rate at expiry of the 
contracts was above $1.64:£1 then there was no trade and the 
Group funded its Sterling requirement through the spot market or 
drew Sterling on the bank facility. Between $1.64:£1 and $1.33:£1, 
EnQuest traded at the lower of $1.46:£1 and the spot rate, and 
below $1.33:£1, EnQuest traded a higher volume of currency at 
$1.46:£1. 
The same structure was also used to hedge the Group’s Norwegian 
Krone exposure arising as part of the Kraken development project. 
In 2014, a total of NOK367 million was hedged.
During 2014 the Company entered into several foreign exchange 
swap contracts when Sterling was trading above $1.66:£1. The 
realised impact of $46.7 million has been recognised in the income 
statement within cost of sales.
EnQuest continually reviews its currency exposures and when 
appropriate looks at opportunities to enter into foreign exchange 
hedging contracts.
Surplus cash balances are deposited as cash collateral against 
in-place letters of credit as a way of reducing interest costs. 
Otherwise cash balances can be invested in short term bank 
deposits and AAA-rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved 
limits and with a view to minimising counterparty credit risks.
Going Concern
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk 
throughout the year, including monitoring forecast covenant results. 
Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities considered 
for, but not limited to, changes in crude oil prices (adjusted for 
hedging undertaken by the Group), production rates and 
development project timing and costs. These forecasts and 
sensitivity analyses allow management to mitigate any liquidity 
or covenant compliance risks in a timely manner.
Following the significant decline in oil prices, management has 
taken action to implement certain cost saving programmes, to 
reduce planned operational expenditure, general and administrative 
spend and capital expenditure in 2015 and 2016. Management also 
successfully renegotiated certain covenants contained within the 
Revolving Credit Facility. 
Other financial liabilities
Other current financial liabilities have decreased by $68.4 million to 
$101.5 million. The decrease relates to the Kraken ‘firm’ carry which 
has reduced throughout the year, amounting to $99.0 million. This is 
offset by an increase relating to commodity forward contracts and 
forward foreign currency contracts of $29.6 million.
Other non-current financial liabilities have increased by $22.9 
million. The balance is made up of commodity forward contracts of 
$18.0 million that expire in 2016 and $5.7 million relating to a carry 
liability with respect to PM8. 
 
Financial Risk Management
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Brent crude oil 
prices on its revenue and profits. EnQuest’s policy is to manage the 
impact of commodity prices and during 2013 the Company entered 
into commodity hedging contracts to hedge partially the exposure to 
fluctuations in the Brent oil price during 2014. A total of 3.6 million 
barrels of puts (300,000 barrels per month) were bought at a price of 
$106 per barrel and 7.2 million barrels of calls were sold at a price of 
$106 per barrel, which would only be triggered if the monthly average 
price of Brent exceeded a fixed price for the given month (ranging 
from $119 to $124 per barrel).
During Q1 2014, the Company swapped an additional 1 million 
barrels at prices of approximately $109/bbl. An additional 1 million 
barrels were swapped in Q2 at a price of $105/bbl.
In Q4 2014, the Company bought puts covering 8 million barrels to 
hedge 2015 production at an average price of $87.3/bbl. In addition, 
the Company sold calls covering 8 million barrels maturing in 2015 
and 7.5 million barrels maturing in 2016. The put position was closed 
in Q4 2014, with the Company purchasing new puts covering 10 
million barrels of 2015 production priced at $65/bbl and selling a 
further 2.25 million barrels of 2015 calls. In return, for closing out the 
$87.3/bbl puts and purchasing the lower priced puts and selling the 
additional calls, the Company received cash of $100 million. Gains 
of $119.1 million in respect of the 8 million barrels of puts closed in 
December, which were designated as hedges of 2015 production, 
have been deferred in equity, and will be recognised during 2015.
After the year end the Group hedged 10 million barrels of 
production for 2016, through the purchase of puts with an average 
strike price of $68.2/bbl on a pro-rata basis throughout 2016. In 
addition, the Group sold further calls maturing in mid-2015 and 
through 2016. In total, as at the date of this report, the Group has 
sold 11.8 million barrels of 2015 calls with an average strike price of 
$80.55/bbl, and 13.5 million barrels of 2016 calls with an average 
strike price of $88.53/bbl. 
The total premiums received or receivable through the sale of calls 
to date totals $115.0 million. This premium will be realised in the 
income statement over the life of the options. In total $6.8 million 
was realised in 2014, with a further $82.4 million and $25.8 million to 
be realised in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Unrealised mark to market 
movements in these options will be recognised as an exceptional 
item in line with the Company’s accounting policy. STRATEGIC 
REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
43 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
At year end, the Group had significant headroom on its borrowing 
facilities and related financial covenants under both the Revolving 
Credit Facility and the Retail Bond. The Group’s forecasts and 
projections take into account the actions described in the 
preceding paragraph, and reflect the assumption that the Group’s 
major projects remain on track. These forecasts indicate that the 
Company will be able to operate within the requirements of its 
existing borrowing facilities for 12 months from the date of approval 
of the Annual Report and Accounts. Forecasts therefore indicate 
that the Group’s liquidity will remain strong. 
Furthermore, if there were further sustained falls in the oil price 
or the benefits of planned initiatives are not realised, management 
has a number of options available to it to maintain strong liquidity, 
including asset sales, new financings or amendment of covenants 
under the existing financing arrangements (including the Retail 
Bond) and may do so as a precautionary measure should it 
determine that it is appropriate or prudent to do so. The Directors 
therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CORPORATE 
RESPONSIBILITY 
REVIEW
During 2014 the Company conducted 
a review of its approach to Corporate 
Responsibility and has approved an 
approach which improves transparency.
The main areas of focus are Health and 
Safety, People, the Environment, Business 
Conduct and Society, each with its own 
policy framework. EnQuest’s website has 
been modified to reflect this approach. 
EnQuest recorded its best overall HSE 
performance since the business was 
formed in 2010.
John Atkinson
Head of Health, Safety, Environment & Assurance (‘HSE&A’)
Health & Safety and Environment: Focus on safety culture 
and practices
Over the year, we achieved a Lost-Time Incident Frequency Rate 
(‘LTIFR’) of zero and a Recordable Incident Frequency Rate (‘RIFR’) 
below the industry average. There were no high-potential incidents 
(‘HIPO’s): the last recorded HIPO was in April 2013.
In addition, we recorded a total of 11 years without a Lost-Time 
Incident (‘LTI’) and 11 million man hours LTI-free across our 
producing northern North Sea assets. Health and Safety Executive 
inspections were performed on all these assets, and no major issues 
were identified.
Our 2014 performance was primarily due to an even greater 
focus upon our safety culture and practices by our leadership 
team and senior operations personnel, augmented by an ongoing 
commitment to our continuous improvement plan by people 
across the organisation.
In practical terms, three groups of managers and supervisors 
completed Major Accident Hazard (‘MAH’) training at the 
Spadeadam test facility in Cumbria during the year. The courses 
extended this key area of training further into the business: a similar 
exercise was undertaken by the leadership team in 2013. This 
programme connects closely to Operations Excellence, which 
defines EnQuest’s unique way of working and has the control of 
MAHs as one of its three key themes. 
The same theme was also reflected in a detailed review undertaken 
in 2014 of the hydrocarbon release prevention plans that are in 
place for individual assets.
Other prominent areas of activity included the provision of 
support to ready the EnQuest Producer for the start of operations 
at Alma/Galia in 2015 – ensuring the formation of a complete, 
fit-for-purpose HSE&A framework for the asset – and detailed 
preparatory work ahead of the future introduction of a new 
simplified and standardised Control of Work regime. 
A comprehensive review of the safety case for our Thistle asset was 
completed, to ensure it remains fully up-to-date and relevant. The 
safety cases for all assets are updated routinely, but each is the 
subject of a five-yearly review. Safety representatives played a key 
role in the Thistle review, as they do in all such exercises.
We moved to a single waste management contractor arrangement 
in 2014. This will help the business pursue its goal of reducing the 
levels of waste consigned to landfill while improving efficiency.
In Malaysia, an HSE Manager was appointed to lead the 
establishment and consolidation of an appropriate infrastructure 
that’s fully aligned with the country’s regulatory environment as well 
as EnQuest’s own policies and principles in this key area. A close 
working relationship has been created between our Malaysian 
operations and the UK to support this key process.
People: Challenging economic conditions
One of the key challenges for the Human Resources (‘HR’) function 
lay in managing costs as efficiently as possible within increasingly 
difficult economic conditions during the latter part of the year.
At the same time, the business benefited from a series of 
programmes that reflect the underlying principles of EnQuest’s 
People and Organisation strategy. 
Internationally, the key focus was upon establishing a strong and 
sustainable EnQuest team in Malaysia to support the Company’s 
increased operational portfolio there.
The projects rolled out in the North Sea business during 2014 under 
the People and Organisation agenda – summarised as the right 
organisation, with great people, who deliver exceptional 
performance, in the EnQuest way – included the Workday system. 
This unified HR platform delivers greater control, decision making 
and compliance and reflects EnQuest’s distinctive way of working.  STRATEGIC 
REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
45 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Business Conduct: During 2014 EnQuest refreshed its anti-
bribery and compliance training programme, rolling this out to 
all of its personnel.
In addition a compliance officer was appointed in order to review 
and monitor EnQuest’s compliance related policies and controls.
EnQuest’s Code of Conduct was updated to reflect a number of 
policy changes. 
The Board also reviewed the Company’s approach to gender 
diversity and confirmed that whilst we work hard to ensure that we 
recruit from a diverse background of candidates, not just in relation 
to gender, we will continue to recruit the best candidate available for 
the job, without the decision being influenced by a need to fill certain 
quotas. We believe that our gender statistics are representative of the 
demographics of the wider oil and gas industry.
Community: Continued active work programme supporting core 
community relationships
Once again EnQuest placed a great deal of emphasis upon its 
community relations work, and helped to deliver very practical gains 
in the process.
The centrepiece of EnQuest’s year was a charity golf day in June 
which raised more than £75,000 for a number of organisations 
and campaigns.
A total of £15,000 was donated to the Play Golf – Help Save Lives 
campaign led by former Ryder Cup Bernard Gallacher. The money 
was used to gift life-saving equipment to 15 golf clubs – 14 in the 
north-east of Scotland with high membership numbers, and one in 
Shetland – in partnership with safety training and offshore services 
specialist Falck Safety Services.
Each club received automated external defibrillators (‘AED’): 
Bernard Gallacher credits the availability of an AED for saving his 
life when he suffered a cardiac arrest at a reception in Aberdeen in 
2013. He subsequently launched the campaign to provide public 
access defibrillators at golf clubs across the UK and Ireland.
We also donated £10,000 to the Arrhythmia Alliance, which raises 
awareness of cardiac arrhythmias and their treatment, as well as 
£25,000 to each of our two nominated charities: Archway and The 
Paul Lawrie Foundation.
There was further support for Archway, which provides support 
services for young people and adults with learning disabilities, in 
the form of three ‘makeover’ sessions at a respite centre run by the 
charity. Groups of EnQuest people spent time performing painting 
work and other renovation tasks to enhance the facility.
EnQuest’s partnership with Tullos Primary School in Aberdeen 
continued throughout the year. Subsurface and wells personnel 
visited the school during its annual Science Week to offer an insight 
into their specialist areas of the industry. Through our partnership 
with the Paul Lawrie Foundation, we arranged for the provision of 
pop-up golf facilities at the school to allow youngsters to try the 
sport, and also facilitated two visits by pupils to the Paul Lawrie Golf 
Centre just outside Aberdeen. 
We supported two Christmas appeals in the north-east of Scotland: 
Northsound Radio’s Cash for Kids ‘Mission Christmas’ and Instant 
Neighbour’s Giving Tree appeal. The campaigns had the same aim: 
to ensure every child in Aberdeen received at least one gift on 
Christmas Day. EnQuest people donated gifts to both causes, while 
some members of staff provided practical support to the Cash for 
Kids appeal by spending time at the radio station, sorting gifts into 
age categories. 
The Strategic Report was approved by the Board and signed on 
its behalf by the Company Secretary on 18 March 2015.

We also introduced a new employee grading system designed to 
add extra consistency and fairness and instigated a staff development 
programme. A pilot phase completed in 2014 featured approximately 
20 members of staff who underwent a set schedule of coaching and 
mentoring support. Several of those involved have gone on to be 
promoted within the organisation. 
That same principle was also evident in the ongoing offshore staff 
deepening process, which continued with 49 further personnel 
transferring from Petrofac during the year.
In addition, it delivered EnQuest’s first formal student placement 
campaign. A total of 15 students from universities across Scotland 
spent three months with the company, working in many different 
areas of the business. 
Together, these initiatives illustrate the ongoing process of maturing 
the practices and processes that underpin all HR related work. 
Despite the challenging economic conditions, EnQuest successfully 
repeated its ability to build organisational capability internationally. 
EnQuest’s partnership with Tullos Primary School in Aberdeen 
continued throughout the year. 
Specifically, it focused upon ‘designing’ an organisation – and 
subsequently assembling a team while putting all required policies 
and processes in place – in Malaysia. This process was completed, 
from a standing start, over the course of just a few months. By the 
end of the year, we had approximately 80 onshore staff and 50 
offshore personnel, complemented by a wider team of contractors.
A five strong HR team was formed in Malaysia to deliver this 
challenging workscope, which was exacerbated by a tight 
recruitment market in the country. The team has been working with 
an appropriate degree of autonomy while at the same time ensuring 
EnQuest’s broader principles, as they apply to HR activities, are fully 
aligned to those of the Group. 
EnQuest’s successful launch into Malaysia has also fuelled a broader 
objective: to create new career development experiences and 
opportunities for EnQuest people in new geographical locations. 46 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014

and evolve EnQuest’s strategy, taking key 
decisions on its implementation. In 2014 
these included the acquisition of EnQuest’s 
first producing assets outside the North 
Sea and in 2015 the Board also took 
measured actions in light of the changed 
macro environment, in particular in terms 
of setting the new business plans for 2015

GOVERNANCE 
CHAIRMAN’S
LETTER
Dear Shareholder, 
EnQuest PLC (‘EnQuest’ or the 
‘Company’) has produced strong 
results in 2014, and we have continued to 
grow our business in line with our vision 
despite the current headwinds generated 
by the present low oil price. The dramatic 
reduction in oil price was generally not 
anticipated by the industry. EnQuest 
has however responded vigorously to 
the challenges and opportunities which 
have followed. 
Our resilience is as a result of the excellent people we have, our 
values and the processes we have in place. I would like to extend 
my thanks to the management and people of the Company for 
the hard work and dedication shown throughout the year. 
Corporate governance
I am pleased to report that your Company has complied in full 
with the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code. In September 
2014, the FRC published the revised 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code compliance with which will be reported 
annually by the Company from next year. The Company is well 
advanced in implementing its responses to the changes brought 
in by the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Corporate Governance for EnQuest is not just about following a 
set of rules but embedding a framework which supports our core 
values and, provides structure for how we are organised, how we 
manage risk, how we behave and how we provide assurance in 
respect of performance. Your Board has strengthened a number 
of areas of Corporate Governance including our risk management 
framework and Corporate Responsibility. We have worked, and 
continue to work, to ensure that all elements of corporate 
governance are ingrained in our corporate culture and we have 
developed an environment which nurtures, develops and 
maintains our approach. 
We have three main Board committees within our governance 
framework: Audit Committee; Remuneration Committee; and 
Nomination Committee, which assist the Board in fulfilment of 
its corporate governance objectives. The core functions and 
activities of each can be found in their respective sections. In 
addition to this, our governance framework also contains several 
non-Board committees, which provide advice and support to 
the Chief Executive, including an Executive Committee and 
Operations Committees for each of the North Sea and 
International business divisions. In addition we have established 
a Risk Committee responsible for the discussion with the Board 
of the principal outputs from EnQuest’s Risk Management 
Framework. We also hold dedicated HSE reviews on a quarterly 
basis which are chaired by the Chief Executive.
Board composition and succession planning
Whilst there have been no changes to the Board during 2014, 
succession planning to ensure the right composition of the Board 
has remained a key priority. As Chairman I constantly monitor and 
review the balance of skills and knowledge on the Board to ensure 
that the Board is able successfully to execute its strategy, 
supported by the annual review of Board effectiveness. 
Corporate Responsibility 
The Board reviewed the Company’s approach to Corporate 
Responsibility and has approved a model which improves 
transparency. The main areas of focus are Health and Safety, 
People, the Environment, Business Conduct and Society, each 
with its own key elements and relevant policy framework. 
EnQuest is committed to operating responsibly and will 
never knowingly compromise the Company’s Health and Safety 
standards. Our approach to HSE&A management is built on our 
values, which are Respect, Focus, Agility, Creativity, Passion, 
Collaboration and Empowerment. These values assist us in 
fostering a working environment which is secure, creative 
and passionate. STRATEGIC

Risk
We have undertaken a review of the Company’s risk management 
processes and the Board has adopted a Risk Management 
Framework that has developed upon existing processes, including 
making the Company’s approach to risk management more 
robust in light of the growth and expansion internationally. 
Shareholder engagement
Transparent and ongoing engagement with shareholders remains 
a key for the Board and we have held numerous investor relation 
events during 2014, including investor broker and sales meetings 
as well as presentations at international conferences. We routinely 
invite governance officers of key institutional investors to meet 
with the Chairman and Senior Independent Director to discuss 
any governance issues they may have. 
Strategy
The Board continued to provide strategic guidance to Executive 
Management throughout the year, which culminated in EnQuest’s 
annual Board strategy day in October 2014. The workshop 
involved a comprehensive review of our existing strategy as well 
as identification of key themes to help us navigate changes in the 
landscape for our business. We are confident that our strategy has 
positioned us well to achieve our long term goals and to maximise 
shareholder value. 
Dr James Buckee 
Chairman
During 2014 the Company conducted a thorough review of its 
Corporate Responsibility policies, which included the area of 
Human Rights. We seek to avoid causing or contributing to adverse 
human rights impacts and to address such impacts when they 
occur. We have ensured that we have strong relevant policies in 
place covering the areas of Health and Safety, People, Business 
Environment, Business Conduct and Community. We will be 
working towards monitoring the impact and progress of these 
areas in the coming period. We have updated our website to reflect 
the changes that have been made and we hope that investors find 
that these changes provide informative and useful insight into our 
approach to Corporate Responsibility and Human Rights.

ENQUEST VALUES
COLLABORATION
Collaboration is a critical element uniting everyone towards 
common goals. It does not carry one’s role higher than that of 
others; thus, making everyone equally important and relevant 
to the business. Collaboration stands very prominently as a 
critical work delivery method for a high performance team.

STATEMENT
The Board of Directors remains 
unchanged from 2013 and is currently 
made up of two Executive Directors and 
five Non-Executive Directors, including 
the Chairman.
Leadership
Board composition
The Board of Directors remains unchanged from 2013 
and is currently made up of two Executive Directors and five 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman. All of the 
Directors served throughout the reporting period. Their 
biographies, including prior experience, are set out on 
pages 46 and 47.
The role of the Board
The Board is responsible for leadership of the Company and setting 
strategic objectives, in order to deliver long term shareholder value. 
The Board is not responsible for the execution of its strategic 
objectives and these are delegated to the Executive Management. 
Operational management of the Group on a day-to-day basis is 
overseen by the North Sea Operations Committee and the 
International Operations Committee, each of which comprises 
members of the Executive Committee, Asset Managers and 
selected Senior Management. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to 
it for decisions, which has been approved by the Board. Its reserved 
matters include to determine the overall strategy of the Group, to 
review business plans and trading performance, to approve major 
capital investment projects, to examine acquisition opportunities 
and divestment possibilities, to review significant financial and 
operational issues, and to review and approve the Company’s 
financial statements, control and risk management systems.
Chairman and Chief Executive
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and agreed 
by the Board. Your Chairman is an independent Non-Executive 
Director and his key responsibilities are the leadership of, setting the 
agenda for and ensuring the effective working of, the Board. The 
Chairman also ensures that the effectiveness and integrity of the 
Board/Executive relationship is maintained between scheduled Board 
meetings through regular contact with all Board members. The Chief 
Executive’s role is the operational management of the business, 
developing strategy in consultation with the Board and then 
implementing such strategy. 
Role of the Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors bring to the Board independence, 
along with a broad mix of business skills, knowledge and 
experience. They provide an external perspective to Board 
discussions and are responsible for the scrutiny of the Executive 
Management on behalf of shareholders. The Board is satisfied that 
all of the Non-Executive Directors meet the independence criteria 
as set by the UK Corporate Governance Code. The terms and 
conditions of each of their appointments are available for inspection
The Non-Executive Directors, in conjunction with the Chairman, 
meet at least once annually in order to review the effectiveness 
of the Board. 
Senior Independent Director
Helmut Langanger continues to serve as the Senior Independent 
Director and provides a sounding board for the Chairman as well 
as acting as an intermediary with other Directors when necessary. 
He also discusses any concerns with shareholders that cannot be 
resolved through the normal channels of communications with 
the Chairman or the Chief Executive. The Senior Independent 
Director meets with the other Non-Executive Directors without 
the Chairman present at least annually in order to evaluate the 
performance of the Chairman. The outcome of their 2014 evaluation 
is addressed on page 53.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, 
through the Chairman, on all governance matters. In addition, 
each Director has access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. There is also a procedure agreed by 
the Board, in furtherance of its duties, to take independent 
professional advice if necessary, at the Company’s expense, up to 
a predetermined limit. The Company Secretary is instrumental in 
facilitating the induction of new directors and assists with the 
ongoing training and development of the Board. 
Board activity during the year
How the Board operates
The Board held six scheduled Board meetings throughout 2014, four 
of which were held at the Company’s registered office in London, 
one was held at the Company’s Aberdeen office and one was held 
offsite in conjunction with the strategy day. In addition to this a 
number of other meetings were held in order to deal with matters 
that required consideration at short notice. 
Board papers are distributed in a timely manner via our online Board 
portal system, which provides faster access to Board papers as well 
as reducing our environmental impact through the elimination of 
paper packs and removing the costs associated with printing and 
distribution. The Board agenda is drawn up by the Company 
Secretary in conjunction with the Chairman and with agreement 
from the Chief Executive.  STRATEGIC

Board Committees
The Board delegates a number of responsibilities to its Audit 
Committee, Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee, 
each of which has formal terms of reference approved by the Board. 
The terms of reference for each of these Committees satisfy the 
requirements of the Code and are reviewed internally on an 
ongoing basis by the Board. Copies of the terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website.
The Committees are provided with all necessary resources to enable 
them to undertake their duties in an effective manner. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committees and 
minutes of all Committee meetings are available to all Directors.
In addition to the three Board committees we have several non-Board 
committees, which assist the Chief Executive in the implementation 
and monitoring of strategy, namely these are the Executive 
Committee, North Sea Operations Committee, International 
Operations Committee and the Group Health, Safety, Environment 
and Assurance team. 
Delegation of Authority
We have a comprehensive Delegation of Authority matrix, which 
sets out the delegated authority levels and other controls from 
Board level down. This is periodically reviewed and in 2014 it was 
supplemented with delegations specific to the Company’s Trading 
and Marketing operations including as to counter party credit risk, 
reflecting the expansion of the Company’s sources of oil production.
Board evaluation
A comprehensive internal Board evaluation covering 2014 has been 
conducted. This was supported by a high level questionnaire which 
built on the results of previous year’s evaluation. The evaluation was 
facilitated by the Company Secretary, under the direction of the 
Chairman and key topics covered included: 
 ` strategy and investment matters;
 ` internal control and corporate governance; 
 ` administration, support and development of the Board; and
 ` Board membership and proceedings of meetings.
The review recognised the individual and collective strengths of 
the directors. The Board considered its own composition in light 
of the development of the Company, and examined how to enhance 
information flows and optimise the Board’s impact on areas such as 
strategy, risk management and assurance process as well as 
information flows.
In addition to the Board evaluation the Senior Independent 
Director conducted a review by the Board of the Chairman. The 
review recognised the Chairman’s extensive experience and solid 
stewardship during a challenging period for the Company. Relations 
between Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors are good 
and there is a strong degree of alignment on the areas requiring 
attention over the coming year as part of the Board’s commitment 
to continuous improvement. 
EnQuest conducts an externally facilitated board review once every 
three years. We will be conducting our second externally facilitated 
Board review in 2015, the first one having taken place in 2013.
Induction, information and support
New Directors receive a full induction following their appointment, 
covering the activities of the Group and its key business and financial 
risks, the terms of reference of the Board and its Committees and the 
latest financial information about the Group.
The Board is updated regularly throughout the year on regulatory 
and governance changes as well as industry developments. The 
Chairman monitors the breadth of knowledge, skills and experience 
of the Board and its Committees to ensure that they can fulfil 
their obligations.

Accountability
Conflicts of interest
Directors have a duty to avoid direct and indirect conflicts of 
interest. Directors must report any concern in this respect and we 
ensure that potential and actual conflicts of interest are recorded, 
and the Board is satisfied that formal procedures are in place to 
ensure that authorisation for potential and actual conflicts of interest 
are operated efficiently. 
Anti-bribery and corruption
In 2014 we have continued to embed our anti-corruption 
programme including by re-issuing our anti-corruption programme 
to the whole Company to refresh the familiarity of our personnel 
with EnQuest’s zero tolerance approach and with the Company 
specific policies. 
Risk
As noted above, we have developed a comprehensive Risk 
Management Framework throughout the course of 2014 which was 
approved and adopted by the Board in October 2014. Key elements 
of the Risk Management Framework include: to identify the risks, to 
assess the risks, ensuring reliable prioritisation, to respond to the 
risks by implementing fully resourced and effective plans with action 
owners, and to control the risk through a regular tracking of risk and 
action progress, by communicating through the organisation.
EnQuest’s Risk Management Framework underpins how risks are 
identified and managed across the organisation. Some key elements 
of the programme include:
 ` articulation of the Company’s risk appetite to underpin risk 
activities across the organisation;
 ` clear identification of risk areas affecting the Company and 
allocation of responsibilities for identification, monitoring and 
management of risks;
 ` delineation of actions to be undertaken in response to risk and 
the resources required in order to achieve this; and
 ` governance practices delineating the roles of the Risk 
Committee, Audit Committee and the Board as well as how risk 
management and assurance mapping are reported. 
We will be continuing to embed the new elements of our framework 
throughout 2015. 
The Company has encouraged staff to escalate any concerns 
they may have. We provide an external ‘speak-up’ reporting line for 
this purpose.
There have been a limited number of instances where issues have 
been elevated. The identified issues have been addressed and 
investigated by the Company’s General Counsel. 
Engagement with shareholders 
Relations with shareholders
Effective shareholder engagement is essential to the Board and we 
ensure continuous dialogue throughout the year by way of investor 
relations programmes through which the Chief Executive, Chief 
Financial Officer and Senior Management regularly meet with major 
shareholders, and by providing extensive information about the 
Group’s activities through the Annual Report and Accounts, half 
yearly report and interim management statements, which are 
published promptly and made available on our website. 
In 2014, numerous investor and broker sales meetings were held, 
presentations were made at international conferences as well as a 
results presentations, which altogether provided for comprehensive 
and engaging dialogue with shareholders and potential investors. 
The Company periodically arranges for formal surveys of investor 
opinion to be conducted, these are reported to the Board.
Corporate governance at EnQuest is designed to promote the 
long term interests of our shareholders, strengthen management 
accountability, and foster responsible decision making. We routinely 
invite the governance officers of large institutional investors to meet 
with the Chairman and Senior Independent Director in order to 
discuss any governance issues that they may wish to raise with the 
Company. These initiatives are made in order to help ensure that we 
are openly promoting high standards of corporate governance.
Shareholders and other interested parties can subscribe to receive 
news updates by email by registering online on the website.
2014 Annual Report
Following extensive review, the Board has concluded that the 
2014 Annual Report and Accounts, as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for users to 
assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
Annual General Meeting
The Board uses the Company’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) to 
communicate with investors and welcomes their participation. All 
shareholders, or their duly appointed proxies, are entitled to attend 
the AGM, at which the Board members are present. The Board views 
the AGM as a good opportunity to meet with smaller private 
shareholders. A summary presentation of results is given by the 
Chief Executive before the Chairman deals with the formal business. 
All shareholders present can question the Chairman, the Chairmen 
of the Committees and the rest of the Board both during the 
meeting and informally afterwards.

AUDIT COMMITTEE  
REPORT
Dear Shareholder, 
When we last reported to you, we 
set out our planned areas of focus 
for 2014. 
These included:
 ` considering the effectiveness of our major capital project 
management, and cost forecasting;
 ` conduct an assurance mapping exercise; and
 ` ensuring our controls and risk management processes are 
embedded within our international locations.
Our work during 2014 has, as planned, focused on these areas: 
PwC, our internal auditor, conducted a review of our project 
management controls, processes and governance associated 
with our Kraken project, and a third party has been 
commissioned to give assurance to the Board as the Kraken 
project progresses. Additionally, we have overseen the 
development of an assurance map which was considered by the 
Committee and Board in the March meeting, and have had 
regular updates from management in respect of the controls and 
processes being developed in our newly acquired businesses.
Unsurprisingly, the significant decline in the oil price, and 
resulting pressure on EnQuest’s cash flows and covenants, 
has necessitated that the Committee pay particular attention to 
how the Company has responded, and the appropriateness of 
the going concern assumption. The market conditions have 
increased the risk in respect of judgements and estimates made 
in the financial statements, and our work during the year has 
responded to this. Details of these judgements and estimates, 
and how we satisfied ourselves as to their appropriateness, are 
set out in detail below, together with further information on how 
the Committee discharged its responsibilities during the year.
Looking ahead into 2015 we will continue to monitor closely the 
Group’s financial liquidity, and will maintain our focus on ensuring 
the controls and risk management processes within the Group 
are embedded appropriately within our Malaysia business.

and interim reports and any other formal announcement relating to 
the Company’s financial performance;
 ` consider whether the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced 
and understandable;
 ` monitor and review the process of audit of the Group’s proven and 
probable reserves by a recognised Competent Person;

Committee composition
As required by the Code, the Committee is comprised exclusively of 
Non-Executive Directors, biographies of whom are set out on pages 
46 and 47. The Board is satisfied that the Chairman of the Committee, 
a previous audit partner of a Big Four audit firm and member of the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland, meets the 
requirement for recent and relevant financial experience.
Membership of the Committee and attendance at the three 
meetings held during 2014 is provided in the table below:

Financial reporting and significant financial statement reporting issues
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting is to assess, amongst other things:
 ` the appropriateness of the accounting policies selected and disclosures made, including whether they comply with International 
Financial Reporting Standards; and
 ` those judgements, estimates and key assumptions that could have a significant impact on the Group’s financial performance and 
position, or on the remuneration of Senior Management.
We consider these items together with both management and our external auditor, who both provide reports to the Audit Committee in 
respect of these areas at each Committee Meeting. The main areas considered during 2014 are set out below:
Significant financial statement reporting issue Consideration
Going concern
The Group’s assessment of the going concern assumption is based 
on detailed cash flow and covenant forecasts. These are, in turn, 
underpinned by forecasts and assumptions in respect of:
 ` production forecast for the next two years, based on the Group’s 
latest risked production forecast;
 ` the oil price;
 ` opex and capex forecasts based on the approved 2015 budget and 
plan; and
 ` other funding activities including certain asset portfolio activities.
The Board regularly reviews the liquidity projections of the Group. 
In the March Audit Committee meeting, management presented 
the liquidity analysis to be presented to the Board, a detailed going 
concern analysis, including sensitivity analysis and stress testing, and 
explanations and justifications for the key assumptions made. The 
external auditor presented its findings on the conclusions drawn.
This analysis was considered and challenged, in detail, by the Audit 
Committee, including the appropriateness of the assumptions made. 
The wording in the Annual Report concerning the going concern 
assumption (see pages 42 and 43) was reviewed and approved for 
recommendation to the Board.
Potential misstatement of oil and gas reserves
The Group has total proved and probable reserves at 31 December 
2014 of 220.0 MMboe. The estimation of these reserves is essential to:
 ` the value of the Company;
 ` assessment of going concern;
 ` impairment testing;
 ` decommissioning liability estimates; and
 ` calculation of depreciation. 
In the March meeting, management presented the Group’s 2P 
reserves, together with the report from Gaffney Cline, our 
reserves auditor.
We considered the scope of the work performed by Gaffney Cline 
and their independence and objectivity. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE  
REPORT CONTINUED STRATEGIC 
REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
57 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Significant financial statement reporting issue Consideration
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
Significant capital expenditure is incurred on projects and the 
fair value of these projects is a significant area of judgement. 
At 31 December 2014, a total of $3.7 billion had been capitalised 
in respect of tangible oil and gas assets, $0.2 billion in respect 
of exploration & evaluation assets and $0.2 billion in respect of 
goodwill, the recovery of which is dependent upon the expected 
cash flows of the underlying assets. 
Owing to the significant decline in the oil price, impairment testing 
has been performed resulting in an impairment of $0.7 billion of 
tangible oil & gas assets, and $0.1 billion of exploration & evaluation 
assets. No impairment of goodwill was required. 
These impairment tests are underpinned by assumptions regarding:
 ` 2P reserves (as audited by Gaffney Cline);
 ` oil price assumptions (forward curve until 2018 and $85 real 
thereafter);
 ` life of field opex and capex; and
 ` a discount rate driven by EnQuest’s weighted average cost 
of capital.
Management presented to the Committee in the March meeting, 
the key assumptions made in respect of impairment testing, and the 
result thereof. The Committee considered and challenged these 
assumptions. Consideration was also given to EY’s view of the work 
performed by management.
Adequacy of the decommissioning provision
The Group’s decommissioning provision is carried at $450 million 
at 31 December 2014, which is based on a discounted estimate 
of the future costs and timing to decommissioning the Group’s 
assets. Judgement exists in respect of the estimation of the 
costs involved, the discount rate assumed, and the timing of 
decommissioning activities.
In 2013 the Group commissioned Wood Group PSN to estimate the 
costs involved in decommissioning each of our operated fields and 
facilities. These estimates underpin the 2014 provision. Estimates for 
Kittiwake have been internally developed by appropriately qualified 
personnel, and the estimates in respect of other similar assets have 
informed this exercise.
The estimate for PM8 was also internally developed, but has been 
reviewed for reasonableness by a third party.
For Alba, our non-operated asset, the provision is based on the 
estimates provided by the operator.
We reviewed the report by management summarising the key 
findings and their impact on the provision. We also challenged 
the appropriateness of the reduction in the discount rate from 5% 
to 3%, and were satisfied in this respect. Regard was also given 
to the observations made by EY as to the appropriateness of the 
estimations made.
Tax
The Group carries deferred tax balances at 31 December 2014 
totalling $1.4 billion of tax assets (primarily comprised of tax losses) 
and $1.9 billion of tax liabilities. Given the complexity of certain tax 
legislation, risk exists in respect of some of the Group’s tax positions.
We received a report by the Group’s Head of Tax, outlining all 
uncertain tax positions, and evaluated the technical arguments 
supporting the position taken by management. We also took into 
account the views of EY as to the adequacy of our tax balances. 
Accounting for Derivatives
The Group undertook a significant volume of commodity and 
foreign exchange hedging, through a variety of put and call options 
and swaps, and gains totalling $65 million have been recognised 
in the income statement during 2014. Hedge accounting has been 
applied to the put options entered into to hedge 2015 production, 
and gains of $156 million have been deferred in equity. Appropriate 
effectiveness testing and documentation has been prepared 
to support this. All contracts have been marked to market and 
accounted for in accordance with EnQuest’s accounting policy. 
The Committee ensured it was kept informed of the hedging activity 
undertaken during the year. In the March Committee meeting 
we considered the paper prepared by management outlining the 
accounting treatments adopted for the various transactions. In 
assessing the appropriateness of the treatments applied, we also 
considered the findings of EY’s audit in this respect. 58 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
AUDIT COMMITTEE  
REPORT CONTINUED
Internal controls
We discharge our responsibility in respect of the Group’s internal 
control environment through directing and reviewing the work 
performed by our outsourced internal auditor, considering the 
reports issued by our external auditor, and through the reports 
issued by management in respect of internal controls. Furthermore, 
we have regard for the other assurance activity performed by the 
Group’s Health, Safety, Environment and Assurance team over the 
operational and HSE risks within the Group. 
In respect of the work performed by the internal auditor, we set 
the internal audit plan each year. When setting the plan we consider 
recommendations from management, the internal auditors, and 
having consideration of the risks impacting the Company, which are 
reviewed by the Board. During 2014 internal audit undertook 
various projects, including:
 ` assisting management in the enhancement of the Group’s Risk 
Management Framework, processes and governance;
 ` a review and assessment as to the maturity of the Kraken project 
definition, appropriateness of scoping and how well the critical 
areas of the project were scoped and comparison to industry 
best practice. It focused on whether management exercises 
effective control to enable the delivery of a major capital project 
across its lifecycle and on the identification of gaps; and
 ` a follow up on findings from a previous HR audit.
In all cases the audit conclusions were that the systems and processes 
were satisfactory. Where control enhancements were identified, the 
Committee ensured that appropriate action was being taken by 
management to implement any agreed improvements.
Internal audit
Since the flotation in 2010, the Group has outsourced its internal 
audit function and following a re-tender process in 2013 PwC were 
appointed to act as our internal auditor. The Committee remains 
satisfied that outsourcing this function, rather than building an 
in-house team, remains the most appropriate action for a company 
of this size. We will continue to keep this under review.
External audit
One of the Committee’s key responsibilities is to monitor the 
performance, objectivity and independence of EY, EnQuest’s 
external auditor, who has been the Group’s auditor since 2010. 
Each year the Committee will review and agree the audit plan and 
the associated fees. The process for reviewing the performance of 
EY involves interviewing key members of the organisation who are 
involved in the audit process, on an annual basis, to obtain feedback 
as to the performance of the external auditor. Additionally, the 
Audit Committee members take into account their own view of the 
performance of EY when determining whether or not to recommend 
their reappointment. 
We formally evaluated the effectiveness of EY during our August 
meeting, and concluded that the Committee continues to be fully 
satisfied with the performance of EY, and that EY continues to be 
both objective and independent. As part of this process, the 
Committee considered the level of non-audit service fees provided 
by EY during the year, the compliance with our policy in respect of 
the provision of non-audit services by the auditor, and the safeguards 
in place to ensure continued independence and objectivity of EY. 
In recommending to reappoint EY for 2015, the Committee took note 
of the reduction from the prior year in the absolute size of non-audit 
fees (from $361,000 in 2013 to $ 226,000 in 2014 (representing 55% of 
the total audit fees)). The Committee continues to expect the ratio of 
non-audit to audit to remain below 1:1 going forward.
Use of external auditor for non-audit services
The Audit Committee and Board believe that the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity can potentially be affected by the 
level of non-audit services to EnQuest. However, the Committee 
acknowledges that certain work of a non-audit nature is best 
undertaken by the external auditor. To ensure objectivity and 
independence, the Committee has adopted a policy in relation to the 
provision of non-audit services by its external auditor. As part of this 
process the external auditor provides the Committee with information 
about their policies and processes for maintaining independence 
and monitoring compliance with current regulatory requirements, 
including those regarding the rotation of audit partners and staff. 
EY confirmed their independence and objectivity.
The key features of the non-audit services policy, the full version 
of which is available on our website, are as follows:
 ` a pre-defined list of prohibited services has been established;
 ` a schedule of services where the Group may engage the external 
auditor has been established and agreed by the Committee; 
 ` any non-audit project work which could impair the objectivity or 
independence of the external auditor may not be awarded to the 
external auditor; and
 ` delegated authority by the Audit Committee for the approval of 
non-audit services by the external auditor is as follows:
Authoriser
Value of services per 
non-audit project
Chief Financial Officer Up to £50,000
Chairman of the Audit Committee Up to £100,000
Audit Committee Above £100,000
EY has served as the Company’s auditor since the Company was first 
formed in January 2010, and has conducted each of the Company’s 
external audits since formation. The Committee has adopted the 
recently implemented requirement of the Code that FTSE 350 
companies tender their external audit contracts every 10 years and, in 
line with this policy, will re-tender this function in 2020, if not sooner. 
At the August 2014 meeting the Committee approved the rotation of 
the EY audit partner, which takes effect with the completion of the 
2014 audit. The Committee is aware that the Financial Reporting 
Council is considering the implications of the European Union’s rules 
in respect of mandatory rotation of auditors, and will amend our 
policy to conform when the guidance in the UK is clear.
Raising concerns at work 
Throughout the year, a whistleblowing procedure, titled the ‘Speak 
Up’ reporting line, has been in place across the Group. This allows 
employees and contractors to confidentially raise any concerns 
about business practices through an independently appointed third 
party. Any concerns raised under these arrangements or otherwise 
are investigated promptly by the General Counsel and notified to 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee, with follow-up action being 
taken as soon as practicable thereafter. As noted on page 54 of the 
Corporate Governance Statement there have been a limited number 
of instances where such issues have been elevated and the 
Committee has been kept appraised of how these have 
been addressed.  STRATEGIC 
REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
59 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION REPORT
Dear Shareholder, 
On behalf of the Board I am pleased 
to present EnQuest’s report on its 
remuneration policy and practice for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2014.
The report has three main sections:
1. Governance of remuneration at EnQuest.
2. The key elements of the Policy Report which was approved 
by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
and took effect from January 2014. This sets out the policy for 
the remuneration of Directors for the current and future 
financial years
3. The Remuneration Report of the Executive Directors and 
Non-Executive Directors during 2014 which will be subject to 
an advisory shareholder vote at the 2015 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration 
policy supports business strategy, the highest levels of Company 
performance and governance, and through this, the delivery of 
shareholder value. The link between performance and reward is 
central to the remuneration philosophy throughout the Company, 
and the Committee believes that the current remuneration policy 
continues to meet these objectives, and for this reason, we are not 
proposing any changes to the policy for 2015.
Performance and reward for 2014
A good performance against most of the Company’s 2014 
performance scorecard was in contrast to continued delay of the 
Alma/Galia development and in particular to the sharp decline in the 
global price of oil in the second half of the year and its consequential 
negative impact on EnQuest’s share price.
Underlying performance by EnQuest Management against 
Company metrics related to financial results, production, reserves 
additions and progress on the Kraken project was good but was 
offset by the delay to the start-up of the Alma/Galia field and the fall 
in share-price. Management took swift action in response to the 
decline in oil price by cutting current and future operating and 
capital expenditures.
Overall performance by the Company was assessed by the 
Remuneration Committee to be marginally below the challenging 
targets set by the Board. Remuneration outcomes for the Executive 
Directors are therefore commensurate with the assessed level 
of performance.
2014 Bonus
The Executive Directors’ bonus awards are based on a 
combination of financial and operational results and the 
achievement of strategic and personal objectives. Awards of 55% 
of base salary (24% of maximum) for Amjad Bseisu and 81% for 
Jonathan Swinney (36% of maximum) have been made in respect 
of 2014 (paid 2/3rd in cash and 1/3rd in shares). Further details of 
how these awards were determined are set out on pages 65 to 67. 
Despite the external challenges faced by the industry, the 
Committee considers these levels of awards to be appropriate for 
the strong operational results and the delivery against the basket 
of measures set by the Board at the beginning of the year.
2012 Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) award
The 2012 PSP award, which had a three-year performance period 
ending 31 December 2014, vested at 79.4% of the maximum. Two 
of the three performance conditions were met in full (TSR and 
reserve growth per share), however the threshold production 
growth per share performance condition was partially met (5.6% 
CAGR versus maximum of 10.0% over the three year period). 
Details on the satisfaction of these performance conditions are 
included in the report.
Executive Director remuneration for 2015
Base salaries
For 2015, base salaries have been frozen for the Executive 
Directors in line with approach taken for all employees across 
the Company.
PSP
EnQuest’s policy is that award levels should vary from year to 
year based on Company and individual performance. For PSP 
awards made in 2015, relating to the 2014 performance year, the 
Committee felt that it was appropriate to grant levels of awards 
equivalent to 118% of base salary for both Amjad Bseisu and 
Jonathan Swinney. These grants have been set at 59% of the 
normal maximum award and reflect the Committee’s view of 
company performance in 2014 as well as recognising the recent 
reduction in share price.
The Committee encourages dialogue with the Company’s 
shareholders and will consult with major shareholders ahead of 
any significant future changes to remuneration policy. It remains 
the Committee’s intention that the policy which shareholders 
approved at the 2014 AGM will remain in operation for the full 
three years.
We are committed to transparent communication and I hope you 
find this report of the Committee’s work comprehensive, clear 
and understandable. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their continued support in this challenging time 
for the industry. I hope you will support the resolution to vote for 
this Directors’ Remuneration Report and look forward to receiving 
this at the forthcoming AGM.

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee invites individuals to attend meetings to provide 
advice so as to ensure that the Committee’s decisions are informed 
and take account of pay and conditions in the Company as a whole. 
These individuals include:
 ` the Chairman (Dr. James Buckee) is not a member but attends 
by invitation;
 ` the Chief Executive (Amjad Bseisu);
 ` the Chief Financial Officer (Jonathan Swinney);
 ` the HR Director (Graeme Cook);
 ` a representative of New Bridge Street (part of Aon plc), 
appointed as remuneration adviser by the Committee in 2013; 
and
 ` the Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee 
(Stefan Ricketts).
No Director takes part in any decision directly affecting his or her 
own remuneration.
POLICY SECTION
This section sets out the principles behind our remuneration policies 
and the key elements of the remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors that was approved by shareholders in May 2014.
The full policy is as disclosed in the 2013 Report and Accounts with 
minor amendments made to elements included in this report to 
update it to reflect the now approved policy.
Remuneration principles
In determining the remuneration policy we reviewed our 
overall remuneration principles to ensure that they were aligned 
to our strategy. EnQuest’s strategic objective is to achieve 
sustainable growth by focusing on exploiting its existing reserves, 
commercialising and developing discoveries, converting contingent 
resources into reserves, and pursuing selective acquisitions.
We also want to ensure that we operate within the appropriate 
culture and, therefore, the principles support and reinforce the 
EnQuest values. Our principles are clear and simple, strengthen the 
link of reward for exceptional performance, as well as emphasise the 
importance of our values.
In summary, the principles underpinning our remuneration 
policy are that remuneration for Executive Directors should be:
1. Aligned with shareholder’s interests.
2. Fair, reflective of best practice, and market competitive.
3. Comprise of fixed pay, currently set below the median 
and variable pay capable of delivering remuneration at 
upper quartile.
4. Reward performance with a balance of short term and 
long term elements.
Executive Directors
General approach
The remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises base salary, 
participation in an annual bonus plan (paid partly in cash and partly 
in deferred shares), a Long Term Incentive Plan (PSP), private 
medical insurance, and cash in lieu of pension and other benefits.
When setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee takes into account the performance and experience 
of the Director, as well as the Company performance, employment 
conditions for other employees in the Company, and the external 
marketplace. Data is obtained from a variety of independent sources. STRATEGIC

DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION REPORT
CONTINUED
Approach to recruitment remuneration
In the event that the Company appoints a new Executive Director 
either internally or externally, when determining appropriate 
remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into 
consideration a number of factors (including, but not limited to, 
quantum relating to prior arrangements and the remuneration of 
other Executive Directors in the Company, appropriate benchmarks 
in the industry and the financial condition of the Company). This 
ensures that the arrangements are in the best interests of both the 
Company and its shareholders without paying more than is 
necessary to recruit an executive of the required calibre.
Salaries for new hires (including internal promotions) will be set to 
reflect their skills and experience, the Company’s intended pay 
positioning and the market rate for the role. If it is considered 
appropriate to appoint a new Director on a below market salary 
initially (for example, to allow them to gain experience in the role) 
their salary may be increased to a market level over a number of 
years by way of a series of increases above the general rate of wage 
growth in the Group and inflation.
The ongoing remuneration package for a new Executive Director 
would be set in accordance with the remuneration package offered 
with the terms of the Company’s approved remuneration policy at 
the time. Different performance measures may be set for the year 
of joining the Board for the annual bonus, taking into account the 
individual’s role and responsibilities and the point in the year the 
executive joined.
Benefits and pensions for new appointees to the Board will normally 
be provided in line with those offered to other Executive Directors 
and employees taking account of local market practice, with 
relocation expenses/arrangements provided for if necessary. Tax 
equalisation may also be considered if an executive is adversely 
affected by taxation due to their employment with EnQuest. Legal 
fees and other relevant costs and expenses incurred by the individual 
may also be paid by the Company.
The Committee may make additional awards on appointing 
an Executive Director to ‘buy-out’ remuneration arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer. Any such payments would 
be based solely on remuneration lost when leaving the former 
employer and would reflect (as far as practicable) the delivery 
mechanism, time horizons and performance requirement attaching 
to that remuneration. The Group’s existing incentive arrangements 
will be used to the extent possible (subject to the relevant plan 
limits), although awards may also be granted outside of these 
schemes, if necessary, and as permitted under the listing rules.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay awarded 
in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according 
to its terms of grant.
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, 
the fees will be set taking into account the experience and calibre of 
the individual.
Service contracts
Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney entered into service 
agreements with the Company which are terminable by either party 
giving not less than 12 months’ written notice. The Company may 
terminate their employment without giving notice by making a 
payment equal to the aggregate of the Executive Directors’ basic 
salary and the value of any contractual benefits for the notice period 
including any accrued but untaken holiday. Such payments may be 
paid monthly and/or subject to mitigation.

Policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated by either the Director concerned or 
the Company on giving 12 months’ notice of termination. In the event of termination by the Company (other than as a result of a change of 
control), the Executive Directors would be entitled to loss of basic salary and cash benefit allowance for the notice period. Such payments 
may be made monthly and would be subject to mitigation. Depending on the circumstances of termination, the Executive Directors may be 
entitled, or the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to allow the Executive Directors, to receive a pro-rated proportion of their 
outstanding awards under the long term share incentive plans. Vesting would normally take place at the end of the original vesting period.
Where Executive Directors leave the Company with good leaver status, and they have an entitlement to unvested shares granted under the 
PSP, the performance conditions associated with each award outstanding would remain in place and are typically tested at the end of the 
original performance period. Shares would typically then vest on their original due date in the proportion to the satisfied performance 
conditions and are normally pro-rated for time.
Annual bonus would not typically be paid to Executive Directors when leaving the Company; however, in good leaver circumstances the 
Committee has the discretion to pay a pro-rated bonus in cash, in consideration for performance targets achieved in the year. Deferred 
bonus shares held by good leavers may, at the Committee’s discretion, vest on a pro-rata basis.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but their terms are set out in a letter of appointment. Their terms of 
appointment may be terminated by either party giving three months’ notice in writing. During the notice period the Non-Executive Director 
will continue to receive their normal fee.

Notes:
1. Annual bonus was based on base salary levels and payment was made in respect of the full financial year. The amount stated is the full amount (including the portion deferred). 
One third of the annual bonus for Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney is paid in EnQuest PLC shares, deferred for two years, and subject to continued employment. 
2. PSP awarded on 18 April 2012 vested on 19 April 2015. The LTIP value shown in the 2014 single figure is calculated by taking the number of performance shares that have vested 
(79.4% of the performance conditions were achieved) multiplied by the average value of the EnQuest share price between 1 October 2014 and 31 December 2014, as the share 
price on 19 April 2015 was not known at the time of this report.
3. Cash in lieu of pension and other benefits.
4. PSP awarded on 18 April 2011 vested on 19 April 2014. The LTIP value shown in the 2013 single figure is calculated by taking the number of performance shares that have vested 
(66.7% of the performance conditions were achieved) multiplied by the share price on that date. The equivalent number in the 2013 report was estimated using the average value 
of the EnQuest share price between 1 October 2014 and 31 December 2014, as the share price on 19 April 2014 was not known at the time of that report. 66 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Annual bonus
The Executive Directors’ annual bonus for 2014 was based fully on the Company performance contract for both Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan 
Swinney (who also had strategic and functional objectives comprising his individual performance contract).
The Committee carefully assessed the achievement of objectives against the Company performance contract, and Jonathan Swinney’s 
individual performance contract, to determine the overall level of annual bonus for each Executive Director.
The Remuneration Committee consider the Company’s annual bonus targets to be commercially sensitive, and has therefore chosen not to 
disclose them.

Historical Chief Executive pay
The table below sets out details of the Chief Executive’s pay for the current year and the previous four years and the payout of incentive 
awards as a proportion of the maximum opportunity for each period. The Chief Executive’s pay is calculated as per the ‘single figure’ of 
remuneration as shown on page 65.
During this time, Amjad Bseisu’s total remuneration has been:

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2014
Base salary and 2015 pay review
As stated in the annual statement to this report, the remuneration for the Executive Directors is geared towards variable pay, with base 
salaries currently set around the lower quartile benchmark for the oil and gas industry and comparable sized companies. In the view of the 
Committee it is therefore important to ensure that the base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually and that any increase 
reflects the change in scale and complexity of the role as the Company grows as well as the performance of the Executive Director.
The table below shows the change to salaries for 2015:
Name Salary for 2014 Salary for 2015 % increase
Amjad Bseisu £430,000 £430,000 0.0%
Jonathan Swinney £280,000 £280,000 0.0%
In line with the approach taken for all employees salaries for both Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney were not increased due to the 
challenging market conditions. 
Annual bonus
The annual bonus scheme for 2015 is unchanged in terms of structure:
 ` Executive Directors (and other Executive Management) will have threshold, target, and stretch performance levels performance 
objectives attributed to key performance objectives;
 ` Amjad Bseisu’s bonus will be determined solely by the performance of the Company. Jonathan Swinney’s will include a modifier based 
upon individual performance;
 ` maximum levels of award for the Executive Directors can be up to 225% of annual base salary applicable in the year of performance; and
 ` stretching targets continue to apply at maximum.
The 2015 metrics and weightings, which determine will affect the level of short term incentive awards for the Directors are set out below:
Company 2015 performance measures scorecard
Category Weighting
Financial targets 20%
Production 25%
Reserves 5%
Alma/Galia 20%
Kraken 20%
EnQuest share price performance 10%
Notes:
1. Precise targets are commercially sensitive and are not being disclosed at this time.
2. Performance in Health, Safety, Environment and Assurance is central to EnQuest’s overall results. This category is used as an overlay on overall Company performance.
3. Amjad Bseisu’s 2015 performance measures scorecard is the same as the Company scorecard.
Jonathan Swinney 2015 performance measures scorecard Weighting
Financial results 20%
Group Financing 50%
Organisation 20%
Shareholders 10%
The choice of performance targets for 2015, and their respective weightings, reflects the Committee’s belief that any short term annual 
bonus should be tied both to the overall performance of the Company and the individual’s performance.
The annual bonus model used for the Executive Directors, and all employees in the Company, is shown below.
Company Individual
Performance level Multiplier Individual performance Multiplier
Stretch performance 1.2–1.5 Exceed target 1.2–1.5

Performance share awards
2014 PSP awards
After due consideration of business performance in 2014, and the performance of the Executive Directors, as well as other factors, the 
Remuneration Committee decided to award grants equal to 118% of salary to both Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney. These awards will 
be granted in April 2015. 72 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Summary of performance measures and targets
The PSP share awards granted in April 2015 have three sets of performance conditions associated with them over a three year financial period:
 ` 30% of the award relates to TSR against a comparator group of 26 oil and gas companies listed on the FTSE 350, FTSE All –Share, AIM

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
During 2014 New Bridge Street (part of Aon plc) continued to provide advice to the Remuneration Committee on appropriate types and 
levels of award for the Directors. New Bridge Street had been selected by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee during 2013 on 
the basis of previous experience and marketplace reputation.
The Committee satisfied itself that the advice given was objective and independent by reviewing it against other companies in EnQuest’s 
comparator group. New Bridge Street is also a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group (‘RCG’) Code of Conduct which sets out 
guidelines for managing conflicts of interest. New Bridge Street does not provide any other services to the Company. The fees paid to New 
Bridge Street totalled £11,748 (excluding VAT) and were charged on the basis of the number of hours worked.

NOMINATION 
COMMITTEE REPORT 
Dear Shareholder, 
The main work of the Nomination 
Committee is to ensure that the Board 
has the appropriate balance of skills, 
expertise and experience in order to 
support the strategy of the Company. 
We achieve this by continuously 
reviewing the Board composition 
and skills and ensuring that strong 
succession planning is in place.
Currently the Board consists of five Non-Executive Directors and 
two Executive Directors, who collectively bring a diverse mix of 
skills and experience to the Company and collaborate to form a 
strong leadership.
During 2014, the Board has continued to remain stable, with no 
changes made to composition. The Committee has spent time 
this period focusing on succession planning for the Board and 
Executive Committee, reviewing the balance of skills currently on 
the Board and also considering gender diversity issues. 
Next year we shall continue to focus on succession planning of 
both the Executive and Non-Executive Directors, to ensure that 
we have strong contingency plans in place and continue to have a 
broad mix of skills and expertise within the Board. 
Dr James Buckee
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
18 March 2015 
Nomination Committee membership
The Nomination Committee remains unchanged from last year and 
currently comprises the Chairman, four independent Non-Executive 
Directors and, to ensure input from the executives, the Chief 
Executive. The membership of the Nomination Committee, 
together with appointment dates and attendance at meetings, 
is set out below:

Main responsibilities
The main responsibilities of the Committee are to:
 
 ` review the size, structure and composition of the Board in order 
to recommend changes to the Board and to ensure the orderly 
succession of Directors;
 ` formalise succession planning and the process for new Director 
appointments;
 ` identify, evaluate and recommend candidates for appointment as 
Directors taking into account the balance of knowledge, skills 
and experience required to serve the Board; and
 ` keep under review the outside directorships and time 
commitments expected from the Non-Executive Directors.
The Nomination Committees’ full terms of reference can be 
found on the Company’s website, www.enquest.com, under 
Corporate Governance. 
Appointment of Directors
We apply a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for 
appointments of new Directors to the Board, and ensure 
independence by using an external consultancy services firm, which 
has no connection with the Company. The Committee thoroughly 
reviews each candidate in terms of the balance of skills, knowledge 
and level of independence they would bring to the Board. The 
Committee also gives careful consideration to other existing 
commitments a candidate may have and whether they will be able to 
devote the appropriate amount of time in order to fully meet what is 
expected of them. Once the Committee has identified a suitable 
candidate a recommendation is made to the Board for appointment. 74 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Committee activities for the year
The Nomination Committee met once in 2014 and its key 
activities included: 
 ` Succession planning – The Committee focused on succession 
planning, so whilst the Company is still relatively young, and it 
is not felt that the independence of Non-executive Directors is 
compromised, we spent time reviewing the succession plans 
for the Board. The Nomination Committee also focused on the 
succession of Senior Management, to ensure that the Board, 
and principally the Chief Executive, remain fully supported in 
the implementation of the Company strategy. The Board and 
Nomination Committee remain satisfied that the individuals 
currently fulfilling key Senior Management positions in the Group 
have the requisite depth and breadth of skills, knowledge and 
experience to ensure that orderly succession to the Board and 
Executive Committee can take place. We will continue to work 
closely with the Chief Executive and the HR Director to ensure 
that we are recruiting and developing Board members and 
Executive Management with all of these attributes. 
 ` Skills and expertise analysis – We conducted an analysis of 
Board skills and experience this period to identify any potential 
gaps, the results of which are outlined below. We are pleased 
to report that following our analysis the Board and Nomination 
Committee remain satisfied that we have the correct balance of 
skills, expertise and experience needed in order to effectively 
support the Company’s objectives and strategy. 
 ` Review of diversity policy – the Board has followed the progress 
made with regards to the recommendations of the 2011 Lord 
Davies report ‘Women on Boards’, and we have reviewed our 
policy on gender diversity. Currently the Board consists of two 
Executive Directors and five Non-Executive Directors. Six of the 
Board members are male and one is female. Following a review 
of our approach to gender diversity, we confirm that whilst we 
work hard to ensure that we recruit from a diverse background 
of candidates, not just in relation to gender, we will continue to 
recruit the best candidate available for the job, without the Board’s 
decision being influenced by a need to fulfil certain quotas. We 
believe that our gender statistics are representative of the 
demographics of the wider oil and gas industry.
Board skills and experience:
Oil and Gas experience 70%
Engineering 60%
Finance 25%
Capital Markets 25%
Regulatory and governance 15%
HSE&A 65%
Operational and strategic 90%
Priorities for the coming year
The main focus of the Committee in 2015 will be to strengthen the 
composition of the Board by appointing a Non-Executive Director 
with significant experience in capital projects within the oil and gas 
industry. The Company is currently working with Heidrick & 
Struggles, a reputable executive search firm, to identify suitably 
qualified candidates with the depth of experience necessary to 
complement the existing skills that the Board have in this key area.
Other priorities include ensuring that the Company’s organisation 
is both efficient and capable in its principal activities, as well as 
undertaking the annual review of Chief Executive and other Senior 
Management succession plans. 
Re-election to the Board
Following a formal review of the effectiveness of the Board, 
the Nomination Committee confirms that it is satisfied with the 
performance and of the time commitment of each Non-Executive 
Director throughout the year. We remain confident that each of 
them is in a position to discharge their duties to the Company in the 
coming year and to continue to bring the necessary skills required 
to the Board. Detailed biographies for each Director, including their 
skills and external appointments, can be found on pages 46 and 47. 
As detailed in the 2015 Notice of AGM, all Directors will stand for 
re-election. 
Conflicts of interest
The Board operates a policy to identify and, where appropriate, 
manage conflicts or potential conflicts of interest with the 
Company’s interests. In accordance with the Directors’ interests 
provisions in the Companies Act 2006, all the Directors are required 
to submit details to the Company Secretary of any situations which 
may give rise to a conflict, or potential conflict, of interest. The 
Board monitors and reviews potential conflicts of interest on a 
regular basis.

Greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions
EnQuest has reported on all of the emission sources within its 
operational control required under the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. These 
sources fall within the EnQuest consolidated financial statement. 
EnQuest has used the principles of the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition), ISO 14064-1 
and data gathered to fulfil the requirements under the 
’Environmental Reporting Guidelines: Including Mandatory 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Guidance‘ June 2013.
The Mandatory Carbon Reporting (‘MCR’) report includes assets 
which are in the operational control of EnQuest. These are:
 ` Heather Alpha;
 ` Thistle Alpha;
 ` Northern Producer Floating Production Facility;
 ` Kittiwake;
 ` Drilling rigs under the control of EnQuest for exploration and 
appraisal purposes; and
 ` All land based offices.
All six greenhouse gases are reported as appropriate.

77 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
EnQuest has a number of financial interests, e.g. joint ventures and 
joint investments, for which it does not have operational control. 
Hence, the boundary for emissions within EnQuest’s operational 
control is different to the financial boundary. In line with MCR 
guidance this is fully disclosed.
EnQuest has voluntarily opted to have the emissions reported 
within the MCR scope verified to the internationally recognised 
ISO-14064-1 standard by a UKAS accredited verification body. This 
increases the robustness of the reported emissions and provides the 
reader with more confidence in the stated figures. This goes beyond 
the minimum requirements of the guidance.
Change of control agreements
The Company is not party to any significant agreements which take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid, except in respect of: (a) the Revolving 
Credit Facility Agreement, which includes provisions that, upon a 
change of control, permit each lender not to provide certain funding 
under that facility and to cancel its exposure to credit which may

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION TO THE 
GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and regulations. Company law requires the 
Directors to prepare Group financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law, the Directors are required to prepare Group 
financial statements under International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union.
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the Group 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the Group financial 
statements the Directors are required to:
 ` present fairly the financial position, financial performance and 
cash flows of the Group;
 ` select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors and then apply them consistently;
 ` present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 ` make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 ` provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 ` state that the Group has complied with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
Group financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Strategic 
Report, Directors’ Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and the Corporate Governance Statement in accordance with 
Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including the 
requirements of the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules.
Fair, balanced and understandable
In accordance with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors are responsible for establishing arrangements 
to evaluate whether the information presented in the Annual 
Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy, and making 
a statement to that effect. This statement is set out on page 54 of 
the Annual Report. STRATEGIC

adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and in the preparation of the Parent 
Company statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006.
3. Our assessment of risk of material misstatement and response to these risks 
We have included in the table below the risks that have had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in 
the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of 
internal controls, including evaluating whether there is evidence of bias by the directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement 
due to fraud. 
Risks Our response to these risks
The recent decline in crude oil prices has had a significant impact on 
the Group financial statements and disclosures. The lower outlook 
has resulted in material impairments of assets.
A significant judgement is oil price assumptions, both in the short 
and long term.
Oil price assumptions impact many areas of financial reporting, 
including estimation of oil and gas reserve volumes, impairment 
assessment and decommissioning provision estimates.
In assessing the appropriateness of management’s oil price 
assumptions, we have compared their price assumptions with 
the latest market evidence available, including forward curves, 
brokers’ estimates and other long term price forecasts. See note 
10 of the accounts, where the impairments are discussed and the 
considerations of the Audit Committee on pages 55–58.
Estimation of oil and gas reserves requires significant judgement 
and assumptions by management and engineers. These estimates 
have a material impact on the financial statements, particularly: 
impairment testing; depreciation, depletion and amortisation 
(DD&A); decommissioning provisions; and going concern.
There is technical uncertainty in assessing reserve quantities. 
Our audit procedures have focused on management’s estimation 
process, including whether bias exists in the determination of reserves. 
We carried out procedures to understand and walkthrough EnQuest’s 
internal process for oil and gas reserves estimation.
We assessed the objectivity and competence of both internal and 
external specialists. We also reviewed the report of the external 
specialist on the audit of the reserves for the UK North Sea and 
Malaysia assets as at 31 December 2014. 
We used the results of these procedures to inform our audit of asset 
impairment testing, the calculation of depreciation, depletion and 
amortisation; the calculation of decommissioning provisions; the 
assessment of going concern and reserve disclosures in the Annual 
Report and Accounts.
See the consideration of the Audit Committee on pages 55–58. 80 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF ENQUEST PLC CONTINUED 
(REGISTERED NUMBER: 07140891)
Risks Our response to these risks
The assessment of the existence of any indicators of impairment 
of the carrying amount of non-current exploration and production 
assets is judgemental.
In the event that indicators are identified, the assessment of the 
recoverable amounts of the assets is also judgemental. Overall 
there has been a material impairment charge that has been 
recognised during 2014. The impairment charge has primarily 
been driven by the significant reduction in oil prices and reduced 
outlook for the long term assumed oil prices.
The principal indicator of impairment was the decline in the oil price.
We carried out procedures to understand and walkthrough EnQuest 
PLC’s process for identifying impairment triggers, and considered 
management’s assessment of indicators of impairment. 
We challenged management’s assessment of impairment indicators 
and whether or not a formal impairment test was required. 
Where a formal impairment test was necessary, we challenged and 
audited management’s assumptions and sensitivities. This included 
specifically the determination of cash generating units, cash flow 
projections, oil prices, production profiles, capital and operating 
expenditure, discount rates, and sensitivities used. In addition we 
engaged our business modelling and valuation specialists to assist us 
in the audit of the impairment charge. 
We performed detailed audit procedures on the impairment test 
models including goodwill, intangibles, transfer of costs, comparison 
to historical data, and past reliability of forecasts. 
We also used the result of procedures performed in relation to 
estimation of oil and gas reserves and depletion calculations.
See note 10 of the accounts, where the impairments are discussed 
and the considerations of the Audit Committee on pages 55–58.
We believe that there is more judgement involved in revenue 
recognition than previous years, mainly as a result of operations in 
international locations such as Malaysia and the commencement of 
commodity trading activity.
We performed procedures to understand and walkthrough the 
process and controls for revenue recognition and calculation. 
We carried out substantive audit procedures on revenue recognition 
including transaction testing, review of new sales agreement and 
contractual terms, cut-off procedures to ensure transactions recorded 
in correct periods and subsequent receipt tests. 
We set expectations and performed detailed analytical review 
procedures on disaggregated sales data including discussion 
with management and business analysts, review of market prices, 
challenged any differences to expectations, and identified any 
significant or unusual trends.
Decommissioning provisions are a judgemental area. They are 
calculated based on a number of estimates and assumptions 
that are impacted by future activities, economic climate and 
the legislative environment in which EnQuest operates. The 
decommissioning provisions are also affected by changes in the oil 
and gas reserve estimates and price assumptions which determine 
the date on which production will cease.
We obtained management’s updated decommissioning papers 
and workings. Our audit procedures focused on assessing the 
reasonableness of the assumptions used in the calculation 
of provisions, consistency across assets and the audit of the 
calculation of the decommissioning charge and unwinding of the 
discount on the liability. We also assessed appropriateness of the 
discount rate applied.
See note 23 of the accounts, where the provisions are discussed and 
the considerations of the Audit Committee on pages 55–58.
The Group has a number of uncertain tax positions, which 
are subject to judgement in relation to interpretation of tax 
regulations and estimation in recording a provision for any 
potential cash outflow.
We considered management’s interpretation and application 
of relevant tax law and challenged the appropriateness of 
management’s assumptions and estimates in relation to uncertain 
tax positions.
To assist us in assessing a number of uncertain tax positions, 
we engaged our tax specialists to advise us on the tax technical 
issues in order to form a view of the risk of challenge to certain tax 
treatments adopted. STRATEGIC 
REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
81 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Risks Our response to these risks
The going concern assessment, particularly in the light of recent oil 
price decline and decrease in forecast forward prices.
We performed procedures to understand management’s going 
concern review process. 
Our audit procedures included:
 – agreeing the assumed cash flows to the business plan and walking 
through the business planning process and testing the central 
assumptions to external data;
 – agreeing the available facilities and arrangements to underlying 
documentation;
 – considering the impact of any delays in the startup of Alma/Galia; 
 – assessing and auditing the sensitivities of the underlying 
assumptions used in the going concern review; and
 – comparing future cash flows to historical data, ensuring variations 
are in line with our expectations and considering the reliability of 
past forecasts.
See the considerations of the Audit Committee on pages 55–58.
4. Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our audit 
and on the financial statements. For the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement we 
define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person, relying on the financial statements would be changed or influenced.
We determined materiality of the Group to be $10.5 million (2013: $16 million), which represents approximately 5% of the Group’s business 
performance before taxation (which excludes exceptionals and one-off items). The final business performance profit before tax was higher; 
however we did not revise our materiality levels upwards. We have calculated materiality with reference to the Group’s business 
performance as we consider this to be one of the principal considerations for members of the Company in assessing the financial 
performance of the Group, on the basis that business performance excludes exceptionals and one-off items. Business performance is the 
key earnings measure discussed when the Group presents the financial results. This provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and 
extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and 
extent of further audit procedures. Our evaluation of materiality requires professional judgement and necessarily takes into qualitative as 
well as quantitative consideration implicit in the definition.
The oil price declined significantly during the course of our audit. The significant decline was in the fourth quarter of the year and did not 
have a significant impact on the full year business performance. However there have been a number of material impairments which have 
been audited individually and in full.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement is that overall 
performance materiality (that is our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance) for the Group should be 50% of materiality 
(2013: 50%), namely $5.25 million (2013: $8 million). Our objective in adopting this approach is to ensure that total uncorrected and undetected 
audit differences in the financial statements as a whole do not exceed our materiality of $10.5 million (2013: $16 million).
Audit work at individual components is undertaken based on a percentage of our total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is based on the relative size of the component and our view of the risk of misstatement at that 
component. In the current year we set performance materiality for UK at $5.25 million and Malaysia at $1.0 million.
We collated errors in excess of $0.5 million and agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit 
differences in excess of $0.75 million (2013: $1 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both quantitative measures of materiality discussed above, and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations.
5. An overview of the scope of our audit
We used a risk-based approach for determining our audit strategy, ensuring that our audit teams performed consistent procedures and 
focussed on addressing the risks that are relevant to the business. This approach focussed our audit effort towards higher risk areas, such 
as significant management judgements, and on locations that were considered material based upon size, complexity and risk.
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of that materiality determined our audit scope. The factors that 
we considered when assessing the scope of the Group audit and the level of work to be performed at each location included the following: 
the financial significance and specific risks of the location, the effectiveness of the control environment and monitoring activities, including 
group-wide controls and recent internal audit findings. 82 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Our Group audit scope focussed on two key locations, of which one 
was subject to a full scope audit, whilst the remaining location was 
subject to specific audit testing based on our judgement of risk and 
materiality. The full scope location is 94% of the Group’s total assets 
and 98% of the Group’s business performance and the specific 
scope location is 6% of the Group’s total assets and 2% of the 
Group’s business performance.
For the remaining locations, we performed other procedures to 
confirm there were no significant risks of material misstatement in 
the Group’s financial statements.
For all in-scope locations, in addition to the site visits, the Group 
audit team reviewed key working papers and participated in the 
component team’s planning and execution of the responses to 
the risks.
6. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion:
 ` the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 ` the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
7. Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters:
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
 ` materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
 ` apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 ` is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit 
Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 ` adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 ` the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 ` certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
 ` we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 ` the Directors’ statement, set out on pages 42 and 43, in relation 
to going concern; and
 ` the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
8. The scope of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are require to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed. 
9. The scope of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been applied consistently and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors, and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts 2014 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
10. The respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
set out on page 78, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.

Notes:
1. The maintenance and integrity of the EnQuest PLC website is the 
responsibility of the Directors: the work carried out by the auditor does 
not involve consideration of these matters and accordingly the auditor accepts 
no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial 
statements since they were initially presented on the website.
2. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

GROUP STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 STRATEGIC 
REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
87 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
1. Corporate information 
EnQuest PLC (EnQuest or the Company) is a limited liability 
Company registered in England and is listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and Stockholm NASDAQ OMX market. 
The Group’s principal activities are the exploration for, and 
extraction and production of, hydrocarbons in the UK Continental 
Shelf, Malaysia and the Norwegian North Sea.
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2014 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of 
the Board of Directors on 18 March 2015.
A listing of the Group companies is contained in note 29 to these 
Group financial statements.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The Group financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of 
the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014 and applied in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies 
which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The Group financial information has been prepared on a historical 
cost basis. The presentation currency of the Group financial 
information is United States dollars and all values in the Group 
financial information are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000) 
except where otherwise stated. 
Going concern concept
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that the use 
of the going concern basis is appropriate and there are no material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the 
Group to continue as a going concern. See pages 42 and 43 in the 
Financial Review for further details.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the sole right to 
exercise control over the operations and govern the financial policies 
generally accompanying a shareholding of more than half of the 
voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when 
assessing the Group’s control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are 
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany profits, transactions and balances are eliminated 
on consolidation. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been 
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
Unincorporated jointly controlled assets
Oil and gas operations are conducted by the Group as co-licensees 
in unincorporated joint ventures with other companies. The Group’s 
financial statements reflect the relevant proportions of production, 
capital costs, operating costs and current assets and liabilities of 
the joint venture applicable to the Group’s interests. The Group’s 
current joint venture interests are detailed on page 32.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of 
the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any controlling interest in the acquiree. For each 
business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Those petroleum 
reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued are 
recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition. 
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014
Other potential reserves, resources and rights, for which fair values 
cannot be reliably determined, are not recognised.
If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the 
aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses 
whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and 
all of the liabilities assumed and reviewed the procedures used to 
measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date, if 
the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net 
assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred then 
the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer 
will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent 
consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial 
instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement, is measured at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognised either in profit or loss, or as 
a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent 
consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in 
accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration 
that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity.
New standards and interpretations
The Group has adopted new and revised IFRS’s that are relevant 
to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2014. The principal effects of the adoption 
of these new and amended standards and interpretations are 
discussed below:
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements/IAS 27 (Revised) – 
Separate Financial Statements
IFRS 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities 
including special purpose entities and introduces changes which 
require management to exercise significant judgement to determine 
which entities are controlled, and therefore, are required to be 
consolidated by a parent. The consolidation requirements forming 
part of IAS 27 have been revised and contained within IFRS 10.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 11 establishes a clear principle that is applicable to the 
accounting for all joint arrangements. The most significant change 
is that IFRS 11 requires the use of the equity method of accounting 
for interests in jointly controlled entities thereby eliminating the 
proportionate consolidation method.
IAS 28 (Revised) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
The standard has been revised due to the introduction of IFRS 11 
and 12. The standard describes the application of the equity 
method to investments in joint ventures in addition to associates. 
Annual Improvements 2010–2012 Cycle
In the 2010–2012 annual improvements cycle, the IASB 
issued seven amendments to six standards, which included an 
amendment to IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. It clarifies in the 
Basis for Conclusions that short term receivables and payables with 
no stated interest rates can be measured at invoice amounts when 
the effect of discounting is immaterial. This amendment to IFRS 13 
has no impact on the Group.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
Includes disclosure requirements for interests in subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities.  88 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Standards issued but not yet effective
Standards issued and relevant to the Group, but not yet effective 
up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements, are 
listed below. This listing is of standards and interpretations issued, 
which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future 
date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they 
become effective. The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption 
of these standards will have a material impact on the Group’s 
accounts in the period of initial application.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments which reflects all phases of the financial instruments 
project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard 
introduces new requirements for classification and measurement, 
impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application 
permitted. Retrospective application is required, but comparative 
information is not compulsory. Early application of previous 
versions of IFRS 9 (2009, 2010 and 2013) is permitted if the date of 
initial application is before 1 February 2015. The adoption of IFRS 9 
will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the 
Group’s financial assets, but will not have an impact on classification 
and measurement of financial liabilities. 
Annual Improvements 2010–2012 Cycle
These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014 and are not 
expected to have a material impact on the Group. They include:
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment
This improvement is applied retrospectively and clarifies various 
issues relating to the definitions of performance and service 
conditions which are vesting conditions, including:
 ` A performance condition must contain a service condition;
 ` A performance target must be met while the counterparty is 
rendering service;
 ` A performance target may relate to the operations or activities 
of an entity, or to those of another entity in the same group;
 ` A performance condition may be a market or non-market 
condition;
 ` If the counter-party, regardless of the reason, ceases to 
provide service during the vesting period, the service 
condition is not satisfied.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations
This amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that all 
contingent consideration arrangements classified as liabilities (or 
assets) arising from a business combination should be subsequently 
measured at fair value through profit or loss whether or not they fall 
within the scope of IAS 39.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments
The amendments are applied retrospectively and clarifies that:
 ` An entity must disclose the judgements made by management 
in applying the aggregation criteria in paragraph 12 of IFRS 8, 
including a brief description of operating segments that have 
been aggregated and the economic characteristics (e.g. sales and 
gross margins) used to assess whether the segments are ‘similar’;
 ` The reconciliation of segment assets to total assets is only 
required to be disclosed if the reconciliation is reported to the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker, similar to the required 
disclosure for segment liabilities.
IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets
The amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies in IAS 16 and 
IAS 38 that an asset may be revalued by reference to observable 
data on either the gross or the net carrying amount. In addition, the 
accumulated depreciation or amortisation is the difference between 
the gross and carrying amounts of the asset.
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures
This amendment is applied retrospectively and clarifies that a 
management entity (an entity that provides key management 
personnel services) is a related party subject to the related party 
disclosures. In addition, an entity that uses a management entity is 
required to disclose the expenses incurred for management services.
Annual Improvements 2011–2013 Cycle
These improvements are effective from 1 July 2014 and are not 
expected to have a material impact on the Group. They include:
IFRS 3 Business Combinations
The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies for the scope 
exceptions within IFRS 3 that:
 ` Joint arrangements, not just joint ventures, are outside the 
scope of IFRS 3;
 ` This scope exception applies only to the accounting in the 
financial statements of the joint arrangement itself.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
The amendment is applied prospectively and clarifies that the 
portfolio exception in IFRS 13 can be applied not only to financial 
assets and financial liabilities, but also to other contracts within the 
scope of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as applicable).
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a new five-step 
model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with 
customers. Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled 
in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The 
principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to 
measuring and recognising revenue.
The new revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will 
supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. 
Either a full or modified retrospective application is required for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 with early 
adoption permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact 
of IFRS 15 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required 
effective date.
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements for Acquisition of 
Interests
The amendments to IFRS 11 require that a joint operator accounting 
for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, in which the 
activity of the joint operation constitutes a business must apply 
the relevant IFRS 3 principles for business combinations accounting. 
The amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in a joint 
operation is not re-measured in the acquisition of an additional 
interest in the same joint operation while joint control is retained. In 
addition, a scope exclusion has been added to IFRS 11 to specify that 
the amendments do not apply when the parties share joint control, 
including the reporting entity, are under common control of the 
same ultimate controlling party.
The amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest 
in a joint operation and the acquisition of any additional interests in 
the same joint operation and are prospectively effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption 
permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any 
impact on the Group. STRATEGIC 
REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
89 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable 
Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that 
revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated 
from operating a business (of which the asset is a part) rather than 
the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset. 
As a result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate 
property, plant and equipment and may only be used in very 
limited circumstances to amortise intangible assets. The 
amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption 
permitted. These amendments are not expected to have any 
impact on the Group given that the Group has not used a revenue-
based method to depreciate its non-current assets.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The management of the Group has to make estimates and 
judgements when preparing the financial statements of the Group. 
Uncertainties in the estimates and judgements could have an impact 
on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the Group’s 
result. The most important estimates and judgements in relation 
thereto are:
Estimates in oil and gas reserves
The business of the Group is the exploration for, development 
of and production of oil and gas reserves. Estimates of oil and 
gas reserves are used in the calculations for impairment tests 
and accounting for depletion and decommissioning. Changes 
in estimates of oil and gas reserves resulting in different future 
production profiles will affect the discounted cash flows used in 
impairment testing, the anticipated date of decommissioning and the 
depletion charges in accordance with the unit-of-production method.
Estimates in impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
For details of the policy see Impairment of assets (excluding 
goodwill) and refer to the further economic assumptions below 
within Estimates in impairment of goodwill.
Estimates in impairment of goodwill
Determination of whether goodwill has suffered any impairment 
requires an estimation of the fair value less costs to sell of the 
cash-generating units (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated. 
The calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows 
expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate. In 
calculating the value of the CGU, the Group uses forward curve prices 
for the first three years and thereafter at US$85 per barrel inflated at 
2% per annum from 2015. Cash flows are then discounted using a rate 
derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Determining whether an acquisition is a business combination or 
asset purchase
The Group analyses the transaction or event by applying the 
definition of a business combination, principally whether inputs, 
processes and outputs exist, including reviewing Group strategy, 
control and resources. Should the acquired business not be 
viewed as a business combination then it is accounted for as 
an asset purchase.
Determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment 
on business combinations
The Group determines the fair value of property, plant and 
equipment acquired based on the discounted cash flows at the 
time of acquisition, from the proven and probable reserves. In 
assessing the discounted cash flows, the estimated future cash 
flows attributable to the asset are discounted to their present value 
using a discount rate that reflects the market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset at the time of the 
acquisition. In calculating the asset fair value the Group will apply 
the forward curve followed by an oil price assumption representing 
management’s view of the long term oil price.
Decommissioning provision 
Amounts used in recording a provision for decommissioning are 
estimates based on current legal and constructive requirements 
and current technology and price levels for the removal of facilities 
and plugging and abandoning of wells. Due to changes in relation 
to these items, the future actual cash outflows in relation to 
decommissioning are likely to differ in practice. To reflect the 
effects due to changes in legislation, requirements and 
technology and price levels, the carrying amounts of 
decommissioning provisions are reviewed on a regular basis. 
The effects of changes in estimates do not give rise to prior year 
adjustments and are dealt with prospectively. While the Group uses 
its best estimates and judgement, actual results could differ from 
these estimates.
In estimating decommissioning provisions, the Group applies an 
annual inflation rate of 2% (2013: 2%) and an annual discount rate 
of 3% (2013: 5%).
Carry provision
Part of the consideration for the acquisition of the interest 
in the Kraken field in 2012 was through development carries. 
These were split into two parts, a firm carry where the amount was 
agreed and a contingent carry where the amounts are subject to a 
reserves determination. In assessing the amounts to be provided, 
management has made assumptions about the most likely amount 
outcome of the reserves determination. Future developments may 
require further revisions to the estimate. These would be recorded 
as a financial liability for any outstanding balance under the firm 
carry and as a provision for the contingent carry.
Taxation
The Group’s operations are subject to a number of specific rules 
which apply to exploration and production. In addition, the tax 
provision is prepared before the relevant companies have filed 
their tax returns with the relevant tax authorities and, significantly, 
before these have been agreed. As a result of these factors, the 
tax provision process necessarily involves the use of a number of 
estimates and judgements including those required in calculating 
the effective tax rate. In considering the tax on exceptionals, the 
Company applies the appropriate statutory tax rate to each 
exceptional item to calculate the relevant tax charge on 
exceptional items.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets on unused tax losses 
where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for 
utilisation. This requires management to make judgements and 
assumptions regarding the amount of deferred tax that can be 
recognised, as well as the likelihood of future taxable profits. 
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). 
The Group financial statements are presented in United States 
dollars, the currency which the Group has elected to use as its 
presentation currency.
In the accounts of the Company and its individual subsidiaries, 
transactions in currencies other than a company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange on the date 
of the transaction. At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of 
exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the rate of exchange as at the dates of 
the initial transactions. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured 
at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the rate of 
exchange at the date the fair value was determined. All foreign 
exchange gains and losses are taken to profit and loss in the 
statement of comprehensive income.  90 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Classification and recognition of assets and liabilities
Non-current assets and non-current liabilities including provisions 
consist, for the most part, solely of amounts that are expected to 
be recovered or paid more than 12 months after the balance sheet 
date. Current assets and current liabilities consist solely of amounts 
that are expected to be recovered or paid within 12 months after 
the balance sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value. Cost comprises the 
purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly 
attributable to making that asset capable of operating as intended. 
The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount 
paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire 
the asset. 
Oil and gas assets are depleted, on a field-by-field basis, using the 
unit-of-production method based on entitlement to proven and 
probable reserves, taking account of estimated future development 
expenditure relating to those reserves. 
Depreciation on other elements of property, plant and equipment 
is provided on a straight-line basis at the following rates:
Office furniture and equipment  25% – 100%
Long leasehold land period of lease
Each asset’s estimated useful life, residual value and method of 
depreciation are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each 
financial year end.
No depreciation is charged on assets under construction. 
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment is 
derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected from its use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from the 
derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is 
included in the statement of comprehensive income when the 
item is derecognised. Gains are not classified as revenue.
Capitalised costs
Oil and gas assets are accounted for using the successful efforts 
method of accounting.
Intangible oil and gas assets
Expenditure directly associated with evaluation or appraisal activities 
is capitalised as an intangible asset. Such costs include the costs of 
acquiring an interest, appraisal well drilling costs, payments to 
contractors and an appropriate share of directly attributable 
overheads incurred during the evaluation phase. For such appraisal 
activity, which may require drilling of further wells, costs continue to 
be carried as an asset whilst related hydrocarbons are considered 
capable of commercial development. Such costs are subject to 
technical, commercial and management review to confirm the 
continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value. When this 
is no longer the case, the costs are impaired and any impairment loss 
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. When 
exploration licences are relinquished without further development, 
any previous impairment loss is reversed and the carrying costs are 
written off through the statement of comprehensive income. When 
assets are declared part of a commercial development, related costs 
are transferred to property, plant and equipment oil and gas assets. 
All intangible oil and gas assets are assessed for any impairment 
prior to transfer and any impairment loss is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
Farm-outs – in the exploration and evaluation phase
The Group does not record any expenditure made by the farmee 
on its account. It also does not recognise any gain or loss on its 
exploration and evaluation farm-out arrangements but redesignates 
any costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest as 
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014
relating to the partial interest retained. Any cash consideration 
received directly from the farmee is credited against costs previously 
capitalised in relation to the whole interest with any excess 
accounted for by the farmor as a gain on disposal.
Oil and gas assets
Expenditure relating to development of assets including the 
construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities 
such as platforms, pipelines and development wells, is capitalised 
within property, plant and equipment.
Farm-outs – outside the exploration and evaluation phase
In accounting for a farm-out arrangement outside the exploration 
and evaluation phase, the Group:
 ` derecognises the proportion of the asset that it has sold to the 
farmee;
 ` recognises the consideration received or receivable from the 
farmee, which represents the cash received and/or the farmee’s 
obligation to fund the capital expenditure in relation to the 
interest retained by the farmor and/or any deferred 
consideration;
 ` recognises a gain or loss on the transaction for the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset disposed of. A gain is only recognised when the value 
of the consideration can be determined reliably. If not, then the 
Group accounts for the consideration received as a reduction in 
the carrying amount of the underlying assets; and
 ` tests the retained interests for impairment if the terms of 
the arrangement indicate that the retained interest may 
be impaired.
The consideration receivable on disposal of an item of property, 
plant and equipment or an intangible asset is recognised initially 
at its fair value by the Group. However, if payment for the item is 
deferred, the consideration received is recognised initially at the 
cash price equivalent. The difference between the nominal amount 
of the consideration and the cash price equivalent is recognised as 
interest revenue. Any part of the consideration that is receivable in 
the form of cash is treated as a financial asset and is accounted for 
at amortised cost.
Carry arrangements
Where amounts are paid on behalf of a carried party these are 
capitalised. Where there is an obligation to make payments on 
behalf of a carried party and the timing and amount are uncertain, 
a provision is recognised. Where the payment is a fixed monetary 
amount, a financial liability is recognised.
Asset swaps
Exchanges or part exchanges of intangible oil and gas assets 
are measured at fair value unless the exchange transaction 
lacks commercial substance or the fair value of neither the assets 
received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. The cost 
of the acquired asset is measured at the fair value of the asset 
given up, unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly 
evident. Where fair value is not used, the cost of the acquired asset 
is measured at the carrying amount of the amount given up. A gain 
or loss is recognised on the difference between the carrying 
amount of the asset given up and the fair value of the asset 
received in profit or loss.
Changes in unit-of-production factors
Changes in factors which affect unit-of-production calculations 
are dealt with prospectively, not by immediate adjustment of prior 
years’ amounts. STRATEGIC

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of qualifying 
assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of 
time to prepare for their intended use, are added to the cost of those 
assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their 
intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as interest 
payable in the statement of comprehensive income in accordance 
with the effective interest method.
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its oil and gas assets to assess whether there is an 
indication that those assets may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable 
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash flows attributable to the asset are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but only so that the increased carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at 
cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over 
the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the entity at the date of acquisition. Following initial 
recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or 
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
such carrying value may be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired is 
allocated to the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or units to which 
goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at 
which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Where the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the 
carrying amount of the cash-generating unit and related goodwill, 
an impairment loss is recognised.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and 
part of the operation within the unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the 
carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or 
loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this 
circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the 
operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating 
units retained.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying 
amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only 
when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be 
committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date 
of classification.
Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, 
held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial investments, 
or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective 
hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its 
financial assets at initial recognition.
All assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs, 
except in the case of financial assets recorded at fair value through 
profit or loss.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets 
within a timeframe established by regulation or convention in the 
marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date.
The Group’s financial assets include cash and short term deposits, 
trade and other receivables, loans and other receivables, quoted and 
unquoted financial instruments and derivative financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their 
classification as described below:
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset 
is either held for trading or designated as at FVTPL. Financial assets 
are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose 
of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives are also 
classified as held for trading unless they are designated as 
effective hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39. 
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains 
or losses arising on remeasurement recognised immediately in the 
income statement within revenue for commodity derivatives or cost 
of sales for foreign exchange derivatives.
Financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are 
designated at their initial recognition date and only if the criteria 
under IAS 39 are satisfied.
The Group evaluates its financial assets held for trading, other than 
derivatives, to determine whether the intention to sell them in the 
near term is still appropriate. Where the Group is unable to trade 
these financial assets or management’s intention to sell them in the 
foreseeable future changes significantly, the Group may elect to 
reclassify these assets. The reclassification to loans and receivables, 
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity depends on the nature of the 
asset. This evaluation does not affect any financial assets designated 
at FVTPL using the fair value option at designation. These 
instruments cannot be reclassified after initial recognition.
Held-to-maturity investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
and fixed maturity are classified as held-to-maturity when the Group 
has the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity. After 
initial measurement, held-to-maturity investments are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method (EIR), less 
impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation and losses arising from 
impairment are included in the profit or loss.  92 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Available-for-sale financial investments
Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an 
active market are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated 
at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
available-for-sale reserve with the exception of impairment losses 
which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment 
is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in the available-for-sale reserve is 
reclassified to profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables 
These include trade receivables, loans and other receivables that 
have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market and are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised 
by applying the effective interest rate, except for short term 
receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any 
objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. A financial 
asset is deemed to be impaired where there is objective evidence 
of impairment that, as a result of one or more events that have 
occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, the estimated 
future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as available-
for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the 
security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of 
impairment. When an available-for-sale financial asset is considered 
to be impaired, cumulative gains and losses previously recognised 
in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in 
the period. In respect of equity securities, impairment losses 
previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through 
profit or loss but through other comprehensive income. Any 
increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the 
impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at 
the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying 
amount is reduced through use of an allowance account and the 
amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the 
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is 
designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group categorises derivatives as follows:
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as fair value 
hedging instruments are recorded in the profit or loss, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability. 
Where put options are used as hedging instruments, only the 
intrinsic value of the option is designated as the hedge, with the 
time value recorded in finance costs.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that 
qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the profit or loss. Amounts accumulated 
in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the profit or loss in the 
period when the hedged item will affect the profit or loss. When 
the hedged item no longer meets the requirements for hedge 
accounting, expires or is sold, any accumulated gain or loss 
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014
recognised in shareholders’ equity is transferred to profit and 
loss when the forecast transaction which was the subject of the 
hedge occurs.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in 
a similar manner as cash flow hedges. The gain or loss accumulated 
in shareholders´ equity is transferred to the profit or loss at the time 
the foreign operation is disposed of.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
When derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in 
fair value are recognised immediately in the profit or loss.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision 
for impairment. 
Inventories
Inventories of consumable well supplies are stated at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value, cost being determined on an average 
cost basis. Inventories of hydrocarbons are stated at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. 
Under/over-lift 
Under or over-lifted positions of hydrocarbons are valued at 
market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. An under-lift 
of production from a field is included in current receivables and 
valued at the reporting date spot price or prevailing contract price 
and an over-lift of production from a field is included in current 
liabilities and valued at the reporting date spot price or prevailing 
contract price.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash in hand, 
outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid interest bearing 
securities with original maturities of three months or less. 
Equity
Share capital
The balance classified as equity share capital includes the total 
net proceeds (both nominal value and share premium) on issue of 
registered share capital of the parent Company. Share issue costs 
associated with the issuance of new equity are treated as a direct 
reduction of proceeds. 
Merger reserve
Merger reserve represents the difference between the market value 
of shares issued to effect business combinations less the nominal 
value of shares issued. The merger reserve in the Group financial 
statements also includes the consolidation adjustments that arise 
under the application of the pooling of interest method.
Cash flow hedge reserve
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument is recognised directly as other comprehensive 
income in the cash flow hedge reserve. Upon settlement of the 
hedged item, the change in fair value is transferred to the statement 
of comprehensive income.
Available-for-sale reserve
Gains and losses (with the exception of impairment losses) 
arising from changes in available-for-sale financial investments are 
recognised in the available-for-sale reserve until such time that the 
investment is disposed of, where it is reclassified to profit or loss.
Share-based payments reserve
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured 
at the fair value of the services received, and the corresponding 
increase in equity is recorded directly at the fair value of the 
services received. The share-based payments reserve includes 
treasury shares. STRATEGIC 
REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
93 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Retained earnings
Retained earnings contain the accumulated results attributable to 
the shareholders of the parent Company. 
Employee Benefit Trust
EnQuest PLC shares held by the Group are deducted from the 
share-based payments reserve and are recognised at cost. 
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds 
from the sale and the original cost being taken to reserves. No gain 
or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on 
the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Provisions
Decommissioning
Provision for future decommissioning costs is made in full when the 
Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an 
item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when 
a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. The amount 
recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure. 
An amount equivalent to the discounted initial provision for 
decommissioning costs is capitalised and amortised over the life of 
the underlying asset on a unit-of-production basis over proven and 
probable reserves. Any change in the present value of the estimated 
expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the oil 
and gas asset. 
The unwinding of the discount applied to future decommissioning 
provisions is included under finance costs in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Other
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset) 
is derecognised where:
 ` the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
 ` the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, 
but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without 
material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; or
 ` the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but 
has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the 
liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the 
same lender, on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability 
and the recognition of a new liability such that the difference in 
the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees 
incurred are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at 
fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are 
amortised over the life of the facility.
Borrowing costs are stated at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through 
the expected life of the financial liability, or a shorter period to the 
net carrying amount of the financial liability where appropriate. 
Bonds
Bonds are measured on an amortised cost basis.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a 
lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception 
date. The arrangement is assessed for whether fulfilment of the 
arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets 
or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even 
if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement. Finance 
leases that transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental 
to ownership of the leased item to the Group, are capitalised at the 
commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased property 
or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and 
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges 
are recognised in finance costs in the income statement.
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. 
However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will 
obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the 
asset and the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense 
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can 
be reliably measured. 
Oil and gas revenues comprise the Group’s share of sales from the 
processing or sale of hydrocarbons on an entitlement basis, when 
the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been passed to 
the buyer.
Tariff revenue is recognised in the period in which the services are 
provided at the agreed contract rates. 
Gains or losses arising on remeasurement of commodity derivatives 
designated at FVTPL are recognised immediately within revenue.
Exceptional items 
As permitted by IAS 1 (Revised), Presentation of Financial 
Statements, certain items are presented separately. The items that 
the Group separately presents as exceptional on the face of the 
statement of comprehensive income are those material items of 
income and expense which because of the nature and expected 
infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate 
presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the 
elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate 
comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in 
financial performance.
Depletion of fair value uplift to property, plant and equipment 
on acquiring strategic investments
IFRS requires that a fair value exercise is undertaken allocating the 
cost of acquiring controlling interests to the fair value of the acquired 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Any difference 
between the cost of acquiring the interest and the fair value of the 
acquired net assets, which includes identified contingent liabilities, is 
recognised as acquired goodwill. The fair value exercise is performed 
as at the date of acquisition. 94 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
The Directors have determined that for strategic investments it is 
important to identify separately the earnings impact of increased 
depletion arising from the acquisition date fair value uplifts made 
to property, plant and equipment over their useful economic lives. 
As a result of the nature of fair value assessments in the oil and 
gas industry the value attributed to strategic assets is subjective, 
based on a wide range of complex variables at a point in time. The 
subsequent depletion of the fair value uplifts bear little relationship 
to current market conditions, operational performance or cash 
generation. Management therefore reports and monitors the 
business performance of strategic investments before the impact of 
depletion of fair value uplifts to property, plant and equipment and 
the uplifts are excluded from the business result presented in the 
Group statement of comprehensive income.
Employee benefits
Short term employee benefits
Short term employee benefits such as salaries, social premiums and 
holiday pay, are expensed when incurred. 
Pension obligations
The Group’s pension obligations consist of defined contribution 
plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which 
the Group pays fixed contributions. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The 
amount charged to the statement of comprehensive income in 
respect of pension costs reflects the contributions payable in the 
year. Differences between contributions payable during the year 
and contributions actually paid are shown as either accrued 
liabilities or prepaid assets in the balance sheet.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration 
in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over 
shares (equity-settled transactions) of EnQuest PLC.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked to 
the price of the shares of EnQuest PLC (market conditions) or 
‘non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the 
period in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the 
award (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The statement of comprehensive income charge 
or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of 
whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. Equity 
awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date of 
cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the award at that 
date is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014
Taxes
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, 
based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the Group financial statements. However, deferred tax 
is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at 
the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis 
using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when 
the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability 
is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
are offset only if a legal right exists to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to 
the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to 
make a single net payment.
Production taxes
In addition to corporate income taxes, the Group’s financial 
statements also include and disclose production taxes on net 
income determined from oil and gas production. 
Production tax relates to Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) and is 
accounted for under IAS 12 since it has the characteristics of an 
income tax as it is imposed under Government authority and the 
amount payable is based on taxable profits of the relevant fields. 
Current and deferred PRT is provided on the same basis as 
described above for income taxes. 
Field allowances
The UK taxation regime provides for a reduction in ring fence 
supplementary corporation tax where investments in new or 
existing UK assets qualify for a relief known as field allowances. 
Eligible assets qualify for field allowances depending on the size, 
type or nature of the field and are granted when DECC approves a 
field development plan or addendum to a field development plan. 
Field allowances are only triggered when production from the field 
commences. The Group is eligible for a number of field allowances 
which will materially reduce the level of future supplementary 
corporation taxation. Field allowances are recognised as a 
reduction in the charge to taxation in the years claimed. STRATEGIC

Unrealised mark-to-market gains and losses of derivatives
These include unrealised mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity and foreign exchange instruments which are included within 
revenue (note 5(a)), costs of sales (note 5(b)) and finance expenses (note (6)). The separate presentation of these items best reflects the 
underlying performance of the business as it distinguishes between the temporary timing differences associated with re-measurement 
under IAS 39 rules and actual realised gains and losses.
Impairment of available-for-sale investments
As consideration for the disposal of the held for sale Petisovci asset in 2011, the Group received an investment in Ascent Resources plc. The 
accounting valuation of this shareholding at 31 December 2014 resulted in a non-cash impairment of US$1,714,000, of which US$1,316,000 
was recognised in the income statement (2013: US$312,000). As there was a reversal of an impairment in 2013, which was taken to the 
available-for-sale reserve then, a portion of the current year impairment must be taken to the reserve, as the income statement impact 
cannot exceed the cumulative decline in the value of the investment.
Impairment of oil and gas assets
As part of the annual impairment review process, impairment triggers were highlighted which has led to a US$678,801,000 impairment of 
Alma/Galia and Don fields (refer to note 10).
Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation assets were reviewed and this has led to an impairment primarily of Kildrummy, Cairngorm, Crawford Porter and 
some GKA acreage in the UK, SB307 and SB308 blocks in Malaysia and the North West October block in Egypt (refer to note 12). 
Gain on disposal of intangible oil and gas assets
In November 2014 the Group disposed of its Dutch asset P8a for US$2,162,000 resulting in a gain of US$2,019,000.
Depletion of fair value uplift
Additional depletion arising from the fair value uplift of Petrofac Energy Developments Limited’s (PEDL) oil and gas assets on acquisition of 
US$6,870,000 (2013: US$8,509,000) is included within cost of sales in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Operator SVT tariff reconciliation
SVT terminal operating costs are allocated to East of Shetland users based on each user’s delivered production throughput, as a 
percentage of the total terminal throughput. Costs are further allocated, based on a user’s share of two associated services – Stabilised 
Crude Oil processing (SCO) & Liquified Petroleum Gas processing (LPG). SVT costs incurred during each month are provisionally allocated 
and charged to users based on a user’s estimated share of costs (based on estimated throughput volumes per service). At year end, a 
process occurs whereby the terminal operator reconciles each user’s estimated share of costs against its actual share (based on the actual 
total spend and actual terminal throughput for that given year).
In 2013, as a direct result of EnQuest’s strong production performance versus other SVT users’ lower than expected throughput in 2013, 
EnQuest’s actual share of SCO/LPG throughput at year end was greater than estimated. This factor combined with a higher base level cost 
at SVT contributed to the exceptional value arising from the 2013 reconciliation. In addition, EnQuest also incurred a small excess capacity 
charge due to the use of terminal capacity in excess of its ownership share entitlement. The charge recognised in the year ended 
31 December 2014 in relation to the 2013 reconciliation process was $30,369,000.
The Terminal Operator (BP) has undertaken a number of technical studies to map out the various operational and investment cases required 
to facilitate the terminal life to 2025, and beyond. These technical studies are now complete and will be presented to the terminal owners at 
the end of Q1/2015.
The next steps will be for the Terminal Owners to make a number of key decisions relating to what investments are necessary to facilitate a 
terminal life to 2025 and/or 2040. 
Negative goodwill
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group acquired the PM8/Seligi assets in Malaysia. The assets and liabilities on acquisition 
have been fair valued and as the fair value is greater than the deemed consideration then a gain of US$28,630,000 has been recognised 
(refer to note 13).
Tax
The tax impact on the exceptional items is calculated based on the tax rate applicable to each exceptional item.

(d) Tax losses 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for the carry-forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it 
is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses/credits can be utilised.
The Group has unused UK mainstream corporation tax losses of US$16,635,000 (2013: US$2,481,000) for which no deferred tax asset has 
been recognised at the balance sheet date due to the uncertainty of recovery of these losses. 
The Group has unused overseas tax losses in Canada of approximately CAD$12,735,000 (2013: CAD$14,880,000) and in Holland of nil 
(2013: €1,070,000) for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised at the balance sheet date. The tax losses in Canada have expiry 
periods of between seven and 20 years, none of which expire in 2015 and which arose following the change in control of the UK Stratic 
Group in 2010. Tax losses in Holland can be carried forward for a period of up to nine years.
The Group has pre-trading expenditure incurred in Malaysia on licences SB307 and SB308 of approximately US$29,700,000 for which no 
deferred tax asset has been recognised at the balance sheet date. The Group also has unrecognised pre-trading expenditure in Egypt at 
the end of 2014 of US$3,300,000. 
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries. Finance Act 2009 exempted foreign dividends from 
the scope of UK corporation tax where certain conditions are satisfied.
(e) Change in legislation
Finance Act 2013 enacted a change in the mainstream corporation tax rate, reducing it from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and 
20% with effect from 1 April 2015. The impact of the change in tax rate in 2013 was an increase in the tax charge of US$409,000.

The calculation of earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue 
during the period. 
In 2014, potentially issuable ordinary shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per ordinary share calculation, as their inclusion would 
decrease the loss per ordinary share.

and a ‘contingent’ carry (payable up to US$144,000,000 subject to reserves determination). US$320,000,000 was included and the 
remaining US$164,176,000 balance of the ‘firm’ carry and US$80,000,000 of the ‘contingent’ carry were provided within financial liabilities 
(note 21) and provisions (note 23) respectively as at 31 December 2013.
Under the 2012 farm-out agreement with KUFPEC for a 35% share of the Alma/Galia development, KUFPEC were required to carry the 
Company for US$182,000,000. This amount was initially recognised as an ‘other receivable’ (note 21) and then transferred to PP&E as the carry 
was exhausted. During the year ended 31 December 2013, KUFPEC carried the Company for US$98,300,000 under this carry arrangement.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, there have been impairments in the Alma/Galia and Don fields of US$678,801,000 
(US$256,896,000 on a post tax basis). The impairment is principally due to the significant fall in the oil price in the latter part of 2014. Other 
factors contributing to the impairment include delays in first oil and cost increases in the case of Alma/Galia, together with the impact of 
cutting the capital programme, in response to the changing economic conditions. The only asset with a material impairment is Alma/Galia, 
where it has been written down by US$675,600,000 to the estimate of its recoverable value of US$832,900,000. This assessment of 
recoverable value is most sensitive to assumptions in respect of price and production (refer to note 11).
There was no impairment in the year ended 31 December 2013. 
The net book value at 31 December 2014 includes US$1,504,172,000 (2013: US$1,581,847,000) of pre-development assets and development 
assets under construction which are not being depreciated. Also US$49,132,000 (2013: US$7,130,000) of costs relating to the construction 
of the Group’s new Aberdeen office has not been depreciated.
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2014 was US$3,169,000 (2013: US$1,241,000) and relate to 
the Alma/Galia and Kraken development projects as well as the construction of the new office building. The weighted average rate used to 
determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is 1.54% (2013: 0.95%).
The net book value of property, plant and equipment held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts at 31 December 2014 was 
US$141,000 (2013: US$141,000) of oil and gas assets. The net book value of US$10,695,000 (2013: US$10,695,000) for land is held under a 
long lease.

Cost
At 1 January 107,760 107,760
Additions (note 13) 81,557 –
At 31 December 189,317 107,760
The balance at 31 December 2013 represents goodwill acquired on the acquisition of Stratic and PEDL in 2010. The additions during the 
year represent the acquisition of the Greater Kittiwake Area asset. 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to a single cash-generating unit (CGU), the UKCS, and therefore the 
lowest level that goodwill is reviewed. 
Impairment testing of goodwill 
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill has been reviewed for impairment at the year end. In assessing whether goodwill 
has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU, including goodwill, is compared with its recoverable amount. In the prior year the 
Group used the detailed calculation performed in 2012 as the basis for the tests as allowed under IAS 36. 
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined on a fair value less costs to sell basis. Discounted cash flow models comprising 
asset-by-asset life of field projections using Level 3 inputs (based on IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy) have been used to determine the recoverable 
amounts. The cash flows have been modelled on a post-tax and post-decommissioning basis discounted at the Group’s post-tax weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.8%. Risks specific to assets within the CGU are reflected within the cash flow forecasts.
Key assumptions used in calculations
The key assumptions required for the calculation of the CGU are:
 ` oil prices;
 ` production volumes;
 ` discount rates;
 ` opex, capex and decommissioning costs; and
 ` taxation.
Oil prices are based on forward price curves for the first three years and thereafter at US$85 per barrel inflated at 2% per annum from 2015.

11. Goodwill (continued)
Production volumes are based on life of field production profiles for each asset within the CGU. The production volumes used in the 
calculations were taken from the report prepared by the Group’s independent reserve assessment experts.
The discount rate reflects management’s estimate of the Group’s WACC. The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost 
of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on its interest-bearing 
borrowings. Segment risk is incorporated by applying a beta factor based on publicly available market data. The post-tax discount rate 
applied to the Group’s post-tax cash flow projections was 8.8%. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The Group’s value is highly sensitive, inter alia, to oil price achieved and production volumes. The recoverable amount (NPV) of the CGU 
would be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill if either the oil price or production volumes (on a CGU weighted average basis) were 
to fall by 14% from the prices outlined above. Goodwill would need to be fully impaired if the oil price or production volumes (on a CGU 
weighted average basis) were to fall by 17% from the prices outlined above. The above sensitivities have flexed revenues and tax cash flows, 
but operating costs and capital expenditures have been kept constant. In reality, management would be highly likely to take steps to 
mitigate the value impact of further falls in the oil price by cutting supply chain costs.

Included within ‘Acquisition of interests in licences’ in 2013 is US$1,310,000 relating to a farm-in to a 50% non-operated interest in 
exploration licence P2006 Block 21/6b (Avalon). Also included is the Group’s 50% interest in the North West October (NWO) block in Egypt, 
acquired from Arabian Oil Company Limited (AOC).
During the year the Group disposed of its Dutch asset P8a for US$2,162,000 resulting in a gain of US$2,019,000.

12. Intangible oil and gas assets (continued)
In 2013, an agreement was completed whereby KUFPEC UK Limited (KUFPEC) and Spike Exploration UK Limited (Spike) took 25% and 30% 
working interests respectively in the Cairngorm discovery (blocks 16/2b and 16/3d). KUFPEC and Spike agreed to pay a premium by way of 
a promoted carry on the Cairngorm appraisal well and to pay their equity share of back costs of US$2,648,000 which are disclosed within 
‘Farm-out’ costs. 
During the year ended 31 December 2014, US$8,423,000 of costs relating to relinquished licences previously impaired were written off 
(2013: US$6,553,000).
The impairment charge for the year ended 31 December 2014 includes costs relating to Crawford Porter, Kildrummy, Cairngorm and some 
GKA acreage in the UK. In current market conditions some of those interests do not merit sufficient funds to progress them to economic 
development. In addition, costs relating to the SB307 and SB308 blocks in Malaysia (due to the unsuccessful exploration well) and costs 
incurred since acquisition on the NWO block in Egypt were impaired. The costs relating to the South West Heather licence which is in the 
process of being relinquished have also been impaired. The year ended 31 December 2013 included the impairment charge for the Peik 
licence which was relinquished in 2014.
13. Business combinations
Acquisition of GKA assets 
On 1 March 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of Centrica North Sea Oil Limited (Centrica) 50% share of the UKCS GKA assets as 
well as Centrica’s 100% interest in the Kittiwake to Forties oil export pipeline. Base consideration was US$39,900,000 which was subject to 
certain working capital and other interim period adjustments from the economic date of 1 January 2013, resulting in a cash consideration of 
US$30,322,000. The Group acquired the GKA assets partly due to its proximity to the Scolty/Crathes field and the potential for a tie-back. 
In addition, the Group saw significant potential to improve production through infill drilling.
The fair value was provisional at 30 June 2014 and has been reviewed in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
(Revised). The initial fair values of assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition have been updated to reflect the finalisation of working 
capital adjustments and decommissioning provisions.
The changes to the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of GKA are as follows:

The goodwill of US$81,557,000 comprises the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition. None of the goodwill recognised is 
expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
From the date of acquisition, GKA has contributed US$61,647,000 to revenue and US$9,866,000 to the profit before tax from continuing 
operations of the Group. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, revenue from continuing operations would have 
been US$61,647,000 and the loss before tax from continuing operations for the Group would have been US$3,044,000.
The Group will pay deferred consideration of US$30,000,000 contingent on regulatory approval of a Field Development Plan (FDP) for the 
Scolty field and/or the Crathes field. The fair value of US$18,000,000 has been determined at the date of acquisition using the then best 
estimate of the likelihood of FDP approval.
 
In addition, contingent consideration up to a maximum of US$100,000,000 may be payable subject to future exploration success. The fair 
value of US$8,700,000 is based on a discounted cash flow method and the best current estimate of the chance of exploration success.

Acquisition of Seligi oil field and PM8 PSC
On 27 June 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Malaysia Inc’s 50% operated interest in the 
Seligi oil field and an 80% participating interest in the PM8 PSC, located offshore Malaysia. The PM8 PSC (extension) was agreed to include the 
Seligi oil field and with effect from 1 July 2014, EnQuest holds a 50% interest in PM8/Seligi. Base consideration was US$67,000,000 subject to 
interim period adjustments since the economic date of 1 January 2014, resulting in a cash consideration payable of US$24,744,000.
The Group acquired the assets to use its extensive experience in creating value from late stage maturing assets in the North Sea to 
enhance recovery from these Malaysian assets.
The fair value was provisional at 30 June 2014 and has been reviewed in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
(Revised). The initial fair values of assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition have been updated to reflect the finalisation of working 
capital adjustments and decommissioning provisions.

The acquired financial liability relates to an agreement by the Group to carry Petronas Carigali SDN BHD (Carigali) for its share of 
exploration or appraisal well commitments. The fair value of US$5,247,000 has been calculated using a discounted cash flow method.
From the date of acquisition, PM8 has contributed US$53,335,000 to revenue and US$21,844,000 to the profit before tax from continuing 
operations of the Group. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, revenue from continuing operations would have 
been US$155,319,000 and the profit before tax from continuing operations for the Group would have been US$91,449,000.
The negative goodwill has been recognised in the income statement in the year ended 31 December 2014. The transaction resulted in a 
gain as EnQuest has the capability to utilise its skills to enhance value of mature assets such as PM8. Therefore, we believe the fair value of 
the assets is greater than the consideration.

to 31 December 2014. 
In the prior year, the accounting valuation for the period ended 30 June 2013 resulted in a non-cash impairment of US$312,000 
and by 31 December 2013 the share price had increased, resulting in a reversal of the impairment, which was recognised in the

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 15 to 30 day terms.
Trade receivables are reported net of any provisions for impairment. As at 31 December 2014 no impairment provision for trade receivables 
was necessary (2013: nil). 
Joint venture receivables relate to billings to joint venture partners and were not impaired. 
Under-lift is valued at net realisable value being the lower of cost and net realisable value.
As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 no other receivables were determined to be impaired.
The carrying value of the Group’s trade, joint venture and other receivables as stated above is considered to be a reasonable approximation 
to their fair value largely due to their short term maturities.
17. Cash and cash equivalents
The carrying value of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents is considered to be a reasonable approximation to their fair value due to their 
short term maturities. Included within the cash balance at 31 December 2014 is restricted cash of US$27,183,000 (2013: nil). US$22,324,000 
of this relates to cash held in escrow in respect of the unwound acquisition of the Tunisian assets of PA Resources and the remainder relates 
to cash collateral held to issue bank guarantees in Malaysia.

The share capital comprises only one class of Ordinary share. Each Ordinary share carries an equal voting right and right to a dividend.
There were no new issues of shares during 2014 or 2013.
At 31 December 2014 there were 29,691,691 shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust (2013: 25,510,520), the increase is due to the 
purchase of shares to satisfy awards made under the Company’s share-based incentive schemes net of shares used during the year.

19. Share-based payment plans
On 18 March 2010, the Directors of the Company approved three share schemes for the benefit of Directors and employees, being a 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan, a Restricted Share Plan and a Performance Share Plan. A Sharesave Plan was approved in 2012. The grant 
values for all schemes are based on the average share price from the three days preceding the date of grant.
Deferred Bonus Share Plan (DBSP)
Selected employees are eligible to participate under this scheme. Participants may be invited to elect or, in some cases, be required, to 
receive a proportion of any bonus in Ordinary shares of EnQuest (invested awards). Following such award, EnQuest will generally grant the 
participant an additional award over a number of shares bearing a specified ratio to the number of his or her invested shares (matching 
shares). The awards granted will vest 33% on the first anniversary of the date of grant, a further 33% after year two and the final 34% on the 
third anniversary of the date of grant. The invested awards are fully recognised as an expense in the period to which the bonuses relate. 
The costs relating to the matching shares are recognised over the vesting period and the fair values of the equity-settled matching shares 
granted to employees are based on quoted market prices adjusted for the trued up percentage vesting rate of the plan.
Details of the fair values and assumed vesting rates of the DBSP scheme are shown below:

The weighted average contractual life for the share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2014 was 0.9 years (2013: 1.0 years).
The charge recognised in the 2014 statement of comprehensive income in relation to matching share awards amounted to US$2,095,000 
(2013: US$1,058,000).
Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Under the Restricted Share Plan scheme, employees are granted shares in EnQuest over a discretionary vesting period at the direction 
of the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of EnQuest, which may or may not be subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions. Awards made under the RSP will vest over periods between one and four years. At present there are no performance conditions 
applying to this scheme nor is there currently any intention to introduce them in the future. The fair value of the awards granted under the 
plan at various grant dates during the year are based on quoted market prices adjusted for an assumed vesting rate over the relevant 
vesting period.

The charge recognised in the year ended 31 December 2014 amounted to US$1,637,000 (2013: US$3,007,000). 
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Under the Performance Share Plan, the shares vest subject to performance conditions. The PSP share awards granted had three sets of 
performance conditions associated with them. One third of the award relates to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against a comparator group 
of 36 oil and gas companies listed on the FTSE 350, AIM Top 100 and Stockholm NASDAQ OMX; one third relates to production growth per 
share; and one third relates to reserves growth per share, over the three year performance period. Awards will vest on the third anniversary.
The fair value of the awards granted under the plan at various grant dates during the year are based on quoted market prices adjusted for 
an assumed vesting rate over the relevant vesting period.

Sharesave plan
The Group operates an approved savings related share option scheme. The plan is based on eligible employees being granted options and 
their agreement to opening a sharesave account with a nominated savings carrier and to save over a specified period, either three or five 
years. The right to exercise the option is at the employee’s discretion at the end of the period previously chosen, for a period of six months.

The charge recognised in the 2014 statement of comprehensive income amounted to US$25,000 (2013: US$62,000).
The Group has recognised a total charge of US$8,468,000 (2013: US$8,193,000) in the statement of comprehensive income during the year, 
relating to the above employee share-based schemes. 
20. Loans and borrowings
Revolving credit facility
At 31 December 2014, the Group had a six year US$1,700,000,000 multi-currency revolving credit facility, comprising of a committed 
amount of US$1,200,000,000 with a further US$500,000,000 available through an accordion structure.
Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% to 3.75%, dependent on specified covenant ratios. 
At 31 December 2014, US$217,649,000 was drawn down under the Group’s facility agreement (2013: US$225,809,000) and LoC utilisation 
was US$149,395,000 (2013: US$181,543,000). Unamortised facility fees of US$24,168,000 have been netted off against the drawdowns in the 
balance sheet (2013: US$26,413,000).
Property loan facility 
During the year the Group entered a £31,800,000 two year development facility with Abbey National Treasury Services PLC in relation 
to the construction of the Group’s Aberdeen office building. The facility terminates on 28 March 2016. 
Interest of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.5% is payable. At 31 December 2014, £21,934,000 (US$34,199,000) was drawn down under the 
development facility. Unamortised facility fees of US$645,000 have been netted off against the drawdowns in the balance sheet.
The Group considers there to be no material difference between the fair values of the interest bearing loans and borrowings and the 
carrying amounts in the balance sheet.
Bonds
In April 2014, the Group issued a US$650,000,000 high yield bond which matures in 2022 and pays a coupon of 7% payable bi-annually 
in April and October. The bond is carried at its amortised cost of US$651,077,000 (2013: nil). 
At 31 December 2014, the Group also had a 5.5% Sterling Retail Bond of £155,245,000. The original bond raised £145,000,000 with 
an additional £10,245,000 issued in November 2013. The bond pays a coupon of 5.5% payable bi-annually in February and August and 
matures in 2022. The bond had a fair value of US$169,010,000 (2013: US$263,498,000) but is carried at its amortised cost of US$244,173,000 
(2013: US$258,791,000). The fair value of the Sterling Retail Bond has been determined by reference to the price available from the market 
on which the bond is traded. 110 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Commodity contracts
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group entered into various put option contracts in order to hedge the exposure to changes in 
future cash flows from the sale of oil production in 2015. Put options over approximately 8,000,000 barrels of oil in 2015 were purchased with 
an average strike price of US$87 per barrel. These options were subsequently closed in December 2014. A gain on the intrinsic value of the 
options (the portion designated into the hedging relationship) of US$119,055,000 was deferred in equity and will be recognised in revenue 
during 2015. The realised loss on the time value portion of US$38,815,000 was recognised in finance costs. Put options over a further 
10,000,000 barrels maturing in 2015 were purchased, and remain open at year end. These options have an average strike price of US$65 per 
barrel, and were deemed effective for hedge accounting purposes. Intrinsic value gains of US$37,226,000 have been deferred in equity and 
will be recognised in revenue during 2015. The increase of US$16,200,000 in the time value portion above the premium paid for the options 
has been recognised in finance costs. The fair value of these open puts at 31 December 2014 was US$87,299,000. 
The Group also sold call options during 2014. At 31 December 2014 call options over 17,744,000 notional barrels had been sold, of 
which 10,246,150 maturing in 2015 with an average strike price of US$93.94 per barrel, and 7,498,199 maturing in 2016 with an average 
strike price of US$99.36 per barrel. These call options are designated as ‘At fair value through profit and loss’ (FVTPL). These contracts had 
a net liability fair value of US$36,227,000 at 31 December 2014, representing a gain over the premium received of US$16,653,000. This gain 
has been recognised in revenue.

21. Other financial assets and financial liabilities (continued)
In August and September 2013, the Group entered into five options in order to hedge the exposure to changes in future cash flows from 
the sale of oil production for approximately 3,600,000 barrels of oil in 2014. These instruments were deemed to be ineffective for hedge 
accounting purposes and were designated as at FVTPL. These contracts matured during 2014 and had a nil fair value (2013: 
US$5,084,000 (loss)). 
During the year, the Group also entered a series of commodity swaps. These contracts had a net fair value of US$3,670,000.
Forward foreign currency contracts
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group entered into various forward currency contracts, namely Sterling, Euro and 
Norwegian Krone which were due to expire in 2014 and 2015. These contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting. Of those outstanding 
at 31 December 2014, the net fair value was US$10,396,000 liability (2013: US$7,688,000 asset). 
Foreign exchange swap contracts
During 2014, the Group entered several foreign exchange swap contracts when Sterling was trading above $1.66:£1. The swap contracts were 
closed early in October 2014 realising a gain of US$46,756,000 which has been recognised in the income statement within cost of sales.

Other receivable
As part of the 2012 farm-out to KUFPEC of 35% of the Alma/Galia development, KUFPEC agreed to pay EnQuest a total of US$23,292,000 
after production commences over a period of 36 months, the fair value of which was US$19,300,000. Receivables were recognised at 
31 December 2012. The unwinding of discount of US$877,000 is included within finance income for the year ended 31 December 2014 
(2013: US$1,447,000).
Other liability
The consideration for the acquisition of 40% of the Kraken field from Nautical and First Oil in 2012 was through development carries. 
These were split into a ‘firm’ carry and a ‘contingent’ carry dependent upon reserves determination. A financial liability is recognised at 
31 December 2014 for the remainder of the ‘firm’ carry amounting to US$66,502,000 (2013: US$164,176,000). This is expected to expire 
early in 2015. The ‘contingent’ carry has been accounted for as a provision (note 23).
On Kraken FDP approval, commitments of US$11,200,000 due in respect of back-in payments associated with the sole risk drilling 
undertaken by the previous operator were due to be paid. These have now been added to the carry arrangement.
As part of the agreement to acquire the PM8 assets in Malaysia, the Group agreed to carry Petronas Carigali for its share of exploration or 
appraisal well commitments. The discounted value of US$5,379,000 has been disclosed as a financial liability (2013: nil). The unwinding of 
discount of US$132,000 is included within finance expense for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: nil).

23. Provisions (continued)
Provision for decommissioning
The Group makes full provision for the future costs of decommissioning its oil production facilities and pipelines on a discounted basis. 
With respect to the Heather field, the decommissioning provision is based on the Group’s contractual obligation of 37.5% of the 
decommissioning liability rather than the Group’s equity interest in the field.
The provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs which are expected to be incurred up to 2032 assuming no further 
development of the Group’s assets. The liability is discounted at a rate of 3.0% (2013: 5.0%). The unwinding of the discount is classified as a 
finance cost (note 6).
These provisions have been created based on internal and third party estimates. Assumptions based on the current economic environment 
have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. These estimates are 
reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately 
depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant 
time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning liabilities is likely to depend on the dates when the fields cease to be economically 
viable. This in turn depends on future oil prices which are inherently uncertain.
Carry provision
Consideration for the acquisition of 40% of the Kraken field from Nautical and First Oil in 2012 was through development carries. 
A provision has been recognised for the ‘contingent’ carry which is dependent on a reserves determination. The reserves determination 
would be triggered by the carried parties, based on drilling work, or if later the date on which the ‘firm’ carry expires. The ‘contingent’ carry 
is pro-rated between 100 and 166 million barrels of proven and probable reserves. The FDP which was approved in November 2013 stated 
137 million barrels and this would give rise to a carry of approximately US$80,000,000. The carry is estimated to be paid 12 months after 
the ‘firm’ carry has expired in early 2015.
Contingent consideration
As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owner of the GKA assets, a contingent consideration has been agreed (refer to note 13).

Other payables 5,982 489
429,070 363,310
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled on terms of between 10 and 30 days. Certain trade and other payables 
will be settled in currencies other than the reporting currency of the Group, mainly in Sterling.
Accrued expenses include accruals for capital and operating expenditure in relation to the oil and gas assets.
The carrying value of the Group’s trade and other payables as stated above is considered to be a reasonable approximation to their fair 
value largely due to the short term maturities.
25. Commitments and contingencies
Commitments
(i) Operating lease commitments
The Group has financial commitments in respect of non-cancellable operating leases for office premises. These leases have remaining 
non-cancellable lease terms of between one and nine years. The future minimum rental commitments under these non-cancellable leases 
are as follows:
2014
US$’000
2013
US$’000
Not later than one year 2,031 2,703
After one year but not more than five years 3,733 3,267
Over five years 1,335 2,235
7,099 8,205
Lease payments recognised as an operating lease expense during the year amounted to US$3,086,000 (2013: US$2,676,000). 
Under the Dons Northern Producer Agreement a minimum notice period of 12 months exists whereby the Group expects the minimum 
commitment under this agreement to be approximately US$13,976,000 (2013: US$24,363,000).
(ii) Finance lease commitments

The leases are fixed rate leases with an effective borrowing rate of 2.37% (2013: 2.37%) and have an average remaining life of one year 
(2013: two years).
On 20 December 2013, the Group entered into a bareboat charter with Armada Kraken PTE Limited (Armada) for the lease of an FPSO 
vessel for the Kraken field. The lease will commence on the date of first production which is currently targeted to come onstream by 2017. 
Armada will construct the vessel and the Group incurred an initial payment of US$100,000,000 which was paid during 2014.
(iii) Capital commitments
At 31 December 2014, the Group had capital commitments excluding the above lease commitments amounting to US$788,259,000 (2013: 
US$447,293,000).
Contingencies
As part of the KUFPEC farm-in agreement, a reserves protection mechanism was agreed with KUFPEC to enable KUFPEC to recoup its 
investment to the date of first production. If on 1 January 2017, KUFPEC’s costs to first production have not been recovered or deemed to 
have been recovered, EnQuest will pay to KUFPEC an additional 20% share of net revenue (giving them 55% in total). This additional 
revenue is to be paid from January 2017 until the costs to first production have been recovered.
In addition, there is contingent consideration of US$20,000,000 after the acquisition of EQ Petroleum Sabah Limited (previously Nio 
Petroleum (Sabah) Limited) which will be determined based on proven and probable reserves associated with an approved FDP on Blocks 
SB307 and SB308 in Malaysia. The exploration/appraisal well drilled in the area in 2014 was unsuccessful.
There is also deferred consideration of US$3,000,000 dependent on FDP approval in relation to the 20% interest in Kildrummy acquired 
from ENI UK Limited during the year ended 31 December 2012, the costs of this well were impaired in 2014.
In the ordinary course of business there is a risk of disputes with partners, suppliers or customers relating to matters such as cost overruns, 
service provision or contractual terms. Should disputes emerge and become subject to formal legal proceedings the Group could face 
liabilities in the event of adverse determinations. As at the date of this report there are no material court or arbitration proceedings 
affecting the Group.
26. Related party transactions
The Group financial statements include the financial statements of EnQuest PLC and its subsidiaries. A list of the Group’s principal 
subsidiaries is contained in note 29 to these Group financial statements.
Balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and 
are not disclosed in this note. 
All sales to and purchases from related parties are made at normal market prices and the pricing policies and terms of these transactions 
are approved by the Group’s management. There have been no transactions with related parties who are not members of the Group during 
the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: nil).

27. Risk management and financial instruments
Risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities comprise trade and other receivables, cash and short term deposits, interest-bearing 
loans, borrowings and finance leases, derivative financial instruments and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial 
instruments is to manage short term cash flow and raise finance for the Group’s capital expenditure programme.
The Group’s activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with fluctuations in oil price, foreign currency risk, 
liquidity risk and credit risk. Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below. Also 
presented below is a sensitivity analysis to indicate sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Group’s financial instruments and to 
show the impact on profit and shareholders’ equity, where applicable. The sensitivity has been prepared for periods ended 31 December 
2014 and 2013 using the amounts of debt and other financial assets and liabilities held at those reporting dates.
Commodity price risk – oil prices
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Brent oil prices on its revenues and profits generated from sales of crude oil. 
The Group’s policy is to have the ability to hedge oil prices up to a maximum of 75% of the next 12 months production on a rolling annual 
basis, up to 60% in the following 12 month period and 50% in the subsequent 12 month period.
Details of the commodity derivative contracts entered into during, and on hand at the end of 2014, are disclosed in note 21.
The following table summarises the impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit and total equity of a reasonably possible change in the Brent oil 
price, on the fair value of derivative financial instruments, with all other variables held constant:

Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases in currencies other than the Group’s 
functional currency and the bond which is denominated in Sterling. To mitigate the risks of large fluctuations in the currency markets, the 
hedging policy agreed by the Board allows for up to 70% of non-US Dollar portion of the Group’s annual capital budget and operating 
expenditure to be hedged. For specific contracted capital expenditure projects, up to 100% can be hedged. Approximately 1% (2013: 1%) 
of the Group’s sales and 91% (2013: 91%) of costs are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
During the first half of 2013, the Group entered into a series of forward contracts and structured products to hedge a portion of its Sterling, 
Euro and Norwegian Krone exposure throughout 2013 and 2014. In 2014, a total of £182,000,000 of Sterling exposure was hedged using 
this structured product with an average strike price of US$1.46:£1. If the spot rate at expiry of the contracts was above US$1.64:£1 then 
there was no trade and the Group funded its Sterling requirement through the spot market or drew Sterling on the bank facility. Between 
US$1.64:£1 and US$1.33:£1, EnQuest traded at the lower of US$1.46:£1 and the spot rate and below US$1.33:£1, EnQuest traded a higher 
volume of currency at US$1.46:£1. 
The same structure was also used to hedge the Group’s Norwegian Krone (NOK) exposure arising as part of the Kraken development 
project. In 2014, a total of NOK367,000,000 has been hedged.
During 2014, EnQuest entered several foreign exchange swap contracts when Sterling was trading above $1.66:£1. The realised impact of 
US$46,756,000 has been recognised in the income statement within cost of sales.
The following table summarises the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the United States Dollar to Sterling foreign exchange rate, 
with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax due to changes in the carrying value of monetary assets and liabilities 
at the reporting date. The impact in equity is the same as the impact on profit before tax. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency 
changes for all other currencies is not material:

27. Risk management and financial instruments (continued)
Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised international oil and gas operators and at 31 December 2014 there were no trade receivables past 
due (2013: nil), US$490,000 of joint venture receivables past due (2013: US$1,981,000) and US$1,955,000 (2013: nil) of other receivables past 
due but not impaired. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with appropriate follow-up action taken where necessary.

At 31 December 2014, the Group had three customers accounting for 89% of outstanding trade and other receivables (2013: two 
customers, 72%) and three joint venture partners accounting for 95% of joint venture receivables (2013: three joint venture partners, 99%). 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Group’s 
exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Cash balances can be invested in short term bank deposits and AAA-rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved limits and with a view 
to minimising counterparty credit risks.
Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by reviewing its cash flow requirements on a regular basis relative to its existing bank 
facilities and the maturity profile of these facilities. Specifically the Group’s policy is to ensure that sufficient liquidity or committed facilities 
exist within the Group to meet its operational funding requirements and to ensure the Group can service its debt and adhere to its financial 
covenants. During 2014, the Group performed within the financial ratios applicable (and forecast for) that period as allowed for by its revolving 
credit facility. In light of recent low oil prices and in order to provide flexibility for EnQuest’s capital investment programme, the revolving 
credit facility lending banks have agreed to relax existing credit facility covenants subsequent to the year end. The net debt/ EBITDA covenant 
has been increased to five times and the ratio of financial charges to EBITDA is reduced to three times, both until mid-2017. 
At 31 December 2014, the Group held a six year US$1,700,000,000 multi-currency revolving credit facility, comprising of a committed 
amount of US$1,200,000,000 with a further US$500,000,000 available through an accordion structure.
The maturity profiles of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities including projected interest thereon are as follows:

Capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 20, cash and cash equivalents and 
equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as in the Group Statement 
of Changes in Equity on page 85.
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to optimise the return on investment, by managing its capital structure to 
achieve capital efficiency whilst also maintaining flexibility for future acquisitions. The Group regularly monitors the capital requirements of 
the business over the short, medium and long term, in order to enable it to foresee when additional capital will be required. Note 20 to the 
financial statements provides further details of the Group’s financing activity.
The Group has approval from the Board to hedge the exchange risk on up to 70% of the non US Dollar portion of the Group’s annual capital 
budget and operating expenditure. For specific contracted capex projects, up to 100% can be hedged. In addition, there is approval from 
the Board to hedge up to 75% of annual production in year 1, 60% in year 2 and 50% in year 3. This is designed to minimise the risk of 
adverse movements in exchange rates and prices eroding the return on the Group’s projects and operations.
The Board regularly reassesses the existing dividend policy to ensure that shareholder value is maximised. Any future payment of dividends 
is expected to depend on the earnings and financial condition of the Company and such other factors as the Board considers appropriate.
The Group monitors capital using the gearing ratio and return on shareholders’ equity as follows:

28. Post balance sheet events
In February 2015, EnQuest announced that it had exited from its small investment in Tunisia. The transaction had been conditional on an 
appropriate response from the Tunisian authorities and with the backstop date for the transaction having passed without the required 
response, the parties elected not to extend. Potential consideration of $22 million had been kept in escrow, this was duly returned to 
EnQuest after the year end. 
In 2015, the Group renegotiated financial convenants under its RCF to provide greater flexibility for its capital investment programme. 
The net debt/EBITDA covenant has been increased to five times and the ratio of financial charges to EBITDA is reduced to three times, 
both until mid-2017. 118 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES  
FOR THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under 
Company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Company for that period. In preparing the financial 
statements the Directors are required to:
 ` select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 ` make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 ` state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 ` prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 120 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014

121 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014
1. Corporate information
The Company financial statements of EnQuest PLC (the Company) 
for the year ended 31 December 2014 were authorised for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 18 March 2015.
EnQuest PLC (EnQuest or the Company) is a limited liability 
Company registered in England and is the holding Company for the 
Group of EnQuest subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’). 
The Group’s principal activities are the exploration for, and 
extraction and production of, hydrocarbons in the UK Continental 
Shelf, Malaysia and the Norwegian North Sea.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards on a 
historical cost basis. The functional and presentation currency of 
the separate financial statements is United States Dollars and all 
values in the separate financial statements are rounded to the 
nearest thousand (US$’000) except where otherwise stated.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as 
permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The parent 
Company’s accounts present information about it as an individual 
undertaking and not about its group. EnQuest reported a loss for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2014 of US$16,578,000 
(2013: loss US$15,327,000). There were no other recognised gains 
or losses in the period (2013: nil).
Going concern concept
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that the use 
of the going concern basis is appropriate and that there are no 
material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the 
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. See pages 
42 and 43 in the Financial Review for further details.
Investments 
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that 
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in 
an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is 
considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable 
profits from which deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted 
basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in 
which timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Amounts due from/to subsidiaries
Amounts due from/to subsidiaries are non-interest bearing 
short term and interest bearing long term funding to and from 
subsidiaries. These are recognised at the fair value of consideration 
received or paid. Amounts receivable are stated net of any 
provision for impairment.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the 
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is 
designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group categorises derivatives as follows:
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that 
qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised through the statement 
of total recognised gains and losses. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss 
account. Amounts accumulated in shareholders’ equity are 
transferred to the profit and loss account in the period when the 
hedged item will affect the profit or loss. When the hedged item no 
longer meets the requirements for hedge accounting, expires or is 
sold, any accumulated gain or loss recognised in shareholders’ 
equity is transferred to the profit and loss account when the 
forecast transaction which was the subject of the hedge occurs.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
When derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in 
fair value are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Employee Benefit Trust
EnQuest shares held by the Group are deducted from the share-
based payments reserve and are recognised at cost. Consideration 
received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, 
with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the 
original cost being taken to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised 
in the profit and loss account on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of equity shares.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration 
in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over 
shares (equity-settled transactions) of EnQuest.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked 
to the price of the shares of EnQuest (market conditions) or 
‘non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the 
period in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the 
award (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. The profit and loss account charge or credit for 
a period represents the movement in cumulative expense 
recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon market or 
non-vesting conditions, which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. Equity 
awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date of 
cancellation, and any expense not recognised for the award at that 
date is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The Company operates a number of share award schemes on 
behalf of the employees of the Group which are described in detail 
within note 19 of the Group financial statements.
The reserve for the share-based payments is used to record 
the value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded to 
employees and transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting 
of the original share awards.

During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company’s subsidiary EnQuest North Sea BV transferred its holding of shares in Ascent 
Resources plc at net book value. These are included within ‘other listed investments’. The Company also acquired subsidiary undertaking 
NSIP Limited, owner and operator of the Kittiwake to Forties oil export pipeline, as part of the Company’s acquisition of Greater Kittiwake 
Area assets from Centrica. On 16 December 2014, the Company transferred its investment in subsidiary EnQuest Norge Limited to EnQuest 
Global Limited, another subsidiary entity.
Additions during the year ended 31 December 2013 include US$67,805,000 of new shares issued by the Company’s subsidiary EnQuest 
Global Limited which is the holding company of the Group’s entities in Egypt and Malaysia.
On 25 November 2013 and 5 December 2013, the Company’s subsidiary EnQuest North Sea BV distributed, in total, US$176,000,000 of 
share premium through a reduction of the net intercompany receivable from EnQuest PLC. This has been accounted for as a dividend. The 
distribution of share premium in EnQuest North Sea BV resulted in a reduction in the subsidiary’s net assets, which created an impairment 
in the Company’s investment in the subsidiary in the year ended 31 December 2013. During 2014, EnQuest North Sea BV was dissolved and 
therefore the investment previously impaired was written off.
Details of the Company’s subsidiaries at 31 December 2014 are provided in note 29 of the Group financial statements.
The interest in other listed investments at the end of the year is part of the Group’s 11% investment in the ordinary share capital of Ascent 
Resources plc, which is incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales.

Nature and purpose of other reserves
Share premium
The excess contribution over the nominal value on the issuance of shares is accounted for as share premium.
Merger reserve
The Company merger reserve is used to record the difference between the market value of EnQuest shares issued to effect the business 
combinations less the nominal value of the shares issued where merger relief applies to the transaction. The reserve is adjusted for any 
write down in the value of the investment in the subsidiary.
Other reserve
The other reserve is used to record any other transactions taken straight to reserves as non-distributable.
Share-based payments reserve
The reserve for share-based payments is used to record the value of equity-settled share-based payments awards to employees and the 
balance of the shares held by the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust. Transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original 
share awards.
Share-based payment plan information is disclosed in note 19 of the Group financial statements.
12. Transactions with Directors
Details of Directors’ remuneration are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
13. Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8 not to disclose transactions with its wholly owned subsidiaries. There were no 
other related party transactions during the year (2013: nil).
14. Auditor’s remuneration
The Company paid US$10,400 (2013: US$10,400) to its auditor in respect of the audit of the financial statements of the Company.
Fees paid to the Group’s auditor and its associates for non-audit services are not disclosed in the individual accounts of the Company 
because Group financial statements are prepared which are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
15. Post balance sheet events
Refer to note 28 of the Group financial statements.

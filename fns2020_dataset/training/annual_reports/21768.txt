Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Group profit before tax and exceptionals
declined 4% to £263.0 million and earnings per
share fell slightly from 29.3 pence to 28.7 pence.
Nonetheless, Bradford & Bingley has had a
successful year.
Exceptional charges, which were £32.6 million in
2002, fell to zero in 2003.As a result, Group
profit before tax rose 9% to £263.0 million.
Basic earnings per share rose 6.4 pence (25%)
to 32.3 pence. Of this increase, 3.6 pence
arose from the release of a taxation provision
for conversion costs.
The Group balance sheet grew strongly from
£25.4 billion to £32.2 billion, reflecting the
success of our lending business which
increased balances 26% to £25.9 billion.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to propose a final
dividend of 11.0 pence per share for payment
on 7 May 2004 to shareholders on the
register as at 26 March 2004. If approved,
the full year dividend for 2003 would be 
16.5 pence. Future dividends will be balanced
by the capital requirements of our growing
lending book.
Lending
The Group continued the transformation of its
main mortgage Lending business from a
traditional building society mortgage book to a
portfolio of selective residential mortgages and
commercial property lending. Our loan portfolio
grew £5.3 billion in the year, £3.9 billion of the
growth was organic and £1.4 billion came from
“Looking to the future we aim to maintain our
strong position within our chosen lending
markets and to test other areas of specialist
mortgage lending.”
Rod Kent Chairman
Chairman’s statement
mortgage portfolio acquisitions.The main
growth came from the buy-to-let market.This is
a market in which we are a leading player and
one we understand well.We also saw a
significant increase in our Commercial Property
lending portfolio.
Over the last three years our lending strategy,
which has been very successful, has been to
replace high margin traditional mortgage
lending, which was redeeming across the
industry at a fast rate, with a portfolio of
selective secured lending.The margins on
selective lending are lower than those
achieved on the old building society back
book but above margins on new mainstream
mortgage loans.
During this crucial transition period, our net
interest income has remained within a narrow
range. But, given the growth in lending
balances which we achieved this year, and
assuming no abnormal economic
circumstances, we expect our net interest
income will once again grow in 2004,
particularly in the second half.
Looking to the future we intend to maintain our
strong market position within our chosen
lending areas and to test other areas of specialist
mortgage lending.As a Group, we have made
the deliberate decision to transact only secured
lending and not to enter the higher risk,
unsecured personal lending market.This sets us
apart from many of our competitors.
Savings 
Our Savings business performed satisfactorily.
Balances remained stable in a difficult year,
which saw high levels of competition and, for
most of the year, a declining interest rate
environment.The turning point in interest
rates last autumn should help release some of
the margin compression in the business and
we are currently refreshing our product range. 5 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Treasury
Our Treasury team supported the strong growth
in our Lending business by sourcing funds from
UK and international markets to meet the
demands of our growing balance sheet.
Distribution
Our capital intensive Lending business is
complemented by a diverse range of property
and financial services businesses which require
little capital.These related businesses include
Estate Agency, Surveying and the broking of a
wide range of mortgage, investment and
insurance products.
These businesses contribute a small but
important share of our earnings and enhance
the Group’s return on capital. Over the last
three years they have contributed between
4% and 12% of Group profit before tax.
This changing earnings pattern reflects the
volatile dynamics of some of the underlying
markets.We benefit from strong market
positions in many of these businesses which
we plan to exploit in future years.We are the
largest mortgage broker in the UK, the fifth
largest residential estate agent and the third
largest residential surveying firm.
Our Distribution businesses delivered a mixed
performance in 2003. Overall profit contribution
was substantially down. Mortgage broking and
Surveying performed well throughout the year.
Estate Agency was hit by the sudden slow down
in the Spring, but recovered in the second half,
while investment product income was
substantially down throughout the year in line
with the rest of the market.
Regulation
The increase in regulatory activity continues
and we are faced with a significant number of
regulatory changes in the coming year.The
introduction of new regulations in the
mortgage market will have a particular impact.
Increasing regulation and the corresponding
growth in the compensation culture has
become a fact of life in our business and the
Group’s task is to try to anticipate and keep
ahead of the changes.
Whilst we are supportive of proper regulation
in general, it comes at a cost.The additional
expenditure needed for training, new systems
and reviews of past business increased costs in
2003 and will continue to impact the business
in 2004.
Board
Over the year we have made several changes
to the Board. Robert Dickie, Group
Operations Director and Ian Darby, Group
Commercial Director were appointed as
Executive Directors.
Stephen Webster, Ian Cheshire and Louise Patten
joined the Board as Non-executive Directors.
George Cox has taken on the role of Senior
Independent Director.
The Board now consists of myself as 
Non-executive Chairman, five Non-executive
Directors and five Executive Directors.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to
the three Non-executive Directors who retired
during the year.All of them had given many
years of service to the Company. Diana
Courtney (10 years), Mark Smith (9 years) and
Trevor Lewis, the Vice Chairman (13 years), all
played a crucial role in the conversion of
Bradford & Bingley into a FTSE 100 company.
People
Over the last few years the Group has
demutualised, become a plc, entered the FTSE
100 and responded to significant changes in the
markets we serve. Change is now a way of life
and our staff deserve to be congratulated for
their performance, as do the committed senior
management team who have led these changes.
Outlook
Bradford & Bingley starts 2004 with good
momentum across its businesses and a major
programme of regulatory change to manage.
We are expecting a stable property market,
improving savings market and some return in
demand for investment products.The benefits
of growing our selective lending book will
become evident in our 2004 results,
particularly in the second half and beyond.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
The Group continues to follow its primary
strategy of growing secured lending assets
selectively and funding them with a robust
savings business and an increasingly
international wholesale funding operation.We
have also developed two innovative financial
services retailing brands and a strong property
services business which require little capital
but generate valuable fee income.
The transformation of the Group since flotation
is emerging more and more clearly.The specialist
lending book is growing strongly and is now
considerably larger than the old building society
back book. Our Charcol and The MarketPlace
financial services brands are recognised and
respected by consumers and the personal
financial press. Bradford & Bingley is now the
largest mortgage intermediary in the country.
The trading environment in 2003 was mixed:
• advantageous macro-economic conditions
helped the markets for lending and
mortgage broking;
• the housing market suffered during the
second quarter but improved during the
second half;
• consumer appetite for investment products
did not improve despite the recovery in
equity markets;
• after many months of falling interest rates,
markets became more volatile around the
middle of the year and interest rates began
to rise.
In these conditions we traded satisfactorily
and made good progress in the majority of
our businesses.
Lending
Our core Lending business reached a key
milestone in its development with managed
selective residential lending assets at £13.6 billion
(2002: £7.9 billion) exceeding the old building
society residential back book of £7.1 billion
(2002: £8.9 billion) for the first time. Profit
before tax increased by 9% to £228.1 million
(2002: £210.2 million).All of our lending
continues to be secured on property and we do
not make unsecured loans.
Gross new lending increased 70% to £9.9 billion.
The 58% organic growth in new residential
lending of £6.3 billion was complemented by the
acquisition of a series of mortgage portfolios
worth £1.4 billion and a £2.2 billion growth in
our Commercial and Housing Association
lending businesses. Of the £7.7 billion new
residential loans in 2003 (2002: £4.6 billion), 61%
were buy-to-let, (2002: 52%), 33% were other
specialist residential loans (2002: 36%) and 6%
were advances to building society back book
customers (2002: 12%).
The momentum we reported at the interims
has been maintained. In the first half year the
net addition to managed residential balances
was £1.9 billion and commercial balances grew
£0.8 billion. Comparable numbers for the
second half were £2.0 billion and £0.7 billion
respectively. Of the £9.9 billion new loans
during the year 78% were residential and 22%
were commercial, in line with the mix achieved
in 2002.
“Our core lending business reached a key
milestone in its development, with managed
selective residential lending assets exceeding
the old building society residential back book
for the first time.”

In a record year for new lending, our Mortgage Express
business has grown significantly, building on its reputation as a
leading player in the specialist areas of the mortgage market.
Diverse portfolio

Lending provide additional revenue, diversity and growth.
Strong growth
Portfolio acquisitions from GMAC-RFC have further 
added to our lending business and complement our 
strong organic growth. 8 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
The strong lending growth we delivered in 2003
will begin to flow through into profit towards the
end of 2004. Profit growth lags lending growth
for two reasons:
• margins on new selective lending, whilst higher
than those available on vanilla lending, are
lower than those historically achieved on the
back book; and
• most of the cost of origination and new loan
set-up is absorbed in the year in which the
loan is put on the books.
As the size of the declining back book becomes
smaller, relative to the growing selective lending
book, profit momentum will increase.
Over the year, total managed residential
lending balances grew 23% to £20.7 billion
and commercial lending balances grew 40% to
£5.2billion generating a total lending balance
increase of 26% to £25.9 billion.
The total lending book is now 80% residential
(comprising 34% buy-to-let, 27% building society
back book and 19% other specialist residential
mortgages) and 20% Commercial Property and
Housing Association lending.
Our Commercial Property and Housing
Association lending grew 40% during the year to
£5.2 billion. Our Commercial Lending team has
been successful in building relationships with a
number of larger banks and is an active
participant in the commercial property
syndication market. Housing Association lending
also increased, although by a lesser amount,
reflecting the competitive nature of this low risk
segment of the market.
The credit environment in 2003 was benign and
the credit quality of all our books has continued
to be very strong. Provisions on our balance
sheet and in our securitisation vehicles rose 9%
to £60.7 million.This growth is lower than the
growth in the balance sheet for two reasons:
• the continued improvement in loan-to-value
(‘LTV’) ratios as house price inflation raises the
market value of the housing stock against
which we lend; and
• the continued decline in the number and value
of non-performing loans.
LTV ratios on new lending increased to 77%
(2002: 73%).The LTV ratio across the book
was 66% (2002: 61%) and 45% (2002: 43%)
when taking account of house price inflation.
The number of cases in arrears dropped
despite the increase in the volume of lending.
The proportion of cases over three months in
arrears fell to 0.99% of the total book 
(2002: 1.66%).We are well provided against
potential losses and provisions cover has
improved as a proportion of non-performing
loans from 18.6% to 31.5%.
Savings
Savings balances increased slightly to £15.1 billion
(2002: £15.0 billion).We remain a safe home for
customer deposits offering competitive products
and returns. Balances were maintained in a very
aggressive market for new business.
The low interest rate environment that prevailed
for most of the year, compressed margins.The
recent change in the interest rate cycle provides
an opportunity to develop new products and
offer improved returns in the coming year.
Treasury
Our Treasury team capitalised on the declining
interest rates in the first half of 2003, adding
to interest income. Conditions in the second
half did not offer similar opportunities
although the team did position itself well for
the interest rate rises that occurred in the
latter part of the year.
The key task of the Treasury team during the
year was to fund our rapid lending growth.
They have secured a diverse range of funding
from the UK, European, US and Asian capital
markets. During the year they raised around
£4 billion from overseas markets.
They also completed a £250 million issue of
Upper Tier II subordinated debt in April and a
further £200 million in December as we
continued to improve capital efficiency.
Financial services
Overall, financial services revenues fell by just
over 6% to £135.7 million (2002: £144.4
million). Individual sectors of the business
performed quite differently.
The mortgage broking market was buoyant
throughout the year and the continued growth in
remortgaging showed that refinancing to reduce
borrowing costs is becoming a way of life for the
UK consumer. Our mortgage broking related
revenues rose 25% to £70.3 million. By contrast
the market for investment products remained
weak and revenues from the sales of investment
products fell 29% as consumers showed no sign
of responding to the well publicised savings gap.
Equities recovered some lost ground in the
second half, but continued adverse publicity
about mis-selling and the troubles of the
insurance sector were regularly in the headlines
and small and medium sized investors, our main
investment market segment, sat on the sidelines.
We have reduced our wealth advisory force in
response to the weaker market.The total
number of advisers employed by the Group
declined from 1,031 to 960.
We have continued to expand our financial
services retailing businesses and have introduced
a number of new products and services,
including personal loan, credit card and general
insurance broking.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Our new insurance proposition has been well
received by customers and staff alike which
looks set to halt the decline in insurance
revenues.The 18% decline to £21.6 million
(2002: £26.2 million) was largely associated with
the run-off of the building society back book and
its linked insurance portfolio.
We acquired two premium advice businesses
during the year, Holden Meehan, now Charcol
Holden Meehan and Aitchison & Colegrave, now
Charcol Aitchison & Colegrave.These acquisitions
added scale and further skills to our wealth
advice business, strengthening its position in the
mid to high net worth financial planning and
services market for both individual and corporate
customers.The integration is proceeding well and
the businesses have already become valuable
parts of the Bradford & Bingley Group.
Property services
Property services revenues were flat year-on-
year at £114.4 million (2002: £114.6 million).
The Estate Agency business had a year of two
halves while Surveying continued to go from
strength to strength.
There was a substantial reduction in housing
transaction volumes during the Spring which,
coupled with a decline in margins, resulted in a
fall in Estate Agency income in the first half to
£35.5 million (2002: £42.5 million). New
management responded by taking swift
corrective action. Costs were reduced and yield
and volumes were improved with the result that
income for the second half was £41.8 million,
only £0.4 million below the same period in
2002. Estate Agency has entered 2004 in a
stronger position than it entered 2003.
Our Surveying business, SecureMove, has
continued to perform well with revenues up
24% at £37.1 million for the full year.We
acquired the Douglas Duff partnership in
October. SecureMove is now one of the UK’s
largest survey businesses with over 275
professionals complemented by a network of
contract surveyors who offer flexibility to
respond to peaks and troughs in demand.
Market outlook
The lending market remains strong.As we enter
2004 we expect remortgaging will continue to
be a major factor in the market. Equity release
will gather momentum as a part of long-term
financial planning.
We expect house prices to continue to rise,
but at a much slower rate than in recent
years. It is likely there will be a modest
reduction in the total number of housing
transactions as interest rates begin to rise and
the shortage of properties coming on to the
market continues. Prospective first time buyers
will remain challenged by the price of starter
houses, providing continued support for the
lettings market.
We anticipate the beginnings of an improvement
in investment product sales as confidence in the
stock market improves, and growing awareness
of the savings gap should encourage consumers
to invest more for retirement.
Business outlook
We expect the overall environment for our
businesses to remain relatively benign in 2004.
Interest rates are still low and the employment
market is strong and stable. Provided these
economic conditions continue, we do not expect
any dramatic changes in market conditions.
Given the strength of our lending pipeline, we
start the year confident that we will deliver
continued growth in our lending balances in
2004. However, we remain cautious lenders and
do not plan to participate in the unsecured
lending market.
Estate Agency started 2004 with better
pipelines and margins than in 2003 and the
Surveying business will benefit from the
acquisitions made last year.
Our financial services businesses remain focused
on improving their customer proposition and
their margins. However, the regulatory change
agenda will be particularly demanding in 2004.
We face new or significantly changed regulation
in mortgage lending, mortgage broking and
insurance, coupled with the forthcoming
introduction of new accounting standards and
capital adequacy requirements. Many of the new
regulations will improve market conditions but
their introduction absorbs considerable amounts
of money and management time.We expect
these costs will be largely offset by the
programme of operational process
improvements that is currently underway.
Overall, we move into 2004 confident that our
business model works and will deliver increasing
value to our shareholders.

Costs increased from £446.3 million to
£468.6 million.This is due in part to the
absorption of the new acquisitions made in
the investment businesses Charcol Holden
Meehan and Charcol Aitchison & Colegrave
that will contribute to investment income in
future years. Furthermore, increasing costs
associated with dealing with regulatory
requirements for both current and previous
product sales are becoming more significant.
Set against this, Bradford & Bingley has
continued to drive down costs by improving
efficiency in our operational support areas.
Summary
Group profit before tax and exceptional costs fell
in 2003 to £263.0 million from £273.2 million in
a year with good performance in our Lending
business but difficult market conditions impacted
some other parts of the Group. No exceptional
costs were incurred and profit before tax
increased by 9% to £263.0 million from 
£240.6 million.A small fall in interest income was
more than recovered by increasing non-interest
income, resulting in a total income increase of
£9.9 million. Costs increased by 5% to 
£468.6 million and the provision charge remained
low.The Group’s profit after tax increased
substantially, benefiting from a £22.9 million 
one-off tax credit. Basic earnings per share
increased to 32.3 pence and return on equity
after exceptionals rose from 14.0% to 16.7%.
Net interest income fell by 1% in 2003. Strong
growth in selective lending increased income and
places the Group in a strong position for the
future. However, we still saw significant decreases
in income due to attrition in the former building
society mortgage book which, in combination
with the impact of lower interest rates on
Savings and Treasury & Reserves interest income,
reduced this positive impact and resulted in net
interest income of £435.6 million.
Non-interest income grew by 5% to 
£302.6 million during 2003.The strong 
growth in mortgage broking income has 
been encouraging and, coupled with this,
our Surveying business has developed well.
Meanwhile, investment markets have remained
depressed and income has been correspondingly
disappointing. Estate Agency had a mixed year
but recovered from a poor first half year in the
later stages of 2003. Non-interest income also
included a net gain from the sale and leaseback
of a small number of properties. 13 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Our Lending business has grown strongly in
2003.This growth is based upon a cautious
approach to the balance of risks and rewards
associated with mortgage lending.We continue
to be conservative and do not write unsecured
personal loans, or offer credit cards, on our
own balance sheet.All our loans are backed by
the security of property, the vast majority of
which are homes.The economic environment
has remained benign with low interest rates,
low unemployment and increasing house prices.
This combination of factors and our continuing
prudent approach means our provisions have
increased by £5.0 million to £60.7 million and
the profit and loss charge of £6.6 million is
broadly similar to the previous year.
As part of our capital management
programme the Group issued £150 million
Tier I capital in May 2002 and the cost of 
this capital is included as minority interest 
(non-equity) in the Profit and Loss Account.
This cost increased to £9.7 million in 2003
reflecting the full year amount compared to
only seven months in 2002.
No exceptional costs were incurred during
2003. Furthermore, having reached agreement
with the Inland Revenue, we have been able to
release provisions against potential tax costs
associated with the conversion from a building
society in 2000.This £22.9 million release
results in an unusually low tax charge of 18.7%.
Excluding the impact of the one-off tax credit,
profits after tax increased to £190.8 million,
enabling earnings per share to increase to 
28.7 pence from 25.9 pence. After the benefit
of the exceptional tax credit, earnings
increased by 19% to £204.0 million and
earnings per share by 25% to 32.3 pence.
Net interest income
The considerable growth in our specialist
Lending business generated an increase in total
balances and corresponding improvement in
income in that part of the business. However,
the former building society mortgage balances
continue to decline and the loss of these
balances has reduced the positive impact of
the new lending. Furthermore, the continued
low interest rates have restricted margins in
the Savings business and reduced earnings on
the Group’s reserves.

The success of the selective Lending business
has generated an increase in interest earning
assets of £4.3 billion, with this strong growth
more than compensating for redemptions
against the back book.The total yield on these
assets declined as a result of the fall in general
interest rates and the costs of the incentives
associated with newer loans.
The costs of interest-bearing liabilities also fell
as market rates dipped.A shift in the mix
towards wholesale funding has increased the
relative cost of financing for the Group, as
would be expected when we continue to grow
so successfully.A small decline in the margin on
interest-free liabilities from 0.20% to 0.16% is
the result of the lower base and inter-bank rate
environment we experienced in 2003.
Non-interest income
Non-interest income increased by 5% to over
£300 million in 2003. Strong performance in
mortgage broking income and lending related
fee income were the main drivers of this
growth. In a mixed year, although property
revenues were flat, the continued success of
our Surveying business compensated for the
decline in Estate Agency revenue. It was
difficult to attract new investment business in
the face of uncertain equity prospects and
general insurance income also reduced.

Mortgage broking revenues grew strongly by

Investment related business continues to
disappoint.A fall in income to £43.8 million
reflects the continuing reluctance of customers
to invest in equity based products despite a
general improvement in 2003 after the poor
performance of these markets in previous years.
General Insurance income was also down.The
main reason for this decline was the number of
redemptions of mortgages from the former
building society book that had linked buildings
and contents insurance policies. Group Finance Director’s review

for the year ended 31 December 2003
Lending related income increased strongly.This
reflects a very positive year of new lending in
our specialist businesses with arrangement
fees from both new mortgage and
commercial lending reaching record levels.
This income includes the net income from 
our securitisation vehicles.
Other non-interest income benefited from the
sale and leaseback of 13 high street properties
at auction realising a net gain of £8.1 million.
Administrative expenses
Total expenses increased during 2003 by 5%.
The Group continues to focus on ensuring
that the operational support to the Lending
and Distribution businesses is managed
efficiently. Group Operations functions have
been reviewed and reorganised during the last
year. Significant improvements in the unit costs
in these areas have been achieved without the
need to charge any exceptional costs.

Staff costs increased by 4% to £246.1 million.
Our staff are the mainstay of the business and
the increase in costs reflects investment in a
number of areas.We have absorbed the costs
of AMS Ltd, our mortgage processing business,
after our US partner exited the joint venture
at the end of 2002.We have purchased two
new businesses, Holden Meehan and Aitchison
& Colegrave to strengthen our offering in the
investment markets.
Premises costs increased to £34.4 million
following increased rental costs resulting from
transactions undertaken to transfer long-term
ownership of a number of properties into the
leasehold sector. Going forward this provides
greater flexibility and reduces the risks and costs
of under-utilised property.
Marketing costs remained stable and support
to our Mortgage Express,The MarketPlace and
Charcol brands has been rewarded by their
success.These brands continue to win industry
and consumer awards across all channels,
reflecting the strength of our propositions.
Other operating expenses increased by 12%.
Underlying improvements in information
technology support have been achieved
through our outsourced arrangements with
IBM and BT. However, increasing costs in
support of regulatory review and change have
more than offset these improvements.
We are also investing in readiness for the
impacts of the substantial number of new
reporting and compliance rules that face our
industry.These changes impact right across our
business.There are new requirements for the
processes applied to the sale of mortgages
under the Financial Services Authority (‘FSA’)
consultation papers CP 186, 197 and 198.
Reporting to the FSA will change substantively
as the Basel II framework is implemented.
Whilst this will not be applied immediately,
investment in new data analysis and credit
scoring processes is ongoing.
The standards applicable to the reporting of
company accounting and financial information
are also undergoing a radical overhaul. From
2005, International Financial Reporting
Standards will govern financial reporting for all
publicly quoted companies. Bradford & Bingley
has established a project to identify, analyse
and prepare for the reporting changes that
these new standards will require.This project
team has developed detailed plans and is on
track to ensure the required changes to
accounting practices, systems and processes
are implemented.
The general objectives of the increasing
regulatory agenda are to promote ease of
access and choice of financial products, and to
promote better comparability and understanding
of financial information amongst investors and
other stakeholders.Whilst the Group fully
supports these objectives, it is important to note
that these activities are not without cost.
Bad debt provision
To provide for bad debts an additional 
£6.6 million (2002: £6.2 million) has been
charged to the Profit and Loss Account during
2003.This level of charge demonstrates our
conservative approach to lending and
provisioning.We make no unsecured loans to
customers, ensuring bad debt costs remain low.
Total provisions on the Balance Sheet have
increased.The amount we have set aside to
provide against losses in our residential
mortgages, securitised mortgages and
commercial loan portfolios totals £60.7 million
(0.23% of the total managed lending assets).
The amount of specific provision against loans,
where there is evidence that credit conditions
on those individual loans has deteriorated,
decreased to £5.5 million and is principally
driven by continuing favourable economic
conditions. General provisions against the
statistical likelihood of losses across all our
portfolios have declined, relative to loan
balances.The low level of provisions is the
result of our lending policies and the
conditions in the markets in which we
operate.These environmental conditions
remain benign. 15 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Taxation
The 2003 tax charge equated to an effective
rate of 18.7% (2002: 26.3%).The underlying
tax charge is a consequence of the nature and
structure of the earnings of the business and
compliance with current and previous tax law.
The effective rate compared to the standard
rate of corporation tax is explained as follows:
Corporation tax
%
Standard corporation tax rate 30.0
Amortisation & expenses disallowed 3.1
for tax purposes
Exceptional tax credit (8.7)
Lower rate on overseas earnings (1.0)
Adjustments in respect of (4.7)
previous periods
Tax on minority interests (non-equity) (1.1)
Effect of timing differences (2.2)
Current tax rate 15.4
Deferred tax 3.3
Total effective tax rate 18.7
During 2003 the Group concluded discussions
with the Inland Revenue on the tax treatment
of the costs associated with the programme
to convert Bradford & Bingley from a building
society to a public limited company that took
place in 2000. As a result, we are now able to
release a provision of some £22.9 million.
Dividends
A final dividend of 11.0 pence per 
share has been proposed for payment 
on 7 May 2004 which, together with the 
interim dividend of 5.5 pence per share,
gives a total dividend for the year of 
16.5 pence per share (2002: 14.8 pence 
per share).This dividend reflects the Board’s
desire to ensure that the dividends paid each
year balance the combined objectives of
providing a growing return to shareholders
with the need to invest the earnings of the
Group to finance future balance sheet growth.
Business segment performance

Lending profits increased strongly to 
£228.1 million, a 9% improvement.This

These figures include £1.4 billion of loans
acquired from GMAC-RFC (£650 million

Association lending of £2.2 billion.
Residential mortgage redemptions were 
£3.8 billion and the redemption rate of

book of 25% is similar to that in the general
market.Total residential loan balances increased
by 23% to £20.7 billion and total managed
lending assets by 26% to £25.9 billion.
Net interest income increased during 2003 to
£257.6 million as income from new specialist
mortgages and commercial property loans
outstripped the effect of the declining building
society book.The net interest margin in Lending
reduced to 1.17% as a result of the increasing
proportion of newer loans on the Balance
Sheet. Spreads on new specialist lending held up
well, reflecting our strong origination and
product development capability.

Management expenses in Lending increased to
£59.9 million from £53.9 million in a year when
new business activity continued a trend of rapid
increase.The improvements in the operations and
support processes in our Lending business are
demonstrated by a significant improvement in the
cost/assets under management ratio to 0.23%
from 0.26%.The cost to income ratio was 20.3%
(2002: 19.8%).The mix of new lending reflects
our commitment to developing the business
within niche sectors of the market that provide
attractive rewards compared to their risks.The
largest segment of our new loans was again in
the buy-to-let market and accounted for 47% of
new loans and now makes up 34% of total loan
balances.The arrears and repossession
experience in our buy-to-let book is significantly
better than the residential mortgage market as a
whole.Arrears of three months or more are just
0.25% of the book compared to the UK average
for buy-to-let loans of 0.45% and a total
mortgage market equivalent figure of 0.75%.
Mortgage Express has been a key player in the
development of the retail investment property
market in the UK and this long experience
enables us to maintain healthy margins whilst
minimising bad debts.We have experienced just
30 repossession cases in the buy-to-let portfolio
since its launch in 1996.
Gross lending (£bn)
other residential buy-to-let commercial 
Another market in which Bradford & Bingley
has developed a strong position is in
mortgages to customers who self-certify their
income. New lending in this category made
up 16% of advances in 2003 and accounts for
8% of the total loan balances. Income is just
one of many underwriting criteria used to
assess the credit status of a potential
borrower.Typically, this type of mortgage is
suitable for self-employed borrowers, or
people who earn commission based income.
Our loans in this segment are scrutinised
robustly, and all credit criteria are reviewed
before loans are sanctioned. Bad debts are
low and just 0.99% of cases are three or more
months in arrears.
Our Commercial Property lending business
performed strongly in 2003. New loans 
were £1.9 billion and balances increased to
£3.4 billion. Our Commercial Property team
has been active in building relationships 
with a number of larger banks, consequently
becoming an increasing participant in a
number of loan syndications. Housing
Association lending also increased.This 
low-risk segment of the market is extremely
competitive and opportunities to lend at
attractive margins are correspondingly difficult.
Together, Commercial Property and Housing
Association accounted for 22% of new lending
and now comprise 20% of total loan balances.
Residential arrears
As a result of our careful approach to
underwriting, and reflecting stable economic
conditions with low interest rates, low,
unemployment and high house price growth,
overall arrears and bad debts have been low.
The number of cases in possession was 67, a
reduction from the previous year,
notwithstanding the significant increase 
in balances.

The strong credit performance has enabled a
reduction in provisions relative to total

Savings
Savings income declined in 2003 by £5.7 million
to £114.2 million.The prevailing low interest rate
environment and an ongoing migration to higher
rate, lower margin investment products reduced
margins on these balances.This shift in balances
from convenience to longer-term value products
such as fixed rate and term accounts has led to
a decline in margins to 0.85% from 0.90%.

Treasury and Reserves
Treasury and Reserves income fell in 2003,
particularly in the second half of the year as

investments fell.

Income from mortgage broking continued its
strong growth, increasing by 25% to £70.3 million,
consolidating the strength of this now well
established segment of our business. Bradford &
Bingley is the largest mortgage broker in the UK
and operates under two well known brands.The
strength of these brands,The MarketPlace and
Charcol, reflects the recognition by the customer
of the value of trusted advice and choice.
Bradford & Bingley remains the largest national
high street presence offering this proposition 
to consumers.
Revenue from the sale of investment products
fell to £43.8 million and this part of the business
is the most affected by the changes to the
regulation of the financial services market.
However, we are clear that there remains an
ongoing need for consumers to invest for the
future and close the well acknowledged savings
gap. During 2003 we purchased two businesses
specialising in providing investment and
retirement planning advice, Charcol Holden
Meehan and Charcol Aitchison & Colegrave.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Overall, we have reduced the number of
advisers providing investment services and
switched some to focus on the provision of
mortgage broking, reflecting the evolving nature
of these markets.
General Insurance sales also fell, down 
£4.6 million to £21.6 million.This income
stream has been particularly affected by the
reduction in the size of the former building
society mortgage portfolio as these
mortgages were often sold with linked
insurance.This practice is no longer common
and we are pleased that during the latter half
of 2003 our general insurance proposition has
been re-launched. Early signs for this improved
service are encouraging.
The income from property services remains
constant at £114.4 million. Underlying this is a
reduction in Estate Agency revenues in a year
that was definitively one of two halves, and a
rise in income from our substantial Surveying
business. Estate Agency suffered the effects of
a stagnant period in the Spring. During this
period, house sales both across the market
and for Bradford & Bingley Estate Agents fell
sharply. However, we are pleased to report
that during the second half we improved both
sales and margins in this business to deliver
much improved performance. Overall, income
from Estate Agency fell reflecting lower sales,
although this fall was somewhat mitigated by
higher income per exchange resulting from
improved margins and increased house prices.
The Surveying business has continued to
strengthen with the development of the
SecureMove branded service and the acquisition
of Douglas Duff, a small surveying business based
in the south east of England. Income from
Surveying increased by 24% to £37.1 million.
Distribution costs increased year-on-year, in
part due to the acquisitions noted previously.
In addition, substantial investment was made in
ensuring that our selling practices and
procedures were fully compliant with the
requirements of the regulator.Total costs were
£239.8 million and we continued to invest in
our distribution brands. Further work to
improve the management and support to the
sales teams has been ongoing in 2003 and this
positions us favourably for the coming year.

Balance Sheet
The Group’s total assets have increased by
27% to £32.2 billion during 2003.This increase
is driven by the success of our lending strategy
which has generated substantial growth in
both specialist residential and commercial
assets. Liquidity increased and it is managed to
provide a stable source of cash flow to the
Balance Sheet at an acceptable level of return.
The Balance Sheet growth has been funded
through wider access to wholesale markets
that have remained both deeper and more
cost effective than the equivalent retail deposit
markets.The main source of these funds has
been our Euro medium term programme, but
funds have also been raised in other markets
around the world.

Capital structure
During 2003 Bradford & Bingley completed a
share repurchase programme, which
commenced in 2002 with the aim of buying
£150.0 million worth of the Group’s equity.
This repurchase programme was undertaken
to re-balance the Group’s capital away from
equity in order to improve efficiency. In total,
47.9 million shares were purchased and have
been cancelled.
In addition to reducing the amount of equity
capital, the Group has increased total capital,
raising £450 million in two separate
subordinated debt issues; £250 million in April,
and £200 million in December. Both issues
were well received by the market and were
fully subscribed.

As a result of these actions, and the addition of
the current year’s retained profits, total capital
increased to £2.3 billion. Our flourishing lending
business generated an addition to risk weighted
assets of £14.1 billion, bringing the total to
£16.9 billion. Consequently, the total capital ratio
of the Group as at December 2003 was 13.7%
and the Tier I ratio was 7.6%, well within our
target ratios.
This ongoing programme ensures the Group’s
capital is efficiently managed and provides a
stable platform to finance the growth of the
business. As part of this activity we have an
active schedule of work aimed at preparing us
for the changes anticipated from the responses
of the European Union and the FSA to the
proposed Basel II capital adequacy framework. 20 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Risk management and control
In the ordinary course of business, the Group
is exposed to, and manages a variety of risks,
with operational, credit, market and liquidity
risk being of particular significance.The
management of risk is fundamental to the
Group, with the Board having responsibility for
the overall system of internal control and for
reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board has delegated specific risk
monitoring and control responsibilities to the
Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee, the
Group Risk Committee and the Asset &
Liability Management Committee (‘ALCO’).
Each business area within the Group is
responsible for the identification and assessment
of their particular risk exposures, and
implementing risk management policies, limits
and procedures as approved by the Board.
The key areas of risk the Group faces are
discussed below.
Operational Risk
Operational risk is defined as the potential risk
of financial loss or impairment to reputation
resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes and systems, from the actions of
people or from external events.The Group’s
business units manage this risk through
appropriate controls and loss mitigation
actions, including insurance.These actions
include a balance of policies, appropriate
procedures and internal controls to ensure
compliance with laws and regulations. In
addition, specialist support functions provide
expertise in operational risk areas such as
information security, financial services
compliance, fraud management, security and
business continuity management.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is defined as the potential of
financial loss if counterparties (borrowers) are
not able to meet their obligations as they fall
due.The Group is firmly committed to the
management of this risk in both its lending
and wholesale money market activities. In its
core lending activities, the Group employs
sophisticated credit scoring, underwriting and
fraud detection techniques that support
sound credit decision making and work to
minimise losses. A proactive approach to the
identification and control of bad and doubtful
debts is maintained in the Credit Risk
Management and Credit Control areas.
Lending policies and limits are reviewed and
approved annually by the Board, with the
attendant credit risk processes defined and
managed centrally.The Group Risk Committee
ensures that any exposure to credit risk,
significant changes in policy, or expansion into
new areas of business remain within overall
risk exposure levels as agreed by the Board.
Authorised credit risk limits for wholesale
money market counterparties reflect the size,
depth and quality of a counterparty’s capital
base and, where published, credit ratings
assigned by the major credit rating agencies.
The policies and limits covering treasury
counterparty credit risk exposure are
reviewed and approved annually by the Board.
Market Risk
Market risk is defined as the potential adverse
change in Group income or Group net worth
arising from movements in interest rates,
exchange rates or other market prices. Market
risk exists to some extent in all of the Group’s
businesses. Effective identification and
management of market risk is essential for
maintaining stable net interest income.
Interest rate risk is the most significant form of
market risk to which the Group is exposed. It
arises from mismatches between the re-pricing
dates of the interest-bearing assets and
liabilities on the Group’s Balance Sheet, and
from the investment profile of the Group’s free
reserves.Treasury is responsible for managing
this exposure within the market risk exposure
limits set out in the Group’s policies.
The Group’s exposure to market risk is
governed by the Balance Sheet Management
policy as approved the Board.This policy sets
out the nature of the market risks that may be
taken along with aggregate risk limits, and
stipulates the procedures, instruments and
controls to be used in managing market risk.
The Board has delegated responsibility for
managing the Group’s exposure to market risk
to the ALCO. It is the ALCO’s responsibility to
approve strategies for managing market risk
exposures and ensuring that Treasury
implements the strategies so that the
exposures are managed within the Group’s
approved policy limits.The ALCO meets at
least monthly and reviews reports and other
analyses showing the Group’s exposure to
market risk.
Group Finance Director’s review 21 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group raises and invests funds in
currencies other than sterling. Accordingly,
foreign exchange risk arises from activities
related to the Group managing borrowing
costs and investment returns. As with interest
rate risk,Treasury is responsible for managing
this exposure within the limits as set out in
the Group’s policies.
Foreign exchange risk is managed primarily
through the use of currency swaps and forward
foreign exchange contracts. It can be also
managed, when appropriate, by foreign currency
denominated liabilities being matched with assets
denominated in the same foreign currency.
Liquidity Risk
It is Group policy to ensure that funds are
available at all times to meet the Group’s
obligations, including the withdrawal of
customer deposits, the draw-down of customer
facilities and growth in the Balance Sheet.The
development and implementation of liquidity
policy is the responsibility of the ALCO.
The day-to-day management of liquidity is the
responsibility of Treasury, which provides
funding to, and takes surplus funds from, each
of the Group’s businesses as required. Liquidity
policy is approved by the Board and agreed
within a framework established by the
Financial Services Authority. Regulatory
guidelines and potential outflows of funds
drive the scope and nature of the Group’s
holdings of readily realisable liquid assets.
Derivatives
The Board, through the Balance Sheet
Management policy, has authorised the use of
certain derivative instruments for the
purposes of supporting the strategies and
operational business activities of the Group,
and for managing the risk of loss arising from
adverse changes in interest rates and foreign
exchange rates.
Detailed disclosures on interest rate risk,
foreign exchange risk, and the use of
derivatives are set out in Note 31 to the
Financial Statements in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard No. 13,
Derivatives and other Financial Instruments.

Annual Report & Accounts

Corporate governance
The Directors confirm that for the year ended
31 December 2003 the Company complied
with the provisions of the Combined Code
(the ‘Code’) as issued by the UK Listing
Authority in June 1998.The Code contains
both general principles of good governance
and detailed requirements.This Corporate
Governance Report coupled with the
Directors’ Remuneration Report, explains how
the Company has applied the governance
principles set out in the Code.
The new Combined Code, arising out of the
Higgs review of the role and effectiveness of
Non-executive Directors and a review of Audit
Committees led by Sir Robert Smith, came into
effect during 2003 for reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 November 2003.The
Directors will be reporting on compliance with
the new Code in the Annual Report &
Accounts for 2004. However, as evidenced by
the commentary below, the Company is
already compliant in most areas and, in the few
areas where it is not, work is underway to put
appropriate structures in place.
The Board
The Directors apply principles of good
governance by adopting the following
procedures and policies:
• The Board meets a minimum of eleven
times per year.This includes one meeting
devoted entirely to strategic matters.
• The roles of Chairman and Group Chief
Executive are distinct and the offices are
held by different people - Rod Kent and
Christopher Rodrigues respectively.
• The Board consists of a Non-executive
Chairman, five independent Non-executive
Directors and five Executive Directors.The
five Non-executive Directors bring wide
experience from varied backgrounds to the
workings of the Board.
• The recognised Senior Independent Director
is George Cox, who took over this role on
the retirement from the Board of Trevor
Lewis on 31 December 2003.
•The purpose of the Board is to govern the
Group’s strategic direction, supervise its
operational management and define and
monitor acceptable risk parameters for the
Group.The Board has adopted a structure of
mandates, granted to individuals and
committees throughout the Group, whilst
retaining specified matters for its exclusive
decision.The specified matters include the
approval of interim and final financial
statements, the approval of recommendations
in connection with the payment of dividends,
approval of corporate governance
arrangements, the approval of the Group’s
strategic direction and the approval of various
policies to be adopted by the Group.The
mandate structure enables authorised
individuals to approve levels of expenditure
and commit to contracts or other agreements
in the normal course of business.
• The Board reviews its constitution at
appropriate intervals and each Director is
subject to re-appointment every three years
in accordance with the Articles of Association.
• For new Directors an appropriate training
programme is established to ensure that
they are fully conversant with their
responsibilities as a Director and with the
business of the Group.Throughout their
period in office all Directors are updated on
Group business, the competitive and
regulatory environment in which it operates
and other changes as they occur.
• All Directors have access to the advice and
services of the Company Secretary, who is
responsible for ensuring that Board
procedures and applicable rules and
regulations are observed.The Directors are
able to take independent professional advice
at the Company’s expense.
Principal Board committees
The Directors manage the Group through
Board meetings and a number of committees,
each of which has detailed terms of reference.
The three principal Board committees
are the Audit, Risk & Compliance, Remuneration
and Nominations Committees.The Audit, Risk &
Compliance and the Remuneration Committees
comprise only independent Non-executive
Directors.The terms of reference of these
committees are available on request to the
Registered Office and by visiting the Investor
Relations section of www.bbg.co.uk
The role of the Audit, Risk & Compliance
Committee is to monitor the effectiveness of the
Group’s risk management process and its financial
and other internal control systems, including
effective internal audit, risk management and
compliance functions.The committee also
reviews the Group’s accounting policies, financial
statements and external reporting responsibilities.
Its role extends to meeting the external auditors
and receiving all reports by them addressed to
the Group and to undertaking corporate
governance and other duties as required under
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and
applicable regulation made under it.
Bradford & Bingley is committed to high standards
of corporate governance in its business. 28 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Corporate governance
The Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee also
considers issues concerning auditors including
any risk of conflict of interest.The Group
recognises the importance of internal and
external auditor independence and has
adopted principles to safeguard this, as follows:
• the Group will continue, where appropriate, to
use the external auditors for non-audit work;
• the Group recognises the need for
transparency around the services 
being provided and for a central
independent overview;
• there is appropriate approval for non-audit
work to ensure the auditors’ independence
is not compromised; and
• the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee
monitors audit and non-audit fees paid.
The members of the committee, chaired by
Stephen Webster, are Ian Cheshire and
Nicholas Cosh.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the
remuneration policy for the Group and
contractual arrangements of the Executive
Directors (and from 2004 onwards the
Chairman’s remuneration), and also the
operation of share plans and options schemes

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s
system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness.The system of internal control is
designed to ensure effective and efficient
operations and compliance with relevant laws
and regulations. Such a system can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss, as it is
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the
risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
Throughout the year ended 31 December
2003 the Group has operated a system of
internal control, which includes an ongoing risk
management process for identifying, evaluating
and managing the significant risks faced by the
Group. During the year the Board has
continued to review and, where necessary,
update the risk management process and the
policies and procedures by which these
significant risks are managed.The Board has
also performed its annual assessment of the
effectiveness of internal controls.
Changes in financial regulation continue within
the industry, and the Group’s risk management
processes are designed to operate to ensure
that the Group responds appropriately both to
actual and proposed regulatory changes.
The Group’s management operate a risk
management process, producing a Group-wide
risk profile that identifies the Group’s significant
risks, the probability of those risks occurring and
their impact should they occur, and has the
prime responsibility for the design and
operation of suitable controls and mitigating
actions.The risk management process is
complemented by a formalised reporting and
escalation process for control issues. Internal
audit has a key role in maintaining the control
environment by providing independent
assurance on the effectiveness of the Group’s
internal control systems.The Group Risk
Committee oversees the risk management
process, considers the Group-wide risk profile
on a monthly basis and receives monitoring
reports to update them on progress. Further
information on risk management and control is
set out on pages 20 to 21.
The Group is committed to developing and
maintaining an appropriate risk management
culture in all areas.This is achieved through an
organisational structure with clear reporting
lines and governed by appropriate business
monitoring mechanisms, codes of conduct and
policy statements.
The Board reviews the effectiveness of the
system of internal control.The system has been
in place throughout 2003 and up to the date of
approval of the Annual Report & Accounts. It
accords with the Turnbull Committee guidance.
In reviewing the effectiveness of the system of
internal control the Board takes into account
the work of the Audit, Risk & Compliance
Committee, which receives reports from the
Group Risk Committee on the Group’s
significant risks and how these are being
managed with any significant risk issues referred
to the Board for consideration. It also considers
reports from internal audit, external audit,
compliance and management on the system of
internal control, adherence to regulatory
requirements, any material control weaknesses,
and actions taken to address problem areas
identified.The Chairman of the Audit, Risk &
Compliance Committee reports on the
outcome of each meeting to the Board, where
appropriate, and the Board also receives
minutes of these Committee meetings.
Going concern
The Directors confirm they are satisfied that
the Company has sufficient resources
to continue in operation for the foreseeable
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the
Financial Statements. 30 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Corporate social responsibility report
This year, as well as providing this summary in
the main Annual Report & Accounts, Bradford
& Bingley Group is publishing its first separate
Corporate Social Responsibility (‘CSR’) Report
to explore in more depth our CSR programme.
This report is available from our website,
www.bbg.co.uk or by request to
csr@bbg.co.uk Alternatively, please write to
the CSR Department, Bradford & Bingley plc,
134b New Street, Birmingham B2 4NP to
request a printed copy.
Bradford & Bingley’s approach to CSR involves
conducting our business in a socially
responsible manner in respect of the
environment, our staff, our customers, our
shareholders and local communities.
This summary of our CSR programme follows
the FORGE Group framework for CSR
management and reporting for the Financial
Services sector.The FORGE Group is a
consortium of financial institutions and
involves the British Bankers’ Association and
the Association of British Insurers.The
guidelines are supported by the Department
of Trade & Industry.The framework is divided
into the four major themes identified as being
those most relevant to financial services
organisations – Marketplace,Workplace,
Community and Environment.
To facilitate our programme we are a national
member of Business in the Community, and
the London Benchmarking Group.
In 2003 we participated in the first
Corporate Responsibility Index run by
Business in the Community.We continue to
be a member of the FTSE4Good Index of
socially responsible companies.
Ian Darby, Group Commercial Director is the
Executive Director responsible for overseeing
our CSR activities.
Doing the right thing in the marketplace
Our philosophy for doing business is simple –
finding what is best for the customer, is best
for us.
Bradford & Bingley provides independent
financial advice on more high streets than
anyone else, with over 950 independent
financial advisers in our branches across the
UK. Our advisers have access to a choice of
products from a wide range of providers, so
customers can be offered independent advice
on products which are suited to their needs.
Whilst the Group has many years experience
in the field of independent advice, the
acquisition of Holden Meehan Ltd in 2003,
now Charcol Holden Meehan, brought the
Group a high level of expertise in the field of
Socially Responsible Investment.
Now in its ninth edition, Charcol Holden
Meehan’s Guide to Socially Responsible
Investment was first published in 1989.The
latest edition can be ordered online at
www.charcolhm.co.uk In terms of the value of
investments in the ethical market, Charcol
Holden Meehan is the leading IFA.
Our Housing Finance teams have continued to
lend to Housing Associations, enabling the
regeneration of housing stock across the UK.
We have provided loans to over 130 housing
associations and now finance over 90,000
rented homes throughout the UK.
We provide customers with literature in
alternative formats, such as braille, audio and
large print and, in conjunction with Royal
National Institute for the Deaf (‘RNID’), we
provide sign language and manual interpreting
services.We also offer Typetalk services
through our partnership with RNID.
Doing the right thing in the workplace
Bradford & Bingley is committed to ensuring the
workplace is a safe, diverse and fair environment
to work in.We strive for equality across all
aspects of working life and, as we recognise the
importance of sharing best practice and success,
we are members of Opportunity Now and
Race for Opportunity. Both these organisations
seek to promote gender and race equality
within the workplace.
We recognise and accept our duty to protect
the health and safety of all staff, contractors
and temporary workers, as well as any
members of the public who might be affected
by our operations.
Robert Dickie, Group Operations Director, is
the Board Director responsible for championing
good health and safety practices throughout the
Group. Health and Safety is managed through a
new Human Risk programme. Details of the
new approach to human risk have been
communicated to all executives and training 
has been provided to their nominated line 
co-ordinators, who assist them in meeting 
their health and safety responsibilities.
Bradford & Bingley has continued to
recognise the advantages of employing a
diverse workforce.
We are committed to conducting our business
in a socially responsible manner. 31 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Women occupy 36% of management roles
and 19% of senior management roles within
the Group and Bradford & Bingley has two
female Directors on the Board. Ethnic
minorities make up 13% of our workforce,
and we continue to hold community
awareness training programmes for
management within the Group.
Our employment practices continue to reflect
the human rights standards enshrined in the
United Nations Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the International Labour
Organisation Conventions, and cover such
items as minimum working age, working
hours, health & safety and discrimination.
Staff benefit from the Group’s success through
share schemes. In 2003, Bradford & Bingley
offered another opportunity to join the
Sharesave scheme and 3,500 (52%) staff have
chosen to participate, enabling staff to save to
buy shares in the Company.
Feedback from staff is encouraged and
valued.We carry out an annual survey of all
staff. In 2003 we have also increased the
profile of our online staff feedback
programme which guarantees a reply to staff
within two working days.
Doing the right thing in the community
Bradford & Bingley’s community programme
invested over £1 million for the fourth
consecutive year, and for the second year
running we were ranked in the top half of 
the FTSE 100 by the Guardian Giving List
(2003: 47th, 2002: 45th). In 2003, we reviewed
the areas of community investment we
support, and we have taken the decision to
focus our support on two areas: preventing
and alleviating the causes of homelessness and
employee involvement in the community.
Preventing and alleviating the causes of
homelessness
2003 saw a strengthening of the relationship
between Bradford & Bingley and Shelter, the
UK campaigning charity for homeless and
badly housed people. Shelter is a national
organisation with local solutions working to
improve lives.They provide free, professional
and independent advice to over 100,000
people each year, an ethos which Bradford &
Bingley heartily endorses.
Bradford & Bingley is now the largest
corporate supporter of Shelter, through the
sponsorship of Shelterline, the 24 hour
freephone housing advice helpline.
Employee Involvement
A major strand of our community programme
is to involve our staff in the communities in
which we live and work.
We support staff fundraising by matching the
first £200 of funds raised per employee, and
in 2003, 124 staff received matching of
£24,770, an increase of 20% on 2002.
Bradford & Bingley also matches staff donations
through our payroll giving programme, Give As
Y ou Earn. In 2003 we teamed up with
Ease2Give to offer an online solution which has
increased take up of the Give As Y ou Earn
programme to 8.5% of the workforce, giving an
additional £85,323 to charities through the
company matching scheme.
Our flagship employee involvement
programme for 2003 was teaming up with
Shelter to enter a team of 70 runners in the
London Marathon. Shelter was the official
charity of the London Marathon, and Bradford
& Bingley was the official charity sponsor.
Our runners, led by Group Chief Executive
Christopher Rodrigues, raised over £150,000
for Shelter.
Doing the right thing in the environment
Bradford & Bingley’s progress in relation to its
environmental responsibilities was reflected in
the Business in the Environment Index results.
In 2003 Bradford & Bingley was ranked 120th
in the FTSE 350, an improvement from 169th
in 2002. In addition, Bradford & Bingley was
ranked 69th on the same index amongst FTSE
100 companies.
Charcol Holden Meehan is a Carbon Neutral®
organisation.This means that all their carbon
emissions in the UK are offset by sponsoring a
Biomass Gassification Plant in South India.
Rather than using diesel, the plant generates
electricity using waste from locally grown
produce and also pumps water to help grow
produce.The reduced greenhouse gas
emissions from this plant more than offset
Charcol Holden Meehan’s carbon emissions in
the UK. Charcol Holden Meehan is the first IFA
in the world to go Carbon Neutral®.
In order to improve our Group wide
environmental performance, Bradford &
Bingley has employed consultants to
undertake an environmental review in 2004.

Directors’ remuneration report
The following report has been approved by
the Board for agreement with shareholders.
Remuneration Committee
The objective of the Remuneration Committee
(the ‘Committee’) is to develop and apply
remuneration strategies that drive performance
and reward performance appropriately for the
Executive Directors and other senior
executives. It is also responsible for the overall
remuneration policy for all employees.
The Committee has been composed entirely
of Non-executive Directors, as detailed in
the table below:
Non-executive Director Membership dates
during 2003
Mark Smith (chairman 1 Jan – 3 Nov
until 3 Nov)
George Cox (chairman All year
from 3 Nov)
Trevor Lewis All year
Rod Kent All year
Nicholas Cosh From 25 Nov
Louise Patten From 17 Dec
Rod Kent, Chairman of the Company, who 
has been a member of the Committee since
26 November 2002, will continue to attend
meetings for those items other than his own
arrangements but, in line with current corporate
governance practice, ceased to be a member
with effect from the end of January 2004.
The Group Chief Executive, Christopher
Rodrigues, attends the Committee meetings
for those items other than his own
arrangements. In addition, a representative
from Human Resources is available to provide
advice.This role was undertaken by Steven
Crawshaw, Managing Director, Lending &
Savings in his capacity as HR Director, until
3 November 2003, and thereafter by Andrew
Law, General Manager, HR and Purchasing.
The Committee receives advice from a
number of sources.The Monks Partnership is
the Committee's appointed independent
adviser and provides no other services to the
Group.Towers Perrin provide external advice
to the Board and the Committee on
executive compensation levels, structure and
design.Towers Perrin also provide services to
the Group on employee reward, retirement
and administration. Mercer Human Resource
Consulting are appointed as the Company’s
pension scheme actuaries and provide advice
to the Company on its pension arrangements.
In addition,Watson Wyatt Consultants provide
advice to the Committee on Pensions issues.
Attendance at meetings during 2003 is
recorded in the Corporate Governance
section of this Annual Report & Accounts.
Remuneration policy 
The Committee continues to develop a
coherent set of reward policies to incentivise
performance and balance short and 
longer-term goals.
The resulting remuneration package comprises
two broad elements:
•fixed pay, i.e. base salary and benefits including
pension; and 
•variable pay, i.e. one short-term incentive
(bonus) and two long-term incentives (share
options and performance shares).
The package is structured so that high rewards
are paid only when shareholders benefit from
high returns.
At the upper end of performance, when the
options and performance shares vest in full,
around three-quarters of the remuneration
package is dependent on performance. For ‘on
target’ performance, the variable pay element is
around two-fifths of the total package.
Total Remuneration at Target Performance
Total Remuneration at Upper End
Performance
Wide share ownership within the Company is
encouraged through the use of a savings related
share option scheme and through the award of
restricted shares to key, high-performing
individuals. Over 3,400 employees, including
Executive Directors, are currently members of
the savings related share option scheme, and
over 300 employees were awarded restricted
shares during 2003 in recognition of their sales
performance.This latter scheme, in which the
shares vest over a three-year period (in equal
tranches), is not available to Executive Directors. 33 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
In addition, the Company operates a Group
Profit Share for all employees, subject to
scheme rules.The Group Profit Share only
pays out for Group performance at or above
target. On-target performance delivers 3% of
salary, and for performance that significantly
exceeds the annual pre-tax profit targets, the
maximum payment is 6%.The Group Profit
Share payments for Executive Directors are
included in their short-term incentive plan.
The Committee believes that the current
remuneration policies have served the Company
well. However, the Committee has reviewed
incentive arrangements for Executive Directors
and other senior employees.
After flotation, the Company wished to
engender a ‘one-group’ culture, and therefore
pursued a set of remuneration policies to
incentivise business performance through
group-wide schemes, such as the Group Profit
Share, which was available to all staff.Whilst
this general philosophy remains appropriate
for Executive Directors, now that the business
model pursued by the Company has matured,
the Committee believes that the link between
performance and reward can be better
focused by allowing each major line of
business to pursue tailored reward models.
For example, Group Profit Share will be
replaced in 2004 by specific incentive schemes
for each area of the Business.
Base salary 
Base salaries for Executive Directors are set at
market levels.These are typically aligned to the
median of companies in the financial services
sector, taking into account individual job
responsibilities and personal performance
against pre-set objectives. Salaries are
reviewed annually in April. Base salary is the
only element of pay that is pensionable.
Short-term incentive
Along with around 200 other employees,
Executive Directors participate in a short-term
incentive plan. For Executive Directors, the
2003 plan pays out 40% of base salary for 
on-target performance, and the maximum
possible payment is 80%.The performance
measures (for 2003; group profit, business unit
performance and individual key objectives) are
designed to deliver year-on-year improvements
in performance. For 2004, the Committee
expects to continue to incentivise short-term
performance, but intends to review the exact
form of the scheme with a view to initiating
stronger links between the short-term and
long-term incentive plans.
Long-term incentives 
Under the long-term incentives, approved by
shareholders as part of the flotation process,
share options are granted to around 80
executives, including Executive Directors, to
encourage sustained share price and profit
growth.To reflect this, and in line with market
practice, the Company’s earnings per share
growth must exceed the increase in the retail
price index by at least 9% over a three year
period, before the share options can be
exercised. If the performance condition has
not been achieved at the end of three years,
the test may be repeated on three further
consecutive occasions, otherwise the options
lapse. In 2003, Executive Directors received
option grants to the face value of their basic
salary.The level of the grant, up to the
maximum of 100% of base salary, is reviewed
on an annual basis.
The definition of earnings per share (‘EPS’),
used to assess performance for 2003, is ‘basic’
EPS, which assumes earnings to be the profit
of the Group after all payments, including
taxation, are made.This measure was chosen
as the most significant measure of overall
financial performance of the Company.
A Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) replaced the
1998 Long Term Incentive Plan on flotation. In
order to incentivise participants, of whom
there are 18 including the Executive Directors,
to out-perform the competition over the
longer-term, the performance measure is
comparative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’),
which measures the growth in share price and
re-invested dividends.The group of companies
chosen for comparison is determined for each
PSP award.The current group is composed of
similar financial services companies (the
‘comparator group’), and is:
Abbey National Legal & General
Alliance & Leicester Lloyds TSB
Aviva Northern Rock
Barclays Old Mutual
Countrywide Prudential
Egg Royal & Sun Alliance
HBOS Royal Bank of Scotland
At the commencement of each three-year
performance period participants are awarded
a ‘standard’ award up to a maximum of one
times basic salary. Executive Directors may
receive a ‘stretch’ award of up to a further
one times basic salary.The level of both the
standard and the stretch award, up to a
combined maximum of twice salary, is
reviewed on an annual basis.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Shares are released to participants depending
on the level of the Company’s TSR relative to
the comparator group at the end of three
years.There are different release criteria for
the standard and stretch awards as set out in
the vesting schedule (see Fig.1).
For achievement of relative three-year TSR
between median and the upper threshold,
vesting is on a pro-rata basis. Notwithstanding
the comparative TSR performance, the
Committee must also be satisfied that the
underlying financial performance of the
Company warrants vesting.
This vesting schedule has been adopted to
reward only out-performance against the
comparator group and help to ensure that there
is a direct link between the level of the award
and the difficulty of the performance conditions.
If the performance condition is not achieved at
the end of three years, the award lapses.
Future Incentive Arrangements for 
Executive Directors and Members of the
Executive Committee.
The Committee proposes to revise its short
and long-term incentive plans for senior
executives from 2004 onwards, with the aim of
simplifying the existing schemes.The proposal
is to replace the current short-term incentive
plan and both of the long-term incentive plans
with a single scheme that encompasses both
aspects of performance.This plan will apply to
those individuals whose personal performance
has a significant impact on the Company’s
results, namely the Executive Directors and the
members of the Executive Committee
(approximately 25 in total).
Within this plan, up to a maximum of 60% of
base salary can be paid in cash as a reward for
short-term performance following the year end.
The other element of the plan will be awarded
as an equivalent amount of shares, as a stake in
the longer-term. However, these shares will not
vest for three years, and if a participant leaves
the Company, they will have no automatic right
to the shares. If the Company performs well, the
value of the shares will be multiplied in line with
pre-set performance conditions. Further details
are provided in the relevant shareholder
resolution in the Notice of Annual General
Meeting 2004 document.
Subject to shareholder approval, the new
performance-related plan will be introduced
during 2004.
If shareholders approve the proposed new
arrangements then the use of options will be
discontinued, for all current employees, from
January 2004 onwards, and no new awards will
be made under the Performance Share Plan
from April 2004 onwards.Appropriate
transitional arrangements will operate for all
employees affected by these changes.
Benefits 
In line with other companies, benefits are
provided in the form of a company car (or
cash allowance), private medical insurance and
permanent disability and accident insurance.
Executive Directors are members of the
Company’s non-contributory pension plan.
This provides an accrued pension at
retirement based on one-fortieth of the 
base salary paid over the prior twelve months
(‘final salary’) for each year of pensionable
service for Ian Darby and Robert Dickie. For
Christopher Rodrigues, Rosemary Thorne and
Steven Crawshaw, pension benefits accrue at
one-fortieth, for service up to 31 December
2000, and at one-thirtieth thereafter.
The pension scheme provides a lump sum
death-in-service benefit of the higher of four
times basic salary or four times earnings in the
previous tax year, together with spouse and
dependants' pensions.
The pension arrangements for all employees,
including Executive Directors, are currently
under review.This review includes consideration
of retirement dates.
Contracts
In line with Group policy, all Executive
Directors have service contracts that expire at
their respective normal retirement age, but
the Company has the right to give 12 months’
notice of termination (or payment in lieu) and
the Director may give 6 months’ notice.
Executive Directors receive a maximum of 12
months’ basic salary and other benefits in the
event of the Company terminating the
contract without notice for any reason other
than gross misconduct (when there will be no
compensation).The date of each service
contract and the age of each current
Executive Director (as at 31 December 2003)
are shown below.
Non-executive Directors
Market level fees for the Non-executive
Directors are determined by a Committee of
Executive Directors, the current membership
being Christopher Rodrigues, Rosemary
Thorne and Steven Crawshaw.Towers Perrin
provide independent advice on best practice
and market fee levels, taking into account the
responsibilities and time commitment of each
Non-executive Director.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
The Non-executive Directors do not participate
in any incentive arrangements and none of them
have a service contract. Each receives a letter of
engagement indicating that their initial term of
appointment will be three years.
With one exception, Non-executive Directors
do not receive any other benefit.Trevor Lewis
joined the Board in 1990 and was entitled to
participate in the Company’s private medical
insurance arrangements and the pension plan.
This provided for a pension based on his final
basic fee (including that received as Chairman
of Bradford & Bingley Pensions Limited) at an
accrual rate of one-thirtieth for each year of
pensionable service subject to the Inland
Revenue earnings cap. He contributes 5% of
his fee to the plan.Trevor Lewis retired from
the Board on the 31 December 2003.These
pension arrangements do not apply to any
Non-executive Director who joined the Board
after 1990.
Non-executive directorships
Executive Directors who hold non-executive
directorships in other companies are permitted
to retain their earnings from these posts.
Performance graph 
In accordance with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (‘the
Regulations’), Fig. 2 shows Bradford & Bingley’s
TSR compared with the companies comprising
the FTSE 100 for the period from flotation on
4 December 2000 to 31 December 2003.
Whilst the FTSE 100 Return Index (of which
Bradford & Bingley is a constituent member)
has been selected for the purposes of the
Regulations to assist shareholders with 
inter-company comparison, the Board
considers the comparator group used for 
the PSP (described on page 33) to be a more
appropriate competitive performance measure
for determining the remuneration of the
executive population and has therefore
included an additional graph (Fig. 3).
Compliance
This report describes the design and structure
of our remuneration policies and the tables
following show how these have been applied
to each individual Director in the year under
review.These tables (on pages 36 to 40) have
been audited in compliance with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
We also confirm that the Company complies
with the Combined Code (‘the Code’)
appended to the Listing Rules of the UK
Listing Authority issued in June 1998 and with
section 1B of the Code’s provisions on
Directors’ remuneration and Schedule B to
the Code in respect of the content of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The following statement, which should be read
in conjunction with the statement of the
Auditor’s responsibilities on page 42, is made by
the Directors to explain their responsibilities.
The Directors are required by the Companies
Act 1985 to prepare Financial Statements for
each financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company
and the Group as at the end of the financial
year and of the profit or loss for the financial
year.The Directors are required to prepare
the Financial Statements on the going concern
basis unless it is not appropriate.
The Directors consider that, in preparing 
the Financial Statements on pages 43 to 78,
they have used appropriate accounting
policies, consistently applied and supported 
by reasonable and prudent judgements 
and estimates and that all accounting 
standards which they consider applicable 
have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for 
ensuring that the Company keeps accounting
records which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Company and which enable them to
ensure that the Financial Statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.

Independent auditor’s report
to the shareholders of Bradford & Bingley plc
We have audited the Financial Statements
on pages 43 to 78.We have also audited the
information in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report on pages 36 to 40.
This report is made solely to the Company’s
shareholders, as a body, in accordance with
section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we
might state to the Company’s shareholders
those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other
purpose.To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s shareholders as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors 
The Directors are responsible for preparing
the Annual Report & Accounts. As described
on page 41, this includes responsibility for
preparing the Financial Statements in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards. Our
responsibilities, as independent auditors, are
established in the United Kingdom by statute,
the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority, and by our
profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether
the Financial Statements give a true and fair
view and are properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.We also report
to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report
is not consistent with the Financial Statements,
if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require
for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration and
transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement on page
27 reflects the Company’s compliance with
the seven provisions of the Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules,
and we report if it does not.We are not
required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks
and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures.
We read the other information contained in
the Annual Report & Accounts, including the
corporate governance statement and the
unaudited part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report, and consider whether
it is consistent with the audited Financial
Statements.We consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the Financial Statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
Financial Statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the Financial Statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to
obtain all the information and explanations
which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the Financial
Statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the Financial Statements and
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Financial Statements give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company
and the Group as at 31 December 2003
and of the profit of the Group for the year
then ended; and
• the Financial Statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the financial statements
1. Principal accounting policies
The accounting policies have been reviewed in
accordance with the requirements of Financial
Reporting Standard No.18 ‘Accounting Policies’.
The Directors consider that the accounting
policies set out below remain most
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
have been consistently applied, and are
supported by reasonable and prudent
estimates and judgements.
(a) Basis of preparation 
The accounts have been prepared in
accordance with applicable accounting
standards and decisions of the Urgent Issues
Task Force under the historical cost accounting
convention. In addition the accounts have been
prepared in accordance with the special
provisions of the Companies Act 1985
applicable to banking companies and banking
groups and in accordance with the Statements
of Recommended Practice (SORP’s) issued by
the British Bankers’ Association.
(b) Basis of consolidation 
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings,
and other companies which are considered by
the Directors to be quasi-subsidiaries as defined
in Financial Reporting Standard No. 5 ‘Reporting
the Substance of Transactions’, all of which have
co-terminous accounting periods. In addition the
accounts comprise the appropriate share of
profits and losses of its associates and joint
ventures.Where subsidiaries have been acquired
during a period, their results have been
consolidated in the Financial Statements from
the date of acquisition.
(c) Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary
undertakings and joint ventures represents the
difference between the fair value of the
consideration and the aggregate of the fair
values of the separate net assets acquired.
Goodwill is included within intangible fixed
assets or investments in joint ventures and is
amortised over a period appropriate to each
acquisition, not exceeding 20 years.
Any unamortised goodwill on disposal of a
subsidiary undertaking or joint venture is
charged against the sale proceeds.
Impairment reviews are conducted at the end
of the first full year after the year of acquisition
in accordance with accounting standards or
when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may
not be fully recoverable or the amortisation
period may have reduced.Any shortfalls are
added to the amortisation of goodwill in the
year of the impairment review.
(d) T axation 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit
for the year and takes into account taxation
deferred because of timing differences between
the treatment of certain items for taxation and
accounting purposes. Full provision is made for
deferred taxation in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard No.19 ‘Deferred T ax’.
(e) Fixed assets and depreciation 
The cost of additions and major alterations to
land and buildings, equipment, fixtures and
motor vehicles is capitalised.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the
cost, less the estimated residual value, of tangible
fixed assets over their useful economic lives.
Depreciation is provided as follows:
• freehold and long leasehold buildings at 2%
per annum on a straight-line basis;
• short leasehold properties are amortised over
the remainder of the lease up to 50 years;
• fixtures and fittings at 20% per annum on a
straight-line basis;
• motor vehicles at 25% per annum on a
reducing balance basis;
• computer equipment at rates ranging from
20% to 33% per annum on a straight-line basis;
• software licences of an enduring nature at
33% per annum on a straight-line basis;
• internet development costs for transactional
based websites at 50% per annum on a
straight-line basis; and
• other equipment and major alterations 
to buildings at 10% per annum on a 
straight-line basis.
Any impairment in the value of freehold and
long leasehold land and buildings is dealt with
through the Profit and Loss Account as it arises.
(f) Leasing 
Rentals under operating leases are charged to
administrative expenses in the year in which the
expenditure is incurred.Assets acquired under
finance leases are capitalised at fair value at the
start of the lease, with the corresponding
obligations being included in other liabilities.The
finance lease costs charged to the Profit and
Loss Account are based on a constant periodic
rate as applied to the outstanding liabilities.
(g) Debt securities 
Debt securities intended for use on a continuing
basis in the Group’s activities are classified as
investment securities and are stated at cost as
adjusted for the amortisation of any premiums
or discounts arising on acquisition, which are
amortised over the period to redemption on a
level yield basis.Any such amortisation is
included in interest receivable. Provision is made
for any impairment in value. Debt securities are
accounted for on a trade date basis. Each
investment in a structured investment vehicle
(‘SIV’) is individually reviewed to ensure the
accounting treatment is appropriate.
Where the SIV is considered to have minimal
management discretion, the Group recognises
its share of the SIV’s underlying assets and
liabilities. In other cases they are treated as debt
securities. Interest on these vehicles includes a
margin above the coupon rate to reflect profits
earned by the underlying investment.
(h) Pension and post retirement benefits 
The Group charges pension and other post
retirement costs against profits in accordance
with Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’ using
an actuarial method and assumptions designed
to provide for the anticipated costs over the
remaining service lives of the employees in the
scheme.This method ensures that the regular
costs represent a relatively equal proportion of
the current and expected future pensionable
payroll in the light of current actuarial
assumptions.Any SSAP 24 prepayment or
liability is included in prepayments and accrued
income or other liabilities as appropriate, with
all charges to the Profit and Loss Account,
including interest, in administrative expenses.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the
remaining service lives of current employees in
the scheme.
(i) Provisions for bad and doubtful debts
Provisions for losses on residential loans and
advances to customers are made throughout
the year and at the year-end.The basis for
determining the level of provisions is to provide
for all reasonably foreseeable losses that exist in
the portfolio at the date of calculation.
Specific provisions for residential lending are
created for cases with arrears to debt ratios of
2.5% or greater.The potential shortfall is
calculated from the outstanding mortgage debt
plus costs of re-possession less the estimated
property value with a discount valuation factor
for forced sale.The potential shortfall for each
case is adjusted to reflect the probability of
loss.This adjustment reflects historical
performance except for specialist lending 48 Bradford & Bingley plc

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2003
Notes to the financial statements
where, because this area of lending is not yet
mature, probabilities of loss are predicted by
reference to the credit scoring system.
The specific provision for properties in
possession is based on the contracted/agreed
sale price or sale valuation with adjustment
for expenses of sale and income from
insurance policies. Specific provisions for the
commercial portfolio are calculated on all cases
three or more months in arrears.A probability
of loss, dependent on the severity of the
arrears, is applied on a case-by-case basis.
General provisions are raised to cover losses
which are judged to be present in loans and
advances at the balance sheet date, but which
have not been specifically identified as such.The
general provision also takes into account the
economic climate in the market and the level of
security held. Loans and advances are written off
where there is no realistic prospect of recovery.
Interest charged to all residential and
commercial loans which are in arrears or in
possession, and where the interest is expected
to be irrecoverable, is suspended from other
interest receivable and similar income.
(j) Debt and capital instrument issue costs 
These are amortised over the period to the
instruments’ maturity at a constant rate and
included in interest payable.The unamortised
amounts are deducted from the relevant liability.
In the event of early repayment the unamortised
issue cost is charged to interest payable.
(k) Interests in joint ventures 
Joint ventures are undertakings in which the
Group holds an interest on a long-term basis
and are jointly controlled by the Group and
one or more other venturers under a
contractual agreement.
The Group’s share of profits less losses from
joint ventures is included in the Profit and Loss
Account using the gross equity method.The
holding value of joint ventures in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet is calculated by
reference to the Group’s share of the gross
assets, including Group loans to the joint
venture and any related unamortised goodwill,
less its share of the gross liabilities, as shown by
the most recent accounts available.
(l) Foreign currencies 
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currency that have been hedged by means of
matching foreign currency contracts, are
translated at the exchange rate inherent in
those contracts.Where assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currency have not been
hedged, they are translated at the rate of
exchange at the balance sheet date.
Any gains or losses are included in interest
receivable or payable depending on the
underlying instrument being an asset or liability.
m) Mortgage indemnity insurance 
Charges to borrowers in respect of high loan-
to-value advances are paid to a wholly owned
captive insurance company. In the Group
accounts these charges are treated
as deferred income and deducted from
loans and advances to customers.The income
deferred is released to interest receivable on a
level yield basis over the life of the mortgage.
(n) Incentives to customers 
Cashbacks, interest discounts and other
incentives to customers are amortised against
interest receivable and similar income or interest
payable over the early redemption clawback
period of these products commencing from the
date of completion. Unamortised incentives are
held within prepayments and accrued income
and other liabilities.
(o) Acquisition of mortgage portfolios
Premiums paid on the acquisition of mortgage
portfolios are held within other assets and
amortised over the estimated economic life of
the underlying asset.Where such mortgage
portfolios are acquired as part of a company
purchase, the resulting charge is included within
administrative expenses.Where such mortgage
portfolios are acquired as a result
of a specific asset purchase, the resulting charge
is deducted from interest receivable.
(p) Loans and advances to customers subject
to non-recourse funding 
Loans and advances to customers subject to
non-recourse funding are included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet using the linked
presentation method. Such balances are stated
at book value.The profit on ordinary activities
before taxation is included within other
operating income in the Consolidated Profit and
Loss Account.The same provisioning policies as
stated in note (i) above apply to these loans.
(q) Off-balance sheet financial instruments 
Off-balance sheet financial instruments are
entered into by the Group for hedging
purposes to reduce the risks arising on
transactions entered into in the normal course
of business.The effectiveness of this hedging is
reviewed on a regular basis.
The income or expense arising from off-
balance sheet financial instruments entered into
for hedging purposes is recognised in the
accounts in accordance with the accounting
treatment of the underlying transaction or
transactions being hedged.
Where off-balance sheet instruments are
terminated prior to the underlying hedged
transaction terminating, any profits or losses
realised upon early termination are deferred
and matched against the income or
expenditure arising from the underlying
hedged transaction over the remaining period
of the hedging instrument. If the underlying
hedged transaction is extinguished or
terminated, the remaining unamortised gains
or losses on the hedge are recognised in the
Profit and Loss Account immediately.
The Group does not undertake transactions for
trading or speculative purposes and
consequently all off-balance sheet financial
instruments are classified as hedging contracts.
(r) Income recognition 
• Interest income is recognised in the Profit and
Loss Account as it accrues except where
interest is suspended as set out in accounting
policy note (i) above.
• Commercial lending fees charged in lieu of
interest are recognised in the Profit and Loss
Account as interest receivable on a level
yield basis over the discount period of the
interest foregone.
• Residential lending fees and commissions
receivable are recognised in the Profit and
Loss Account on receipt within Fees and
Commissions Receivable.
• Commission receivable from Regulated
Financial Services products is recognised as
income within Fees and Commissions
Receivable when the policy goes ‘On Risk’, net
of any provision for repayment in the event of
termination by the customer.
• Procurement Fees from sale of mortgages are
recognised when the house sale completes
and the mortgage becomes active.
• Client Fees are recognised on the exchange of
contract for the relevant property.
• Estate Agency fees on sales of new and
second hand homes are recognised on
exchange of contracts.
(s) Fees payable 
Fees payable to brokers and agents in respect
of the sale of Bradford & Bingley mortgages are
fully expensed as incurred. 49 Bradford & Bingley plc

61.9 66.1
Foreign tax 1.7 2.2

Tax on profit on ordinary activities 49.3 63.2
There are no adjustments in respect of previous periods included within foreign tax.
During the year, the Inland Revenue agreed that certain costs of conversion to listed company status were a deductible expense for tax purposes.
As a result of this agreement, an exceptional tax credit of £22.9m has been recognised in these accounts.
The 2003 current tax charge of £40.7m (2002: £68.3m) equates to an effective rate of 15.4% (2002: 28.4%).This is reconciled to the standard UK
rate as follows:

(b) Quasi-subsidiaries 
(i) Advances secured on residential property subject to non-recourse funding
A quasi-subsidiary of the Group, Aire Valley Finance plc, has a portfolio of residential mortgage assets.The portfolio was funded by the issue of
£989.0m of bonds, serviceable only from the cash flows generated by the mortgage portfolio, together with £36.0m of subordinated finance from
the Group. At 31 December 2003, bonds including accrued interest and the aforementioned subordinated finance to the value of £41.7m were
held by the Group. Aire Valley Finance plc has the option to redeem all classes of bonds at their principal amount outstanding on the interest
payment date falling in November 2004 and on any interest payment date falling thereafter or when the value of bonds falls below £100m.
A second quasi-subsidiary of the Group, Aire Valley Trustees (No. 2) Ltd, also has a portfolio of residential mortgage assets.The beneficial interest
in this portfolio was subsequently transferred to a third quasi-subsidiary of the Group, Aire Valley Finance (No. 2) plc. Aire Valley Finance (No. 2)
plc was funded by the issue of £1.0 billion of bonds, serviceable only from the cash flows generated by the mortgage portfolio, together with
£22.9m of subordinated finance from the Group. At 31 December 2003 the subordinated finance from the Group, including accrued interest, was
£23.1m.The company has the option to redeem all classes of bonds at their principal amount outstanding on the interest payment date falling in
September 2008 and on any interest payment date falling thereafter or when the value of bonds falls below £100m.
Aire Valley Trustees (No. 2) Ltd has entered into an interest rate swap with Bradford & Bingley plc as the swap counterparty to manage the
interest rate basis risk payable on the loan notes issued by Aire Valley Finance (No. 2) plc. Mortgage income received by Aire Valley T rustees (No.
2) Ltd from the securitised mortgage portfolio is passed to Bradford & Bingley plc which then pays a floating rate of interest to Aire Valley
Trustees (No. 2) Ltd to enable payment of interest on the loan notes.There is one fixed rate swap, with a capped notional volume of £600m and
a maximum term of ten years.
The Group is not obliged to support any losses in respect of these mortgages, other than to the extent of its subordinated funding, nor does it
intend to do so.This is clearly stated in the agreements with the bond holders.
The controlling interests of Aire Valley Finance plc, Aire Valley Finance (No. 2) plc and Aire Valley Trustees (No. 2) Ltd are held by a discretionary
trustee.The Group receives an administration fee for servicing the mortgage portfolios of both Aire Valley Finance plc and Aire Valley Finance
(No.2) plc, together with any residual income arising after the claims of the bond holders are met.

(ii) Secured funding
On 3 August 2003 a quasi-subsidiary of the Group, Legaless Ltd, was assigned equitable title to a £1.0 billion portfolio of residential mortgage assets
from Mortgage Express, a subsidiary of the Group. Mortgage Express and the Group continue to be exposed to the risk that the principal amount
and interest receivable on the mortgage loans are not collectable.The mortgage loans are not ring-fenced and so a linked presentation is not
appropriate and the loans continue to be shown within loans and advances to customers in the Group accounts. Legaless Ltd funded the purchase of
mortgages through a participation agreement with a third party bank and the funding is shown within deposits by banks in the Group accounts.

The issued share capital has reduced as a result of a share buy back programme, approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meetings in
2001, 2002 and 2003. During 2003, 19.7 million shares were purchased for cancellation at a cost of £61.6m (excluding commissions and Stamp
Duty). In total 47.9 million shares have been purchased for cancellation at a total cost of £150m under the programme which commenced in
February 2002.
The Group and Company hold on their Balance Sheets own shares of £33.0m (2002: £20.8m) which represent shares held by share trusts for the
purposes of executive and employee share awards/savings schemes. Own shares are carried at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in
value.The movement in own shares in 2003 represents £14.3m of additional share purchases, less £1.0m of options exercised by individuals and a
charge of £1.1m in respect of the discount on shares acquired for the Sharesave Scheme.
Bradford & Bingley Profit Sharing Scheme
In March 2001 and March 2002, employees entitled to the Group bonus could elect to receive shares under the rules of the Bradford & Bingley
Profit Sharing Scheme.This scheme operates a trust fund, known as the Bradford & Bingley Share Ownership Trust, which is under the control of
independent trustees, Computershare Trustees Limited. By leaving the shares in the Bradford & Bingley Share Ownership Trust for three years,
employees will not have to pay income tax and national insurance contributions on receipt of those shares. At 31 December 2003 the trustees of
the Bradford & Bingley Share Ownership Trust held 1,357,090 shares (2002: 2,422,919) on behalf of 2,604 employees (2002: 4,607).
Bradford & Bingley Employees' Share Trust
On 3 October 2000 the Company established an offshore employee share trust, the Bradford & Bingley Employees’ Share Trust, for the purpose of
receiving monies and acquiring shares to be used in conjunction with any employee share schemes established by the Company. At 31 December 2003
the trustees of this trust, Mourant & Co.Trustees Limited, held 6,346,112 (2002: 4,265,769) shares to satisfy share awards and options which have been
made or are to be made in accordance with the rules of the employee share schemes established by the Company.The market value of shares held at
31 December 2003 was £19,355,641 (2002: £12,370,730). During 2003 the Company provided £6.4m (2002: £7.4m) for share purchases.The trust
has waived in full its rights to receive dividends on the shares held.This trust currently holds shares relating to the Long Term Incentive Plan, Executive
Share Option Scheme, Performance Share Plan and the Employees' Restricted Share Bonus Plan which are detailed below.
Long T erm Incentive Plan
Under the rules of the 1998 Long Term Incentive Plan it was possible for the participants to elect to take share options rather than the cash
entitlements.Awards were made under this plan on 12 December 2000 and 50 participants elected to take options over 353,744 shares exercisable
at the same time as the cash payments (40% immediately and two further equal tranches on the first and second anniversaries).The options over
shares remain exercisable during the first five years following the award date.At the year end 126,795 (2002: 149,218) shares remained under option.
Executive Share Option Scheme
Grants of approved and unapproved share options were made under the rules of the Bradford & Bingley 2000 Share Option Scheme as detailed
below.The shares are exercisable subject to the achievement of a performance target linked to an increase in the Company’s earnings per share.
The options over shares are exercisable over the period of three to ten years after the date of the grant.

31. Derivatives and other financial instruments
(a) Financial instruments and risk management
The Group’s core business is to provide its customers with financial products appropriate to their needs, from mortgages and savings accounts to
long-term investment products and insurance products.The Group uses wholesale financial instruments to invest in liquid assets and to raise funds
from wholesale money markets in support of its retail savings and mortgage operations.These instruments also allow it to manage the risks arising
from these business activities.
The Group has a well established formal structure for managing risks which includes formal risk policies, risk limits, reporting structures, mandates
and control procedures.The Group’s approach to risk management and control is set out within the Financial Review on pages 20 to 21.The
Board delegates the management of all aspects of market and liquidity risk to the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO).
Financial instruments used by the Group for risk management purposes include off-balance sheet or derivative instruments. Such instruments are
used only to limit the extent to which the Group will be affected by changes in interest rates and exchange rates. As part of its responsibilities,
ALCO approves the use of specified off-balance sheet instruments within approved limits and business activities. 68 Bradford & Bingley plc

(a) Financial instruments and risk management – continued
The Group does not undertake transactions for trading or speculative purposes and consequently all off-balance sheet financial instruments are
classified as hedging contracts.The principal off-balance sheet instruments used by the Group in managing its balance sheet risk exposures are
interest rate swaps, interest rate options, cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.These are used to protect the Group
from exposures arising principally from fixed and capped rate mortgage lending, fixed rate savings products, deposit funding, foreign currency
exposure and investment activities.The duration of off-balance sheet contracts is generally short to medium-term and their maturity profile
reflects the nature of exposures arising from underlying business activities.
At the year end the Group had no net material exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations or changes in foreign currency interest rates.

A positive interest rate sensitivity gap exists when more assets than liabilities re-price during a given period. Although net interest income tends to
benefit from a positive gap when interest rates are rising (and a negative gap when rates are falling), the actual effect will depend upon a number
of factors, including the extent to which repayments are made earlier or later than the next reset or maturity date. 69 Bradford & Bingley plc

discounted cash flow techniques have been used to determine the fair value using market interest rates for the relevant assets.The fair values of
off-balance sheet financial instruments have been determined using market interest rates in discounted cash flow techniques. Fair values of interest
rate caps and collars have been calculated using option-pricing models. 71 Bradford & Bingley plc

Deferred balances relating to settled derivatives and other financial transaction provisions, used as hedges, will be released to the Profit and Loss
Account in the same periods as the income and expenditure flows from the underlying hedged transactions.The above table shows the gains and
losses on off-balance sheet derivative instruments used for hedging by the Group.The gains and losses therefore do not represent absolute gains
and losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from on-balance sheet instruments. 72 Bradford & Bingley plc

33. Retirement benefits
(a) Pension schemes
The Company operates a funded defined benefit staff pension scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Staff Pension Scheme (‘the principal scheme’),
administered by trustees, which is a closed scheme.The fund is independent from those of the Company.The normal pension age of employees in
the scheme is 60 years. Pension costs in the principal scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected
unit method.The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 October 2003.The aggregate actuarial value of the scheme’s assets was
sufficient to cover 110% of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The aggregate market value of the scheme’s assets held at 31 October 2003 was £352.6 million.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and
the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.The rate of return on investments has been assumed to exceed the rate of salary increases by 2.75%
per annum and to exceed the rate of present and future pensions increase by 3.25% per annum.This latter assumption is different from that used
by the Company and Trustees in determining the contribution rate to the scheme where the investment return is assumed to exceed the rate of
pension increase by 2.25% per annum.
The pension charge takes account of the surpluses disclosed, which are amortised over a period of 11.5 years, being the estimated average
remaining service life of pension scheme members.
The Group also operates two further defined benefit schemes which are not material.
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Group Pension Plan.The fund is independent from those of the Company.
The total pension cost for the Group was £13.0m (2002: £10.7m) and included £0.2m (2002: £0.2m) in respect of pensions to former Directors
which was charged to other administrative expenses.There were no liabilities or prepayments associated with the defined contribution scheme at
the year end (2002: £Nil).
(b) Other post-retirement benefits
The Company provides concessionary rate mortgages and health care benefits to some of its pensioners.The cost of health care benefits is
provided for in accordance with the stated accounting policy.The cost of concessionary rate mortgages is not significant and is recognised in the
Profit and Loss Account as it is incurred.
(c) Financial Reporting Standard No.17 ‘Retirement Benefits’
Whilst the company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 ‘Accounting for
Pension Costs’, the following transitional disclosures are required by FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’:
The major assumptions used in this valuation were:

33. Retirement benefits – continued
(c) Financial Reporting Standard No.17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ – continued
The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 October 2003 has been updated by the actuary on an FRS 17 basis at 31 December 2003. The assumptions used
by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not
necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term and may be subject to significant change before they
are realised, and the present value of the schemes’ liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently
uncertain, were:

Notes
(a) In order to analyse net interest by business segment it is necessary to apply a transfer price to the internal funding or liquidity requirement of
each segment. Interest rates used for transfer pricing have been determined to retain the interest rate risk within Treasury. Costs have been
assigned to each segment based on resources consumed.Transfer pricing in respect of mortgage origination by the Distribution segment has
been determined on the basis of market rates for such activity.
(b) Exceptionals have not been allocated across business segments since they are the consequence of Group-level decisions.
(c) For the purposes of segmental information net assets have been allocated to Lending, Savings and Distribution on the basis of the regulatory
capital framework.The segments are not allocated capital during the normal course of business, therefore segmental profits do not relate to
these net assets.
(d) The Group operates entirely within the retail financial services sector and accordingly no segmental analysis of turnover has been presented.
Please refer to the Financial Review for more information on segmental performance. 78 Bradford & Bingley plc

ShareGift
Many investors find themselves owning parcels
of shares in quantities so small that it would
cost more to sell them than they are worth.
They may therefore be too small to do
anything with, but may still bring a tax liability
on any dividends paid and unwanted annual
reports and other documents.
Bradford & Bingley plc supports ShareGift, which
is administered by The Orr Mackintosh
Foundation (registered charity number 1052668).
Any shares that you donate to ShareGift will
be transferred into the name of The Orr
Mackintosh Foundation, who will aggregate
them, sell them when possible and donate the
proceeds to a growing list of charities. Since
ShareGift was started over £4 million has been
given to more than 400 different charities.
If you would like to use ShareGift, or receive
more information about the scheme, they
can be contacted by visiting their website at
www.ShareGift.org.uk or by calling 0207 337

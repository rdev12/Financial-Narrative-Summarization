underlying profits before tax, the amortisation 
of intangible assets and exceptional items were 
ahead of expectations at £52.8m (2008: £89.2m);  
and underlying earnings per share on the same basis 
were 102.5p (2008: 174.8p). overall we recorded 
only a modest reduction in revenue to £2,145.6m 
(2008: £2,374.2m), despite fairly sizeable 
volume reductions in our Partnership Homes and 
Developments businesses.
o ur Construction and Support Services divisions 
achieved record levels of operating profit and 
strong cash balances. Combined order books of 
£4.5bn (2008: £4.1bn) for both divisions reflect 
the award of several new framework agreements 
and large contracts including, in Support Services, 
the £600m building maintenance contract for north 
Tyneside Council.
Considerable effort has been put into completing 
the reorganisation of our housing business during 
the year which, in total, has provided annualised 
cost savings of around £26m. While beginning to 
show recent signs of stabilisation, the market for 
the newly formed Kier Partnership Homes division 
continued to be tough throughout the financial year 
with 1,141 unit sales achieved compared with 2,090 
last year, 59% of which were social units (2008: 
43%). We generated a small underlying operating 
profit in the Partnership Homes division before 
taking into account further land write-downs and 
reorganisation costs, together totalling £44.3m.
in our Developments business volumes reduced 
due to the lack of funds available in the market for 
potential purchasers. However we have advanced 
a number of long-term opportunities including our 
joint venture with n etwork r ail. We also completed 
the purchase of a majority stake in the Kent Building 
Schools for the Future (BSF) l ocal education 
Partnership which gives us access to a further £300m 
of schools construction work, in due course, as well 
as access to further Private Finance initiative (PFi) 
investment and a facilities management contract. 
More recently we have exchanged contracts for the 
disposal of the uK Supreme Court for over £30m.
Cash, one of our key measures particularly within 
the Construction division, continues to be strong at 
a net balance of £92.5m at 30 June 2009 (2008: 
£143.9m). The outflow for the year is attributable 
to committed land payments in our Partnership 
Homes business and to further investment in the uK 
Supreme Court development in our Developments 
business which now is complete and in the process 
of disposal.
The Board is pleased to announce that it is 
proposing to maintain the total dividend for the year 
at 55.0p, the same level as last year’s dividend. The 
dividend is 1.9 times covered by adjusted earnings 
per share. The final dividend of 37p will be paid on 27 
n ovember 2009 to shareholders on the register on 
25 September 2009 and there will be a scrip dividend 
alternative. Maintaining the dividend in this difficult 
economic climate has been an important objective 
for the Board and we look forward to returning  
to a progressive dividend policy as economic  
conditions improve.
Board changes
The Board was pleased to announce the appointment 
of nick Winser as a non-executive director of the 
Company with effect from 1 March 2009. nick, aged 
49, is an executive director of national Grid plc.
Against a backdrop of a very challenging 
economic climate, particularly in uK 
property developments and housing 
markets, i am pleased to report good 
results for Kier Group plc for the year  
to 30 June 2009.

prospects
our Construction and Support Services businesses 
are performing well with some strong opportunities 
identified and secured in both the public and private 
sectors supported by the significant number of 
framework agreements with which we are involved. 
We expect to maintain a healthy margin and cash 
position in both of these divisions.
The newly restructured Partnership Homes 
division is now better able to respond to the 
current market conditions with an emphasis on 
social housing provision within a mixed tenure 
context whilst continuing to develop out or seek 
disposal opportunities for the 6,150 plots of land 
with residential planning consent which we hold 
across our operational areas.
Whilst the current markets for our Developments 
business remain tough, they are beginning to show 
signs of improvement and we have a number of excel-
lent long-term projects which will provide consider-
able value for the future.
The new financial year has started well. The 
current economic climate will, no doubt, present us 
with many challenges; however, our businesses are 
financially strong. We have a strong balance sheet 
and good cash resources and i am confident that 
Kier will respond positively to changing markets as 
we enter the new financial year.

overview
i am pleased to report that Kier Group plc has 
performed ahead of expectations in the year to 
30 June 2009 and has maintained strong levels of 
revenue, underlying profits and cash.
our Construction division has had a strong 
year achieving further growth in operating profits 
at record margins of 2.6% (2008: 2.3%) together 
with healthy average cash balances. We continue to 
focus on long-term relationships and have success-
fully extended the number of long-term public and 
private sector framework agreements in which we 
participate to 52 across the country. Public sector 
projects, particularly in the education sector, 
continue to underpin our order books representing 
56% of our contract awards for the year, with private 
sector enquiry levels holding up in many sectors. 
The infrastructure, power and energy sectors are 
providing significant opportunities in the uK, and 
overseas we are seeing improved prospects for work 
arising from the Middle east and Hong Kong.
in Support Services our order books have grown 
significantly, particularly with the recent award of 
the contract with n orth Tyneside Council to repair 
and maintain around 16,000 social housing units 
together with other council-owned property. We are 
also seeing an increase in the number of outsourcing 
opportunities for both the public and private sectors 
as organisations continue to examine their cost 
base and seek efficiencies.
o ur Partnership Homes division, which now encom-
passes the former Kier Homes, our private housing 
business, and Kier Partnership Homes, our social 
housing contracting business, performed in line with 
our expectations. Despite weak buyer sentiment 
and a continued lack of liquidity in the mortgage 
and general lending market, the division completed 
1,141 unit sales for the year (2008: 2,090) and 
generated an underlying operating profit of £1.1m 
(2008: £32.2m). o ur Developments business 
saw modest sales activity this year although we  
have been active on a number of projects and 
long-term opportunities.
More recently our Developments business has 
acquired a majority stake in a BSF programme for 
Kent County Council. This acquisition secures our 
position on the l ocal education Partnership board 
giving us access to a further £16m of PFi investment 
in education projects together with at least £300m 
of additional construction work for our regional 
contracting businesses as well as a 25-year facilities 
management contract for Kier Support Services. 
We have also, recently, exchanged contracts for 
the disposal of the uK Supreme Court for over  
£30m which provides an exit yield of around 5%  
based on post-tax disposal proceeds. Completion  
is expected imminently.
Financial performance
r evenue for the year was £2,145.6m, 
(2008: £2,374.2m) with good growth in Support 
Services offset, as expected, by a reduction in 
each of the Partnership Homes and Developments 
divisions. The Construction division saw a mild 
reduction in revenue largely as a result of a decline 
in private sector projects. underlying operating 
profit for the Group was 40% less than last year’s at 
£50.1m (2008: £83.8m), the decline attributable to 
our Partnership Homes and Developments divisions 
offsetting significant growth in Construction and 
Support Services.

Chie F exeCutive’s 
review
The good performance for the year is the result  
of our product diversification and spread of 
operations, the quality and commercial capability 
of our staff as well as our approach to risk 
management. The Group continues to be  
cash-positive with healthy order books in our 
Construction and Support Services businesses 
supported by framework agreements and public 
sector opportunities.

share were 98.1p (2008: 170.6p).
Cash remains strong with month-end net 
balances in the year averaging £62m, ending the 
year at a net balance of £92.5m (2008: £143.9m). 
Healthy cash balances have been maintained in the 
Construction division which averaged £390m for the 
year, together with the Support Services division 
which averaged £20m. Within our Partnership 
Homes division we experienced a cash outflow, as 
predicted, of £22.3m largely due to land payment 
commitments and the high levels of work in progress 
built up prior to the commencement of the 2009 
financial year. This, coupled with our investment in 
the uK Supreme Court development and our equity 
investment in PFi and property joint ventures, led to 
an outflow of Group cash of £51m during the year.
group structure and strategic developments
For the year to 30 June 2009 Kier Group plc 
comprised four divisions: Construction, Support 
Services, Partnership Homes and Developments. 
The Group’s management structure and segmental 
analysis for reporting purposes are based on the 
four divisions.
During the year we successfully completed 
the merger of the former Kier Homes, our private 
housing development business, together with Kier 
Partnership Homes, our social housing contracting 
business, to form the enlarged Kier Partnership 
Homes division. This merger has combined the skills 
and relationships of the social housing management 
team with the land skills and marketing techniques 
of our private development team in order to focus on 
large-scale regeneration projects, to participate in 
housing PFi schemes, and to respond to the Homes 
and Community Agency’s (HCA’s) affordable housing 
strategy. indeed, Kier Partnership Homes enjoys 
‘Partner Status’ with the HCA and is able to apply 
for and receive grant directly.
The new division is better able to respond to 
the current market conditions with an emphasis 
on social housing provision within a mixed tenure 
context whilst continuing to develop out or seek 
disposal opportunities for the 6,150 plots of land 
with residential planning consent which we hold 
across our operational areas. With the change in 
emphasis towards providing an increasing number of 
social housing units, whilst retaining our private land 
development and marketing skills, Kier Partnership 
Homes will benefit from a reduced risk profile. The 
new business model requires less working capital 
than the previous model, arising from a higher 
proportion of social housing units developed on 
third-party land and, consequently, a higher return 
on capital employed.

overall revenue remained fairly flat at £1,492.2m 
(2008: £1,584.5m), whilst operating profit grew from 
£36.6m to a record £39.1m, at a margin of 2.6% 
(2008: 2.3%). Cash generation has been good with 
cash balances at 30 June 2009 in line with those 
last year at around £400m after deducting tax and 
intra-group dividends. Contract award levels were 
marginally lower than those for last year giving a 
secured order book of £1,190m (2008: £1,357m) 
(comprising only the value of projects with a signed 
contract) but with a higher level of ‘probable’ awards 
(comprising contracts on which we are preferred 
bidder or in one-to-one negotiations); £1,055m 
compared with £757m last year.
Fifty-six per cent of our awards were for public 
sector projects, with education, by far, our biggest 
source of work accounting for some £600m (45%) 
of our total awards for the year, much of it generated 
through framework agreements and partnerships 
with government, local authorities and universities. 
The Contractors’ Framework for Academies has 
awarded us six projects so far with a combined 
value of £139m as well as a further six projects  
on which we are preferred bidder valued at an 
additional £272m.
We are active in the BSF market and our role on 
the Kent County Council BSF has started to deliver 
with £108m already awarded and a further £300m 
anticipated to come on-stream in due course.
Frameworks for local authorities are also deliv-
ering a high volume of work, particularly in schools. 
We were selected as one of three contractors to 
form the east Midlands Property Alliance (eMPA) 
intermediate Projects Partnering Framework valued 
at £275m over four years, as well as being selected 
as preferred bidder on a £400m Construction 
Framework in the south-west over a similar period, 
neither of which is currently included in our secure 
or probable awards.
Health projects represented 9% of our awards in the 
year. The seven-year ProCure 21 (P21) framework 
is in its sixth year and is producing a steady flow 
of work. in the last 12 months Kier Health has won  
a further 20 projects at a combined value of  
£65m taking our total awards on the framework to 
nearly £400m.
new construction, extensions and refurbishment 
work at prisons for the Ministry of Justice Custodial 
Properties’ Framework has again provided a good 
level of activity representing around 3% of total 
awards in the year. At the end of the year we  
were selected for the £180m Featherstone  
Prison contract near Wolverhampton to provide  
three 480-place house blocks and additional 
associated facilities.
in the private sector we have been awarded a 
number of projects under the new BAA framework 
and are active at edinburgh, Heathrow, Gatwick and 
Stansted airports. other private sector contracts 
include projects under frameworks for Tesco 
and Sainsbury’s including two ground-breaking 
Sainsbury’s eco stores in Dartmouth and Gloucester 
Quays. other important framework clients for whom 
we work include SeGro , Goodman, British l and, 
Hermes, Morrisons and Vodafone.
The energy sector accounted for 14% of our 
awards in the year including the £100m contract at 
West Burton, n ottingham where we are providing 
civil engineering works for a 1,200MW Combined 
Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power station for eDF 
energy. As the leading provider of power station 
infrastructure for CCGT power stations, having 
completed 13 such stations in a similar number 
of years, we are well placed to take advantage 
of the necessary future growth in this sector. We

operations in Dubai have continued to slow as

lengthened, cash receipts have continued to flow. 
We have now turned our attention to other areas 
in the Middle east including Saudi Arabia, where 
we are setting up an eight-year phosphate mining 
contract in joint venture with a local partner. Further 
opportunities are being pursued in Saudi Arabia and 
Abu Dhabi.
in r omania we have successfully completed a 
large retail centre on time and to budget, together 
with the first phase of an apartment scheme. 
However our operations have been hampered by 
the economic downturn and the lack of financing for 
projects and we have decided to withdraw from the 
region after ten successful years.

Construction markets and outlook
We enter the new financial year with strong order 
books and a healthy pipeline of ‘probable’ awards 
which, together, secure around 93% of our targeted 
revenues for 2010 and around half of our target for 
2011. Whilst there may be uncertainties around 
the level of future construction markets we are 
better placed than many of our competitors to 
win further construction work and to increase our 
market share whilst maintaining a healthy margin. 
The main factors that differentiate Kier from our 
competitors are:
 our wide geographic regional network of 32 
offices across the uK giving the businesses 
strong integration into local communities, our 
client base and our supply chain;
 our strong central co-ordination of national 
clients;
 a good track record of performance delivery;
 a strong Group balance sheet;
 an ability to manage smaller contracts;
 a strong safety record, which is of increasing 
importance to clients; and
 a culture of client service that creates repeat 
business for the Group.
With these winning themes we are well positioned 
to continue to attract new business. Moreover, our 
framework agreements in both the public and private 
sectors continue to provide us with a good long-term 
and steady stream of work. on the current national 
P21 healthcare framework we have been successful 
in winning 22 schemes of the 34 on which we were 
short-listed last year and on the Academies frame-
work we have been awarded the contract or preferred 
bidder status on 12 out of 17 of the schemes for 
which we bid. We are currently bidding for the 
follow-on for both of these frameworks: Academies 
2 which has a national value of £4bn and is sched-
uled to start in november 2009; and P21+ which 
is anticipated to have a national value of £700m 
per annum for six years. We have now started work 
as one of three contractors identified by Argent for 
their £2.4bn Central Framework contract at King’s 
Cross which includes around 8m sq ft of mixed-use 
development over a 10 to 15-year period.
in the energy sector our status and exemplary 
track record continues to attract work. We are bidding 
for the planned Kingsnorth coal-fired power station, 
which will include carbon-capture technology, and 
for planned nuclear power stations across the uK, 
starting with eDF’s proposed nuclear power station 
at Hinckley.
o verseas we are looking at opportunities in 
Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong.

revenue in Support Services rose 11.2% to £437.9m 
(2008: £393.7m). operating profit, before deducting 
the amortisation of intangibles of £2.2m, increased 
by 10.5% to £17.9m (2008: £16.2m) maintaining 
the margin at 4.1%. once again, the cash position 
within the division was strong with £19.3m generated 
during the year to give a year-end cash balance of 
£36.7m (2008: £17.4m) which includes our invest-
ment in plant of £18m. The order books have grown 
to £2,292m at 30 June 2009 (2008: £2,023m), 
reflecting an expansion of existing contracts together 
with the award of a £600m contract for north Tyneside 
Council which was signed in September 2009.
The largest and fastest growing business stream 
is Building Maintenance, with revenue in the year up 
14.0% to £329.1m (2008: £288.7m). We recently 
signed a £600m contract with n orth Tyneside Council 
to repair and maintain its social housing stock and 
other council-owned property for an initial ten-year 
term, extendable for a further five years which could 
take the value to £900m. The contract, which started 
at the beginning of September 2009, entailed the 
transfer of 500 council employees to Kier to carry 
out reactive and planned maintenance to 16,000 
council homes and to council-owned buildings. n orth 
Tyneside joins Kier’s already well-established large 
portfolio of local authority outsourcing contracts 
as well as long-term contracts with many l ondon 
boroughs and brings the total number of public 
sector homes maintained by Kier to over 240,000.
Kier Building Maintenance has also been awarded 
a £3m per annum Decent Homes contract for seven 
years within the l ondon Borough of Southwark and 
has been short-listed for its housing planned mainte-
nance contract worth up to £25m per annum for 
five years.
Kier Facilities Services, which focuses on facili-
ties management outsourcing, and mechanical & 
electrical installation and maintenance, generated 
£92.9m of revenue in the year (2008: £102.1m). 
in partnership with Kier Asset Partnership Services 
(KAPS), Kier Facilities Services formed an integrated 
property and facilities management solution to 
manage Sheffield City Council’s corporate property 
portfolio under a £60m contract. The business 
provides facilities management services to around 
300 properties, delivering cleaning, catering, events 
management, security, CCTV monitoring and mail 
services through a more streamlined, efficient and 
cost-effective process.
We were pleased to have renewed our facilities 
management contract with a leading financial 
services company to deliver a range of services 
across their uK portfolio and we were appointed by 
Surrey County Council to undertake a £44m contract 
over the next four years to maintain their mechanical 
and electrical installations and the fabric of the 
council-owned properties.
Kier Plant has had a challenging, but successful 
year. The economic climate has seen a reduction 
in both residential and construction opportunities. 
However we are investing in selective new equipment 
and continue to deliver quality equipment to Kier 
companies and the external market.
Support Services comprises four business streams: Kier 
Building Maintenance, which provides both reactive and planned 
maintenance, largely to local authorities; Kier Facilities Services, 
providing facilities management as well as mechanical & electrical 
services maintenance to public and private sector clients; Kier Street 
Services, providing services within the waste and recycling, street 
scene and grounds maintenance sectors; and Kier Plant, which hires 
construction plant to Group companies and external customers.

These long-term contracts and partnerships allow

Conditions within the housing market were difficult 
throughout the year, largely due to restricted 
mortgage availability and tighter mortgage criteria 
as well as weak buyer sentiment. As predicted, our 
unit sales declined from 2,090 in 2008 to 1,141 
in 2009, generating reduced revenue of £150.8m 
(2008: £311.5m). 59% of the unit sales were social 
housing sales, mostly under contracts with housing 
associations, and 41% were private unit sales 
(2008: 43% social, 57% private). Average selling 
prices fell from £149,000 to £132,200 through 
a combination of reduced selling prices and an 
increase in social housing sales.
We generated operating profits of £1.1m 
(2008: £32.2m) before exceptional charges of 
£44.3m (2008: £36.1m). £1.8m of the exceptional 
charge relates to further redundancy and reorgani-
sation costs following the merger of our private and 
social housing businesses (2008: £9.5m). This 
merger has provided additional cost savings which 
now amount to £26m per annum in total since we 
began the business reorganisation. We have also 
reviewed the carrying values of our land and work 
in progress and have written down land values by 
a further £30.3m in the second half of the year 
bringing our total write-down to £42.5m for the 
year (2008: £26.6m). The land write-downs are as 
a result of reduced forecast revenue on a small 
number of sites where selling prices continued to 
fall in the second half of the year coupled with sites 
where market conditions have required us to amend 
planning. Together with the £26.6m provided in the 
year to 30 June 2008 the land write-downs now total 
£69.1m over two years and represent around 23% 
of the initial value of the land bank. our land bank at 
30 June 2009 is carried at £230m after write-downs 
(June 2008: £276m) represented by 6,150 plots, all 
with planning consent, approximately half of which 
were acquired over two years ago. The average plot 
cost, after land write-downs, is £37,000 with the 
southern area having the highest value at £51,000, 
due to larger plot sizes on greenfield sites and 
l incolnshire having the lowest at £24,000 a plot.
There was a cash outflow of £22m in the year 
including the final payment for Hugh Bourn Homes 
of £13m, committed land payments and options of 
£38m and restructuring and redundancy costs of 
£8m. n o new land purchases are presently being 
considered although £27m of committed expend-
iture is expected, most of which falls in the current 
financial year.
our sites are principally located outside major 
cities and exclude high-rise flats. in l incolnshire, 
Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire our sites are 
principally greenfield housing developments. in the 
south-east and Scotland, whilst we have a number 
of developments with apartments, they are typically 
low-rise. We have reduced our stock of completed 
units from 307 at the beginning of the financial year 
to 101 and in many areas we are starting to build to 
provide sales in 2010 as demand returns.

This development in r eading comprised the design and construction of 65 flats above a 60,000sq ft Tesco 
superstore constructed by Kier Southern. it achieves a unique configuration of retail space with affordable 
rented homes above. The end user for these flats was Southern Housing Group and the project was also 
awarded the prestigious title of ‘Housing Project of the Year 2008’ by Builder & engineer Magazine.
partnership homes market and outlook
We remain cautious on the outlook for 2010 but we 
believe that the difficult market conditions which 
we have experienced over the last 12 months are 
beginning to ease. Visitor levels have been steady 
over the last six months and are now showing 
some signs of modest increases; the downward 
pressure we saw on selling prices is beginning to 
alleviate and we have seen price stabilisation in 
some of our locations. We are therefore recom-
mencing construction on a number of develop-
ments and starting new sites in locations where 
demand is stronger. We continue to enforce rigid 
controls over expenditure.
our reservations for the first two months of the 
financial year are some 40% ahead of last year. When 
combined with low levels of brought-forward reser-
vations and exchanged contracts, our order books 
at 31 August 2009 are in line with last year’s and, 
together with our completions to date, they secure 
around 65% of our targeted unit sales for 2010.
We are short-listed as one of two bidders on a £55m 
housing PFi project in Woking which will provide 320 
new homes. other PFi opportunities include projects 
in Birmingham, Hull and Portsmouth. We are also 
bidding as one of four for a local housing company in 
Sheffield to provide 2,500 mixed-tenure homes, as 
well as opportunities in nottingham and Bolton.
We are seeking land-led development oppor-
tunities for r egistered Social l andlords as well 
as potential land swaps with other developers. 
o ur new business model should ensure that our 
diverse land bank is better utilised and this, along 
with a management team experienced in social 
housing, regeneration and private development, will 
position us well to take advantage of the market as 
it recovers. Kier Grou P Pl C Annu Al r ePor T AnD ACCoun TS 2009

r evenue for the year to 30 June 2009 of £64.7m 
(2008: £84.5m) was 23.4% below last year, reflecting 
the low level of development sales within our Property

of £1.9m before exceptional items (2008: profit of 
£11.7m) principally due to incurring bidding costs 
in both the PFi business and in connection with 
the successful tender for the Sheffield outsourcing

Within our Property business we completed 
the refurbishment works for the new uK Supreme 
Court in March 2009, with Kier Wallis, our specialist 
refurbishment business, as contractor. The building 
was handed over to the Ministry of Justice on time 
and on budget in advance of its official opening in 
october. We have now exchanged contracts for the 
disposal of the uK Supreme Court for over £30m 
which provides us with an exit yield of around 5% on 
the post-tax disposal proceeds.
in April construction by Kier r egional began 
on the new headquarters for ordnance Survey in 
Southampton. once this is completed ordnance 
Survey’s existing 25-acre site will be released to 
Kier Property for a mixed-use scheme.
excellent construction progress is being made 
at our 219,000sq ft r eading Central office scheme 
which we sold to Clerical Medical investment Group 
l imited but which we continue to develop. Kier 
r egional, the contractor, is due to complete the 
building early next year and seven of the ten floors 
have already been pre-let to Yell with an encouraging 
level of interest in the remaining vacant space.
Solum r egeneration, our joint venture with 
n etwork r ail, has had a good first year. This 
innovative partnership gives us the opportunity 
to develop seven station-related sites in l ondon 
and the south-east at east Maidstone, Guildford, 
epsom, Twickenham, Walthamstow, enfield and 
Wembley. We have made much progress on all of 
these opportunities with epsom likely to be the first 
site to see development activity. A number of new 
development opportunities are now being added 
by n etwork r ail to the existing portfolio. These 
include sites for the development of budget hotels, 
shops and affordable housing which will generate 
significant future value.
The commercial property market continues to be 
difficult and, whilst exit yields are now beginning to 
harden, rents are beginning to fall. Consequently we 
have examined the carrying values of our develop-
ments and work in progress and have made provi-
sions against the values amounting to £7.3m.
Kier Project investment (KPi), our PFi business, 
had a number of successes. We completed 
construction on the norwich Schools project, 
which now means all 12 of our current invest-
ments are operational. in n ovember 2008 we 
were announced as preferred bidder on the n orfolk 
and Suffolk Police investigation Centres scheme 
with a capital value of £60m. Kier r egional is the 
contractor on this scheme and, together with KPi, 
is working with the two police authorities and is 
well advanced in taking the six sites through the 
planning process. Financial close is expected on 
this project in n ovember 2009 bringing with it a 
£3m PFi investment.
our Developments division comprises Kier Property, 
which includes commercial, office, industrial, retail and 
mixed-use development both directly and through joint 
ventures; Kier Project investment, our PFi investment 
business; and Kier Asset Partnership Services (KAPS),

in September 2009, Kier purchased Telereal Trillium’s 
investment in Kent’s first BSF l ocal education 
Partnership (leP) which was established in 2008 
to provide 34 secondary schools in Kent to be deliv-
ered through three phases of construction. Kier was 
already in place as the principal construction supply 
chain partner of the le P and is active on the first 
phase of schools which are in construction. We are 
now working on the second phase of schools for start 
on site during 2010 and we expect to commence 
working on the proposals for the third phase once 
the second is in construction. The purchase secures 
an additional £300m of construction work for Kier 
and significant additional PFi investment opportunity. 
The consideration for the purchase was £4.2m, of 
which £2.0m is conditional upon the funding being 
approved for the second phase of schools. The 
contract also provides Kier Support Services with a 
25-year facilities management contract.
o ur portfolio of PFi projects now totals 14 
including the Police investigation Centres and the 
first phase of the Kent PFi project. o ur committed 
equity investment in these schemes stands at 
£28.0m (2008: £18.4m) of which £18.4m has 
been invested to date. The directors’ valuation of 
the committed investment of £28m at a discount 
rate of 8% is £50.7m.
KAPS was established to provide total property 
asset management services to local authorities and 
other public bodies. its objectives are to leverage 
maximum value from property holdings for clients 
whilst providing improvements in day-to-day real 
estate management. KAPS achieved its first success 
in winning a seven-year, £60m contract to manage 
Sheffield City Council’s corporate property portfolio, 
which started on 1 July 2009. The contract is to 
manage the city’s approximately 6,700 operational 
and investment property interests and our remit is 
to develop and deliver long-term asset management 
strategies on behalf of the council.
Developments markets and outlook
The forthcoming year will continue to challenge 
the sector. l iquidity remains a key issue although 
there are some signs that banks are cautiously 
re-entering the market and it would appear that 
prices have begun to stabilise.
Through our low-risk strategy of largely non-specu-
lative development, Kier Property is not exposed 
to large holdings of unoccupied buildings and our 
portfolio is diverse. Through active asset management 
we continue to enhance value, especially given our 
expertise in the planning process.
We believe that long-term partnerships, such as 
those established with n etwork r ail and Sheffield 
City Council, offer us the certainty of a secure 
income stream which extends over many years. 
This provides us with a stable platform from which 
we can take advantage of the current market condi-
tions to secure assets at depressed values. We 
will also continue to grow our business through 
appropriate strategic alliances and opportunities to 
partner development schemes moving forward.
As more pressure is placed on local author-
ities to make the most of their assets, the KAPS 
model is well placed to capture this fast-growing 
market. For Kier, the KAPS expertise completes 
the capability of the Group to provide clients with  
a total property solution from inception to long- 
term management.

health and safety
Good health and safety performance demands 
positive safety leadership at all levels. Throughout 
Kier we have embarked on a Behavioural Safety 
l eadership programme that focuses on positive 
behaviours and identifies unsafe acts or conditions 
that need to be addressed. The staff buy-in has been 
tremendous and the results are beginning to show 
in a greatly reduced Accident incident r ate (Air ). 
We believe this focus on individual and collective 
behaviour will continue to raise health and safety 
standards throughout Kier and the supply chain.
o ur Air in June 2008 was 588 per 100,000 and 
in June 2009 it was 404 per 100,000, comparing 
very favourably with the HSe target rate of 906. This 
continuous improvement is inextricably linked to 
our project teams’ positive attitude and our behav-
ioural programme.
people
on behalf of the Board i would like to thank all of 
our people for their hard work and loyalty over the 
last 12 months. 2009 has been a challenging year 
for many parts of the Group and inevitably the focus 
throughout the business has been on cost reduc-
tion and headcount, with the consequential effect 
of increasing workloads for many individuals. The 
Board appreciates everyone’s efforts in continuing 
to pull together to support the Group and i am confi-
dent that, with our wealth of talented, committed 
people, we will continue to steer our way through 
these uncertain times.
markets and prospects
our Construction businesses, with their wide 
geographic coverage, array of frameworks, strong 
pipeline of projects and appetite for smaller value 
contracts, are well positioned to endure the uncer-
tainties of the construction marketplace whilst 
maintaining a healthy margin. our Support Services 
business has a strong order book, a good pipeline 
of prospective bidding opportunities and a growing 
reputation for good quality service delivery which 
will provide the division with long-term growth. The 
marketplace for Partnership Homes is showing 
encouraging signs of improvement, particularly in 
private development, which will allow us to utilise 
our well spread, consented land bank. There 
are a number of long-term opportunities in our 
Developments business which will provide consider-
able value for the future.
The current economic climate will continue to 
pose challenges to our business over the next 12 
months. i believe, with our spread of operations 
and product diversification coupled with the quality 
and commercial capability of our staff, we are well 
equipped to manage the risks inherent in this 
stage of the economic cycle and, indeed, to take 
advantage of opportunities that will, inevitably, 
arise in this environment.

l ast year significant progress was made towards 
our aim of becoming a fully responsible organisa-
tion. Despite challenges presented by the diver-
sity and structure of our businesses an overriding, 
strategic approach to Cr is now in place. We are 
confident that we now have the necessary tools and 
processes to meet the aims set out in our Strategy for 
Sustainability, launched in 2007. indeed, the group’s 
progress was recognised in the year as a short-listed 
finalist in the Construction news Quality Awards  
2009, Corporate Social responsibility category.
Benchmarking frameworks
The Business in the Community (BiTC) Corporate 
r esponsibility index has become the foundation for 
both our reporting and plan of action. We subscribed 
publicly to the BiTC Cr index for the first time in 
2008, with results and feedback obtained early in 
2009. Benchmarked against both industry at large 
and our peers, the Group scored a creditable 58.5% 
for a first-time submission.
This enabled Kier to establish a series of bench-
marks to evaluate its management practices in 
four key areas of Cr (environment, workplace, 
marketplace and community) and performance in 
a range of environmental and social impact areas. 
Working closely with BiTC, we have now undertaken 
a detailed gap analysis and identified areas where 
we are doing well and where we need to improve.
As a result we have set an ambitious target to 
achieve 70%, or bronze performance status, in the 
next three years, acknowledging that the bar tends 
to be raised year-on-year. We have also stream-
lined our Group Sustainability Steering Committee, 
headed by main board director Paul Sheffield, with 
key responsibilities established to reflect the core 
reporting areas under the BiTC Cr index.
in order to address the findings of the 2008 
exercise, the Group plans to significantly reinforce 
its measurement and monitoring mechanisms 
to improve its performance for the 2009 review. 
These are based broadly on the four key sectors 
evaluated by the Cr index but further qualified 
into five sectors to cover environment (and climate 
change), workplace (sub-divided into health & safety 
and employees & training), marketplace (customers 
and supply chain) and community engagement.  
We also benchmark, set targets for, and report 
via the audited and assessed framework of the 
Considerate Constructors Scheme which covers 
eight distinct categories under which we can set 
performance standards.
environment and climate change
To respond to The BiTC Cr index gap analysis we 
have accelerated actions on several environmental 
initiatives, including establishing a Kier Group energy 
Committee. An important undertaking this year has 
been the Group’s response to the 2009 Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP 2009) questionnaire which, 
together with our Climate Disclosure leadership 
index (CDli ) score, is to be publicly available. Taking 
part in the CDP has improved our understanding of 
our position in relation to the risks and commercial 
opportunities associated with the transition to a 
low-carbon economy. 
The Group became involved in several Waste & 
r esources Action Programme (Wr AP) initiatives 
aimed at reducing construction waste, including 
the ‘Halving waste to landfill’ initiative. The Building 
r esearch establishment (Bre ) has developed a 
bespoke version of its on-line SmartWaste tool 
which was adopted by the Group in June 2008 to 
identify waste streams and evaluate options to 
reduce, re-use or recycle it.
Kier has made great strides on its corporate responsibility (Cr ) 
journey during the last financial year. Having put in place several 
nationally recognised frameworks and processes upon which to 
build our Group-wide targets, benchmarking and audit procedures 
during the previous year, we are now ready to go forward with more 
robust and transparent actions based on more defined objectives.

w orkplace – health & safety
During the year Group businesses continued to focus 
on getting back to basics to ensure that we create 
and maintain safe sites. effective supervision is a 
key factor in maintaining safe sites. The Group is 
committed to all supervisors on construction sites 
holding the Site Supervisors Safety Training Scheme 
(SSSTS) or a recognised equivalent supervisory 
qualification by January 2010.
Safety leadership is viewed as the most effective 
way of achieving a safe working environment and 
eliminating injuries. one-day Culture Based Safety 
(CBS) and one-day Safe & unsafe Acts (SuSA) 
workshops are being delivered Group-wide and 
within our supply chain at management and super-
visor level. 
workplace – employees & training
over 15% of our workforce is on new entry training 
programmes and during the year a total of 1,031 
employees were registered on development 
programmes (2008: 864).
in 2008 we instigated, co-designed and rolled out 
a Foundation Degree in construction management, 
in partnership with oxford Brookes university. We 
launched an e-learning programme on core business 
issues in the last year with over 900 of our staff 
completing training. 
During the year, the Group has set up three skills 
academies, or on-site training facilities and opera-
tions, geared at ensuring that the supply chain and 
tradesmen on our long-term projects at Kent BSF, 
King’s Cross and Stoke-on-Trent City Council have 
access to specific and relevant skills. 
 The Group has recently received the three top 
accolades for people development in the uK: the 
top Chartered institute of Personnel & Development 
(CiPD) for People Management; the uK winner of 
the national Training Award for collaboration and 
partnership and uK winner of the national Training 
Awards for l arge employers, 2008. 
marketplace – customers & supply chain
During the year the Group launched its Business 
ethics Policy which draws together a wide range of 
existing policies and statements introduced over 
time to ensure that we all conduct our business 
in an ethical manner and have the highest stand-
ards in dealing with our customers, supply chain  
and employees.
o ur regional construction businesses were 
benchmarked during the year to ensure continued 
improvements in key areas including our Zero 
Defects campaign, the average number of days to 
remedy defects and customer satisfaction surveys. 
in excess of 15% of our projects were completed and 
handed over with no defects. We have set a target 
of 25% for next year. 
We completed the comprehensive Supplier 
Module for the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2009 
dealing with the environment, climate change and 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our supply 
chain. To be a member of the Kier supply chain, 
a subcontractor or supplier has to complete the 
Contractors Health & Safety Assessment Scheme 
(CHAS) environmental questionnaire. 
Community engagement
The Group, by the very nature of its business 
streams and customer base, is inevitably integrated 
within the communities in which it works.

committee has now been refined and focused 
through functional responsibilities based upon 
the framework and guidance provided by the 
BiTC Cr index. This committee is chaired by 
main board director Paul Sheffield who reports 
back to the Group Board. in this way all of our 
policies, benchmarking and reporting can be 
closely aligned to the key management practice 
sections covered by the Cr index (environment, 
Workplace, Marketplace, Community) and  
incorporate a range of other social and environ-
mental issues. in parallel to this central group 
there are other sub-committees that report 
into the centre, such as the Kier Group energy 
Committee, chaired by Kier Support Services 
director Karim Khan.

accounting policies
The Group’s annual consolidated financial state-
ments have been prepared in accordance with 
international Financial r eporting Standards. There 
have been no changes in accounting policies during 
the year.
underlying profit before tax  
and exceptional items
underlying profit before tax and exceptional items 
reduced by 41.9% to £50.6m (2008: £87.1m). This 
is stated after deducting joint venture tax of £0.3m 
(2008: £1.1m) and before minority interests of 
£0.8m (2008: £1.0m). The share of minority inter-
ests relates to the share of profits from our building 
maintenance outsourcing contracts attributable to 
local authorities in the circumstances in which they 
partner with Kier.
exceptional items
exceptional items amounting to a charge of 
£27.3m, before tax, were incurred in the year as 
follows:
 £m
Pension credit arising from changes 
to the salary-related section of the  
Kier Group Pension Scheme 24.3
redundancy and reorganisation costs  
associated with our Partnership Homes division (1.8)
Provisions against land and work in progress  
 Partnership Homes (42.5) 
 Developments (7.3)
Total exceptional items (27.3)
The £24.3m credit to the income statement and 
corresponding improvement in the funding position 
of the Scheme has arisen as a result of a restriction 
on future pensionable salary increases for active 
members in the final salary section of the Kier Group 
Pension Scheme to the lower of actual pay increases 
and the annual rate of increase in r Pi.
The exceptional costs relating to the restructuring 
of the Partnership Homes division include the cost 
of consolidating our private development business 
and social housing contracting business into one. 
We have also reviewed the carrying value of land 
and work in progress as at 30 June 2009 and, given 
further deterioration in house prices in the second 
half of the financial year together with the decision 
to re-plan certain sites, we have written down our 
residential land by £42.5m. This brings our land 
write-downs to a total of £69.1m and represents 
around 23% of the original book value of the land 
bank. We have also reviewed the carrying values of 
our property development portfolio and have taken 
write-downs of £7.3m, £2.0m of which relates to 
our wholly owned business and £5.3m relates to 
properties held in our joint venture with the Bank 
of Scotland.
taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate, including joint 
venture tax on joint venture profits is in line with 
last year at 28% which is also the statutory rate.

FiNaNCial review
The Group interest receivable includes that arising 
from average treasury balances of £36m for the 
year (2008: £95m). The charge of £2.4m relating 
to unwinding of discounts includes £2.1m relating 
to land creditor balances (2008: £3.1m).
n et cash at 30 June 2009 was £92.5m 
(2008: £143.9m) after deducting £30.2m relating 
to loan notes. £7 .5m (2008: £56.6m) was generated 
from operations during the year after deducting 
£8.0m (2008: £6.0m) in respect of special pension 
contributions made during the year.
Cash, net of debt, at 30 June 2009 includes 
£46.7m (2008: £44.9m) of cash which is not 
generally available for Group purposes, including 
that held by joint arrangements, overseas and other 
cash that cannot be offset against other Group bank 
balances. The liquid cash position is affected by 
seasonal, monthly and contract-specific cycles. 
in order to accommodate these flows the Group 
maintains a range of bank facilities of £110.0m 
comprising £12.5m of overdraft facilities and £97 .5m 
of committed, revolving credit facilities all on an 
unsecured basis. £5.0m of this expires in January 
2010 and £92.5m expires in January 2011.
treasury policy and risk management
The Group has bank facilities amounting to £110m 
and long-term debt of £30m managed by the central-
ised treasury function.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash 
and liquid investments. The Group, largely through 
its PFi and Property joint ventures, enters into 
derivatives transactions (principally interest rate 
swaps) to manage interest rate risks arising from 
the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. 
We do not enter into speculative transactions.

from operations. The Group has a small number

of branches and subsidiaries operating overseas  
in different currencies. Currency exposure to 
overseas assets is hedged through inter-company 
balances and borrowings, such that assets denomi-
nated in foreign currencies are matched, as far as 
possible, by liabilities. Where there may be further 
exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, forward 
exchange contracts are entered into to buy and sell 
foreign currency.
Balance sheet and total equity
The balance sheet at 30 June 2009 includes intan-
gible assets of £11.2m of which £6.0m relates to 
building maintenance contracts.
Total equity has reduced during the year to 
£92.5m (2008: £183.1m) largely as a result of an 
increase in the pension deficit and other reserve 
movements.
inventories
An analysis of inventories is given below:

   2009 2008

The Group conducted a review of the carrying 
value of its housebuilding land at 30 June 2009 in 
accordance with normal practice and accounting 
standards. The review was carried out on a 
site-by-site basis using appraisals incorporating 
forecast sales rates and selling prices that reflect 
trading conditions paying particular attention to 
sites with low sales rates. As a result we recog-
nised an impairment of the housing land bank of 
£42.5m as at 30 June 2009. When coupled with 
the impairment taken in the year to 30 June 2008, 
the land bank has been written down by a total of 
£69.1m over two years representing 23% of our 
land value.
The Group also reviewed the land and work in 
progress held within its Property business taking into 
account the marketplace and in particular reducing 
rents which identified the need for an impairment of 
£5.3m (our share) in our joint venture business and 
£2.0m in our wholly owned business.
pensions
The Group participates in two principal schemes, 
the Kier Group Pension Scheme, which includes 
a defined benefit section, and a local govern-
ment scheme on behalf of its employees in Kier 
Sheffield ll P. The financial statements reflect the 
pension schemes’ deficits calculated in accord-
ance with iAS 19. At 30 June 2009 the net deficit 
under the Kier Group Pension Scheme was £69.2m 
(2008: £32.9m). The market value of the scheme’s 
assets was £498.4m (2008: £538.4m) and the 
net present value of the liabilities was £594.5m 
(2008: £584.1m). The reduction in the scheme’s 
assets is owing to a reduction in the value of our 
hedging instruments, together with a fall in equity 
values whilst the increase in the liabilities is largely 
owing to a reduction in the discount rate to 6.2% 
(2008: 6.7%).
l iabilities are stated after taking into account 
a £24.3m curtailment as a result of the Board’s 
decision to restrict future pensionable salary 
increases for active members in the final salary 
section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme to the 
lower of actual pay increases and the annual rate 
of increase in r Pi. earlier valuations assumed that 
salaries would increase at 1.5% above the rate 
of increase in r Pi and, therefore, the change in 
basis reduces liabilities and, importantly, reduces 
volatility in the scheme liabilities in the future. 
The £24.3m reduction in liabilities is shown as an 
exceptional credit to the income statement.
We have been addressing the issue of pensions 
over a period of several years and in the last four years 
have contributed £68.5m in special contributions 
including £8.0m during the year to 30 June 2009 
(2008: £6.0m). The special contributions have no 
effect on the income statement for the year, but are 
shown as a reduction in cash and a reduction in the 
pension deficit.
under the scheme relating to Kier Sheffield ll P 
there was a net deficit of £13.4m at 30 June 2009 
(2008: £0.7m).
Pension charges of £10.4m (before the exceptional 
credit of £24.3m) (2008: £7.6m) have been made to 
the income statement in accordance with iAS 19.

BusiNess risKs
BusiN ess risK s
Core to our continued success is our ability to 
identify and effectively manage the risks to our 
business. Accordingly the Group has well-defined, 
rigorous policies and processes designed to identify, 
mitigate and control risk. risks are specific to each 
of our businesses and are controlled through the 
Group’s risk management processes. The primary 
risks that have the potential to adversely impact on 
our business over the next 12 months are considered 
to be as follows:
 macro-economic climate risk: The order books 
for our Construction and Support Services 
divisions are dependent upon the level of spend 
in the public sector and the availability of credit for 
private sector expenditure. The Group has created 
a structure to manage and mitigate this risk with 
the following key components:
– a wide geographic regional network of offices 
across the uK providing strong integration in 
local communities, our client base and our 
supply chain
– a strong level of framework agreements and 
partnerships with government, local authorities 
and private sector
– an ability to react to evolving opportunities in 
the marketplace and to maintain a focus on 
cost reduction and efficiency.
 Contract and build risk: We carry out several 
hundred contracts annually and the risks to which 
the Group is exposed are dependent upon the 
nature of the work, the duration of the contract 
and the legal form of the contract. The Group’s 
appetite for very long-term, large, competitively 
tendered construction contracts is limited, 
driven by the desire to manage risk. Tenders for 
contracts are subject to approval by the Board, 
chief executive and finance director or divisional 
directors depending on the value and nature of the 
contract. Contracts in progress are controlled and 
managed through the Group’s operating structure  
and procedures including rigorous and  
regular review of forecast revenue and costs  
to complete.
 l and acquisition risk: The cost and quality 
of land is fundamental to the profitability of a 
housing development business. Site evaluation 
is a key process and site appraisals are carried 
out in detail including external advice where 
appropriate. l and acquisitions are subject to 
approval by the Board, chief executive and finance 
director or divisional directors depending on the 
value and nature of the contract. Developments 
in progress are controlled and managed through 
the Group’s operating structure and procedures 
including rigorous and regular review of forecast 
revenue and costs to complete.
  t he housing market: our ability to sell houses 
depends on the demand for housing which, in turn, 
is linked to consumer sentiment. We manage the 
exposure by ensuring that we closely control levels 
of work in progress to match the level of demand. 
Prices and incentives are reviewed regularly and 
adjusted as appropriate.
 property development risk: Similar to housing 
land acquisition, acquiring the right property at 
the right price is fundamental to the profitability 
of the Property division. The division controls its 
development risk by commencing construction 
generally when it has either pre-sold or pre-let 
the development. Board approvals are required 
depending upon the value and nature of the 
development.
  investment risk: The Group is selective in the PFi 
projects for which it bids, primarily concentrating 
on the sectors where we have established 
construction expertise.
  people: People are the key to this business and 
good people are a scarce resource. it is important 
that we attract the best, look after them and 
retain them. Health & safety is a key feature 
and we have rigorous health and safety policies 
aimed at minimising health and safety incidents 
that may affect any staff, subcontractors and 
members of the public coming into contact with 
our business activities.
 pension scheme deficit: The pension scheme 
liabilities and assets are subject to market 
movements and, although a long-term issue, 
regulations require us to respond to these 
long-term issues over the short term. Steps 
have been taken to eradicate our calculated 
deficit over a timeframe agreed with the scheme 
trustees.
 Counterparty risk: The Group depends for 
its success on the stability of its customers, 
suppliers, funders, bondsmen and insurers. 
Considerable efforts are made to assess the 
financial strength of counterparties before 
entering into contract and to structure payments 
so as to mitigate our financial exposure to them 
for the duration of our relationship. Where the 
Group is particularly dependent on the continued 
financial strength of the providers of key financial 
services to the Group, we take steps to spread 
this exposure across a range of counterparties 
so as to diversify the risk. Kier GrouP PlC AnnuAl rePor T AnD ACCounTS 2009

Combined Code
A statement on corporate governance is set out on pages 47 to 49.
Going concern basis
The Group has considerable financial resources together with long-term 
contracts with a number of customers and suppliers across its business 
activities. As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current 
uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
Donations
Group donations to charity in the United Kingdom were £64,000 (2008:

Policy on payment of creditors
The Group agrees payments with its suppliers and subcontractors on 
an individual contract basis rather than following a standard code. The 
policy is to abide by these agreed terms whenever it is satisfied that 
the suppliers or subcontractors have provided the goods or services 
in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. The aggregate 
amount owed to trade creditors by the Company at the end of the year 
was nil (2008: nil).
Subsidiary trading companies within the Group, acting in accordance 
with the above policy, exhibit creditor days averaging 34 (2008: 28) 
in respect of suppliers of invoiced goods and services and 16 (2008: 
18) in respect of certified amounts due to subcontractors. These 
figures exclude amounts not currently due for payment but included 
within trade creditors.
Financial instruments
Details of the financial risk management objectives and policies of the 
Group along with its exposure to material financial risks are set out in 
notes 1 and 26 of the consolidated financial statements.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006 a resolution 
for the reappointment of the auditors, KPMG Audit Plc (KPMG), will be 
proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting. The directors who 
held office at the date of approval of this directors’ report confirm that, 
so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the auditors are unaware; and each director has taken all the 
steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The Code
The Board recognises the importance of high standards of corporate 
conduct and is committed to managing the Group’s operations 
in accordance with the best principles of corporate governance as 
contained within Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance issued in June 2008 and has complied with it throughout 
the year except as explained below.
Independent non-executive directors comprise less than half of the 
Board. During the course of the year Mr R W Side retired as an executive 
director and no additional executive director was appointed in his place, 
nor is any such appointment anticipated. Furthermore, Mr N P Winser 
was appointed as an additional independent non-executive director 
on 1 March 2009. The Board balance has therefore moved closer to 
Code provisions during the course of the year. Notwithstanding this, 
the Company maintains its view that given the structure of the Group 
it is important that each division is represented at executive level on 
the Board. It is also felt that to increase the number of independent 
non-executives to a level where parity was attained would lead to 
an unduly large and unwieldy board, without delivering any tangible 
benefit to shareholders. For these reasons the Company continues to 
believe that whilst the current board structure does not comply with 
the Code, it is satisfactorily balanced in practice, with the independent 
non-executives having a substantial presence in board debate.
Until 1 March 2009 neither the Remuneration Committee nor 
the Audit Committee comprised three independent non-executive 
directors, nor were the majority of members of the Nomination 
Committee independent non-executive directors. This was addressed 
on 1 March 2009 with the appointment of Mr N P Winser as an 
independent non-executive director and his concurrent appointment 
to the Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees.
Board of directors
The Board of Kier Group plc is responsible to its shareholders for the 
success of the Company. It sets the strategic and financial policies of 
the Group, monitors and reviews business performance and controls 
risk. As part of the Group’s organisational structure (described on page 
49 under ‘Internal control’) the Board has put in place standing orders 
which are designed to ensure the provision to it of relevant information 
on a timely basis, which set authorisation limits and which reserve 
certain matters for the Board or its committees, including:
  strategy and financial policy;
  the approval of financial statements;
  risk management;
  major capital expenditure;
  major project approval;
  acquisitions and disposals; and
  certain aspects of human resource policy, including senior 
appointments, general salary reviews, employee share plans and 
pension provision.
The principal matters considered by the Board during the year 
included:
  the Group’s budgets, strategy, structure and financial requirements;
  the full and interim reports and accounts (taking into account the 
views of the Audit Committee);
  interim management statements;
  the Group’s final salary pension scheme;
  the implications of and proper approach to the issues with the 
Castlepoint Shopping Centre car park, Bournemouth;
  potential acquisitions;
  the implications of prevailing economic conditions and the appropriate 
response to them;
  material operational opportunities;
  health & safety strategies and particular issues as they arose;
  the investigation by the Office of Fair Trading into alleged cover pricing 
by a Group company; and
  presentations as to strategic issues from the senior management of 
a number of the divisions.
The Group’s chairman is Mr P M White who leads the Board. He is 
responsible for its effectiveness and sets its agenda. He facilitates 
the effective contribution of the non-executive directors and ensures 
a positive and constructive relationship between the executive and 
non-executive directors. The chairman is also responsible for effective 
communication with shareholders.
The chief executive is Mr J Dodds who is responsible for the 
operational management of the Group and is accountable to the Board 
for the implementation of the Group’s strategy. In order to facilitate 
this, the chief executive meets monthly with a management committee 
comprising the other executive directors and he also chairs monthly 
management meetings with each of the divisions. He is the director 
responsible for human resource matters and health & safety and 
meets regularly with the director of safety, health & environment.
The senior non-executive director is Mr C V Geoghegan.
Biographical details of all the directors are set out on pages 42 
and 43. The Board considers Mr C V Geoghegan, Mr S W Leathes, and  
Mr N P Winser to be independent.
A table of attendance of directors at meetings of the Board and 
its various committees is set out on page 48. In addition to these 
meetings, the full Board attends a number of away-days annually 
which focus on strategy, material issues facing the Group and 
succession planning. Outside of the formal schedule of meetings, the 
non-executive directors met without the executive directors a number 
of times during the year.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company 
secretary and the directors are able to seek independent professional 
advice if necessary at the Company’s expense. Training is available 
for new directors and subsequently as necessary. All directors are 
subject to election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
The Committee reviewed the performance of KPMG and the level of 
non-audit fees paid to them during the year, which are set out in note 
3 to the consolidated financial statements. The provision of non-audit 
services, other than tax compliance and routine taxation advice, must 
be referred to and agreed by the Committee over a predetermined 
cost threshold and any work costed below that threshold must be 
pre-approved by the Group finance director.
No consultancy related work has been carried out by the auditors 
during the year. The Committee was satisfied, following its review, that 
KPMG’s objectivity and independence had not been impaired.
The Committee agreed and approved the audit fee following 
discussions between divisional management and the divisional KPMG 
audit teams.
The Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed annually and were 
updated in 2004 in line with the guidance and recommendations of 
the revised Combined Code. The terms of reference are available on 
request and on the Company’s website.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the chairman and the  
three independent non-executive directors, under the chairmanship of  
Mr C V Geoghegan.
Information about the workings of this Committee is contained 
in the directors’ remuneration report on page 50. The Committee 
makes recommendations to the Board on the Company’s framework 
of executive remuneration and determines, on its behalf, specific 
remuneration packages for each of the executive directors. In doing 
so it takes the advice of independent external consultants. The terms 
of reference are available on the Company’s website.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee presently comprises the chairman, the chief 
executive and the non-executive directors. It is responsible for monitoring 
the composition and balance of the Board, making recommendations 
to the Board on new Board appointments and succession planning. 
The Committee met twice during the year. The Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on the Company’s website.

 Mr N P Winser was appointed to the Board on 1 March 2009
following their appointment, and to re-election thereafter at intervals 
of no more than three years. Executive directors are required to seek 
approval from the Board before accepting any external non-executive 
positions, although none is currently held.
The Remuneration Committee and Board encourage directors and 
staff at all levels to acquire shares in the Company and to hold them 
for the longer term. This sense of ownership is an important element 
of Kier’s culture and of its focus on long-term performance. As far as 
possible the Group prefers to promote individuals from within.
Board evaluation
The chairman carried out an evaluation of the Board during the year. 
This included all the committees of the Board. The chairman held 
individual meetings with each director to discuss their views and to 
canvass suggestions. The conclusions were discussed collectively 
by the Board and a number of actions agreed. The performance of 
the chairman is reviewed separately in a process led by the senior 
independent director.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection at the registered office and will 
be on display prior to and at the annual general meeting.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the three independent non-executive 
directors under the chairmanship of Mr S W Leathes, a chartered 
accountant with recent and relevant financial experience. The Committee 
met twice during the year in September and February. (The meeting 
normally held in June was held in July). These Committee meetings were 
also attended by the finance director and the head of internal audit. The 
KPMG audit engagement director attended these meetings. The chairman 
and executive directors were also invited to attend the meetings. The 
Committee also met with KPMG without management being present.
The Committee has clearly defined terms of reference which outline 
its objectives and responsibilities relating to financial reporting, 
internal controls, risk management and the application of appropriate 
accounting policies and procedures. Specific responsibilities include 
reviewing and recommending for approval the annual and interim 
financial statements, reviewing the Group’s accounting policies, 
reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management 
and reviewing the scope and results of the external audit.
The Committee also has responsibility for overseeing the Group 
internal audit function including approval of the annual risk-based audit 
plan and monitoring the work, recommendations and effectiveness of 
the function. The head of internal audit reports directly to the chairman 
of the Committee.
At each of its meetings the Committee received and reviewed a 
report from the head of internal audit which highlighted the status 
of the Group risk management processes and audit activity against 
the approved plan together with the findings from internal audits. 
The chairman of the Committee also met regularly with the head of 
internal audit and the Committee has met with the head of internal 
audit without management being present. The Committee has carried 
out a review of the effectiveness of the internal audit function.
The Committee is responsible for monitoring the independence 
and objectivity of KPMG, the external auditor, and agreeing the level 
of remuneration and extent of non-audit services. The Committee 
received a presentation from KPMG on its audit strategy and the scope 
of work at the February meeting which it agreed. It also discussed the 
firm’s professional ethical standards.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
  internal audits carried out to assess the adequacy and effectiveness 
of internal controls. The scope of the internal audit work is planned 
to cover the key risks faced by the business and supplemented by 
cyclical reviews of the core financial process. Internal audit findings 
are reported to the Audit Committee and the executive directors on 
a regular basis;
  risk registers which are in place for each business unit highlighting 
key risks facing that business together with an assessment of the 
effectiveness of controls to mitigate those risks. The risk registers 
are updated regularly and at 31 March;
  an annual process of risk and control self assessment whereby 
all operating companies are required to review and confirm that 
appropriate internal controls are in place and operating effectively 
across the key risk areas identified in individual company risk 
registers. This assessment was carried out on 31 March 2009 and 
the findings reviewed by the Audit Committee;
  regular monitoring, review and reporting of safety, health and 
environmental matters; and
  the provision of a confidential method of reporting any suspected 
fraud or other misfeasance to the head of internal audit.
The Board receives regular reports from all operating units to monitor 
their performance and all directors are properly briefed on issues 
arising at Board meetings.
During the course of the year members of the Board visit all 
companies and monitor the control framework of each business. The 
Audit Committee reviews the appropriateness and effectiveness of 
internal controls.
Relations with shareholders
The Board uses the annual general meeting to communicate with 
shareholders and encourages their attendance and participation. The 
chairmen of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee 
are available to answer questions from shareholders. The Group also 
maintains a regular dialogue with institutional investors to assist in 
the understanding of the Group’s objectives and the Company has 
a programme of regular communication with investors, analysts and 
brokers. Presentations are made to investors, analysts and press at the 
time of the announcement of the final and half-year results and there 
are regular meetings with analysts and investors which are arranged 
through the Company’s brokers so that the investment community can 
be kept informed. The Board is provided with independent feedback 
from analysts and institutional shareholders periodically.
The Company’s website is also maintained to aid communication with 
investors, employees, customers, suppliers and the general public.
Internal control
The Combined Code requires that the directors review the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal control. This extends the directors’ 
review to cover all material controls, including operational, compliance 
and financial controls and risk management systems. The directors are 
satisfied that procedures are in place to ensure that the Group complies 
with the Turnbull Committee guidance published by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and that the procedures 
have been applied during the year.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board considers that the 
Group’s systems and controls are appropriately designed to ensure that 
the Group’s exposure to significant risks is properly managed. However, 
such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risks of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement. In reviewing 
the effectiveness of internal controls, which have been developed and 
refined over many years, the directors have considered the key risks 
and exposures within the Group.
The key features of the Group’s system of internal controls are:
  an established management structure operating throughout the 
Group with clearly defined levels of responsibility and delegation of 
authority;
  clearly defined operating guidelines and procedures with authorisation 
limits set at appropriate levels. These are set out in the Group and 
divisional standing orders;
  a comprehensive budgeting and forecasting system in place which 
is regularly reviewed and updated;
  a formal quarterly review of each division’s year-end forecast, 
business performance, risk and internal control matters which is 
carried out by the directors of each division with the chief executive 
and finance director in attendance;
  monthly management reporting including regular comparison of actual 
results against latest forecasts;
  established policies and procedures governing the Group’s investment 
in land, property and other significant assets, including acquisitions 
and disposals. These include detailed appraisals, appropriate 
authorisation levels and Board approval depending on value or 
perceived exposure;
  investment decisions, including Private Finance Initiative (PFI) projects 
and tenders for contracts being subject to approval by the Board, the 
chief executive and finance director or divisional directors depending 
on the value and nature of the investment or contract. Individual 
tender and project review procedures are in place prior to bidding 
and before contract award; KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a Board committee consisting 
of independent non-executive directors and the chairman who was 
considered independent upon his appointment. The following directors 
were members of the Committee for the year ended 30 June 2009:
C V Geoghegan (chairman)
S W Leathes
P M White
N P Winser (appointed 1 March 2009)
The secretary of the Committee is Mr M D Barton, company secretary.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the 
Group’s website and on request from the company secretary. The 
Committee meets when necessary, but not less than once a year. 
The Committee consults the chief executive concerning its proposals 
(except in relation to his own remuneration) and takes external 
professional advice as appropriate. In respect of the year ended 
30 June 2009 the Committee appointed Kepler Associates as its 
independent remuneration advisors. Kepler Associates provides 
no other service to the Company. Where necessary, or appropriate, 
the Committee instigates consultation with major institutional 
shareholders on remuneration matters.
Remuneration policy
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on executive 
remuneration policy for adoption by the Board and determines specific 
remuneration packages for each of the executive directors on behalf 
of the Board. The Committee also monitors remuneration packages 
of other senior executives throughout the Group. Remuneration and 
benefits are set at market levels comparable with companies of similar 
size and scope of activity in order to be able to attract, retain and 
motivate high calibre individuals. The Committee’s policy is to maintain 
an appropriate balance between fixed elements of remuneration (basic 
salary, benefits in kind and pension) and performance-related elements 
(annual bonus and long-term incentives) and to place much greater 
emphasis on rewarding executives by reference to the Group’s long-term 
performance rather than its short-term results. The remuneration 
received by each of the directors, together with details of share interests 
and pension benefits, are set out on pages 51 to 53.
Executive directors’ remuneration consists of a basic salary 
together with an annual bonus, benefits in kind, awards under a 
long-term incentive plan (LTIP), and membership of a pension scheme. 
The remuneration components are set out below:
Basic salary
Salaries for executive directors take account of external market data 
and the individual’s responsibilities, experience and performance. 
Salaries are reviewed annually.
Benefits in kind
Benefits in kind comprise membership of private health insurance, and 
the provision of a company car or a car allowance.
Annual bonus arrangements
A bonus is paid to all executive directors at a percentage of annualised 
basic salary (not exceeding 75% for the year ended 30 June 2009) if 
Group pre-tax profit attains targets pre-set each year. These targets are 
agreed by the Committee; they are not published externally for reasons 
of commercial confidentiality.
Retirement benefits
Executive directors participate in the Kier Group Pension Scheme which 
has both a defined benefit section and a defined contribution plan.
Executive directors in the defined benefits section accrue pension 
up to the value of the lifetime allowance. Where the value of pension 
exceeds the lifetime allowance, future pension accrual ceases and 
executive directors receive a pension allowance of 20% of salary.
Only the basic salary of directors is pensionable. Details of 
individual directors’ pension arrangements are shown in a separate 
table on page 52.
Long-term incentives
Under the Kier Group 1999 LTIP, approved by shareholders, directors 
can receive awards of shares worth up to 100% of salary per annum. 
Awards granted in the year to 30 June 2009 are subject to the Group 
achieving the following adjusted earnings per share growth targets:
  the directors will receive 100% of the award if earnings per share 
increase at least 15% per annum (the maximum target) over the 
relevant three-year period;
  no awards will vest unless earnings per share over the same period 
increase by at least 5% per annum (the base target) at which point 
25% of the award will vest;
  the proportion of the awards which will vest for performance between 
the base target and the maximum target will be calculated on a 
straight-line basis; and
  no account shall be taken of inflation in calculating earnings per 
share growth.
The above targets were selected by the Committee to ensure that the 
Group would have to attain a substantial improvement in underlying 
financial performance before the awards could vest. Growth in earnings 
per share is the key performance measure used by the Group. The 
attainment of the performance targets is verified by the Remuneration 
Committee and reviewed by the Company’s auditors.
23.4% of executive directors’ remuneration for the year ended  
30 June 2009 was represented by the vesting under the LTIP on the 
basis of the share values at the time of the vesting. This award related 
to the performance of earnings per share for the three years ended 
30 June 2008.
The Remuneration Committee has set a policy whereby it encourages 
executive directors to build up a shareholding in the Company equal to 
at least one year’s salary over a period of up to five years.
Service contracts
The Company has service agreements with its executive directors which 
have a notice period of one year although there is a duty to mitigate 
in the event of termination. As stated in the corporate governance 
statement, executive directors are required to seek approval from 
the Board before accepting any external non-executive positions. Any 
emoluments arising from such positions are taken into account by 
the Remuneration Committee. Currently no paid external non-executive 
positions are held by executive directors.

C V Geoghegan
Chairman Remuneration Committee KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the 
Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU (IFRS) and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards and applicable law.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their 
profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS;
  for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial 
statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a directors’ report, directors’ remuneration 
report and corporate governance statement that comply with that law 
and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable 
set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation as a whole; and
  the operating and financial review which forms part of the directors 
report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities

on the APB’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/UKP.
Opinion on financial statements

of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRS;

In our opinion:
  the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006;

We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us;
  the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns;
  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
  the directors’ statement, set out on page 45, in relation to going 
concern; and
  the part of the corporate governance statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.

CONSOLIDATED CASh FLOW STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2009
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET
CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Kier Group plc (the Company) is a company domiciled in the United 
Kingdom (UK). The consolidated financial statements of the Company 
for the year ended 30 June 2009 comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and the Group’s interest 
in jointly controlled entities.
The consolidated financial statements were approved by the 
directors on 16 September 2009.
Statement of compliance
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRS). The Company 
has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP). 
These are presented on pages 90 to 93.
Basis of preparation
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Group’s financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. They 
have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative 
financial instruments which are stated at their fair value, certain 
inventories that are valued at net realisable value and certain payables 
on extended terms which are stated at discounted cost.
The following relevant new standards, amendments to standards 
and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the 
financial year ended 30 June 2009:
IAS I ‘Amendments to presentation of financial statements’
IAS 23 ‘Amendments to borrowing costs’
IAS 27R ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’
IFRS 2  ‘Amendments to share-based payments: vesting conditions 
and cancellations’
IFRS 3R ‘Business combinations’
IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’
IFRIC 12 ‘Service concession arrangements’
IFRIC 14  ‘IAS 19 – the limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum 
funding requirements and their interaction’.
IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the construction of real estate’
In respect of IFRIC 12 ‘Service concession arrangements’ which 
was endorsed by the EU in March 2009, the Group has continued 
to recognise the FRS 5 ‘Reporting the substance of transactions’ 
finance debtors relating to concession arrangements held by PFI joint 
ventures at amortised cost as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement.’ The effect of adopting this policy is to 
maintain the accounting within PFI joint ventures in line with existing UK 
GAAP (with the exception of the treatment of interest rate derivatives 
under IAS 39), while ensuring that the accounting treatment complies 
with existing IFRS. The Group has assessed the impact of adopting 
the interpretation to be a reduction in the investment in joint ventures 
and in retaining earnings of £3.2m when it becomes mandatory for the 
accounting period commencing 1 July 2009.
The directors have considered the impact of the other new 
standards and interpretations in future periods and no significant 
impact is expected. The Group has chosen not to adopt any of the 
above standards and interpretations early.
Basis of consolidation 
(a) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements 
of the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the Company drawn up 
to 30 June 2009. Control exists when the Group has direct or indirect 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to 
obtain economic benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are included 
in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
transfers to the Group until the date that control ceases. The purchase 
method is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
(b) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group 
undertakes an economic activity that is subject to joint control with 
third parties.
The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted 
for using the equity method. Under this method the Group’s share of 
the profits less losses of jointly controlled entities is included in the 
consolidated income statement and its interest in their net assets is 
included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet. Where the 
share of losses exceeds the Group’s interest in the entity and there is 
no obligation to fund these losses the carrying amount is reduced to 
nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued; future profits are 
not recognised until unrecognised losses are extinguished. Interest in 
the entity is the carrying amount of the investment together with any 
long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the net investment 
in the entity.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly controlled operation, that 
company accounts for the assets it controls, the liabilities and expenses 
it incurs and its share of the income. Such joint arrangements are 
reported in the consolidated financial statements on the same basis.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity at the 
date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment 
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed. Negative goodwill 
is recognised in the income statement immediately. On disposal of a 
subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, the attributable carrying amount 
of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 July 2004, being the 
date of transition to IFRS, has been retained at the previous UK 
GAAP amounts at 1 July 2004 subject to being tested for impairment. 
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent 
profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets which comprise contract rights are stated 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged to cost of sales in the income statement on 
a straight-line basis over the relevant contract period.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Exceptional items
Items which are significant by either their size or nature to require 
separate disclosure are reported separately in the income statement 
in the column headed ‘Exceptional items’.
Revenue and profit recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after 
eliminating sales within the Group. It also includes the Group’s 
proportion of work carried out under jointly controlled operations.
Revenue and profit are recognised as follows:
(a) Construction contracts
Revenue arises from increases in valuations on contracts and includes 
the Group’s share of revenue from joint arrangements, and goods and 
services provided.
Revenue is normally determined by external valuations and is the 
gross value of work carried out for the period to the balance sheet 
date (including retentions) but excludes claims until they are actually 
certified.
Profit on contracts is calculated in accordance with accounting 
standards and industry practice. The principal estimation technique 
used by the Group in attributing profit on contracts to a particular period 
is the preparation of forecasts on a contract by contract basis. These 
focus on revenues and costs to complete and enable an assessment 
to be made of the final out-turn on each contract. Consistent contract 
review procedures are in place in respect of contract forecasting.
The general principles for profit recognition are as follows:
  profits on short duration contracts (generally less than 12 months) 
are taken when the contract is complete;
  profits on other contracts are recognised on a percentage of 
completion basis when the contract’s outcome can be foreseen with 
reasonable certainty;
  provision is made for losses incurred or foreseen in bringing the 
contract to completion as soon as they become apparent; and
  claims receivable are recognised as income when received or certified 
for payment except that, in preparing contract forecasts to completion, 
a prudent and reasonable evaluation of claims receivable may be 
included to mitigate foreseeable losses but only to the extent that 
there is reasonable assurance of recovery.
Percentage completion is normally calculated by taking certified value to 
date as a percentage of estimated final value unless the internal value 
is materially different in which case the internal value is used.
(b) Support Services
Revenue from services rendered is recognised when the service is 
provided.
(c) Private housing and land sales
Revenue from housing sales is recognised at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable on legal completion, net of 
incentives. Revenue from land sales and land exchanges is recognised 
on the unconditional exchange of contracts. Profit is recognised on a 
site-by-site basis by reference to the expected out-turn result from each 
site. The principal estimation technique used by the Group in attributing 
profit on sites to a particular period is the preparation of forecasts on a 
site-by-site basis. These focus on revenues and costs to complete and 
enable an assessment to be made of the final out-turn on each site. 
Consistent review procedures are in place in respect of site forecasting. 
Provision is made for any losses foreseen in completing a site as soon 
as they become apparent.
(d) Property development
Revenue in respect of property developments is taken on unconditional 
exchange of contracts on disposal of finished developments. Profit  
taken is subject to any amounts necessary to cover residual 
commitments relating to development performance. Provision is made 
for any losses foreseen in completing a development as soon as they 
become apparent.
Where developments are sold in advance of construction being 
completed, revenue and profit are recognised from the point of sale and 
as the significant outstanding acts of construction and development 
are completed.
Pre-contract costs
Costs associated with bidding for contracts are written off as incurred 
(pre-contract costs). When it is probable that a contract will be awarded, 
usually when the Group has secured preferred bidder status, external 
costs incurred from that date to the date of financial close are carried 
forward in the balance sheet.
When financial close is achieved on PFI or Public Private Partnership 
(PPP) contracts, external costs are recovered from the special purpose 
vehicle and pre-contract costs within this recovery that were not 
previously capitalised are credited to the income statement, except 
to the extent that the Group retains a share in the special purpose 
vehicle. The amount not credited is deferred and recognised over the 
life of the construction contract to which the costs relate.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Depreciation is based on historical or deemed cost, less the estimated 
residual value, and the estimated economic lives of the assets 
concerned. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible assets 
are depreciated in equal annual instalments over the period of their 
estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows:
Freehold buildings 25-50 years
Leasehold buildings and improvements Period of lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles 3-12 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of 
the term of the lease or the expected useful life of the asset.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Leases
Operating lease rental charges are charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease.
Employee benefits
(a) Retirement benefit obligations
For defined contribution pension schemes operated by the Group, 
amounts payable are charged to the income statement as they  
fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits 
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method. The charge to the income statement reflects the 
current and past service costs of such obligations, and the interest 
cost on scheme liabilities less the expected return on plan assets.
The retirement benefit obligation represents the difference between 
the fair value of scheme assets and the present value of scheme 
liabilities. It is determined biannually by independent actuaries and 
recognised in full in the balance sheet. Differences between the actual 
and expected returns on assets and experience gains and losses 
arising on scheme liabilities during the year, together with differences 
arising from changes in assumptions, are recognised in full directly 
in reserves via the statement of recognised income and expense in 
the year.
The recognised pension asset is limited to the present value of 
any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions 
to the plan expected at the balance sheet date.
The Group’s contributions to the schemes are paid in accordance with 
the rules of the schemes and the recommendation of the actuary.
(b) Share-based payments
Share-based payments granted but not vested, are valued at the fair 
value of the shares at the date of grant. This affects the Sharesave 
and LTIP schemes. The fair value of these schemes at date of award 
is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
The cost to the Group of awards to employees under the LTIP 
scheme is spread on a straight-line basis over the relevant performance 
criteria period. The scheme awards to senior employees a number of 
shares which will vest after three years if particular criteria are met. 
The Group has the option to make the awards either as shares or as 
a combination of shares and cash based on the share price prevailing 
when the shares vest. The cost of the share-based payment element 
of the scheme is based on the fair value of the shares at the date 
the options are granted, and the cost of the cash-based payment 
element is based on the market value of the share options at the 
balance sheet date.
Shares purchased and held in trust in connection with the Group’s 
share schemes are deducted from retained earnings. No gain or loss 
is recognised within the income statement on the market value of 
these shares compared to the original cost.
Finance income and costs
Interest receivable and payable on bank deposits is credited or charged 
to the income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the Group constructs 
qualifying assets and has separately identifiable funding. All other 
borrowing costs are written off to the income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs incurred within the Group’s jointly controlled entities 
relating to the construction of assets in PFI and PPP projects are 
capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
Notional interest payable, representing the unwinding of the 
discount on long-term liabilities, is charged to finance costs.
Infrequently a long-term land creditor arises for a parcel or parcels 
of land where the Group has exchanged unconditional contracts, and 
so recognised the creditor and the land inventory, but in practice does 
not have title or access to the land. In these few cases the notional 
interest payable already charged to finance costs is then credited to 
finance costs and added to the cost of inventory in accordance with IAS 
23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ and IAS 2 ‘Inventories’. In no circumstances will 
the cost of such land inventory exceed the contracted sum payable.
Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is 
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is also recognised  
in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for  
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will 
be realised.
NOTES TO ThE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED Property inventory, which represents all development land and work in 
progress, is included at cost less any losses foreseen in completing 
and disposing of the development less any amounts received or 
receivable as progress payments or part disposals. Where a property 
is being developed, cost includes cost of acquisition and development 
to date, including directly attributable fees, expenses and finance 
charges net of rental or other income attributable to the development. 
Where development property is not being actively developed, net rental 
income and finance costs are taken to the income statement.
Finance lease receivables
Leases of assets where the Group has passed on substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. When 
assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of the 
minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable. The difference 
between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is 
recognised as unearned finance income. Lease income is recognised 
over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax 
which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.
Share capital
The ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of directly attributable incremental issue costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and where it is 
probable that an outflow will be required to settle the obligation and 
the amount can be reliably estimated.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. The principal financial assets and liabilities 
of the Group are as follows:
(a) Trade receivables and trade payables
Given the varied activities of the Group it is not practicable to identify a 
common operating cycle. The Group has therefore allocated receivables 
and payables due within 12 months of the balance sheet date to current 
with the remainder included in non-current.
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their initial 
value reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts.
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are 
stated at their nominal value. Trade payables on extended terms, 
particularly in respect of land purchases, are discounted and recorded 
at their fair value.
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise cash at 
bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original maturities of three 
months or less, net of bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included 
within financial liabilities in current liabilities in the balance sheet.
1 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the 
exchange rates in effect when they take place. Resulting foreign 
currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at the 
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences 
arising from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the income 
statement.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are 
translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Trading profits or losses are translated at average rates prevailing 
during the accounting period. Differences on exchange arising from the 
retranslation of net investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings 
at the year-end rates are recognised in the translation reserve. All other 
translation differences are reflected in the income statement.
Mining assets
Opencast expenditure incurred prior to the commencement of operating 
opencast sites is capitalised and the cost less the residual value is 
depreciated over the coaling life of the site on a coal extraction basis. 
The total cost of restoration is recognised as a provision as soon as 
the mine becomes operational. The amount provided represents the 
present value of the anticipated costs. Costs are charged against the 
provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount is included 
within interest costs. A tangible asset is created for an amount 
equivalent to the initial provision and depreciated on a coal extraction 
basis over the life of the asset. Where there is a subsequent change 
in the estimate of restoration costs or discount rate, the present value 
of the change is recognised in the cost of the tangible asset with a 
corresponding change to the restoration provision. The resulting impact 
on the unwinding of the discount is recognised in the year of change.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress, including land held for and in the 
course of development, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where appropriate, labour 
and production overheads which have been incurred in bringing 
the inventories and work in progress to their present location and 
condition. Cost in certain circumstances also includes notional interest 
as explained in the accounting policy for finance income and costs. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution.
Construction work in progress is included within inventories in the 
balance sheet. It is measured at cost plus profit less losses recognised 
to date less progress billings. If payments received from customers 
exceed the income recognised, the difference is included within trade 
and other payables in the balance sheet.
Land inventory is recognised at the time a liability is recognised – 
generally after exchange of unconditional contracts.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
(c) Bank and other borrowings
Interest-bearing bank and other loans are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using 
the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of 
the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in 
which they arise.
(d) PFI assets
Under the terms of a PFI or similar project, where the risks and rewards 
of ownership remain largely with the purchaser of the associated 
services, the Group’s interest in the asset is classified as a financial 
asset and included at its amortised cost within investment in joint 
ventures.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the 
contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured in future periods 
at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting change in 
fair value is dependent on whether the derivative is designated as an 
effective hedging instrument.
The effective part of the change in fair value of these derivatives 
is recognised directly in equity. Any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in 
equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the 
hedged items will affect profit or loss. The fair value of interest rate 
derivatives is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or 
pay to terminate the derivatives at the balance sheet date.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge 
accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast 
transaction occurs.
The Group also enters into forward contracts in order to hedge 
against transactional foreign currency exposures. In cases where 
these derivative instruments are significant, hedge accounting is 
applied as described above. Where hedge accounting is not applied, 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income 
statement. Fair values are based on quoted market prices at the 
balance sheet date.
Accounting estimates and judgements
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year, relate to revenue and profit 
recognition and the valuation of defined pension scheme assets and 
liabilities.
Revenue and profit recognition
Details on the estimation techniques used for revenue and profit 
recognition in respect of private housing and land sales, property 
development and construction contracts are given on page 61.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations
In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets 
and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made. The key 
assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors 
outside the control of the Group:
  Expected return on plan assets
  Inflation rate
  Mortality
  Discount rate
  Salary and pension increases
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 8.

SEGMENTAL REPORTING
During the year to 30 June 2008 the Group comprised five divisions: 
Construction, Support Services, Homes, Property and Infrastructure 
Investment, and it was on this basis that the Group presented its 
primary segmental information.
To respond positively to changing market conditions the Group was 
restructured on 1 July 2008, to bring the Group’s operations closer 
together and provide increased efficiencies. The revised structure 
comprises four divisions: Construction, Support Services, Partnership 
Homes and Developments.
The changes to the structure are:
  The affordable homes business, Kier Partnership Homes Limited, 
previously part of the Construction division, has been combined with 
Kier Homes to form the Partnership Homes division.
  The Property and Infrastructure Investment divisions together with 
a new business stream, Kier Asset Partnership Services (KAPS), 
have been combined to form the Developments division. For the year 
ended 30 June 2008 KAPS was a bidding operation and its costs 
were included in Support Services.

The pensions credit has arisen as a consequence of the Board’s decision to restrict pensionable salary increases to the lower of actual pay 
increases and the annual rate of increase in RPI.
The carrying value of land and work in progress has been written down to net realisable value as a result of a further deterioration in market 
conditions.
The exceptional charges in respect of restructuring consist principally of the costs arising from the announcement of closures of four of the six 
offices within the Partnership Homes division and the costs associated with staff redundancies.
During the prior year the Group sold its investment in Prospect Healthcare (Hairmyres) Group Limited for £13.8m which, when combined with  
a refinancing gain from August 2004, resulted in a profit on disposal of £16.2m. (See further details in note 29b) KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Group operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as disclosed below.
Kier Group Pension Scheme
This is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution plan. The assets of the Scheme are held under 
trust separately from those of the Group; the Trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent 
professional investment managers.
The defined benefit section of the Scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002; existing members continue to accrue benefits for 
future service.
An actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken by the trustees’ independent actuaries as at 1 July 2007 using the projected unit method. 
The market value of the Scheme’s assets at that date were £508.9m which represented approximately 87% of the benefits that had accrued 
to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries. The contributions paid during the year were £20.2m (2008: £17.1m) 
which include special contributions of £8.0m (2008: £6.0m).
Going forward contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2007 valuation date over a 10-year 
period to June 2018. The Group expects to pay contributions for future service of £12.8m being 20.3% of pensionable pay plus £8.0m for 
funding the past service deficit in the year to June 2010.
The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Following closure of the defined benefit section of the Scheme to new entrants most new employees are offered membership of the defined 
contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme. The Group is required to pay contributions in respect of those employees in accordance 
with the rates specified in their contracts of employment. The contributions paid during the year and the pension charge, amounted to £5.8m 
(2008: £4.9m).
Kier Sheffield LLP
The Group participates in this defined benefit scheme through its subsidiary Kier Sheffield LLP which has participated as an admitted body in 
the South Yorkshire Pension Fund since 1 April 2003. As an admitted body it was granted a fully funded past service position at that date, with 
assets and ongoing past service liabilities of £65.0m.
The scheme covers 1,146 employees who transferred from Sheffield Council’s employment to Kier Sheffield LLP upon the start of the contract. 
New employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme. Kier Sheffield LLP is required to 
pay contributions in respect of these employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
Kier Sheffield LLP’s pension costs in respect of the defined benefit scheme are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary 
using the project unit method. The contributions paid during the year were £1.1m (2008: £1.1m). Going forward Kier Sheffield LLP expects 
to pay contributions for future service at the rate of 11.5% of pensionable pay which the funds actuary has determined is sufficient to meet 
ongoing benefits.
Other schemes
Contributions are also made in respect of hourly paid operatives to an industry-wide stakeholder pension scheme, and in respect of employees 
who are members of a local government pension scheme. The pension costs for these have been taken as the actual contributions paid during 
the year. KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

Pension sensitivity
The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted. If the discount rate were to increase by 0.1% the Kier Group 
Pension Scheme deficit would decrease by £9.9m, and the Kier Sheffield LLP deficit would decrease by £2.7m.

The credit on the benefit curtailment has arisen as a consequence of the Board’s decision to restrict pensionable salary increases to the lower 
of actual pay increases and the annual rate of increase in RPI. The previous valuations were based on salaries increasing at 1.5% above the 
rate of increase in RPI.

respect of £10.0m (2008: £0.1m) of income losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses, due to the 
unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be offset. Under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried 
forward indefinitely.

Goodwill relates to the acquisition of Kier Partnership Homes Limited in 2002. This balance has been subject to an annual impairment review 
based upon projected profits of Kier Partnership Homes Limited but continues to be maintained at the 30 June 2004 carrying value.
Contract rights relate to the acquisition by the Group of the business and assets of the construction and building services operations of Sheffield 
City Council (£15.8m), Harlow Council (£0.8m) and Stoke-on-Trent City Council (£1.9m). These are being amortised on a straight-line basis over 
the remaining lives of the contracts. These contracts are in partnership with the respective councils who have retained a participatory ownership 
interest and the rights for a minority share of the profits. These profit shares are reflected in the income statement as attributable to minority 
interests. The amounts for the year to June 2009 are, Sheffield City Council £0.4m (2008: £0.9m), Harlow Council £0.3m (2008: £0.1m) and

GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
There are contingent liabilities in respect of performance bonds, guarantees and claims under contracting and other arrangements, including 
joint arrangements and joint ventures, entered into in the normal course of business. The Office of Fair Trading has named Kier Regional Limited 
as one of the 112 construction companies in its Statement of Objections (SO) in connection with its investigation into alleged infringements 
of UK Competition Law in the sector. Kier has responded to the SO but it is not possible to predict the effect of the Office of Fair Trading’s 
investigation on the Group’s financial position or results of operations.

Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily 
to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The overall aim of the Group’s financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse 
effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Group’s treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board. 
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions. Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to 
fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counter parties based on ratings issued 
by the major ratings agencies. Counter party exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counter party are 
within predetermined limits. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management 
following a review of individual receivable accounts. There is no Group-wide rate of provision, and provision made for debts that are overdue is 
based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when 
management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
      2009 2008

Provision utilised during the year      – –
Provision released during the year      (0.5) (0.7)
Provision as at 30 June      3.6 1.6
There are £43.8m (2008: £63.7m) of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, of 
which £32.2m (2008: £41.3m) had been received by the end of August 2009. There are no indications as at 30 June 2009 that the debtors 
will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and 
unprovided. The proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2009 that were overdue for payment was 20% (2008: 23%). Credit terms vary across 
the Group; the average age of trade receivables was as follows:
Construction 41 days (2008: 48 days)
Support Services 26 days (2008: 38 days)
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group has hedged part of its exposure to interest rate movements through a private placement of £30.2m of loan notes for 10 years from 
February 2003, which bear interest on a fixed rate basis at 6.4% p.a. The balance of the Group’s borrowings are to finance short-term working 
capital requirements. Such borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
In addition, a number of the Group’s PFI and Developments joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where foreign currency exposures are identified these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts. KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to 
carry significant net debt over the medium term. The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in 
the form of unsecured committed borrowing facilities. The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly 
and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.

At 30 June 2009     £m £m £m
Fuel price forward contracts     (0.6) (0.3) (0.9)
Fuel price forward contracts have been accounted for as an effective cash flow hedge.
In addition to the above, a number of the Group’s PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest 
rate risk. Interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 25 and 30 
years and are without recourse to the Group. At 30 June 2009 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interest-bearing debts against which 
interest rate derivatives are held is £146.5m. The Group’s share of the total net fair value liability of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 
2009 amounted to £11.9m which, together with the related deferred tax asset of £3.3m, have met the criteria for hedge accounting and as a 
result have been recognised directly in equity.
Financial assets and liabilities – analysis by currency and maturity dates
At 30 June 2009 the Group had cash, overdrafts and long-term borrowings denominated in the following currencies:
    2009   2008
  Financial Financial  Financial Financial 
  assets liabilities Aggregate assets liabilities Aggregate

Other  4.9 – 4.9 6.8 – 6.8
Total  122.7 (30.2) 92.5 174.1 (30.2) 143.9
There is no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of the Group’s aggregate financial assets and liabilities.
The financial liabilities represent a £17.0m UK sterling loan and a £13.4m US dollar loan, net of £0.2m of capitalised finance costs, from the 
private placement of loan notes made in February 2003. The loans are repayable in one payment in February 2013. The UK sterling loan is at 
a fixed interest rate of 6.4% for the term of the loan. The Group has entered into interest payment and repayment swaps for the US dollar loan, 
which give an effective 6.4% fixed interest rate for the term of the loan.
The remaining financial assets and liabilities are cash, short-term deposits and overdrafts at floating rates based on LIBOR.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has £97.5m (2008: £102.5m) of unsecured committed borrowing facilities due for renewal as follows:
       Undrawn facility
       £m
2010       5.0

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with UK GAAP.
A cash flow statement has not been presented as permitted by FRS 1 
(revised) ‘Cash flow statements’.
Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the balance 
sheet at cost less any provision for diminution in value.
Deferred taxation
In accordance with FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’, deferred taxation is provided 
fully and on a non-discounted basis at expected future corporation tax 
rates in respect of timing differences between profits computed for 
taxation and accounts purposes.
Own shares
The cost of the Company’s investment in its own shares which comprise 
shares held by the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust for the 
purpose of funding of the Company’s share option plans, is shown as 
a reduction in shareholders’ funds in retained earnings.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments under the 
Sharesave and LTIP schemes. The fair value of these schemes at the 
date of grant is expressed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Financial instruments
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities are cash at 
bank and borrowings. Cash at bank is carried in the balance sheet 
at nominal value. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost.
The consolidated financial statements include disclosures in note 
26 under IFRS 7 which comply with FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments 
and Disclosures’. Consequently the Company has taken advantage of 
certain exemptions in FRS 29 from the requirement to present separate 
financial instrument disclosures for the Company.
2 
PROFIT FOR ThE YEAR
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for  
the year.
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £4,050 
(2008: £4,835). No other services were provided to the Company.

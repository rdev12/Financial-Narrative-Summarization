INTRODUCTION
The Telegraph: The one share I would buy for both my grandchildren
17 June 2014
“I have two grandchildren, but picking a share for them that I am willing to hold 
on to for 20 years is actually a really difficult decision to make.
“The problem is a lot of investment sectors are prone to change – I cannot pick 
an oil company because they could run out of oil in two decades; similarly a 
pharmaceutical firm cannot guarantee that it will invent new drugs, so this is 
another risky area to buy and hold for the long term.
“So to meet my criteria the share has to definitely still be around in 20 years’ 
time and be an even bigger and more profitable business than it is today.
“With this mind I would buy Bloomsbury Publishing as people will still be reading 
books in one form or another in 50 years’ time, never mind 20. I am impressed 
how the firm has adapted to the way the younger generation prefers to use 
e-books and the like, and I think they will continue to make material compatible 
with new formats as and when they are created.
“The company obviously made its name as the publisher for the Harry Potter 
books, but what I like about it is that its big area of expertise lies in educational 
books. Obviously these books are timeless, but it also gives the firm a chance to 
expand its footprint and revenues in other markets, such as India.”

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
T
he Group has had a good year. Total revenue 
is up 1% and operating profit before 
highlighted items is up 1.2%, in line with market 
expectations. We have also made encouraging 
progress on a number of our strategic objectives. 
During the year we have taken in-house more of our 
sales and marketing activities as we look to strengthen 
direct relationships with our customers, especially in 
non-consumer areas. Aiming for more predictable 
earnings, Bloomsbury continues to broaden its business. 
The acquisition of Osprey Publishing is an example. As a 
specialist military and natural history publisher, Osprey’s 
sales are not reliant on traditional book retailers and 
involve more direct relationships with customers who 
share the specialist interests. We continue to be open 
to acquisitions that help us to deliver our strategy, in 
particular to taking attractive opportunities to increase our 
non-consumer revenues.
Ian Cormack stands down as a Non-Executive Director 
following the Annual General Meeting. Ian has chaired 
the Audit Committee with great authority and has made 
a major contribution to the operation of the Board. We 
will miss him. After an extensive search process, we are 
delighted to announce our intention for John Warren 
to join the Board following the Annual General Meeting.  
He will succeed Ian Cormack as an Independent Non-
Executive Director and Audit Committee Chair. John is a 
Chartered Accountant with considerable City experience 
gained as audit committee chair of various businesses 
including Welsh Water, Greencore Group Plc, 4Imprint 
Plc, Bovis Homes Plc, Spectris Plc and others.  He also was 
Finance Director of WH Smith Plc and United Biscuits Plc.  
We look forward to working with him.  We will announce 
further information in accordance with the listing rules 
upon John’s appointment. 
I would like to congratulate Bill Swainson, Senior 
Commissioning Editor, who is leaving the Company this 
month on his OBE for services to literary translation and 
for his 15 years of exceptional service to Bloomsbury. I 
would also like to thank Kathy Rooney for her 29 years of 
outstanding deal making and reference publishing as 
Managing Director of Bloomsbury Information and as a 
member of our Executive Committee. We wish them well.
There is a wealth of talent across the Bloomsbury 
Group. I would like to acknowledge again the immense 
contribution of everyone in Bloomsbury and, on behalf 
of the Board, to thank all staff for their hard work 
and dedication. The commitment to excellence, the 
entrepreneurialism and the imagination of our staff are 
critical to our progress and to our ambition to provide the 
best possible service to our authors and for users of our 
online services. The overall strength of our Bloomsbury 
team enables us to face the challenges with confidence.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
T
he year was characterised by the consistent 
development of the strategic aims of the 
business – in short, digital investment, a 
greater proportion of business generated 
from academic and professional publishing, a greater 
proportion of sales from non-traditional book retailers and 
a focus on marketing to discrete communities of interest.
Revenues grew 1.5% year on year to £111.1 million. Profit 
before tax and highlighted items** of £12.1 million was up 
1% year on year* from £12.0 million. Profit before tax was 
£9.6 million (2014*: £9.5 million). 
There were excellent performances in the Children’s & 
Educational division, including strong growth from Harry 
Potter titles, and in the Academic & Professional division, with 
strong digital and UK rights revenues mitigating lower print 
sales. In the Adult division revenues were reduced against 
a tough comparator which included Khaled Hosseini’s And 
the Mountains Echoed, but this was a solid performance in a 
year with fewer major bestsellers. Bloomsbury Information 
revenues and profits were flat year on year.
The majority of our revenue comprises title sales, which 
dipped by 4% year on year to £97.0 million, with digital 
sales, within this total, reduced by 4% to £11.7 million. 
Digital sales make up 12.1% of title sales (2014: 12.1%). 
Higher margin rights and services revenues grew by £5.6 
million to £14.1 million and formed 13% of total Group 
revenues compared to last year’s weaker performance of 
8%, and previous years of 12% in 2013 and 13% in 2012. 
The operating profit margin before highlighted items for 
the Group was maintained year on year at 11%. Operating 
profits before tax and highlighted items in the UK business 
were up by 5% to £11.3 million. In the US profits fell by 
7% to £0.7 million reflecting a reduction in academic 
print title sales. Australia saw another significant growth in 
profits by £0.2 million to £0.3 million. In its second full year 
of operation, our Indian publishing business generated 
revenues of £1.6 million and start-up losses of £0.2 million 
before the allocation of Group costs, with a particularly 
encouraging performance from local publishing.
*  Results for 2013/14 year have been adjusted for the change in policy, announced 
in July 2014, for the treatment of amortisation of internally generated intangible 
assets.
**  Highlighted items comprise amortisation of acquired intangible assets, 
acquisition related legal and other professional fees and restructuring costs.
It has been a good year 
for Bloomsbury and we 
are pleased with the 
Group’s performance. The 
spirit of intense focus on 
performance combined with 
entrepreneurial drive saw us 
deliver an impressive result 
against a backdrop of change 
in our industry.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

In December 2014, Bloomsbury completed the acquisition 
of Osprey Publishing, the Oxford-based military, heritage 
and natural history publisher, which now operates within 
our Adult division. The consideration of £4.6 million 
was satisfied by the payment of £3.2 million in cash on 
completion and the issue of 869,054 new Bloomsbury 
Ordinary shares, which constitute approximately 1.2% 
of Bloomsbury’s outstanding share capital. Osprey 
had approximately £0.3 million of cash at the time of 
acquisition. The acquisition, which was immediately 
earnings enhancing, contributed £1.2 million of revenue 
and £0.1 million of operating profit before highlighted 
items to Bloomsbury in the year ending 28 February 
2015. This acquisition highlights our strategy of reducing 
our exposure to the traditional book market. Over the 
last few years many countries have seen retail bookshop 
closures and increasing discount pressure from retailers. 
Although, on the positive side, trade return levels from 
retailers continue to fall and we continue to see the benefits 
from reduced print costs and better service levels. Profits 
from the consumer book market made up 44% of total 
Bloomsbury operating profit in the 2015 year (2014: 53%).
In response to the evolving digital marketplace, the 
development of online knowledge hubs and intellectual 
property platforms have become a core part of our 
business. In light of this, our investment in online platforms, 
which was previously relatively small, has been increasing. 
In a statement in July 2014 we announced that we had 
therefore decided to change the treatment in our 
financial statements of the amortisation of product and 
systems development assets, our internally generated 
intangibles. Previously this amortisation was included 
within highlighted items, it is now included within profit 
before tax and highlighted items. The change has no effect 
on profit before tax or cash. The prior period results for 
the year ended 28 February 2014 have been represented 
accordingly, with profit before tax and highlighted items 
reduced by £1.1 million. In the current year there was £1.4 
million of amortisation of internally generated intangibles. 
The acquisition of Osprey Publishing, related restructuring 
and other strategic initiatives have resulted in £0.7 million 
of costs which, together with amortisation of acquired 
intangibles, are highlighted separately in the financial 
statements.
The effective rate of tax for the year was 8.9% compared 
to 18.7% for the year ended 28 February 2014. The rate 
reduction reflects the recognition of additional deferred 
tax assets, including more UK tax losses. 
Diluted earnings per share, excluding highlighted items,

were 14.73p, up 15% from 12.80p in 2014, reflecting the 
reduction in effective rate of tax. Total diluted earnings per 
share for the year were 11.90p compared to 10.43p in 2014.
The Group’s cash balance net of borrowing drawdowns 
was £7.5 million at 28 February 2015 (2014: £10.0 million). 
Cash outflows in the year included £5.3 million for 
acquisition investment net of cash acquired.
During the year we published 2,415 new titles compared 
to 2,189 in 2014. 55% of these were in the Academic & 
Professional division (2014: 49%).
We continue to reduce costs in the business through 
volume-based tender processes. Having reviewed mono 
and colour print, prepress, image licensing and conversion 
costs over the past two years we will be assessing freight 
costs and editorial services in the forthcoming year.
There will be continued emphasis on our shift to an 
XML-based workflow which ensures that all Bloomsbury 
intellectual property has a standard underlying structure, 
ready for export to all known formats, including print, 
as well as providing a large degree of ‘future-proofing’ 
for any not-yet-known formats that the evolving digital 
marketplace may demand.  
Divisional Review
Academic & Professional
Revenues for the year were up by 12% to £36.0 million 
(2014: £32.1 million). Digital title sales grew by 35% year 
on year to £4.2 million, more than double the overall 
industry growth rate in 2014. They now represent 12% of 
total revenues in the division (2014: 10%). However, against 
the backdrop of a challenging market for print, total title 
sales were down 4% year on year to £29.7 million, and 
were down in each territory except India, which is still in its 
start-up phase. The print title sales decline was exacerbated 
by a higher level of returns following de-stocking decisions 
by some major distributors in the US. The growth in digital 
sales, together with strong rights sales in the UK, meant that 
the division’s revenues as a whole grew. Copyright licence 
revenues included two deals worth in excess of £1.5 million 
each. Licence revenue has above average margins. 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £5.1 million 
(2014*: £3.9 million) and included a £0.5 million one-off 
stock write-down in Fairchild Books.
Hart Publishing, which was acquired in September 2013, 
contributed £3.7 million of revenue (2014: £1.8 million) and 
£1.2 million of operating profit (2014: £0.5 million) before 
central recharges and excluding highlighted items.

Following back-to-back wins of the Bookseller Academic, 
Educational & Professional Publisher of the Year Award in 
2013 and 2014, the division was shortlisted again for this 
award in 2015. It is the first time that an academic publisher 
has won the award in two consecutive years. The division 
was also shortlisted for a third time in a row for the 2015 IPG 
Frankfurt Book Fair Academic Publisher of the Year and 
Ingram Digital Publisher of the Year. 
Bloomsbury Academic’s digital strategy reflects the 
changing needs of scholars, students and librarians. In 
September 2014 we successfully launched a new e-book 
platform, Bloomsbury Collections, which delivers unique 
online collections of scholarly e-books for the institutional 
market on a subscription and perpetual-access basis. 
54% of the orders to date have come from outside the UK, 
demonstrating the potential to grow international digital 
revenues. This new service will respond to the growing 
demand for e-books from academic libraries worldwide, 
offering them direct as an attractive alternative to e-book 
aggregators: smaller, subject-based collections at a 
lower cost per book, and a DRM-free, mobile-optimised 
interface designed around the content. It offers new 
opportunities for users which include scholars, students 
and researchers to discover more easily and make 
the most of the full wealth of Bloomsbury’s academic 
publishing portfolio. Already the site has approximately 
4,000 titles, bringing together innovative current research 
publications alongside more than a century’s worth of 
authoritative scholarship from the backlists of imprints such 
as Hart, T&T Clark, Bristol Classical Press, Continuum, Berg 
and the Arden Shakespeare. New collections in further 
subject areas will follow in future releases, and all newly 
published academic monographs will go directly on to the 
Bloomsbury Collections site in digital form.
In February 2015, Bloomsbury launched the instructor part 
of its major new platform www.bloomsburyfashioncentral.
com, which will cater for the needs of fashion educators, 
students and professionals. From July this year, more than 
140 Fairchild Books fashion textbooks will be available 
in a digital library subscription, for instant e-rental, or to 
purchase in digital or print, along with online materials 
to complement courses. This product sits alongside The 
Fashion Photography Archive, which will include over 
600,000 images, and the existing Berg Fashion Library. 
Fairchild Books continues to be the leader in higher 
education textbooks for Fashion and Interior Design. Its 
largest frontlist ever in 2014 included revisions of classic 
books such as Who’s Who in Fashion, Swatch Reference 
Guide for Fashion Fabrics, Textiles for Residential and 
Commercial Interiors, Design Management, The Layout Book, 
Shaping Interior Space, and new entries such as Design

Genius, Surface Design for Fabric, Designing Sustainable 
Residential and Commercial Interiors, Apparel Quality and 
Designing: An Introduction. We are now the foremost global 
academic visual arts publisher.
Our partnership with Faber and Faber,  
www.dramaonlinelibrary.com, received a number of 
accolades in 2014: it was shortlisted for the IPG Digital 
Publishing Award 2014 and the Innovation Excellence 
Award from the Stationer’s Livery Company. It has also 
received “Highly Commended” at the ALPSP Awards for 
Publishing Innovation. 
Continuing the tradition of innovative partnerships, and 
venturing into multi-media, Drama Online announced 
300 titles coming from Nick Hern Publishing and an audio 
collection from LA Theatre Works. Further collections 
are being added in 2015 and 2016 to make this the pre-
eminent online worldwide collection for performing arts. 
These new collections will double the size of the resource.
In January 2015 we launched www.churchillcentral.com, 
the online offering for the 50th anniversary of Churchill’s 
death. The website is a hub that allows Churchill-related 
organisations to collaborate by contributing and sharing 
content that will extend the Churchill world. Making 
800,000 documents available digitally for the first time, 
the Churchill Archive stands as a digital library of modern 
international history. The Churchill Archive for Schools will 
be made available free for every secondary school in the 
UK, US and Canada from May 2015. 
To support the growth in digital subscription products, 
in 2014 we invested in a worldwide in-house institutional 
sales team. This allows us to maintain control of the 
sales, customer service, marketing functions and data. 
It also affords opportunities in the cross-selling of other 
Bloomsbury products. 
Bloomsbury Professional has 24 online services, with 191 
titles included, and a further seven services in development 
for 2015. Online revenues grew by over 30% year on year. 
The continuing growth in online services is reflected in the 
increase in documents viewed online from 475,000 in 2012 
to 1,400,000 in 2014. During 2014 Bloomsbury launched 
the first online services covering Scottish tax law. Our 
Financial Reporting and Irish online services both achieved 
100% renewal rates in the year. PricewaterhouseCoopers 
extended its contract with us to publish its Financial 
Reporting information in both print and online. 
Drama Online is a subscription service providing a resource for plays, 
critical analysis and performance featuring pre-eminent drama lists.
The Churchill Archive online has around one million pages accessible 
on demand to libraries worldwide. All secondary schools in the UK, USA 
and Canada are granted access to the entire archive.
Bloomsbury Professional presently has 24 online services

Adult 
Revenue for the year was £44.7 million (2014: £49.9 million). 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £3.0 
million (2014*: £5.1 million). Year on year comparisons are 
distorted by the huge success of And the Mountains Echoed 
by Khaled Hosseini in the prior year. His book sales this year 
continue strongly but naturally not at the same level.
We continue to develop our strategy of global publishing 
through the acquisition of global rights wherever possible. 
Many of our top-selling titles were successes in multiple 
markets, including Roz Chast’s Can’t We Talk About 
Something More Pleasant? which won three prizes in the 
US, James Runcie’s wonderful ‘Grantchester’ series being 
shown on both BBC in the UK and PBS in the US, Simon 
Singh’s The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets and 
Charles Spencer’s Killers of the King.
Whilst e-book sales are down year on year, also reflecting the 
success of Khaled Hosseini’s books last year, opportunities 
for growth continue in many territories and the advent of 
new devices and new business models such as subscriptions 
will continue to expand the market. We are beginning to see 
material sales in India, parts of Europe and the Far East.
Apart from Khaled Hosseini, our fiction offering was led by 
Lucie Whitehouse’s Before We Met, Samantha Shannon’s The 
Mime Order and continuing sales of The Bone Season, Daniel 
Handler’s We Are Pirates, Stella Rimington’s Liz Carlyle titles, 
Sheila Hancock’s Miss Carter’s War, Kamila Shamsie’s A God 
in Every Stone – which has been shortlisted for the Baileys 
Women’s Prize for Fiction 2015, Richard Ford’s Let Me Be 
Frank With You and Esther Freud’s Mr Mac and Me.
Non-fiction was dominated by our international chefs 
including Tom Kerridge, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, 
Heston Blumenthal, Raymond Blanc, Paul Hollywood, Ollie 
Dabbous, Atul Kochar, Russell Norman and Jason Atherton. 
This list is now complemented by the launch in March of 
the cookery subscription site, www.cooked.com. Absolute 
Press, one of our cookery imprints, was awarded Specialist 
Consumer Publisher of the Year 2014 at the Independent 
Publishing Guild Awards.
Literary prizes awarded to our adult titles in the year included 
the inaugural Folio Prize, awarded to Tenth of December by 
George Saunders, the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, awarded 
to The Sound of Things Falling by Juan Gabriel Vasquez 
(translated by Anne McLean) and a Windham-Campbell 
Prize for Fiction, awarded to Aminatta Forna.
Two of our paperbacks, And the Mountains Echoed by 
Khaled Hosseini and Before We Met by Lucie Whitehouse, 
were selected for the Richard & Judy Summer Book Club, 
with And the Mountains Echoed being chosen by readers as 
their favourite of all the titles.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
www.cooked.com is a paid subscription site where authors can publish

We had bestsellers in Sod 70, Muir Gray’s guide to living well 
in later life, as well as two titles shortlisted for the William 
Hill Sports Book of the Year award – Alone by Bill Jones and 
Floodlights and Touchlines, an all-encompassing history 
of spectator sport. The acquisition in September 2014 of 
the highly respected Conway list of over 200 titles from 
maritime and military history is a wonderful complement 
to our nautical and military publishing, and The Cutty Sark 
and The Wipers Times, the facsimile trench newspaper from 
the First World War, are already making their mark. 
The launch of River Cottage Australia has boosted our sales 
and market position, confirming Bloomsbury Australia as a 
significant force there.
Bloomsbury India was delighted to continue the 
development of Shiv Khera’s self-improvement books and 
we sold nearly 200,000 copies in the year.
Our acquisition of Osprey in December 2014 increased 
our presence in niche special interest markets, including 
sport, natural history and cookery, as part of our strategy 
to reduce exposure to the traditional book trade. Its list 
is complementary to the existing Bloomsbury military 
and natural history lists. Osprey is the world’s best known 
military history brand, publishing trademark series in both 
print and e-book formats, titles with international appeal, 
covering history from ancient times to the modern day. 
The Military division is the largest part of Osprey with a 
significant subscriber database. British Wildlife Publishing 
publishes high quality books and the British Wildlife 
magazine for lovers of the natural world. Over 50% of 
Osprey’s revenue is generated outside the UK, principally 
in the US, thereby increasing Bloomsbury’s exposure to the 
global book market. 
Children’s & Educational 
Revenue for the year was £26.6 million (2014: £23.6 million). 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £2.9 million 
(2014*: £1.9 million). There was good revenue growth in 
each of our territories. 
The excellent result in this division reflects the success of our 
three-year strategy and has reshaped the team with focused 
commercial acquisition, targeted and strategic marketing, 
brand management together with the launch of a new 
imprint Bloomsbury Activity Books and the Bloomsbury 
Picture Books list. Our strategy is working and our pipeline 
of titles is strong. Our UK educational strategy is to support 
our publishing imprints with digital innovation for today’s 
teachers and curriculum. Our publishing is high quality and 
our ambition is to sell our authors’ and illustrators’ books 
to as wide an audience as possible, while ensuring children 
learn to read and develop a love of reading for pleasure.
Bloomsbury India continues to publish bestsellers.
The Conway list acquired by Bloomsbury has over 200 titles from 
maritime and military history.

Our sales of Harry Potter titles in the year grew by 29% due 
to the reissue of our Harry Potter novels by J. K. Rowling in 
August 2014, with striking new covers by Jonny Duddle. 
Other publishing highlights were Paper Towns by John 
Green, which was rejacketed in January and sold over 
150,000 copies, The Sleeper and the Spindle by Neil Gaiman 
and Chris Riddell, which was published with exceptionally 
beautiful artwork, The Imaginary by A. F. Harrold, illustrated 
by Emily Gravett and The Wall by William Sutcliffe, which was 
shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal with the judges calling it 
“an outstanding narrative adventure”. Paper Towns is due 
to be released as a film by 20th Century Fox in August 2015. 
Picture books and Activity books sales grew by 15% year on 
year and now account for 13% of the division’s sales. Stars 
on the Picture Book list were There’s a Lion in my Cornflakes 
by Michelle Robinson and Jim Field which won the 
Sainsbury’s Picture Book Award and Yasmeen Ismail’s Time 
for Bed Fred which won the V&A Book Illustration Award 
and was named a New York Times Best Illustrated Book. 
The education team launched its first subscription product, 
Music Express Online. It is a dynamic, visually appealing 
website that enables primary classroom teachers to teach 
the music curriculum even if they cannot read or play 
music themselves. Our objective is to see this product used 
in every primary school in the UK – whether purchased by 
individuals, schools or music hubs. It was shortlisted for the 
Future-book Award for Best Consumer Facing Website, 
the BETT award for Best Whole Course Curriculum Content 
award and the Educational Resource Award for Whole 
Curriculum Resource. 
Bloomsbury Spark, our digital first e-book list for the young 
adult market, celebrated its first anniversary. We have 
published 18 titles from a range of authors from debut to 
bestselling. Our Christmas e-novella Mistletoe and Mr Right 
by Lyra Payne will be the first title to move across into print.
Digital sales in the division moved from 4.9% of revenue 
in the UK last financial year to 4.5%, mainly reflecting the 
fact that sales of Harry Potter print titles made up a larger 
proportion of total sales and Bloomsbury does not sell 
Harry Potter e-books; and in the US digital sales moved 
from 16% to 14% of revenue mainly because the biggest 
selling title, I Love You Night and Day, was a picture book. 
The digital market for children’s titles is still predominantly 
led by young adult fiction. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Bloomsbury’s Music Express is the UK’s best selling and award winning 
primary classroom music resource.

Bloomsbury Information
The core activities of Bloomsbury Information are the 
development of IP-rich knowledge hubs in cooperation 
with external partners; the provision of publishing, 
management and consultancy services; and the 
publication of business, management, finance and 
reference titles in print and digital formats.
Revenue was flat year on year at £3.9 million with rights 
and services making up 90% of that total (2014: 89%). 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £1.1 million 
(2014*: £1.1 million). 
Bloomsbury content went live on the Lloyds Bank website 
aimed at their SME business customers during the year, 
following our three year content licence agreement 
concluded in the last financial year. Lloyds will continue 
to launch more Bloomsbury content during 2015 which 
will provide business thought leadership, insight and best 
practice to its business customers. 
Our management services agreement with Qatar 
Foundation has been extended on the same terms to 
December 2015, and the intention of the parties is to enter 
into a longer term renewal shortly. Both the book and 
journals sides of that operation performed well in the year. 
QScience.com, the Open Access journals publishing portal, 
grew strongly in the year with a joint marketing agreement 
reached with Nature Publishing Group. Titles published 
by Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Publishing in the year 
included two English translations of novels which won the 
prestigious International Prize for Arabic Fiction, Throwing 
Sparks by Abdo Khal and The Arch and The Butterfly by 
Mohammed Achaari. The Hidden Light of Objects by Kuwaiti 
author Mai Al-Nakib, who was discovered by BQFP, won the 
2014 First Book Award from the Edinburgh International 
Book Festival. 
IZA World of Labor (wol.iza.org) went fully live on  
1 May 2014, International Workers’ Day, with a launch 
in Washington DC which was followed by further events 
aimed at the site’s target market of policy-makers in labour 
economics in Lima, Peru, in London (in partnership with 
the LSE), and with the OECD in Paris. Visitors to the site have 
come from 189 countries. Press coverage included the 
Washington Post and the Daily Telegraph. The site publishes 
two articles per week on topics of current interest such as 
migration, minimum wage, development and education. 
One recent article, extolling the benefits of companies 
offering employee share schemes has been particularly 
well received.

to provide business and financial content for their website. 
After the end of the licence term to the QFCA, QFinance 
content is now available at financepractitioner.com.
The market for which Bloomsbury Information supplies 
solutions remains complex, but the division continues

and publishing services and other innovative business 
opportunities for the Group.
Outlook
Since the year end, trading has been good across all 
divisions, with the UK and US showing particular strength, 
with such titles as Celia Imrie’s Not Quite Nice, Children 
of the Stone by Sandy Tolan, the Harry Potter box set 
and the re-jacketed Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s 
Stone by J. K. Rowling. Bloomsbury’s excellent publishing 
programme for 2015/16 includes Sweet Caress by William 
Boyd, Big Magic by Elizabeth Gibert, The Heart Goes Last by 
Margaret Atwood, The Sunlit Night by Rebecca Dinerstein, 
the illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s 
Stone and new cookery titles from Tom Kerridge, Paul 
Hollywood, Frances Quinn, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall 
and Russell Norman among others. Books with TV tie-ins 
include Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke 
and the second Grantchester Mysteries novel, Sidney 
Chambers and the Perils of the Night by James Runcie.
Bloomsbury continues its strategy of growing academic, 
professional, special interest and educational revenues 
to reduce the overall exposure of the business to the 
traditional book market. During 2015/16 we will also 
continue our focus on digital publishing, launching the 
new online portals Bloomsbury Fashion Central and the 
Fashion Photography Archive.
We look forward to delivering continued success.

GROUP OVERVIEW
GROUP STRATEGIC SUMMARY
Bloomsbury is a global fully integrated publisher of 
books and other media for general readers, children, 
students, researchers and professionals. Bloomsbury 
offers authors access to these multiple markets in 
multiple formats throughout the world: in print, through 
e-books, through digital downloads and apps; in schools, 
in libraries, in universities, and in terrestrial and internet 
bookshops, with entrepreneurial teams in New York, 
London, New Delhi and Sydney serving all territories. 
Our overall strategy is unchanged and is to grow a 
high quality global publishing business delivering high 
value to its authors and other contributors, readers and 
shareholders. We achieve this by:
 ✷ Publishing authors and works of excellence and 
originality; 
 ✷ Delivering professional services to those seeking 
publication; 
 ✷ Combining tradition and technology to achieve 
excellence; and
 ✷ Establishing solid profit streams. 
Key areas of focus and the progress we have made in the year are as follows:
Area of focus Reason for the focus Progress in the year
Growing non-consumer* 
revenues so that they 
match or exceed our 
consumer revenues.
Non–consumer revenues have higher 
margins, are generally a more predictable 
revenue stream, are less reliant on the retail 
bookshop environment and have more 
digital opportunities. They are typically 
derived from our Academic & Professional 
and Information divisions and Educational 
and Special Interest books. 
In December 2014 we acquired Osprey 
Publishing, a special interest publisher. 
Non–consumer products made up 39% of 
revenues in 2014/15, up from 35% in 2013/14.
Continuing acquisition 
of rights to publish 
outstanding works 
by undiscovered and 
established authors.
Bloomsbury differentiates its brand by the 
quality of its publishing.
During the year the Group signed up the 
rights to in excess of 1,700 titles. Bloomsbury 
titles won a significant number of prizes in 
the year– these are listed on pages 24 to 28 of 
these accounts. 
Expanding 
internationally in 
English language 
markets.
This reduces the Group’s reliance on the UK 
market and, in particular, takes advantage of 
the biggest academic market worldwide in 
the US and the significant growth in India.
Over 50 percent of Osprey’s revenue is 
generated outside the UK, principally in 
the US. This acquisition thereby increased 
Bloomsbury’s benefit from the global book 
market.
Revenues sourced from outside the UK 
reduced to 33% of total Group revenues in 
2014/15 (2013/14: 35%).
Creating and 
exploiting copyright 
and IP, including by 
licensing information 
databases to support 
major institutions and 
corporations.
This reduces the Group’s reliance on 
consumer revenues and increases higher 
value B2B transactions.
Lloyds Bank have renewed their contract with 
Bloomsbury in the year. The IZA World of 
Labor website went fully live on 1 May 2014. A 
new content licensing agreement was agreed 
in the year with Stephen’s Inc for business and 
finance content.
Benefitting from the 
digital opportunity.
It expands the markets we are in and our 
revenue opportunities.
Bloomsbury titles available as e-books up 23% 
year on year to 16,000. A further 5 online 
products were launched in 2014/15, including 
Churchill Central and Scottish Tax Law.
Delivering excellent 
service to our authors. 
Excellent service is core to attracting and 
keeping our authors.
We have initiated a monthly author survey to 
monitor the performance of the business in 
important service areas.
*Non-consumer: This includes Academic & Professional, Bloomsbury Information, Education and Specialist titles (excluding Cookery) 
The Group is organised as four worldwide publishing divisions supported by global functions. A review for each of these 
publishing divisions follows.

In 2014/15 Bloomsbury increased sales by £1.6 million to £111.1 million generating £12.1 million of profit before tax and 
highlighted items (2013/14: £12.0 million).
The results for this year largely reflect:
 ✷ a good Academic & Professional performance driven by the £6.1 million increase on 2013/14 of digital and rights sales, 
mitigating a reduction in print sales;
 ✷ a sales contribution of £1.2 million from Osprey Publishing, which we acquired on 22 December 2014;
 ✷ a reduction in sales in the Adult division, as expected, following the huge success of And the Mountains Echoed by 
Khaled Hosseini last year;
 ✷ strong book sales in the Children’s & Educational division, due to the success of the Harry Potter rejacketed editions 
and performance in the US; and 
 ✷ successful online product launches including Bloomsbury Collections and Churchill Central.

the Company sold Bloomsbury Verlag, its subsidiary in Germany, following a strategic decision to concentrate on English language publishing. Results for 2011/12 
and earlier years exclude this subsidiary.
On 22 December 2014, we acquired Osprey Publishing (‘Osprey’) which as a special interest business is included in the Adult 
division. Our other significant acquisition in the past two years was Hart Publishing (‘Hart’) which was acquired on 2 September 
2013 and is in the Academic & Professional division. Underlying numbers disclosed below exclude the results of Osprey and Hart.
During the year we changed the treatment of amortisation of internally generated intangible assets, by excluding it from 
highlighted items. Amortisation of product development is now included in cost of sales and amortisation of systems 
development is in administration expenses. Both costs are included in the Adjusted Operating profit figures above. Prior 
year numbers have been represented accordingly. There have been no other changes in accounting policies in the year.

Revenue
The Group’s revenues arise from publishing services and 
related revenue. Publishing services principally comprise 
editing, marketing, selling and distribution of titles either in 
print or digital formats. Related revenue is disclosed in the 
rights and services table below.
Group revenue for the year was £111.1 million, up 1% 
on the year ended 28 February 2014 of £109.5 million. 
There was growth year on year of 13% in the Children’s 
& Educational division, growth in the Academic & 
Professional division of 12%, offset by a decline in the 
Adult division of 10%. Revenues in the Information division 
were flat year on year. Within the Academic & Professional 
division, Hart contributed an incremental £2.0 million of 
revenue and £0.7 million of operating profit, before central 
recharges and excluding highlighted items to the 2014/15 
results. Within the Adult division Osprey contributed £1.2 
million to revenue and £0.1 million to operating profit 
before highlighted items. Excluding the impact of the 
acquisitions of Hart and Osprey, the Group’s underlying 
revenue in the year ended 28 February 2015 of £108.0 
million was down on a like-for-like basis by 1%.

excluding Khaled Hosseini titles in both years. The Digital 
sales movement broadly comprises a £1.2m year on year 
reduction in e-book sales of Khaled Hosseini titles offset 
by organic growth in e-book sales of £0.5m, chiefly led by 
further digitisation of the Academic & Professional backlist, 
and £0.2m of sales growth from our online platforms, 
which are mainly in the Academic & Professional division. 
There are now 16,000 Bloomsbury titles available as e-books

STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The two key areas that drive this revenue are copyright 
licence sales and management contract income. Copyright 
licences include the sale of foreign language, online and 
other rights to our titles. Revenue growth in the year 
has been driven by journals licensing and Harry Potter 
illustration rights, among others. Copyright licence 
revenues included two deals worth in excess of £1.5 million 
each. Management contracts include revenues from the 
IZA World of Labor contract and from our management 
contract in Qatar. The top three revenue sources in 2014/15 
delivered £5.7m profit (52% of total rights and services 
profit), an increase on 2013/14 when the top three sources 
delivered £2.8m or 43% of this profit.
The chart below shows where Group revenues were 
generated for the year ended 28 February 2015. 
Proportions are similar to last year.
Group Revenue by Territory
UK 68%
US 26%
Australia 5%
India 1%
Gross profit margin and operating profit
The gross margin was maintained year on year at 57%, 
despite an additional £0.8m being charged in 2014/15 
for the amortisation of internally generated intangibles. 
Without this, the margin rose from 57% to 58%. Stock costs 
rose from 5% to 6% of sales. They included a £0.5m one-off 
write down of legacy US Fairchild stock and also increased 
because of higher returns experienced during the year in 
the US in our Academic & Professional division in particular, 
with the Group’s effective book returns rate moving to 
15.7% from 13.5% last year. Author royalties and advances 
costs reduced from 16% to 15% of sales , reflecting some 
large provisions in the US in the prior year. 
Group marketing and distribution costs remained at 14% 
of revenues.
Incremental administration costs relating to our newly 
acquired businesses, Osprey and Hart, were £0.7 million 
in the year. The charge for amortisation of internally 
generated intangibles reduced by £0.4 million because this 
year some of those costs are now charged to cost of sales. 
Excluding these two elements, underlying administration 
costs were flat year on year at £34.4 million. 
Group operating profit before highlighted items for the 
year was £12.1 million, up 1% on last year. The operating 
profit margin for the Group was 11% (2013/14: 11%).
The acquisition of Osprey and restructuring resulted in 
costs which, together with the amortisation of acquired 
intangibles, have been highlighted separately in the 
financial statements.

Divisional financial highlights are noted below and further 
information by division is given in the Divisional Review 
section of the Chief Executive’s Review.
Growth in Academic & Professional revenues, up by 12% to 
£36.0 million (2013/14: £32.1 million), is core to our strategy 
to balance consumer and non-consumer revenues. Non-
consumer revenues are defined as those in our Academic 
& Professional and Information divisions, together with the 
Education and Special Interest sub-divisions in Children’s 
& Educational and Adult respectively. In the 2014/15 year 
total non-consumer revenues were 39% of total revenues 
(2013/14: 35%) and profits were 56% of total profits 
(2013/14: 47%). 
The good growth in the Academic & Professional division 
reflects the full year impact of the Hart acquisition, growth 
in digital sales and copyright licensing. Digital title sales 
in the division grew by 35% year on year to £4.2 million, 
boosted by robust online subscription revenue and now 
represent 12% of total revenues in the division (2013/14: 
10%). However, facing a challenging market for print, total 
title sales were down 3% year on year to £30.0 million. The 
print title sales decline was exacerbated by a higher level 
of returns following de-stocking decisions by some major 
distributors in the US. Operating profit before highlighted 
items was £5.1 million (2013/14: £3.9 million) and included 
a £0.5 million one-off stock write-down in Fairchild Books. 
Hart Publishing, which was acquired in September 2013, 
contributed £3.7 million of revenue (2013/14: £1.8 million) 
and £1.2 million of operating profit (2013/14: £0.5 million) 
before central recharges and before highlighted items.
In the Adult division total net sales declined 11% year 
on year, however this is against the backdrop of 2013/14 
being the strongest year for the division ever, with several 
bestsellers including And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled 
Hosseini, Tom Kerridge’s Proper Pub Food, Paul Hollywood’s 
Pies and Puds and the 150th anniversary edition of Wisden. 
Highlights in the 2014/15 year included the acquisition 
of Osprey, the world’s best known military history brand 
contributing £1.2m of revenue; Tom Kerridge’s Best Ever 
Dishes achieving sales of 258,000 copies; and in-line with the 
division’s strategic aims, year on year underlying growth 
was seen in the Adult Special Interest divisions including, 
Sport, Natural History, Popular Science and Maritime 
History. Operating profit before highlighted items was 
£3.0 million (2013/14: £5.1 million) representing a good 
performance in a year with fewer major bestsellers.
The Children’s & Educational division sales were up 13% 
year on year, £26.6 million (2014: £23.6 million). Sales of 
Harry Potter titles in the year grew by 29% due to the 
rejacketed Harry Potter novels by J. K. Rowling published 
in August 2014. The other key contributor to the division’s 
growth was Paper Towns by John Green. Digital sales were 
flat year on year because a large amount of the growth was 
from activity and pictures books, which tend not to sell in 
digital formats, and Harry Potter titles, where Bloomsbury 
does not own the e-book rights. The division saw growth 
in each territory and now makes up 24% of Group sales 
(2013/14: 21%). Operating profit before highlighted items 
was £2.9 million (2013/14: £1.9 million).
The Information division revenue was flat year on year at 
£3.9 million with rights and services making up 90% of 
that total (2013/14: 89%). The core revenue was derived 
from our management services agreement with Qatar 
Foundation; and the development of IP-rich knowledge 
hubs including the IZA World of Labor which went fully 
live on 1 May 2014 and the Lloyds Bank website aimed at 
their SME business customers. The Information division 
operating profits before highlighted items were £1.1 
million (2013/14: £1.1 million).

Acquisitions
On 22 December 2014 the Group acquired the issued 
share capital of Osprey Publishing Limited (‘Osprey’), the 
Oxford-based military and natural history publisher, from 
private equity ownership, principally The Third Alcuin Fund 
LP, a fund managed by Alcuin Capital Partners LLP. The 
consideration of £4.6 million was satisfied by the payment 
of £3.2 million in cash on completion and the issue of 
869,054 new Bloomsbury Ordinary shares to the value of 
£1.4 million.
The acquisition of Osprey increases our presence in niche 
special interest markets. It is complementary to, and 
will substantially enhance, our existing lists; in particular 
increasing the division’s expertise in natural history and 
military history publishing, as well as international sales. 
Over 50% of Osprey’s revenue is generated outside the UK, 
thereby increasing Bloomsbury’s benefit from the global 
book market. 
Interest
The net interest expense for the Group for the year was 
£0.05 million compared with a net interest expense of 
£0.03 million for 2013/14 due to lower net cash levels, which 
reduced following acquisitions.
Taxation
Taxation was £0.8 million for the year, compared to £1.8 
million for the year ended 28 February 2014. The effective 
tax rate was 8.9% (2013/14: 18.7%). Excluding the effect of 
highlighted items, the effective tax rate for the Group was 
8.4% (2013/14: 18.3%). The effective rate of tax is lower this 
year following the recognition of previously unrecognised 
deferred tax assets, including more UK tax losses.
Earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share, excluding highlighted items, 
were up by 15% year on year to 14.73 pence (2013/14: 
12.80 pence) reflecting the growth in profit before tax and 
highlighted items and the lower effective tax rate. Diluted 
earnings per share were up by 14% year on year to 11.90 
pence (2013/14: 10.43 pence).
Dividend and dividend policy
The Group has a progressive dividend policy and aims to 
keep dividend cover in excess of two. In line with this policy 
the Directors are recommending a final dividend of 5.08 
pence per share, which subject to shareholder approval at 
our Annual General Meeting on 23 July 2015 will be paid 
on 23 September 2015 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 28 August 2015. Together with the 
interim dividend, this makes a total dividend for the year 
ended 28 February 2015 of 6.10 pence per share, a 4.8% 
increase on the 5.82 pence dividend for the year ended 28 
February 2014. Over the past ten years the dividend has 
increased at a compound annual growth rate of 7%.

Increase 13.4 5.2 8.2
The Group’s key assets were goodwill and intangible assets, 
net trade receivables and inventories. 
Net assets increased by 7% to £124.2 million (2014: £116.0 
million) and net assets per share by 6% to 166 pence (2014: 
157 pence). The main movements in the balance sheet are 
explained below. 
Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets increased by £3.3 million to 
£64.1 million (2014: £60.8 million) principally due to:
 ✷ the acquisitions of Osprey increasing goodwill by £1.6 
million and other intangibles by £1.6 million; 
 ✷ additions to product and systems development 
and assets under construction of £3.1 million (which 
includes Academic & Professional online knowledge 
hubs); less
 ✷ £3.3 million of amortisation and £0.1 million of 
exchange differences
Inventories increased 16% to £29.2 million (2014: £25.2 
million). This includes £1.8 million of stock acquired as part 
of the Osprey acquisition. Stock levels have increased in the 
US following the decision to sell special interest titles from 
our local distributer in the US.
Trade and other receivables were £61.7 million (2014: £56.8 
million). The acquisition of Osprey added £1.5 million to 
trade receivables and there was an increase of £3.4 million 
in trade receivables from increased trading.
Since books sold are generally returnable by customers, 
the Group makes a provision against books sold in the 
accounting year. The unused provision at the year end is 
then carried forward and offset against trade receivables 
in the balance sheet, in anticipation of further book 
returns subsequent to the year end. A provision for the 
Group of £6.1 million (2014: £4.7 million) for future returns 
relating to 2014/15 and prior year sales has been carried 
forward in trade receivables at the balance sheet date. This 
provision was 16% of gross trade receivables (2014: 15%), 
reflecting the higher level of returns within our Academic 
& Professional division and the Adult division’s year with 
fewer major bestsellers.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Equity and liabilities
At 28 February 2015 total equity was £124.2 million (2014: 
£116.0 million). The increase of £8.2 million was due to 
an increase of £2.0 million from cumulative currency 
translations, recognition of a merger reserve of £1.4 million 
from the acquisition of Osprey, the retained profit for the 
year of £8.7 million (2013/14: £7.7 million) after highlighted 
items of £2.5 million (2013/14: after highlighted items of 
£2.5 million), offset by share based payment transactions 
of £0.4 million and dividends of £4.3 million (2013/14: £4.0 
million).
Current liabilities increased 13% to £42.6 million (2014: 
£37.8 million). Trade payables increased to £18.7 million 
(2014: £13.7 million) due to an increase in trading levels 
and £1.1 million coming in from Osprey. Accruals and 
deferred income, which is included in trade and other 
payables, decreased to £16.5 million (2014: £17.5 million). 
This includes deferred income on database contracts, 
subscription revenues and royalty payments due to 
authors, which vary year on year depending on revenue 
and authors’ royalty rates. Other payables of £1.5 million 
(2014: £3.4 million) decreased by £1.9m which included 
£2.0 million to cover the third and final instalment of 
the Fairchild Books and AVA purchase prices. Provisions 
decreased to £0.02 million (2014: £0.5 million) due to the 
£0.5 million earned out for the acquisition of Hart.
Non-current liabilities increased by 10% to £4.7 million 
(2014: £4.3 million). Within that other payables increased to 
£0.9 million (2014: £0.6 million). The deferred tax liability of 
£3.1 million primarily relates to intangible assets arising on 
acquisitions. This is reducing as the relevant intangibles are 
amortised.
Cash 
Cash and cash equivalents were £10.0 million at the 
year end (2014: £10.0 million). The net cash inflow from 
operating activities, including the effect of highlighted 
items, was £10.2 million, £0.9 million down on 2013/14. This 
difference is materially the net of an increase in Group 
inventories and lower taxes paid in the year. Investing 
activities for the year ended 28 February 2015 resulted in an 
outflow of £9.1 million (2013/14: £11.0 million) largely from 
the acquisition of Osprey, the final instalment payments for 
Fairchild and AVA acquired in 2012 totalling £1.9 million, 
the payment of £0.5 million Hart contingent consideration 
and investment in product and systems development; the 
outflow in 2013/14 included £6.2 million for the acquisition 
of Hart. The net cash of £1.7 million used in financing 
activities was predominantly made up of dividend 
payments of £4.3 million (2013/14: £4.0 million) net of a 
£2.5 million drawdown of the revolving credit facility at the 
year end (2014: £nil). 
Liquidity 
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility with 
Lloyds Bank plc. At 28 February 2015 the Group had at 
its disposal £13 million of undrawn borrowing facilities 
(2014: £12 million) comprising an £11 million committed 
revolving loan facility and a £2 million overdraft. The 
overdraft facility is available until November 2015 and the 
loan facility matures in May 2016. The facility is subject to 
two covenants being a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio 
and a minimum interest cover covenant. 
 The Group’s net cash position changes over the course 
of the year as a result of the seasonality of the business 
with the most significant expenses being the payment of 
royalties in March and September and the most significant 
sale receipts being in February from the Christmas sales.

Overview of Bloomsbury’s processes
Bloomsbury is an independent publisher and has been 
listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange 
since 1994. Over a period of more than 25 years the 
business has built up a substantial body of publishing 
rights.
The Group is structured as four fully integrated worldwide 
publishing divisions – Adult, Children’s & Educational, 
Academic & Professional and Information – under a 
global brand supported by centralised sales, marketing, 
production and head office functions. Each publishing 
division reports to the Chief Executive. The Group 
encourages each publishing division to develop and grow 
diversified income streams. Each division has the capability 
to publish books in all formats but may also produce 
other products such as online content accessible through 
subscription. Each division may also use its expertise to 
provide publishing related services to clients. 
Book publishing
Book publishing (e-books, printed books etc.) is the main 
activity of Bloomsbury. This generates two core income 
streams: book sales and rights sales. 
In competition with other publishers, Bloomsbury’s 
publishing teams acquire the intellectual property rights 
to publish the works of authors. Ultimately, the authors and 
their literary agents control which rights each publisher 
acquires. Bloomsbury focuses on publishing worldwide in 
English but getting the specific rights desired can entail 
acquiring an assortment of other rights. Bloomsbury 
re-sells on to other publishers any rights it does not 
need, which generates an income stream. When it makes 
financial sense, Bloomsbury also sells the publishing rights 
to titles in its extensive backlist e.g. for a book in a series 
published by another publisher which is valuable to them 
to complete the series.
Bloomsbury sells its own books typically through online 
retailers such as Amazon, through bookshops, through 
supermarkets and direct to customers.
Bloomsbury’s global production function produces books 
in all formats. Bloomsbury has produced e-books since 
2005 and as an early adopter benefited from the worldwide 
growth in e-book sales. Printed books that are sold through 
retail outlets are normally sold on a sale-or-return basis. 
The Group does not print its own books but subcontracts 
the printing, warehouse storage and distribution of printed 
books to a number of long-term global partners.

RISK FACTORS
Group strategic actions to mitigate the risks 
The Group focuses on improving its processes in order to 
address the identified risks and has implemented a number 
of key initiatives including: 
Repositioning the business towards non-trade 
revenues 
Bloomsbury is a cash generative business and has enjoyed 
the benefit of publishing many bestselling titles over a 
prolonged period. Bloomsbury has balanced its core 
general trade publishing business with academic and 
professional publishing. This addresses a number of risks: 
 ✷ Long-term growth potential, less sales volatility 
and higher margins: The demand for academic 
and professional books is more regular which reduces 
the volatility of book sales compared to general trade 
publishing. 
 ✷ Barriers to entry: Since acquiring Methuen Drama in 
2006, Bloomsbury has continuously invested in growing 
its academic publishing business through organic 
growth and acquisitions of publishing businesses, lists 
of academic books and online databases. The time, 
cost and expertise required to build up an academic 
publisher acts as a barrier to entry for significant new 
competitors. 
 ✷ Established business: Bloomsbury continues to 
successfully develop its established position in the 
professional publishing market. 
 ✷ Exploiting intellectual property: Bloomsbury is 
developing innovative academic online products 
which are sold under annual subscriptions and which 
exploit the Group’s content assets and expertise. 
 ✷ Lower risk: Academic publishing acquisitions require 
lower advances and have lower returns of unsold 
copies from booksellers relative to general trade 
publishing.
Growth in emerging markets 
India has one of the world’s largest English speaking 
populations and an increasing number of highly educated 
readers of English. Bloomsbury has a growing publishing 
business in India which publishes the works of local talented 
authors in addition to the works of Bloomsbury authors 
with works originally published in the UK and US. 
One Global Bloomsbury 
Bloomsbury is structured as four worldwide publishing 
divisions under a global brand supported by centralised 
group sales, marketing, production and head office 
functions. This ‘One Global Bloomsbury’ structure 
addresses a number of risks and process issues: 
 ✷ Extended territorial reach of the sales and 
marketing teams: Sales and marketing teams are 
unified into a single global function to meet the needs 
of a worldwide market. 
 ✷ Editorial economies of scale: Regional editorial 
teams based close to authors focus on acquiring world 
English rights for exploiting by the Group.
 ✷ Functional economies of scale: The book 
production function (which takes finalised scripts from 
editorial teams and converts them into e-books and/or 
printed books), Finance and IT teams have been unified 
into global functions to support the Bloomsbury 
publishing teams based in different territories 
worldwide.
 ✷ Worldwide systems and processes: The Group 
has implemented centralised publishing and finance 
systems worldwide across the business allowing the 
global team to work closely together.

STRATEGIC REPORT GROUP OVERVIEW
The table below provides a description of risk factors that management considers relevant to the Group’s business. Other 
factors besides those listed could also affect the Group. 
Key area Risk Description Mitigation
Market Volatility of general 
trade book sales
Sales of general trade books 
for both children and adults 
focus on bestsellers and can be 
both seasonal and volatile
Develop special interest, academic and 
professional publishing where revenues 
are less volatile
Develop other revenue streams 
including from rights and services 
increasing the scope to enter annually 
renewing agreements.
Increased importance 
of internet retailing
Internet retailing is a key sales 
channel.
Grow expert marketing teams skilled 
in digital who understand the book 
buying behaviours of readers.
Engage with multiple internet retailers.
Increase focus on developing other 
marketing opportunities and other 
revenue streams e.g. rights and services
Grow e-book sales
Rights and 
Services
Volatility of timing 
of closing rights and 
services deals
The timing for completing 
high margin rights and 
services deals can depend on 
the performance by multiple 
parties including the main 
customer
Increase the number of rights 
and services deals to reduce the 
dependency on individual deals.
Non-renewal of larger 
subscription and 
services agreements
The customer or partner might 
not renew agreements that 
generate significant ongoing 
income
Senior managers responsible for 
ensuring strong performance by 
Bloomsbury of its obligations and 
strong customer care.
Increase the portfolio of agreements to 
reduce the dependency on individual 
agreements.
Entrepreneurial risk A deal may require upfront 
staff time and costs but may 
fail to close resulting in lost 
investment
Similar to ordinary publishing risks: 
increase the portfolio of deals to 
leverage economies of scale and 
absorb volatility
Move to digital E-book sales plateau Rise in e-book sales in US and 
UK may slow
Ensure Group is positioned to take 
advantage of e-book emergence in 
international markets
Use social media and other digital 
marketing to encourage direct sales to 
consumers
Continue to supply books in all formats 
through multiple digital delivery 
systems aligned with the demands of 
readers.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Bloomsbury’s core business is the worldwide promotion of 
literature and information for readers of all ages, which has a high 
social value. We aim for integrity in all our activities, consider 
our impact on society and the environment and maintain high 
ethical standards. This is key to our commercial success, and ability 
to deliver good returns to our shareholders, which depends on 
attracting and retaining talented authors who want us to publish 
them and customers who want to buy our products.
T
he Board recognises that the achievements 
of the Group have depended upon the high 
standards of social responsibility demonstrated 
by the Directors and employees for more than 
twenty five years. The Board takes account of the relevant 
social, environmental and ethical issues and associated risks 
and opportunities to the Group’s short-term and long-
term value. The company continues to be included in the 
FTSE4good index.
Community 
Bloomsbury has a significant direct beneficial impact on 
the community through its commercial activities. Our 
publishing teams share a common passion for promoting 
the enjoyment of reading and high quality literature 
that is often cutting edge and provides new authors with 
opportunities to establish themselves. We have a substantial 
Children’s & Educational division focused on promoting 
literacy for young readers of all abilities and ages including 
specialist ranges for ‘Hi-Low’ pupils (high age, low 
attainment) which provide parents and teachers with the 
tools needed to engage their children in reading.
Support by Bloomsbury
Incremental to our direct commercial activities and with 
a focus mainly on promoting literature, literacy and 
education, we actively support numerous organisations 
worldwide including schools, universities, libraries and 
other good causes and charities. The following examples 
illustrate the range of our support worldwide:
Corporate volunteering and educational 
development
 ✷ A Bloomsbury UK employee recently travelled to Nigeria 
to train 170 teachers on the importance of reading and 
how to set up an effective classroom library.
 ✷ Our India office in partnership with the Hope 
Foundation published ‘Ten Steps To Good Health’, 
a guide for children particularly in schools in non-
urban areas. The book is being promoted through the 
India state education system for distribution to school 
children. Our Australia office supports Indigenous 
Literacy Foundation events.
 ✷ Bloomsbury’s Chief Executive is President of Book Aid 
International that gifts approximately 500,000 books a 
year to libraries in Africa.
 ✷ We provide work experience days for secondary school 
pupils and sponsor achievement prizes for students 
within US and UK universities. We invite students to visit 
us for presentations on working in publishing.
Corporate donating
 ✷ Our Australia, US and UK offices donate, or provide at 
a nominal cost, a substantial quantity of books each 
year, which includes donations of mainstream titles 
to schools and libraries e.g. our US office has donated 
significant quantities of books to an organisation 
setting up libraries in Africa. Other book donations 
have been to good causes such as to Book Trust, 
Barnardos, Oxfam, Red Cross and smaller organisations 
local to our offices worldwide e.g. our UK office donated 
books to an appeal for children living in poverty in 
London and our Adlard Coles Nautical imprint donates 
sea-related books to the RNLI for fundraising.
 ✷ The Bloomsbury Institute (the events function of 
Bloomsbury) has organised charitable fund raising 
events such as for British Dyslexia Association, Book 
Aid and to celebrate International Women’s Day with 
guest speakers such as Bob Geldof, William Boyd and 
Aminatta Forna. We organised Writers & Artists writing 
masterclasses to raise money for Book Aid International.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
 ✷ We are a sponsor and partner of World Book Day 
that was established by UNESCO to promote reading 
amongst children and adults. 
We make a small number of targeted minor cash donations 
each year predominantly to not-for-profit organisations 
that support literature, literacy and education, which in 
recent years has included to Book Aid International, the 
Independent Publishers Guild, The Charleston Trust and 
Woodland Trust.
Support by employees of Bloomsbury 
We encourage the spare time involvement of staff 
worldwide on supporting good causes and on the 
promotion of literature, literacy and education. These 
voluntary activities by employees are often directly or 
indirectly assisted by the business and by Bloomsbury 
colleagues. Examples of the many such activities recently 
undertaken are as follows.
Staff volunteering
 ✷ A significant number (over 40) of our employees 
worldwide, both through a Bloomsbury coordinator 
and privately, are involved in formal volunteer reading 
schemes and regularly attend state schools and 
organise reading groups in libraries. These provide 
supervised reading support to young readers often from 
disadvantaged backgrounds where their opportunities 
to develop reading skills may be hindered. 
 ✷ Bloomsbury employees attend schools and colleges to 
give talks on careers, such as in publishing and IT, and 
on reading skills required in the workplace. They also 
assist young people with interview practice and school 
magazines.
 ✷ In Ghana, Bloomsbury employees spent time 
supporting a library in a shipping container, helped 
local children with learning English and maths and 
provided tuition on journalism and publishing a school 
magazine. Another employee visited Togo to teach 
digital communication to children, in order for them to 
participate in the democratic and global conversation. 
 ✷ In their spare time, employees are unpaid public 
speakers at presentations, and they publish articles 
and host discussions, on various publishing topics such 
as Open Access, how to write books and be published 
and careers in publishing. Our employees also support 
many voluntary associations such as for editors 
promoting the publication of children’s books or the 
conservation of books.
 ✷ In our offices worldwide the employees volunteer 
regularly to help their local communities and to assist 
good cause such as for homeless and vulnerably 
housed people and for providing meals to sick and 
disadvantaged people e.g. our employees give 
presentations at conferences and use their digital 
publishing skills to support a charity for young people 
living with type 1 diabetes.
Many employees worldwide are involved in their 
local communities promoting literacy, literature and 
education such as sitting on committees or as governors 
of schools and by supporting special interest groups e.g. 
a Bloomsbury employee has established a scholarship 
scheme for a US University and US employees volunteer for 
the New York Public Library.
Staff donating
Bloomsbury employees worldwide often call on their 
colleagues for fund raising sponsorship such as with 
marathons, cake sales and many other employee-inspired 
activities. Our offices will put up teams to participate 
in events e.g. the staff of Bloomsbury Professional put 
together a hamper as part of Mid-Sussex Christmas hamper 
project for vulnerable families, and our employees helped 
raise money for a charity event run by The Book People.
Diversity
We have a diverse workforce and management team led 
by a diverse Board. The majority of senior managers and 
employees worldwide in the Group are women. As at 28 
February 2015 the numbers of employees by each sex is:
Female Male
All employees of the Group

1. Excludes Non-Executive Directors and workers who are freelance

The Board aims for at least one third, or the nearest 
number to a third, of Directors on the Board should be 
women. The Board comprises two women out of a total 
of seven directors so achieves the objective. The Board is 
progressively refreshed and new appointments are selected 
by the Nomination Committee using independent search 
consultants based on merit as the best candidate for the role.

STRATEGIC REPORT GROUP OVERVIEW

Employees and human rights
We recognise that people are a key asset and employment 
policies are directed at creating a workplace that attracts, 
motivates, develops and retains high calibre employees.
Supported by territory heads of human resources, the 
managing directors of the four publishing divisions, the heads 
of each Group function and managing directors of regional 
offices have responsibility for the employment matters 
(including human rights) of their teams. The Chief Executive 
has overall Board level responsibility for employment matters. 
For example, where employment matters have a group wide 
impact or cannot be resolved at a lower level in the business 
then they may be referred to the Chief Executive. 
The senior management team monitors joiners, leavers, 
head count, pay rates and other KPIs but the Group does 
not disclose all of these for commercial reasons that are in 
the interest of the shareholders. 
Key features of the Group’s employment policies and 
practices are: 
 ✷ Openness: Bloomsbury provides a high degree 
of openness and transparency on its activities and 
performance through information provided to 
employees. Employees are kept updated daily, 
weekly and monthly on sales, book releases, project 
achievements, internal news letters, corporate news 
and feedback from external media and other sources. 
The Bloomsbury Institute arranges regular events, 
which enable staff to meet socially. Weekly and 
other regular team meetings and internal annual 
conferences bring employees together from across 
the Group’s worldwide sites allowing team members 
to formally and informally share information about the 
business and develop strong working relationships. 
 ✷ Engagement: we promote a friendly collegiate 
culture in which employees are encouraged to discuss 
their concerns and issues with their line managers 
and senior colleagues. The senior management team 
meets frequently to discuss employee matters and is 
supported by regular operational meetings attended 
by managers covering all of the Group’s worldwide 
sites. 
 ✷ Ethical behaviour: we expect employees, Directors, 
subcontractors and others to exercise the highest  
ethical standards at all times in respect of the 
relationships and dealings that Bloomsbury has with  
its customers, authors/agents, suppliers and other third 
parties. Bloomsbury has whistleblower procedures, 
which it publishes at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk enabling 
employees, other categories of workers and third 
parties to have their concerns confidentially addressed. 
It also has a formal policy on ethical behaviour, which is 
included within employment terms. 
 ✷ Employee development: Bloomsbury is acquisitive 
and has benefited from an intake of high calibre 
entrepreneurs who support the Group’s capacity 
to innovate. The Group develops its management 
structure to serve the changing needs of customers 
and authors. This creates opportunities for suitably 
high calibre individuals to progress to increasing levels 
of seniority as they gain capabilities and expertise. 
External recruitment is supported by territorial Human 
Resources functions enabling vacancies across sites 
worldwide to be filled internally where employees of an 
appropriately high calibre seek new opportunities. 
 ✷ Performance and merit: senior employees agree 
personal objectives and are rewarded based on 
performance determined by business results and 
appraisals. Senior managers are accountable for the 
performance of their teams and determine the most 
appropriate approach to performance management 
for each team. Promotions and external recruitment 
are based on merit and ensure that the most suitable 
person is selected for each position. 
 ✷ Employee participation: the Group offers UK 
employees the opportunity to participate in an all 
employee HM Revenue and Customs approved 
Sharesave scheme to encourage employee 
participation in the performance and growth of the 
Group. High performing senior managers may also 
be eligible to participate in the Company’s Long Term 
Incentive Plan. 
 ✷ Flexible working: we encourage family friendly 
working practices such as flexible working hours and 
recognise that experienced employees returning to 
work following maternity, paternity or other career 
breaks are an asset. 
 ✷ Equality of opportunity: Bloomsbury has a 
diverse workforce and follows a policy that no 
employee or other person receives more or less 
favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, 
sexual orientation, colour, race and ethnic origin, 
nationality, religion, disability or age. This extends 
to any person known to be HIV positive. The Human 
Resources function monitors compliance with the 
policy and with applicable legislative requirements to 
ensure the equality of opportunity in the recruitment, 
selection and promotion of employees. Grievance 
and disciplinary procedures protect employees from 
discriminatory behaviours and attitudes.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
 ✷ Disabled persons: Group policy is to offer equal 
treatment in respect of the recruitment, training, 
career development and promotion of disabled 
persons. Should people become disabled during the 
course of their employment, the Group will seek to 
retain their services and to provide retraining where 
necessary. 
 ✷ Human Rights: Bloomsbury is committed to meeting 
its responsibility to respect human rights. The nature 
of the business makes it at low risk of contributing to 
adverse human rights impacts. The heads of human 
resources monitor for human rights issues and 
ensure any remedial action that is needed is taken 
promptly. Bloomsbury is committed to complying 
with employment and other legislation applicable to 
the locations in which it employs people ensuring the 
human rights of individuals are protected. 
Health and safety
The Company Secretary reporting to the Chief Executive in 
respect of Health and Safety (‘H&S’) heads an H&S team 
that ensures Group-wide compliance with H&S policy. At 
least annually the main Board and senior team review H&S 
including risks assessments, developments and incident 
reports. The H&S team works closely with management 
and employees to ensure that the H&S policy is effectively 
communicated, implemented and maintained across the 
business. Managers of the worldwide sites are accountable 
for ensuring their areas of the business are in compliance 
with H&S policy.
The Group maintains H&S risk assessments and accident 
books for all its locations worldwide (including where there is 
no local legal requirement to do so) and staff are encouraged 
to report all accidents or near misses. During the year there 
were no fatalities or serious injuries. Accidents reported have 
typically included infrequent bumps and scalds from hot 
drinks associated with the office environment. 
Environment 
The Board recognises that a responsible approach to the 
environment is attractive to its existing and prospective 
customers and authors. Customers can require Bloomsbury 
to demonstrate that the Group is a good corporate citizen 
during the tender process for new and existing contracts. 
The Executive Committee (which consists of the Executive 
Directors and the managing directors of the publishing 
divisions and group functions) have responsibility for 
environmental matters of their teams. These people 
report to the Chief Executive who has overall Board level 
responsibility for environmental matters and issues. 
The impact on the environment of our business 
predominantly arises from the activities the Group 
subcontracts to its suppliers including the printing, 
production, distribution, recycling and disposal of printed 
books. Bloomsbury also has office based editorial, product 
development, sales and administrative activities, which 
operate through an employee workforce based at offices 
in the UK, US (New York), India (New Delhi) and Australia 
(Sydney). 
Our policy is to reduce both the financial cost to 
the business and the impact of the business on the 
environment. We employ specialist independent 
external advisors, Trucost, to monitor our impact on the 
environment. Key areas where we are active in reducing 
the direct and indirect environmental impact of the 
business include: 
 ✷ Online print: we are increasingly moving to e-books 
and online products that have very little environmental 
impact and will save on using natural resources. Our 
strategy embraces digital publishing and the potential 
benefits this may bring to the environment. 
 ✷ Book manufacture: we require all of our contracted 
print suppliers, worldwide, to be FSC-certified and we 
make regular trips to their factories to monitor their 
recycling and other locally relevant environmental 
initiatives. These visits also provide an opportunity to 
view employment practices at first hand, including 
employee minimum age and working conditions. 
Other required accreditations to act as a supplier 
to the Group are ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. Where the 
manufacture/handling of novelty items is involved, 
e.g. on our Children’s lists, we also require ICTI 
accreditation. 
 ✷ Building and office facilities: most of our employees 
travel to work by public transport and we support part-
time and home-working. We provide bicycle storage 
for staff who ride to work. For most employees we have 
implemented separate recycling bins for different 
waste materials so that a significant proportion of our 
office waste is recycled. Lights are generally fitted with 
motion detectors and our office policy is to turn off 
lights out of hours when not in use. 
We have previously taken advice from the Carbon Trust 
and continue to apply their recommendations to reduce 
our carbon footprint. For example, we use point of use 
instead of bottled water coolers, fit energy efficient lamps, 
ensure heating systems are regularly maintained and 
programmed efficiently and turn off unnecessary electrical 
equipment out of hours amongst other measures.

Environmental targets 
Our target is to beat the greenhouse gas and waste 
production normalised tonnes per £m revenue averaged 
for the previous 2 years. By setting such a target we are 
focused on continuously increasing our efficiency at using 
natural resources. 
Our direct operations are predominately office-based 
and have been independently assessed as having a low 
impact on the environment. The Group’s consumption of 
natural resources, although relatively minor, is significantly 
impacted by ambient weather conditions beyond our 
control and by the buildings we lease. 
Greenhouse gases
Our independent external advisor, Trucost, has calculated 
the tables below based on data we have provided. We 
report on our waste production and greenhouse gas 
emissions aligning with the 2006 Government Guidelines, 
Environmental Key Performance Indicators, Reporting 
Guidelines for UK Businesses. In respect of greenhouse 
gases, we report consumption of natural gas, vehicle fuel 
and electricity in kWh, converted to CO2-e following the 
protocols provided by the Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural affairs (DEFRA). Emissions have been 
categorised against the Greenhouse Gas Protocol scopes of 
reporting. This information is unaudited.
During the year, we improved the recording of refrigerant 
use, which led to a higher reported use in 2015 of 6.9 
tonnes (2014: 1 tonne). A reported increase of 29% of 
CO2 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 (see below) emissions to 568 
tonnes for 2015 (2014: 442 tonnes) can be attributed to 
the leased building of a recently acquired business and 
improvements in data recording at several sites.

Details of Directors’ service contracts and Directors’ interests 
in shares, awards and options are shown in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 65 to 82. Other than as 
disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, none of 
the Directors held any interest, either during or at the end of 
the financial year in any material contract or arrangement 
with the Company or any subsidiary undertaking. The terms 
of termination of the Directors’ contracts are described in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report set out in pages 65 to 
82 which includes details of any agreements by which the 
Company would pay compensation to its Directors for loss 
of office, for loss of employment or would make payments in 
respect of a change of control of the Company.
Company policy is to appoint Directors to the Board on 
the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. 
This may be as part of the progressive refreshing of the 
Board, to reappoint a Director retiring by rotation, to fill a 
vacancy arising as a result of a retiring Director or as part of 
measures taken to enhance the skills, experience, capability 
and balance of the Board. 
The effect of the Company’s Articles of Association is to 
require that new Directors appointed by the Board must 
offer themselves for election at the next Annual General 
Meeting. No Directors fall due to offer themselves for 
election under this provision.
The Articles require that any Director who did not stand 
for re-election in either of the two proceeding AGMs must 
retire by rotation. No Directors fall due to offer themselves 
for election under this provision.
The Articles also require that one third of Directors who have 
remained in office for the longest period since being elected 
or re-elected shall retire at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. Accordingly, Wendy Pallot and Ian Cormack 
shall retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Wendy Pallot being eligible offers herself for re-election. Ian 
Cormack shall retire from the Board at the AGM.
The Chairman on behalf of the Board confirms that 
the Director proposed for re-election at the Annual 
General Meeting continues to contribute effectively 
and to demonstrate commitment to the role (including 
commitment of time for Board and committee meetings 
and any other duties).
Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
Directors are granted an indemnity from the Company to 
the extent permitted by law in respect of liabilities incurred 
as a result of their office. The Group maintained insurance 
throughout the year for its Directors and officers against 
the consequences of actions brought against them in 
relation to their duties for the Group. 
Director conflicts of interest 
Procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the 
Directors’ conflict of interest duties set out in the Companies 
Act 2006. These procedures have been complied with during 
the year and the Board considers that these procedures 
operate effectively. During the year, details of any new 
potential conflict matters were submitted to the Board 
for consideration and, where appropriate, these were 
approved. Authorised conflicts or potential conflict matters 
will be reviewed by the Board on an ongoing basis. 
Charitable and political donations
The Group made charitable donations of £4,621 in respect 
of the year (2014: £6,200). Details of the non-cash support 
given by the charitable and voluntary activities of the 
Company are as set out in the Corporate Responsibility 
section on pages 40 to 45. 
No political donations were made by the Group during the 
current or previous year. 
Financial instruments 
Details of financial risk management are given in note 23. 
Share capital and rights attaching to the 
Company’s shares 
The share capital of the Company comprises a single class 
of ordinary 1.25p shares (‘Ordinary shares’). During the

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Details of the issued share capital of the Company can be 
found in note 20 together with details of the shares issued 
and cancelled during the year. 
No Ordinary shares carry special rights with regard to 
control of the Company. At a general meeting of the 
Company every member has one vote on a show of hands 
and on a poll one vote for each share held. The notice of 
general meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting 
rights either by proxy or present in person in relation to 
resolutions to be passed at a general meeting. 
Under the Articles of Association, any share in the Company 
may be issued with such rights or restrictions, whether in 
regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise as 
the Company may from time to time by ordinary resolution 
determine (or, in the absence of any such determination, 
as the Directors may determine). 
No shareholder is, unless the Board decides otherwise, 
entitled to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a 
general meeting or to exercise any other rights conferred 
by being a shareholder if he or she or any person with an 
interest in shares has been sent a notice under section 793 
of the Companies Act 2006 (which confers upon public 
companies the power to require information with respect 
to interests in their voting shares) and he or she or any 
interested person failed to supply the Company with the 
information requested within 14 days after delivery of that 
notice. The Board may also decide to apply to the court 
for an order under section 794 of the Companies Act 2006 
so that no dividend is payable in respect of those default 
shares and that no transfer of any default shares shall be 
registered. These restrictions end seven days after receipt 
by the Company of a notice of an approved transfer of 
the shares or all the information required by the relevant 
section 793 notice, whichever is earlier. 
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer which is 
not a fully-paid share, although such discretion may not be 
exercised in a way which the Financial Conduct Authority 
regards as preventing dealing in the shares of that class 
from taking place on an open proper basis. The Directors 
may likewise refuse any transfer of a share in favour of 
more than four persons jointly. 
The Company is not aware of any other restrictions in the 
transfer of Ordinary shares in the Company other than 
certain restrictions that may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); 
and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority whereby certain employees of the Group require 
approval of the Company to deal in the Company’s shares. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of the securities or voting rights. 
Share dilution 
The Company adheres to “ABI Principles of Remuneration” 
issued in November 2013 by the association of British 
insurers in respect of dilution limits. In particular: 
 ✷ The rules of the Company’s LTIP scheme ensure that 
commitments to issue new shares or re-issue treasury 
shares, when aggregated with awards under all of 
the Company’s other schemes, do not exceed 10% of 
the issued ordinary share capital (adjusted for share 
issuance and cancellation) in any rolling 10 year period. 
 ✷ The Remuneration Committee ensures that 
appropriate policies regarding flow-rates exist in order 
to spread the potential issue of new shares over the life 
of relevant schemes so that the limit is not breached. 
 ✷ Commitments to issue new shares or re-issue treasury 
shares under executive (discretionary) schemes do 
not exceed 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital 
of the Company (adjusted for share issuance and 
cancellation) in any rolling 10 year period. The 
implicit dilution commitment is provided for at point 
of grant even where, as in the case of share-settled 
share appreciation rights, it is recognised that only a 
proportion of shares may in practice be used. 
As set out below in this report, the Bloomsbury Employee 
Benefit Trust purchases shares in the market to be used for 
satisfying LTIP awards and other employee share options 
that vest. 
Authorities to purchase shares, to allot 
shares and pre-emption rights 
Notice of the 2015 Annual General Meeting and 
explanatory foreword to the meeting on pages 150 to 156 
form part of the Directors’ Report and set out: 
 ✷ an ordinary resolution renewing the authority for 
the Directors to allot shares under section 551 of the 
Companies Act; 
 ✷ a special resolution renewing the authority given to 
the Directors to disapply statutory pre-emption rights 
under section 571 of that Act to allow shares to be 
issued for cash or treasury shares to be sold for cash on 
a non-pre-emptive basis; and 
 ✷ a special resolution renewing the authority given to the 
Directors to purchase the Company’s own shares on 
the stock market.

Employee Benefit Trust 
Throughout the financial year, Elian Employee Benefit Trustee Limited (‘Trustee’, formerly, Ogier Employee Benefit Trustee 
Limited) acted as the trustee of the Bloomsbury Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’).

As at 28 February 2015 the EBT held 268,293 ordinary shares of 1.25 pence in the Company being approximately 0.4% of 
the issued ordinary share capital. The EBT did not make any purchases of shares in the Company between 28 February 
2015 and the signing of this report. The Trustee may vote on shares held by the EBT at its discretion, but waives its right to a 
dividend. 
Share purchases of own shares

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Changes of control 
The Group has established close relationships over a 
long period within the publishing markets in which it 
operates. It relies heavily on its goodwill and reputation 
and in particular on its reputation as an autonomous 
independent publisher with authors, customers and key 
employees that could be affected by a change of control.
The Company’s share incentive schemes contain 
provisions relating to a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid (see note 21 for further details of 
the share incentive schemes). Under these provisions, a 
change of control of the Company would normally be a 
vesting event, facilitating the exercise of awards, typically 
subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Contracts and arrangements essential to 
the business 
The Group has a diverse base of authors, customers 
and general suppliers so that its dependency on any 
one individual author, customer or supplier is reduced. 
Primarily for printed books, the Group develops longer 
term relationships with a reduced number of business 
partners, printers and distributors to maximise process 
efficiencies and economies of scale. Failure of a main 
supplier could temporarily disrupt the supply of books 
to market or result in increased cost of working whilst 
alternative arrangements are made. 
The Group depends on its reputation as there is a tendency 
for its authors and customers to behave collectively in the 
selection of their publishing service provider. 
Future developments 
The Group intends to continue to develop its range of 
publishing businesses and services. Although the primary 
focus of the Group is on organic growth, acquisitions in 
these areas of business will be considered. 
Cautionary statement 
Under s417 of the Companies Act 2006, a company’s 
Directors’ Report is required, among other matters, 
to contain a fair review by the Directors of the Group’s 
business through a balanced and comprehensive analysis 
of the development and performance of the business of 
the Group and the position of the Group at the period end, 
consistent with the size and complexity of the business. The 
Directors’ Report together with all sections incorporated 
into it by reference has been prepared only for the 
shareholders of the Company. Its sole purpose and use is 
to assist shareholders to exercise their governance rights. 
In particular, the Directors’ Report has not been audited 
or otherwise independently verified. The Company and its 
Directors and employees are not responsible for any other 
purpose or use or to any other person in relation to the 
Directors’ Report. 
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely future 
developments and other forward looking statements 
that are subject to risk factors associated with, among 
other things, the economic and business circumstances 
occurring from time to time in the sectors, countries and 
business divisions in which the Group operates. These 
factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed 
under Risk Factors on pages 36 to 39. These and other 
factors could adversely affect the Group’s results, strategy 
and prospects. Forward looking statements involve risks, 
uncertainties and assumptions. They relate to events and/ 
or depend on circumstances in the future which could 
cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from 
those currently anticipated. No obligation is assumed to 
update any forward looking statements, whether as a result 
of new information, future events or otherwise.

A resolution to reappoint KPMG LLP as auditor will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
b) Statement as to Disclosure of Information to 
the Auditor 
The Directors who were in office on the date of approval 
of these financial statements have confirmed that, as far 
as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the auditor is unaware. Each of the Directors 
have confirmed that they have taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that it has been communicated to the auditor. 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial 
statements, the Directors Remuneration Report and the 
Directors Report (which incorporates the other sections 
of the Annual Report by reference) in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Company financial statements for each financial period.

statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European 
Union (‘EU’) and have elected under company law to 
prepare the Company financial statements in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU. 
The financial statements are required by law and IFRS 
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position 
of the Group and the Company and the financial 
performance of the Group. The Companies Act 2006 
provides in relation to such financial statements that 
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial 
statements giving a true and fair view are references to 
their achieving a fair presentation. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. 
In preparing the Group and Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to: 
a) select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
b) make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
c) state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs adopted by the EU; 
d) prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s and the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Board confirms that, in the opinion of the Board, 
the Annual Report including the Financial Statements 
on pages 1 to 156, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Annual General Meeting 
The notice of the 2015 Annual General Meeting of 
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc is set out on pages 153 to 
156 and an explanation of the resolutions to be put to 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 23 July 
2015 is set out on pages 150 to 152 which forms part of this 
Directors’ Report. 
Safe Harbour
Under the Companies Act 2006, a safe harbour limits 
the liability of directors in respect of statements in and 
omissions from the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report. Pages 1 to 156 of the Annual Report are included 
within the Directors’ Report by reference and so are 
included within the safe harbour.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the 
disclosure and transparency rules 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
in the Directors’ Report, confirms that, to the best of their 
knowledge: 
a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
b) the Annual Report and Financial Statements include 
a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
T
he Board takes its responsibility to achieve 
sound governance of the Bloomsbury Group 
seriously and continuously maintains high 
standards of corporate governance that focus 
on serving the interests of the shareholders. 
Confirmation of compliance with the code 
The UK Corporate Governance Code edition issued 
September 2012 (the “Code”) is published on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website (www.frc.org.uk). 
The Company has complied throughout the year with the 
provisions of Code in addition to the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority except: 
 ✷ On 9 July 2014, the Chairman of the Board was appointed 
as chair of the Nomination Committee in compliance 
with Code provision B.2.1. However, in respect of the 
period from 1 March 2014 to 9 July 2014, during the 
hand-over period following the recent appointment 
of the Chairman, the Chief Executive was chair of the 
Nomination Committee. The Board considers that 
provision B.2.1 is complied with fully in all other respects 
and that the main principle and supporting principle of 
B.2 have been applied effectively.
The following sections provide information on how the 
Company has applied the principles and provisions of the 
Code.
Board and the Directors
Board effectiveness 
The Board is responsible to the shareholders for ensuring 
that the Company is appropriately managed and that it 
achieves its objectives. The Board determines the strategy 
for the Group and sets and monitors targets for the 
management team to achieve the strategy. 
The Board comprises the Independent Non-Executive 
Chairman, Senior Independent Director, a further two 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, the Chief Executive, 
the Finance Director and a further Executive Director. The 
biographies of the Directors appears on pages 46 and 47. 
During the year the Board met 10 times including  
6 schedule main meetings and 4 meetings called during 
the year to consider specific matters such as acquisitions.  
Sub-committees appointed by the Board met on  
7 occasions on specific matters. Board meetings included 
reviewing the Company’s strategic direction, operating 
and financial performance and overseeing that the 
Company is adequately resourced and effectively 
controlled.
The agendas for all main Board meetings provide standing 
items for each Director to provide updates on areas of 
their responsibility and items for the Chairs of each Board 
committee to update the Board. 
The Board has approved the matters specifically reserved 
for consideration by the Board. The Board determines the 
responsibilities and authority of its committees, Board sub-
committees, individual Directors and the level of authorities 
delegated to the management of the business. The Audit 
Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration 
Committee have terms of reference approved by the 
Board that can be found on the Company’s website, www.
bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
Matters considered at Board meetings during the year 
have typically included: 
 ✷ Review and setting of strategy for the Company’s 
operations; 
 ✷ Review of the management accounts, short and long 
term forecasts, key performance indicators and full 
year forecasts; 
 ✷ Approval of the annual and interim results statements; 
 ✷ Review and approval of the annual budget; 
 ✷ Regular reports by the Chief Executive, proposals and

 ✷ Reports of the chairs of Board committees and minutes 
following committee and sub-committee meetings; 
 ✷ Review and approval of decisions, transactions and 
sensitive policies that are significant to the Company 
such as dividends, the organisational, legal and capital 
structure of the Company, acquisitions of literary titles, 
businesses and companies and major contracts;

Company; and 
 ✷ Evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board including

GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the 
Company, with the Chairman responsible for the effective 
operation of the Board, encouraging the active participation 
of all Directors, and the Chief Executive responsible for 
the strategic running of the Company’s businesses. The 
Board has approved formal statements describing the 
role and remit of both the Chairman and Chief Executive, 
which further emphasise this division of responsibilities. 
The Executive Directors regularly hold formal meetings 
with senior managers as a management team to assist the 
Chief Executive in fulfilling his operational objectives. This 
management team makes recommendations to the Board 
and seeks approval from the Board where required. The 
Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge and help 
develop proposals on strategy at meetings specifically set up 
for the purpose, which are attended by all Board members. 
All Directors and Board committees have access to the 
advice and services of the Group Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed and advising the Board, through the Chairman, on 
governance matters. They also have access to independent 
professional advice, if required, at the Company’s expense. 
The Chairman has held meetings during the year with the 
Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors 
present to discuss relevant matters. 
Conflicts of interest procedures
A standing item on Board agendas at the start of meetings is 
for Directors to disclose their significant interests. The Board 
has reviewed the interests of the Directors and maintains a 
register of areas of conflict of interest for Directors. Should 
a matter arise where there is a risk of a conflict in the Board 
discussing matters or making decisions then the Director 
affected by the conflict will absent them self from the room 
whilst the matter is considered. 
Policy on Board diversity 
More information on diversity is found in the report on 
Corporate Responsibility on pages 40 to 45. 
The majority of the senior management team, which 
includes the Executive Directors and senior managers, are 
women. The Board aims for at least one third of Directors 
(to the nearest number of Directors) to be women. The 
Board comprises seven Directors of which two are women.
The policy of the Board is that all Directors should be 
appointed purely on merit regardless of their gender or 
background.
Director independence 
The Board considers each of the Non-Executive Directors 
who served during the year to be independent in 
character and judgement and does not consider that there 
are any relationships or circumstances which affect, or 
could appear to affect, their independent judgement. 
Board and committee attendance 
The table below shows the attendance at main Board and 
committee meetings during the year ended 28 February 
2015. Further meetings in addition to the figures included 
in the table below were convened during the year for

Board evaluation 
The Board conducts a formal evaluation annually that 
considers the balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge of the Board, its diversity including gender, 
how the Board works together as a unit and other factors 
relevant to its effectiveness. The evaluation reviews the 
progress made by the Board with developing strategy and 
with the underlying processes supporting the effective 
operation of the Board including the quality of information 
it receives. 
The evaluation of the Board and of each individual Director 
is through: 
 ✷ one-to-one interviews, using evaluation questionnaires 
to facilitate discussion, of Directors with the Chairman to 
appraise the performance of the Director on the Board 
and to discuss any improvements needed to the Board 
processes;
 ✷ the chair of each Board committee leads the evaluation 
of their committee; 
 ✷ the Chief Executive conducts additional management 
appraisals of the Executive Directors and the senior 
management team; 
 ✷ the Board discusses the findings and recommendations 
for improvement actions in respect of evaluations of 
the Board, each Director, the Board committees and 
the processes supporting the Board;
 ✷ the Chairman may hold further one-to-one interviews 
with Directors to follow up issues and actions if 
applicable; and
 ✷ The Nomination Committee, as appropriate, considers 
the conclusions of the Board evaluation.
The performance appraisal of the Chairman is led by the 
Senior Independent Director. The appraisal is undertaken 
using assessment questionnaires and a one-to-one 
interview of the Chairman with the Senior Independent 
Director who takes account of the confidential views of the 
other Directors. 
Upon completing the interviews, the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director make formal reports to the Board 
on the findings with recommendations for actions to be 
implemented by the Board, by individual Directors, by the 
Group Company Secretary and by senior management 
in the business. Where needed the Chairman holds 
confidential follow up meetings with individual Directors to 
address concerns they have raised or to address concerns 
raised about them. The Board monitors progress with 
implementing the actions. 
Board committees are evaluated annually against 
the terms of reference for the committee and against 
adherence to relevant regulation such as the Code. 
The committees approve the evaluations and make 
recommendations to the Board on any changes needed to 
the Board processes and terms of reference.
The conclusions of the Board evaluations are considered 
by the Nomination Committee when reviewing the 
structure and composition of the Board and succession 
planning. As a result of the review of performance, the 
Chairman on behalf of the Board confirms that each of the 
Directors proposed for re-election at the AGM continues 
to contribute effectively and to demonstrate commitment 
to the role (including commitment of time for Board and 
committee meetings and any other duties). 
Examples of the matters arising from the 2014/15 Board 
and committee evaluations include:
 ✷ The Board is working well, NEDs have settled in and are 
making effective contributions
 ✷ More Board time on strategy: Extend Board and 
committee meetings by 1 hour to permit more 
discussion in particular on strategic issues. 
 ✷ More Board oversight on below Board talent 
management
 ✷ Update the existing conflicts of interest Board policy for 
director outside roles to ensure the areas of potential 
conflict are clear
Relations with shareholders 
The Board led by the Chairman is responsible for ensuring 
an open dialogue with shareholders based on the mutual 
understanding of objectives. 
The Annual Report, Interim Reports, AGM, market 
updates and post results announcement presentations 
are the principal means through which the Company 
communicates its strategy and performance to 
shareholders. All shareholders are welcome to attend the 
AGM and investors are encouraged to take advantage of 
the opportunity given to ask questions. The chairs of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees attend 
the AGM and are available to answer questions.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company maintains an active dialogue with its 
institutional shareholders and City analysts through a 
planned programme of investor relations. The programme 
includes formal presentations of results and post results 
meetings with the major shareholders and other investors 
who request meetings. The presentations are made 
available on the website www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The 
meetings and presentations provide an opportunity for 
shareholders to ask questions and to meet the Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors. The outcome of regular 
meetings with the main shareholders, presentations and 
post results meetings is reported to the Board. This includes 
both feedback from individual Directors and feedback 
collated from discussions by the Company’s corporate 
broker with the main shareholders. The Company’s 
corporate broker provides regular shareholder analysis 
to the Board. Feedback from shareholders and other 
members of the shareholder corporate governance 
community is used to help review and develop 
Bloomsbury’s procedures. 
The Chairman writes to the major shareholders each 
year to provide shareholders with the opportunity to 
openly discuss corporate governance matters, including 
remuneration, and raise any concerns. Following the 
meetings the Chairman reports to the Board on the 
discussions held including any feedback from the 
shareholders.
Training and development of the Directors 
The Board evaluation including Director appraisals by the 
Chairman considers whether each Director has refreshed 
their skills and knowledge sufficiently and provides an 
opportunity for Directors to identify where training and 
development can assist them in the performance of their 
duties. Development may include, for example, meetings 
with senior managers to gain an improved understanding 
of the business. 
Directors are provided with extensive director knowledge 
checklists to help them self-assess their personal learning 
needs and they have access to numerous relevant 
publications by Bloomsbury. Formal training is provided 
to the Board by the External Auditor and external 
remuneration consultants who assign time in meetings 
to provide updates on and to explain topical areas of 
corporate governance, remuneration, auditing and 
financial reporting. 
The Board is progressively refreshed, bringing in new skills 
and experience to the pool of knowledge on the Board 
from which each Director on the Board can learn. 
Nomination Committee 
The Committee comprises the Non-Executive Chairman 
of the Board, who chairs the Committee, and the three 
Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Chief 
Executive.
The Committee operates under terms of reference agreed 
by the whole Board, and which are available on the 
Company’s website www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. Its role is to 
review the composition of the Board, consider succession 
planning and nominate to the Board, for approval, 
candidates to fill Board vacancies. The Committee 
determines the Directors who should stand for re-election 
at the AGM in accordance with the Articles of Association 
of the Company. The Board formally approves the 
appointment of all new Directors on the recommendation 
of the Committee. 
Board appointment process
The Board adopts a formal and rigorous approach to the 
appointment of Directors. The following outlines the Board 
appointment process typical to that followed: 
 ✷ The need to appoint a new Director is identified by 
an existing Board member retiring or by a review 
by the Committee of the Board’s structure, balance, 
succession planning and the need for progressive 
refreshing which may take account of the findings 
of the annual Board evaluation of the skills and 
capabilities of Board members; 
 ✷ The Committee considers the strengths and 
weaknesses of the Board and the senior management 
team and the needs of the business in order to define 
the experience and capabilities required for a new 
appointment;
 ✷ The Committee determines the recruitment process;
 ✷ For appointing independent NED’s, an independent 
external recruitment consultant is appointed and 
performs an extensive search to identify candidates 
meeting criteria agreed with the Committee. The 
external consultant performs initial interviews with 
candidates and carries out background research 
on them to formulate a shortlist to put forwards to 
the Committee together with an evaluation of each 
candidate;

 ✷ Several Directors separately interview each candidate 
and feedback to the external consultant on the 
evaluation of the candidate;
 ✷ Multiple references are taken and further background 
checks are made on candidates;
 ✷ The Committee sitting together selects the final 
candidate and makes a recommendation to the Board 
on their appointment; and
 ✷ The Board approves appointments nominated by the 
Committee.
The Group Company Secretary ensures that new Directors 
receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining 
the Board. Newly appointed Directors are provided with 
induction packs and one-to-one meetings are arranged 
for them with the senior management team. Directors 
are provided with a detailed knowledge self-assessment 
questionnaire to help them consider any further training 
needs they may have.
The significant Shareholders are invited to contact or 
meet with a new Chairman. Any request by a Shareholder 
to meet with a new Director would be considered by the 
Board. Investors will typically get the opportunity to meet 
with new Directors at presentations and meetings following 
the announcements of the results.
Re-election of Directors 
All Directors are subject to reappointment by the 
Shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after their 
appointment and thereafter at intervals of no more than 
three years.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for periods of three 
years upon the end of which their appointment terminates 
subject to their re-appointment by the Board. A policy is 
followed of progressive refreshing of the Board and the 
Independent Non-Executive Directors can be expected 
to retire from the Board at the end of their first, second or 
during their third three year period. 
The notice periods by the Company of the Directors are  
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages  
65 to 82.
Board diversity
The Board  aims for at least one third, or the nearest 
number to a third, of directors on the Board should be 
women. The Board comprises two women out of a total 
of seven directors so achieves the objective. The Board 
is progressively refreshed and new appointments are 
selected by the Nomination Committee using independent 
search consultants based on merit as the best candidate for 
the role.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises two Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman 
of the Board and is chaired by Jill Jones. The role of the 
Committee is set out in the Directors Remuneration Report 
on pages 65 to 82.

Going concern
Management maintains a rolling Group financial forecast extending to 5 years that is developed from 
the long term plans for each of the global publishing divisions. The Group financial forecast enables the 
Directors to assess the long term prospects of the Company. To assess the validity of the going concern 
assumption, the Directors have reviewed projections that similarly extend up to 5 years to evaluate 
the financial position of the Group under a number of scenarios that are adverse relative to the Group 
financial forecast e.g. what-if there is a substantial decline of revenues or a business disaster that diverts 
management time and causes unplanned costs. In light of this review and after making enquiries the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the consolidated and company financial statements in accordance 
with Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK companies 2009, published by the 
Financial Reporting council in October 2009. Further going concern disclosure is given in the financial

Operation of the Audit Committee
The Committee comprises three Independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Chair of the Committee is Ian 
Cormack. The Board is satisfied that the experience and 
qualifications of Ian Cormack are sufficient for him to meet 
the experience and qualification requirements to be a 
member of the Audit Committee with recent and relevant 
financial experience under the Code and the UK listing 
authority Listing Rules appropriate to the Company.
The Committee typically invites the External Auditor, 
Internal Auditor, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive, 
Finance Director and Executive Director to attend 
meetings. It meets at least once in respect of each 
reporting period and a standard item on the agenda 
for every meeting is a meeting with the External Auditor 
alone without management present which provides the 
opportunity for the Committee and External Auditor to

The Committee assesses the effectiveness of the audit 
process as an item on the agenda for Committee meetings. 
In forming its view on the effectiveness of the audit process 
the Committee has considered: 
 ✷ the quality of audit work undertaken and resulting 
audit findings;
 ✷ whether the auditors’ scope has been limited and 
whether the auditor has had sufficient resources to 
complete their agreed work programme; and 
 ✷ the independence of the auditor
The annual evaluation of the Board reviewed the 
effectiveness of how the external audit process integrated 
with the business processes for the Group.
The Committee is satisfied that KPMG has performed an 
effective audit that provided the Committee with adequate 
assurance.
External Auditor non-audit services
The Committee has approved a formal policy on 
the provision of non-audit services to safeguard the 
independence and objectivity of the External Auditor and 
reviews the level of non-audit fees relative to audit fees. The 
full policy is found on the website www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
A list has been defined by the Committee of services that 
the External Auditor is prohibited from undertaking which 
includes:
 ✷ Bookkeeping or other related services to the 
accounting records or financial statements of 
Bloomsbury and its subsidiary undertakings;
 ✷ Internal audit;
 ✷ Financial information systems design and 
implementation;
 ✷ Appraisal or valuation services where the output or 
opinion is likely to be used for financial reporting 
purposes or decisions by the business;
 ✷ Administration services such as payroll, human 
resources or other support for management, which 
involves acting as a director, employee or officer of 
Bloomsbury and its subsidiary undertakings;
 ✷ Broker, dealing, investment advisor, or investment 
banking services
 ✷ Legal services requiring the person providing the 
service to be admitted or qualified to practice before 
the courts of a jurisdiction;
 ✷ Expert services for the purpose of advocating 
Bloomsbury’s interests in litigation or investigation 
pursuit to proceeding;
 ✷ Recruitment of senior executives or directors; or
 ✷ Any other services that is prohibited locally through law 
or regulation.
Other policy terms include:
 ✷ All other non-audit services need prior approval by the 
Committee. A list of specifically permitted non-audit 
services has been determined by the Committee, as 
listed in the policy, for which prior approval is deemed 
to have been given.
 ✷ A maximum of £10,000 +VAT per annum may be spent 
on permitted non-audit services undertaken by the 
External Auditor above which Committee approval is 
required.
 ✷ External Auditor annual fees for non-audit work may 
not exceed 50% of the total fees charged by the 
External Auditor.
Internal control and risk management 
The Code requires the Directors to assess at least annually 
the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control, 
which include financial, operational and compliance 
controls, and the system of risk management. This review 
has been carried out by the Audit Committee on behalf of 
the Board. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, for 
setting policy on internal control, and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal control. The role of management 
is to implement Board policies on risk and control. The 
system of internal control is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material financial misstatement 
or loss.

The Board operates both formally, through Board and 
committee meetings, and informally, through regular 
contact amongst Directors. High level decisions on such 
matters as strategy, financial performance and reporting, 
dividends, risk management, major capital expenditure, 
acquisitions and disposals are reserved for the Board or 
Board committees. For its regular formal meetings, the 
Board receives appropriate information in advance from 
management. Other decisions outside of these areas are 
delegated to the Company’s management, which reports 
to the Executive Directors. 
The Board has put in place an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Company in accordance with the guidance of 
the Turnbull Committee on internal control. This process 
has been in place for the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of this Annual Report. The process 
is regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee on behalf 
of the Board to ensure that the procedures implemented 
continue to be effective and, where appropriate, 
recommendations are made to management to improve 
the procedures. The Company’s system of internal financial 
control aims to safeguard the Company’s assets, ensure 
that proper accounting records are maintained, that the 
financial information used within the business and for 
publication is reliable, that business risks are identified and 
managed and that compliance with appropriate legislation 
and regulation is maintained. 
Internal control and risk management framework 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
of the Company is the responsibility of the Finance Director 
and is overseen by the Audit Committee and the Board. 
This includes responsibility for ensuring appropriate 
internal controls are in place over financial reporting 
processes and related IT systems. The Audit Committee 
monitors the risks and associated controls over financial 
reporting processes, including the consolidation process. 
Relevant features of the Company’s system of internal 
controls and risk management in relation to the financial 
reporting process and preparation of the Group financial 
statements include: 
 ✷ Organisational culture: The Company has a highly 
skilled, professional and committed workforce. 
The Board is committed to developing a culture of 
openness, integrity, competence and responsibility. 
The Board concentrates mainly on strategic and 
significant organisational issues, approving objectives 
and monitoring, at a high level, the financial and 
operational performance against objectives.
 ✷ Organisational structure: The One Global 
Bloomsbury structure is four worldwide publishing 
divisions supported by group functions (finance, IT, 
production, sales & marketing) which provide the 
business with internal control pillars in the internal 
control framework. 
 ✷ Risk and control review: The Executive Committee 
(which comprises the senior management team and 
Executive Directors) maintains the matrix of Group 
level risks and control assessments for each risk. This 
is supported by the Internal Auditor and by formal 
risk reviews by the Executive Committee. The head 
of each Group function maintains the matrix of risks 
and control assessments for their function. This 
ensures that risks and control issues from around the 
Group worldwide are reported openly to the senior 
management team and addressed. The Board has 
regularly reviewed the significant Group and functional 
risks to ensure appropriate action is taken to address 
the risks. The Audit Committee has reviewed the risks 
in particular the financial risks and issues that could 
impact on reporting when considering the financial 
statements.
 ✷ Financial internal control and risk review: The 
Finance Director formally reviews the internal financial 
controls taking account of the risks within the financial 
information systems and reports the findings of this 
review to the Audit Committee. Analytical review of 
operating results and detailed control questionnaires 
completed for the publishing divisions and overseas 
offices supplement management’s knowledge of the 
business for the evaluation of the risks and assessment 
of the internal financial controls. The Audit Committee 
also receives reports on the internal controls and risks 
provided by the Internal Auditor. The Audit Committee 
receives other reports from management relevant to 
the internal financial controls such as reports on the 
progress of key projects. 
 ✷ Authority levels: The Board maintains a detailed 
register of delegated authorities and sets the level of 
authority required, before Board approval is needed, 
to commit the Company or to undertake transactions. 
It also approves budgets and other performance 
targets. The publishing divisions and Group functions 
operate within these authority levels and budgets. 
The Executive Directors determine the authority to be 
delegated to individual managers.

 ✷ Financial management reporting: The Board 
approves the annual Group budget. Sales are 
reported daily, weekly and monthly. Financial results 
of the business operations are reported monthly and 
compared to budget and forecasts. Detailed forecasts 
for the Company are updated regularly and reviewed 
by the Board. 
 ✷ Book title acquisition procedures: Established 
procedures, such as the review and approval by an 
Executive Director of acquisition proposals of rights to 
new books, are operated within set authority limits and 
used for transactions in the ordinary course of business. 
Acquisitions exceeding delegated authority limits 
require approval by the Board. Significant acquisitions 
of companies and businesses are approved by the 
Board. The Board has set authorised limits for the total 
author advances held on the Statement of Financial 
Position as a percentage of net assets and for the total 
value of committed but unpaid advances. 
 ✷ Accountability: The Company has clearly defined 
lines of responsibility headed by the Chief Executive 
and Executive Committee to control the publishing 
divisions and business functions. Detailed operational 
and financial performance data are monitored by 
supervisory management to ensure the performance 
of operations is in line with targets. The reasons for 
variances and under performance are established by 
supervisory line management and followed up with 
managers and staff.
 ✷ Overseas offices. Each overseas office has a local 
manager or managing director who is responsible for 
operational effectiveness and local internal controls. 
Accounting for the Group is centralised and overseas 
subsidiaries hold limited cash balances. Senior 
managers and Executive Directors regularly visit the 
overseas offices and the finance function conducts 
operational review visits to review the procedures. The 
Board has implemented a Group Whistleblower Policy 
and an Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy which are 
communicated to all staff worldwide and found on the 
Company’s website at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
 ✷ Internal Audit: An internal audit function conducts 
risk based audits of the processes agreed with the 
Audit Committee to review the internal controls. Its 
conclusions are communicated to senior management 
and the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee 
considers reports from External and Internal Audit to 
ensure that adequate measures are being taken by 
management to address risk and control issues. The 
Group Company Secretary is the Head of Internal Audit 
and reports to the Chair of the Audit Committee and 
the Chief Executive in respect of risk management and 
internal audit work. 
Significant failings or weaknesses in the internal 
controls
Pursuant to provision C.2.3 of the Code issued September 
2014, the Committee concludes from its review of the 
systems of risk management and internal control that 
the internal controls are adequate for the business of 
Bloomsbury, including all the Group companies. From this 
review, the Committee has not identified any significant 
internal control weaknesses that challenge the Group in 
achieving its objectives.
The One Global Bloomsbury structure of four worldwide 
publishing divisions supported by Group functions ensures 
an effective internal control framework and provides a 
platform for integrating acquisitions as the Group grows 
and evolves.
Management assigns and monitors control effectiveness 
ratings to the internal controls across all the business 
processes worldwide based on the benefits expected from 
making improvements given the investment of resources 
that would be required. Based on this, management has 
identified that the Group’s information systems is the 
process area where most improvement can be made 
to help increase productivity and effectiveness of the 
business. In particular, work is ongoing to simplify the 
legacy systems and introduce new reporting systems to 
help manage the risks from expansion across new markets, 
new product types and acquisitions.

Significant issues in relation to the financial 
statements 
In accordance with Code Provision C.3.8, the following 
are the issues that the Committee considers significant in 
relation to the Financial Statements and how these issues 
are addressed. 
For each item below, the Committee has reviewed the 
assumptions and judgements made and has considered 
the risks to the integrity of information reported in the 
Financial Statements. In accordance with the Code the 
Committee has taken account of the disclosure of the 
issues when forming an opinion on the fair, balanced and 
understandable view of the Annual Report.
1. Inventories Provision
The level of inventories and the inventory provision are set 
out in note 15 on page 117.
For each line of inventory, a provision is made against the 
cost of the inventory, where the Net Realisable Value is less 
than cost. Net Realisable Value is the estimated selling price 
for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and 
costs necessary to make the sale. 
The estimated selling price for each inventory line is a 
judgement based mainly on recent selling patterns for 
a title. A formulaic provision is applied to each inventory 
line where titles have been published for more than one 
year. The Committee considered the judgements applied 
to estimating the selling prices of inventory. This was to 
ensure that the total level of provision for all inventory was 
adequate.
2. Sales Returns provision
The level of sales return provision is set out in note 16 on 
page 117.
Printed books are normally sold on a sale-or-return basis. The 
timing of returns of unsold books is uncertain. A provision is 
made against sales for the expected future returns of books 
that have not occurred by the end of an accounting period. 
This provision is a judgement based on the assumption of 
the time lag following a sale before a return is made and the 
calculation of the historic returns rate. 
The Committee considered the judgements made in 
estimating the key assumptions. This was to ensure that the 
sales return provision was adequate.
3. Revenue Recognition
Included within Rights and Services revenues are licenses 
over Bloomsbury’s IP to third parties, as stated in note 3 
to the financial statements. The revenue recognised from 
these licences in any one period mainly reflects the value of 
contracted performance obligations satisfied in that period. 
The revenue recognition treatment for more complex deals 
is reviewed by the External Auditors as soon as contracted.
The Committee considered the judgements applied to 
the most significant licenses. This was to ensure that the 
revenue recognition treatment was adequate.
4. Valuation of goodwill on acquisition of companies
The carrying value of goodwill arising on the acquisition of 
companies (or group of companies) by the Group is set out 
in note 11 on page 112. 
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill 
is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units 
(CGUs) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the combination. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is 
less than its carrying value, an impairment charge reduces 
goodwill and is recognised in the Income Statement. There 
is more detail on this process in note 2k), to these financial 
statements. The recoverable amount is based on future 
cash flow projections based on a Board approved budget 
and the five year plan. 
The Committee considered the judgements and 
assumptions made in selecting CGUs and performing the 
impairment tests for each CGU, to ensure that the carrying 
value for goodwill was adequately supported. In particular, 
the Committee reviewed the annual budget and five year 
plan for the Group as approved by the Board which is used 
as the basis for forecasting future cash flows from the CGUs.
5. Unearned Advance Provision
Prepayments and accrued income in the Group Statement 
of Financial Position, in note 16 on page 117, include net 
unearned author advances of £21.4 million (2014: £20.8 
million).
A provision is made against gross advances (paid and 
payable) to the extent that they are not expected to be 
fully earned from anticipated future sales of a title. This 
provision is a judgement that depends on recent royalty 
earnings and known future new format releases.
The Committee considered the assumptions made for 
the titles with the largest net advances across the Group 
to ensure that the net carrying value of advances was 
adequately supported.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for Bloomsbury Publishing Plc for the year ended  
28 February 2015 (the “Report”). The Report has been prepared on behalf of the Bloomsbury Board by the Remuneration 
Committee (the “Committee”) and has been approved by the Board. 
Outline of the Remuneration Report
The Report is split into the following two sections:
 ✷ Part A, the Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the Remuneration Policy for the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors which was approved by the shareholders at the 2014 AGM and has operated from 1 March 2014. No changes 
are proposed to the Remuneration Policy Report; and
 ✷ Part B, the Annual Report on Remuneration, which discloses how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented for the 
year ending 28 February 2016 and how it was implemented for the year ended 28 February 2015. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the forthcoming AGM on 23 July 
2015. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report will be subject to a binding vote every three years (sooner if changes are 
made to the policy) next due at the 2017 AGM.
Performance and Reward for 2014/15
Bloomsbury delivered another good performance for the year ended 28 February 2015 against the background of a 
publishing market place that continues to evolve and a relatively stable economic environment. The Committee set 
stretching annual bonus targets (see below) for the year and it is to the credit of the business that it has beaten the 
threshold target for PBTA allowing bonuses to be paid at an average rate of 16% of the maximum bonus.
The 2011 long-term incentive awards were determined by a combination of earnings per share (50% of awards), for which 
the maximum EPS target was exceeded allowing full vesting, and relative total shareholder return performance (50% of 
awards), which the performance target for threshold vesting (see below) was exceeded permitting vesting at 54.8% of the 
maximum in 2014/15.
Remuneration Policy for 2015/16
The Remuneration Committee continually reviews the Executive Director Remuneration Policy to ensure it promotes 
the attraction, motivation and retention of the high quality executives who have been key to delivering the Company’s 
strategy in the past and who will be key to delivering sustainable earnings growth and shareholder return in the future. For 
2015/16, the Committee has concluded that:
 ✷ basic salaries should be increased by 2% in line with the general workforce for the Group;
 ✷ there will be no changes to other elements of fixed pay (i.e. benefit and pension provision);
 ✷ the structure and quantum of the annual bonus arrangement continues to work well. Therefore, the maximum bonus 
potential will remain at 100% of salary and the structure of the 2015/16 annual bonus will be broadly similar to that 
operated for 2014/15. A claw-back provision, introduced for 2014/15, will operate in respect of the annual bonus for the 
Executive Directors; and
 ✷ the long-term incentive policy, operated under the Bloomsbury Share Plan 2014 (“PSP”), whereby nil-cost awards 
are granted annually with vesting based on earnings per share (EPS) growth relative to RPI (50%) and relative total 
shareholder return (50%) performance conditions and continued service provide a strong alignment between the 
Executive Director team and shareholders.
 ✷ For the awards granted in 2014/15 and thereafter a new concurrent EPS growth relative to RPI performance condition 
is added to PSP awards with relative total shareholder return performance conditions. This supplements the financial 
underpin in the PSP scheme rules that provides the Committee with discretion to reduce the level of vesting should the 
Committee, in its opinion, consider that vesting is not reflective of Bloomsbury’s performance.

Shareholder feedback
In applying the Remuneration Policy, the Committee’s priority is to ensure that the interests of the shareholders and, where 
beneficial to the shareholders, other stakeholders are served whilst the Executive Directors and senior management team 
are treated fairly. In reaching its decisions the Committee considers the views and feedback it receives from shareholders 
and other members of the shareholder corporate governance community together with the views of management. Major 
shareholders and representative bodies were consulted in early 2014 in respect of the proposed changes to the long-term 
incentive policy. 
In conclusion, the Committee considers that the Remuneration Policy will incentivise the sustainable delivery of the Board’s 
strategy, strong financial performance and the creation of long-term shareholder value.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
PART A – REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
Introduction
The Committee has adopted the principles of good governance relating to Directors’ remuneration as set out in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code issued September 2014 (the “Code”). This Report, together with the Annual Report on 
Remuneration, complies with the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”), the UKLA Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority 
and Directors’ Remuneration: the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013. The Company has complied with the provisions of the Code relating to Directors’ Remuneration 
throughout the year. 
In determining the Remuneration Policy the Committee applies the key principles that remuneration should:
 ✷ attract and retain suitably high calibre Executive Directors and ensure that they are motivated to achieve the highest 
levels of performance including delivering strategic initiatives and objectives;
 ✷ align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the shareholders; and
 ✷ not pay more than is necessary.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year. This feedback, plus any 
additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Group’s annual 
review of the Remuneration Policy. In addition, the Remuneration Committee will seek to engage directly with major 
shareholders and their representative bodies should any material changes be made to the Remuneration Policy. Major 
shareholders and representative bodies were consulted in early 2014 in respect of the proposed changes to the long-term 
incentive policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report and any matters 
discussed with shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the 
annual salary increases for the Executive Directors. Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the 
Group’s Executive Director Remuneration Policy, although the Committee will keep this under review. 
The relative increase in CEO pay for the year under review, as compared with that of the general workforce, is set out in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration. The Committee also considers environmental, social and governance issues, and risk 
when reviewing executive pay quantum and structure.

Notes to the Summary Policy Table:
1. A description of how the Company intends to 
implement the policy set out in this table from the 2014 
AGM is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
on pages 73 to 82.
2. Remuneration arrangements below Board tend to be 
skewed more towards fixed pay with less of a focus on 
share-based long-term incentive pay. These differences 
have arisen from the development of remuneration 
arrangements that are market competitive for the 
various categories of individuals.
3. The choice of the performance metrics applicable to 
the annual bonus scheme reflect the Committee’s 
belief that any incentive compensation should be 
appropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery 
of profit growth and personal and strategic objectives. 
4. The TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to 
the PSP were selected by the Remuneration Committee 
on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term 
returns to shareholders and the Company’s financial 
growth and are consistent with the Company’s 
objective of delivering superior levels of long-term 
value to shareholders. The TSR performance condition 
is monitored on the Committee’s behalf by New Bridge 
Street whilst the Group’s EPS growth is derived from the 
audited financial statements.
5. While PSP awards currently vest after 3 years subject 
to continued service and performance targets, 
the Committee will consider developments in best 
practice when setting future long-term incentive grant 
policies and, in particular, whether the introduction 
of a post vesting holding period, in addition to the 
existing shareholding guidelines, is appropriate for the 
Company.
6. The all-employee Sharesave scheme does not have 
performance conditions. 
7. For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority is given to 
the Company to honour any commitments entered 
into with current or former Directors (such as the 
payment of a pension, payment of last year’s annual 
bonus or the vesting/exercise of share awards granted 
in the past). Details of any payments to former Directors 
will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as 
they arise.
Discretion of the Committee
The Committee will operate the annual bonus and PSP 
schemes according to the respective scheme rules 
(or relevant documents) and in accordance with the 
applicable regulations. Executive Director incentive 
schemes and remuneration plans are designed to align the 
interests of management with those of the shareholders 
and are kept as simple as possible. Where the outcome 
of incentives is not as the Committee intended it may use 
its independent discretion to intervene and modify the 
outcomes to align the interests of management with those 
of the shareholders.
The Committee has adopted terms of reference based on 
best practice and may apply its independent discretion in a 
number of ways through its conditional approval including 
for:
Share based incentives
 ✷ granting of all discretionary share awards/ options and 
determining the participants (including for Executive 
Directors and below the Board), timing of grants, size 
of awards, performance conditions and how vested 
awards should be satisfied;
 ✷ running Sharesave to ensure that the scheme is run 
within applicable dilution limits;
 ✷ vesting of all discretionary share awards/ options 
including the timing and level of vesting;
 ✷ non-routine vesting of all-employee share options 
in the unlikely event needed to ensure the effective 
operation of the schemes under the applicable 
regulations and rules;
Annual bonuses
 ✷ making annual bonus awards to the Executive Directors 
and determining the level of awards, targets and 
conditions and calibration of bonuses;
 ✷ the group bonus pool and the level of bonus payouts 
for the Executive Directors and managers below Board 
who participate in the group bonus scheme;
 ✷ bonus payments to the Executive Directors so 
may determine the level of payments following 
the assessment of performance measures and 
achievement against bonus objectives;
Routine payments
 ✷ all changes to Executive Director basic salaries, 
pensions and eligibility to benefits;

Notes:
1. The minimum performance scenario comprises the fixed elements of remuneration only, based on salary and pension as per policy for 2015/16 and estimated 
benefits based on 2014/15
2. The target level of bonus is taken to be 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity (100% of salary), and the target level of PSP vesting is assumed to be 50% of the 
face value assuming a normal grant level (100% of salary). These values are included in addition to the components/values of minimum remuneration.
3. Maximum assumes full bonus payout (100% of salary) and the full face value of the PSP (100% of salary), in addition to fixed components of remuneration.
4. For simplicity, no share price growth has been factored into the calculations. The value of any Sharesave awards and notional dividends accruing on vested LTIP 
shares has been excluded
Executive Director share ownership 
guidelines
Under the guidelines the Executive Directors are expected 
to build and maintain a shareholding valued at 100% of 
basic salary with no upper limit on the number of shares 
they may hold. A time limit is not set to accumulate the 
shareholding however Executive Directors are required to 
retain all shares arising from vested PSP awards (net of tax) 
or purchase shares until the shareholding guideline is met. 
The number of shares needed to satisfy the shareholding is 
recalculated annually at the close of the next business day 
following the announcement of the full year results taking 
account of changes to basic salary.
Remuneration earned by the Executive 
Directors from outside appointments
Significant external appointments of the Directors are 
given in the bibliographic details on pages 46 and 47. 
The Committee considers that the external appointments 
of the Executive Directors have no detrimental impact 
on the performance of their duties. The Committee has 
approved that each Executive Director may retain his or 
her remuneration earned from external appointments up 
to £15,000 per year.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director 
would be set in accordance with the terms of the 
Company’s prevailing approved Remuneration Policy 
at the time of appointment and take into account the 
skills and experience of the individual, the market rate 
for a candidate of that experience and the importance of 
securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as required to 
attract the most appropriate candidate and may be set 
initially at a below mid-market level on the basis that it may 
progress towards the mid-market level once expertise 
and performance has been proven and sustained. The 
annual bonus potential would be limited to 100% of salary 
and grants under the PSP would be limited to 100% of

salary (150% of salary in exceptional circumstances). In 
addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/
or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive 
pay forfeited by an Executive leaving a previous employer. 
It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards 
would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting 
periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any 
variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior 
role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms. In 
addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue. 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
and/or incidental expenses as appropriate.
If appropriate the Committee may agree, on the 
recruitment of a new Executive Director, a notice period in 
excess of 12 months but to reduce this to 12 months over a 
specified period.
Service contracts for Executive Directors
Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors, 
which are not of a fixed term and are terminable by either 
the Company or the Director, are set out below:
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Executive Directors Date of agreement Date of expiry Notice period
Nigel Newton 24 June 2003 – 12 Months
Richard Charkin 1 October 2007 – 12 Months
Wendy Pallot 10 March 2011 – 12 Months
At the Board’s discretion, early termination of an Executive Director’s service contract may be undertaken by way of payment 
of salary and benefits in lieu of the required notice period (or shorter period where permitted by the contract of service or 
where agreed with the Executive Director) and the Committee would take such steps as necessary to mitigate the loss to the 
Company and to ensure that the Executive Director observed his or her duty to mitigate loss. 
Annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the financial year served although it will be pro-rated for time 
and paid at the normal payout date. Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Company’s 
share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, 
ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, sale of employing business or other circumstances at the discretion of 
the Committee, “good leaver” status may be applied.  For good leavers, awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date, 
subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion 
of the performance period actually served. However, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to determine that 
awards vest at cessation of employment and/or not to pro-rate awards.
Non-Executive Directors
Each of the Non-Executive Directors (“NEDs”) has similar general terms for their agreement which can be found on 
Bloomsbury’s investor relations website at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The agreements provide for 3 months notice by the 
Director or by the Company with the option for the Company to terminate an appointment at any time on payment of 3 
months fees in lieu of notice. Termination of the agreements is without compensation. Details of the NED agreements are as 
follows:

Jill Jones 23 July2013 22 July 2013 July 2016 3 Months
Stephen Page 20 August 2013 20 August 2013 July 2016 3 Months 
1. the dates of expiry of NED appointments are set relative to Annual General Meetings which are expected to occur during July each year.
The annual fees of NEDs, excluding the Chairman, are determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The annual 
fee of the Chairman is determined by the other NEDs and the Executive Directors. NEDs receive a basic annual fee plus an 
extra annual amount for additional responsibilities such as chairing Board committees. The fees of the NEDs and Chairman are 
periodically reviewed against benchmark data provided by external remuneration consultants. Where NEDs and the Chairman 
receive an increase in annual fee this is normally limited to the budgeted annual increase in salaries for Bloomsbury employees. 
The NEDs and Chairman do not participate in the Company’s annual bonus or share incentive schemes including Sharesave.

From 1 March 2015, the Group’s employees generally including the Executive Directors received a pay increase of 2% 
reflecting the underlying performance of the business. In respect of the year ended 28 February 2015, the Group’s 
employees generally received pay increases in line with the market.
The basic salaries for the Executive Directors from 1 March are as follows:

1. As negotiated at the time of appointment, Richard Charkin’s base salary includes a modest uplift in lieu of pension and car allowance.
2. Wendy Pallot was assigned responsibility for the Group’s Information Technology from December 2012. Following a probationary period of 6 months to assess her 
performance, the assignment of responsibilities was made permanent. In view of the resulting increased responsibility, additional commitment required and her 
performance, the Committee approved an increase of £12,000 per annum to the her basic salary from 1 September 2013. The personal and strategic objectives 
for the annual cash bonus of Wendy Pallot in future years will include objectives relating to Bloomsbury’s IT.
Pensions
In accordance with the policy, pension contributions will be set at 15% of basic salary for Nigel Newton and Wendy Pallot. 
No pension contributions will be made by the Company for Richard Charkin.
Other benefits
Benefits will continue to comprise of a car or car allowance (excluding Richard Charkin), medical cover, permanent health 
cover, life assurance and Company schemes offered to staff generally such as buying books for private use at the staff 
discount rate.
Annual bonus
For 2015/16, the maximum bonus potential will continue to be set at 100% of salary based on profit with 30% of the bonus 
paid subject to achieving further objectives comprising 10% on personal objectives and 20% on strategic objectives.
The Group Management Bonus scheme used in previous years for the Executive Directors will continue to be adopted for 
2015/16. Under this scheme bonuses for the Executive Directors and approximately 40 managers are paid from a bonus 
pool determined by the Committee. The bonuses for the participants of the scheme are scaled-back where the pool is not 
sufficient to pay maximum bonuses. The maximum bonus for each participant is capped and depends on them achieving 
their individual bonus objectives.
The pool is calculated as the excess of Adjusted Profits (before bonus) above a stretching target set by the Committee. No 
bonuses are paid if Adjusted Profits fall below the target.

Long term incentives
As a result of the previous PSP (Bloomsbury 2005 Performance Share Plan) reaching the end of its 10 year life, shareholder 
consent for a new plan, based on the existing arrangements but updated in a number of areas to comply with best practice 
(including the reduction of the threshold vesting level and introduction of claw-back), was approved by shareholders at the 
2014 AGM. 
Reflecting market practice for a FTSE SmallCap company, the PSP individual annual award limits under the current PSP is 
100% of salary. The Committee has discretion to apply the exceptional limit of 150% of salary but envisages doing this only 
rarely when in the interests of the shareholders. 
The annual PSP awards granted in 2015 and onwards will be subject to the following targets:
 ✷ Relative EPS (50%) – 25% of this part of an award will vest for annualised growth in EPS over the performance period of RPI 
+3% increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting for annualised growth in EPS over the performance period of RPI + 8%; and
 ✷ Relative TSR (50%) – the Company’s TSR measured against the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap (excluding investment 
trusts). 25% of this part of an award will vest at median increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting at top quartile or higher. 
Relative EPS and TSR are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance for the Group, in 
that they ensure Executives are incentivised and rewarded for the earnings performance of the Group as well as returning 
value to shareholders.
The awards will be subject to clawback provisions. 
The Remuneration Committee has approved that the Executive Directors may participate in the Company’s Sharesave 
scheme if operated during 2015/16.

1. The Shareholding Guideline (100% of salary) was introduced during the year ended 28 February 2013 and can be found on the Company’s website  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The guideline requires that the Executive Director must retain shares vesting from the PSP awards net of tax until the shareholding 
guideline has been met. The number of shares needed to satisfy a Shareholding is recalculated at the close of the next business day following the announcement 
of the full year results (the “Review Date”). The recalculation is based on the Executive Director’s prevailing base salary and the closing mid-market share price 
(175.5 pence) on the Review Date.
2. Owned includes shares held directly by the Director and indirectly by a nominee on behalf of the Director where the Director has the beneficial interest. It includes 
the shares of the Director and of connected persons defined under the Model Code annexed to the UKLA Listing Rules.
Between 1 March 2015 and the date of this report, Nigel Newton disposed of 132,651 shares being his LTIP shares that most 
recently vested and Sir Anthony Salz acquired 5,000 shares.

Remuneration Committee
Responsibilities and activities of the Committee
The Committee determines the Remuneration Policy and annual remuneration plans for the Executive Directors for 
approval by the Board. In particular, the Committee approves for each Executive Director the basic salaries, pensions, other 
benefits, bonus awards and the awards made under Bloomsbury’s Long Term incentive Plan (see above). The Committee 
approves all payments of bonus and the vesting of PSP awards before payments are made for each Executive Director. 
The Committee considers it is appropriate for the Executive Directors to determine the remuneration plans of senior 
management. In respect of employees below the level of the Board, the Committee approves the bonus pool from which 
bonuses are paid and approves the grant and vesting of all share incentives before payments are made.
Membership
For the year ended 28 February 2015 up until signing the Report the Committee has comprised three Independent Non-
Executive Directors as follows, 
Director
Appointed in the year 
(if applicable)
Resigned in the year 
(if applicable)
Jill Jones (Chair of the Committee) - -
Sir Anthony Salz - -
Ian Cormack - -
The Group Company Secretary, Michael Daykin FCIS FCA, acts as secretary to the Committee. All meetings or business of the 
Committee have been conducted during the year with two Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive 
Chairman present.
The Committee met formally on four occasions during the year including two occasions without the Executive Directors 
present and on two occasions with an Executive Director attending part of meeting at the request of the Committee for 
specific items on the agenda. New Bridge Street attends Committee meetings where needed to provide technical support. 
The Committee chair has a standing item on the agenda at each main Board meeting, which provides the opportunity 
to update on and raise remuneration matters for discussion by the Board. Minutes of the Committee are circulated to the 
Board once they have been approved by the Committee.
Assistance to the Committee
During the year the Committee took advice from external remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street, which does not 
perform other services for and has no other connection with the Company (a statement to this effect is included on the 
Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.). The Committee is free to choose its advisors and is satisfied that New 
Bridge Street continues to provide advice that is objective and independent. Fees paid to New Bridge Street for 2014/15 
totalled £50,889.
The Committee received assistance from the Group Company Secretary and, where specifically requested by the 
Committee, the Chief Executive and Finance Director. The Committee has considered any feedback received from the 
major shareholders during the year as part of Bloomsbury’s ongoing investor relations programme and considers the 
reports and recommendations of shareholder representative bodies and corporate governance analysts.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BLOOMSBURY PUBLISHING PLC ONLY
Opinion and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc for the year ended 28 February 2015, set out on 
pages 87 to 147. In our opinion: 
 ✷ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 28 
February 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 ✷ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
 ✷ the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
 ✷ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion on the financial statements the risks of material misstatements that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows:
The risk Our response
Revenue – £111.1m; Returns provision – £6.1m
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee Report), page 95 (accounting policy) and pages 101 to 103 (financial disclosures)
In some cases contracts entered into by the Group for Rights 
and Services revenue (including sales of copyright and 
trademarks) are complex. These arrangements may include: 
the licensing or outright sale of the Group’s intellectual 
property; the provision of ongoing consultancy services; or 
occasionally a bundled combination of these. 
The complexity of the contractual terms may require the 
Group to make judgements in assessing when the triggers for 
revenue recognition have been met particularly as to when 
the Group has sufficiently fulfilled its obligations (licensing, 
consultancy or outright sale) under the contract to allow 
revenue to be recognised. 
For all individually significant Rights and Services contracts 
signed during the year, our audit procedures included:
 ✷ performing a detailed assessment of the contractual 
terms to identify separate milestone delivery dates to the 
respective customer;
 ✷ identifying from the contracts the triggers for revenue 
recognition and subsequent assessment of the allocation 
of revenue to each period; 
 ✷ where revenue has been recognised, we obtained, on 
a sample basis, evidence that the Group had fulfilled its 
obligations under the contract. This included, where 
appropriate, evidence of customer acceptance;
 ✷ For revenue on licensing arrangements that was 
recognised by the Group on delivery of the intellectual 
property, we considered whether there were any 
remaining contractual obligations or separate 
deliverables in the agreement which may preclude the 
recognition of revenue; and
 ✷ Where particular licensing arrangements individually 
have a large impact on the financial statements we 
assessed the adequacy of the disclosure of these 
transactions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF BLOOMSBURY PUBLISHING PLC ONLY
The risk Our response
Revenue – £111.1m; Returns provision – £6.1m
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee Report), page 95 (accounting policy) and pages 101 to 103 (financial disclosures)
The Group typically sells its books on a sale or return basis. 
Estimating the level of returns from customers may have 
a material impact on the reported result. As such this is a 
significant focus area for our audit. 
For the returns provision, our procedures included an 
assessment of historical returns from customers and 
comparing this against the returns rate used in the underlying 
provision calculation. This specifically focused on the actual 
returns rate in the current and previous financial year 
compared to those anticipated by the directors. 
We re-performed the Group’s return rate calculation and 
obtained evidence of actual returns post year end to assess the 
adequacy of the provision made.
We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in respect 
of the key judgements and estimates descriptions and the 
amounts recognised as revenue during the period or deferred 
at the balance sheet date.
Goodwill – £41.5m
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee Report), page 96 (accounting policy) and pages 112 to 113 (financial disclosures)
The Group has completed a number of significant acquisitions 
in the past three years. The recoverability of the goodwill 
is dependent on individual businesses acquired sustaining 
sufficient profitability in the future and the Group realising 
synergy savings associated with the acquisitions. Due to the 
inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting 
future cash flows, which are the basis of the assessment of 
recoverability, this is a significant risk area that our audit is 
focused on. 
Our audit procedures included testing of the budgeting 
procedures upon which the forecasts are based and assessing 
the integrity of the discounted cash flow model. We have used 
our knowledge of comparable companies to challenge the 
assumptions, in particular the inputs and methodology used 
in determining the discount rate used to calculate the present 
value of projected future cash flows. 
Our work included comparing the assumptions made by 
the Group in compiling the discount rate to market data. We 
considered the historical accuracy of key assumptions by 
comparing the accuracy of the previous estimates of revenue 
and cost growth to the actual amount achieved. We sensitised 
key assumptions, including the revenue growth rate and the 
discount rate and considered whether the disclosures about 
the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment 
to changes in key assumptions properly reflected the risks 
inherent in the valuation of goodwill.
Advances – £21.3m
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee Report), page 98 (accounting policy) and page 117 (financial disclosures)
The Group pays advances to its authors prior to the delivery of 
a manuscript. The Group recovers these advances from future 
sales by deducting royalties due to the author under the 
terms of the relevant royalty agreement. 
The advances balance is made up of a significant number 
of individual advances to authors and requires the Group to 
track sales made. 
In determining whether advances are recoverable, the 
Group must make judgements over the likely future sales of 
individual titles. Where insufficient sales are forecast by the 
Group, a provision is recorded. 
This is a significant risk area as there is inherent uncertainty 
regarding the future sales of individual titles.
In this area our procedures performed included testing the key 
controls in the advances process, including contract approval, 
and testing the accuracy of recording of contract information 
on the underlying accounting systems. This included agreeing 
the value of the advance paid and the royalty rate due to the 
author to the signed contract.
For individually significant advances held on balance sheet at 
the reporting date, we challenged the assumptions underlying 
the forecasts for future sales by analysing the accuracy of 
historical estimates of recoverability, both by genre and by 
title, and comparing forecasts made in prior periods to actual 
outcomes. We also considered the adequacy of the disclosures 
in respect of advances in the light of relevant accounting 
standards.

The risk Our response
Inventory – £29.2m
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee Report), page 98 (accounting policy) and page 117 (financial disclosures)
The Group has significant inventory balances which could be 
at risk of obsolescence if stock levels exceed anticipated future 
sales volumes.
As estimates of stock obsolescence are based on anticipated 
sales volumes, there is an inherent uncertainty included in the 
estimate which may have a material impact on the reported 
result. As such this is a significant focus area for our audit.
In this area our procedures performed included assessing the 
accuracy of the inventory reconciliation performed by the 
Group, which included obtaining confirmation from the third 
party stock handler of amounts held. 
We assessed the recoverability of aged inventory items based 
on sales made in the year and the Group’s internal forecast 
sales for future periods. In addition we assessed whether 
inventory was recorded at the lower of cost and recoverable 
value by comparing, on a sample basis, the recorded unit cost 
of stock against the market sales price at the time of testing.
We assessed whether the level of year end stock provision 
was consistent with the historical write offs. We also evaluated 
whether the Group’s provisioning policy was consistently 
applied and, based on an assessment of historical write-offs, 
remained appropriate. 
We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of inventory obsolescence. 
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £696,000, determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before taxation, of which it represents 7.2%.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £35,000 in addition to 
other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the group’s four reporting components, audits for Group reporting purposes were performed by component audit 
teams at two reporting components in the UK and the USA, covering 93% of total Group revenue; 100% of Group profit 
before taxation and 97% of total Group assets. For the remaining components in Australia and India, we performed 
analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within these. 
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks 
detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group audit team approved the component materialities, 
which ranged from £400,000 to £500,000, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the 
components.
The Group audit team (based in the UK) also visited a component location in the USA, to assess the audit risk and strategy 
and finally to review their audit files. Video and telephone conference meetings were also held with the US component 
auditors. At the visit and meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail, and any 
further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component auditor.

5. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or 
the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 ✷ we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or
 ✷ the Audit Committee section of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 60 does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 ✷ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 ✷ the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 ✷ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 ✷ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 ✷ a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 ✷ the directors’ statement, set out on page 53, in relation to going concern; and
 ✷ the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 59 relating to the company’s compliance with the ten 
provisions of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on pages 52 to 53, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A 
description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the Company’s members as a body and is subject

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1. Reporting entity
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the ‘Company’) is a Company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the 
Company’s registered office can be found on page 149. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and 
for the year ended 28 February 2015 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). The 
Group is primarily involved in the publication of books and other related services.
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
a)  Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations adopted by the European 
Union (‘EU’) at the time of preparing these financial statements and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. 
b)  Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on a going concern 
basis.
c)  Representation of highlighted items
An operating profit before highlighted items figure has been disclosed because in the view of the Directors this gives a 
fairer reflection of the core business performance. The basis for inclusion within highlighted items has changed in the year 
to more accurately reflect this and 28 February 2014 comparison has been restated accordingly. 
In response to the evolving digital marketplace the development of online knowledge hubs is now a core part of our 
business. In the light of this, our investment in online platforms, which was previously relatively small, has been increasing. 
We have therefore decided to change the treatment in our financial statements of the amortisation of product and systems 
development assets, our internally generated intangibles.
Amortisation within highlighted items now only includes amortisation of acquired intangible assets. Internally generated 
intangible asset amortisation has been removed from highlighted items as it is considered to be a recurring and standard 
cost of the business. 
Internally generated intangible asset amortisation of £1,054,000 for the year ended 28 February 2014 has been removed 
from highlighted items. 
The adjusted profit figure used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share has been restated to remove the internally 
generated intangible asset amortisation from highlighted items. The effect is to decrease the adjusted profit. 
The operating segment comparative information has been amended to reflect this change. Product and system 
development amortisation is now allocated to divisions in the operating results reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker. The comparative information has been amended to reflect this change.

d)  Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position 
are set out in the Strategic Review on pages 1 to 45. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position 
are described in the Financial Review on pages 29 to 35. In addition, note 23 to the financial statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its 
financial instruments, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Directors believe that the Group’s diversification of product and geographical spread together with its monitoring 
and forecasting processes place the Group well in managing its business risks. The Group’s forecasts and projections, 
taking into account reasonable possible changes in trading performance, indicate that the Group is able to operate within 
the level of its current available facilities including compliance with the bank facility covenants. Details of the bank facility 
and its covenants are shown in Note 23c).
After making enquiries of senior management and reviewing cash flow forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 
until June 2016, being the period of the detailed going concern assessment reviewed by the Board. They therefore 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. 
e)  Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Critical judgments and areas 
where the use of estimates is significant are disclosed in note 2w). 
f)  Application of new and amended standards and interpretations
The following amendments and interpretations were adopted by the Group for the year ended 28 February 2015 and have 
not had a material impact on the Group financial statements:
 ✷ IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Involvement with 
Other Entities’, amendments to IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ and amendments to IAS 28 ‘Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures’ (issued as a package effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014). 
These are a new suite of standards on consolidation and related standards, replacing the existing accounting for 
subsidiaries and joint ventures (now joint arrangements), and making limited amendments in relation to associates.
 ✷ Amendments to IAS 39, ‘Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting’, effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. The amendments mean there would be no need to 
discontinue hedge accounting if a hedge derivative was novated and certain criteria met.
 ✷ Amendments to IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’, effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2014. The amendments clarify some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial 
liabilities on the balance sheet.
The Directors are currently assessing the potential impact of other new and revised accounting standards, interpretations 
or amendments issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are currently endorsed but not yet effective. 
They have not been adopted early by the Group and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
g)  Basis of consolidation
i) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date 
on which control is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of 
an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 ✷ the fair value of consideration transferred; plus
 ✷ the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; less
 ✷ the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Where the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. 
Such amounts are generally recognised in the income statement.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in 
connection with the business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured and recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in the income statement. 
For acquisitions before 1 January 2010, the Group applies IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2004) in accounting for 
business combinations. All changes to contingent consideration in respect of these acquisitions are recognised as 
an adjustment to goodwill.
ii) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights 
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from 
the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned with accounting policies adopted by the Group to ensure 
consistency.
All subsidiaries except Bloomsbury Publishing India Private Limited and the recently acquired Osprey Publishing 
group have a reporting period end of 28 February. Bloomsbury Publishing India Private Limited has a reporting 
period end of 31 March, which aligns with the Indian government’s financial year. The Osprey Group entities have a 
31 December year end. 
iii) Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any 
non-controlling interests and the other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. 
iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group 
transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are 
eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are 
eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

h)  Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received from the provision of goods, services and rights falling within 
the Group’s ordinary activities, after deduction of trade discounts, value added tax and anticipated returns. 
 ✷ Revenue from book publishing is recognised when title passes. A provision for anticipated returns is made based 
primarily on historical return rates. If these do not reflect actual returns in future periods then revenues could be 
understated or overstated for a particular period. 
 ✷ Revenue from the sale of publishing and distribution rights, including film, paperback, electronic, overseas publishing 
rights, and sponsorship, is recognised when the Group has discharged its obligations under the arrangement to 
deliver the associated material, and the Group has either received appropriately enacted contractual documentation 
or received payment, whichever occurs first. 
 ✷ Revenue from database contracts is recognised in accordance with the stages of completion of contractual services 
provided. The degree of completion is calculated as a proportion of the content generated against the contractually 
agreed milestone, for example number of words generated. Where the degree of completion of milestones cannot be 
reliably measured, revenue is only recognised in full on completion. 
 ✷ Revenue from management services contracts is usually recognised on a straight-line basis over the period that the 
service is provided. 
 ✷ Revenue from e-book sales is recognised when content is delivered.
i)  Foreign currencies
i) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). These consolidated 
financial statements are presented in sterling (£) as this is the most representative currency of the Group’s 
operations. All financial information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest thousand except where 
otherwise stated.
ii) Transactions and balances
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded in the functional currency at the rates 
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated 
into sterling at closing rates of exchange at the date of the statement of financial position. 
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement within administrative expenses.
iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the group entities that have a functional currency different from the 
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 ✷ Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the 
date of that statement of financial position;
 ✷ Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates; and
 ✷ All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the 
translation reserve in equity. On disposal of a foreign entity these exchange differences are recycled to the 
income statement. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities 
of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity.

j)  Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
i) Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported 
in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are 
generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit 
will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit 
nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profits will be generated to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period. 
iii) Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited 
or charged directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in 
other comprehensive income or equity respectively. 
k)  Goodwill and other intangible assets
i) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the 
business (see note 2g) i) less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or 
groups of cash-generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently 
where there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is 
less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset 
in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss in the consolidated income 
statement. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. 
On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over their 
expected useful lives by equal annual instalments at the following rates:
 Publishing relationships  - 5% to 20% per annum
 Imprints  - 3% to 5% per annum
 Subscriber and customer relationships  - 6% to 17% per annum
 Product and systems development  - 14% to 20% per annum
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted 
prospectively if appropriate.
iii) Product and systems development
Costs that are directly associated with the purchase and implementation of systems, such as software products, are 
recognised as intangible assets. Likewise costs incurred in developing a product, typically an online platform, are 
recognised as intangible assets.
Expenditure is only capitalised if costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and commercially 
feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development 
and use the asset.
I)  Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated in order to write down their cost less residual value using the straight-line 
method over their expected useful lives at the following rates: 
Short leasehold improvements - over the remaining life of the lease
Furniture and fittings - 10% per annum
Computer and other office equipment - 20% per annum
Motor vehicles - 25% per annum
Depreciation is pro-rated in the years of acquisition and disposal of an asset. The estimated useful lives, residual value 
and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined 
as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income 
statement.
m) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At the end of each reporting period the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of 
the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. 
n) Inventories
Inventories include bound stock. The cost of work in progress and finished goods represents the amounts invoiced to the 
Group for origination, paper, printing and binding. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Provisions are made for slow 
moving and obsolete stock.
o) Royalty advances to authors
Advances of royalties to authors are included within prepayments and accrued income when the advance is paid less any 
provision required to adjust the advance to its net realisable value. The royalty advance is expensed at the contracted or 
effective royalty rate as the related revenues are earned. 
p) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be 
estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. When 
a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present 
value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).
q) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group has become a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are as below:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially stated at fair value after provision for bad and doubtful debts and anticipated future sales 
returns and thereafter they are held at amortised cost. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank and other short-term deposits held by the Group, repayable 
on demand.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
r) Operating leases
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating lease by the lessee. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are 
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

s) Employee benefits
i) Defined contribution plans
Pension costs relating to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised in the income statement in the 
period for which related services are rendered by the employee. 
ii) Defined benefit plans
Until 1997 a subsidiary company operated a defined benefit pension scheme. The retirement obligation recognised 
in the statement of financial position represents the net of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and 
the fair value of plan assets at the statement of financial position date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are 
charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. The service cost, 
representing benefits accruing over the year, is included in the income statement as an operating cost. Net interest 
is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit obligation and is presented as finance costs or 
finance income.
iii) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic 
possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan either to terminate employment before the normal retirement 
date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
iv) Share-based payment transactions
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payment instruments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date 
of equity-settled share-based payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. 
Options granted under the Group’s share option schemes and sharesave scheme are equity settled. The fair values 
of such options have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model or a modified version of the same, based on 
publicly available market data. 
Awards granted under the Group’s performance share plan are equity settled. Half of any award granted under 
the plan is subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition. The fair value of this element of the 
awards is calculated using the Stochastic model. The other half of any award granted under the plan is subject to 
an Earnings Per Share performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is calculated using the 
Black-Scholes model.
t) Employee benefit trust
The Company operates an employee benefit trust and has de facto control of shares held by the trust and bears their 
benefits and risks. The Group considers the trust to be substantially under its control and so consolidates the financial 
information of the trust as stated in note 2g). The Group records the assets and liabilities of the trust as its own and shares 
held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Finance costs and administrative expenses 
are charged as they accrue.
u) Segmental reporting
Operating segments, which have not been aggregated, are reported in a manner that is consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’), regarded as the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The CEO views the Group primarily from a nature of business basis, reflecting the divisional performance of Adult, 
Children’s & Educational, Academic & Professional and Information. Segment results that are reported to the CEO include 
items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Performance is 
evaluated based on operating profit contributions using the same accounting policies as adopted for the Group’s financial 
statements.

v) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as liabilities once they are appropriately authorised.
w) Critical accounting estimates and judgments
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
reasonable expectations of future events. The resultant estimates will, by definition, not necessarily equal the related actual 
results and may require adjustment in subsequent accounting periods. The estimates and assumptions that may cause a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are:
Revenue recognition
Certain contracts entered into by the Bloomsbury Information division may include: the licensing or outright sale of the 
Group’s intellectual property; the provision of ongoing consultancy services; or a bundled combination of both.   
The Group considers contractual terms and makes judgements in assessing when the triggers for revenue recognition 
have been met particularly that the Group has sufficiently fulfilled its obligations under the contract to allow revenue to be 
recognised. 
Book returns
As books are returnable by customers, the Group makes a provision against books sold in the accounting period which 
is then carried forward and offset against trade receivables in the statement of financial position in anticipation of book 
returns received subsequent to the reporting period end. The provision is calculated by reference to historical returns 
rates and expected future returns.
Author advances
A provision is made by the Group against advances on published titles which may not be covered by royalties on 
anticipated future title sales or subsidiary rights receivable. At the end of each financial year a review is carried out on all 
published titles advances. If it is unlikely that royalties from future title sales or subsidiary rights will fully earn down the 
advance, a provision is made in the income statement for the difference between the carrying value and the anticipated 
recoverable amount from future earnings.
Inventory
At the end of each reporting period a review is carried out on all published titles where inventory is held. A provision is 
made by the Group against unsold inventory on a title by title basis, with regard to historical net sales and expected future 
net sales, to value the inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Impairment reviews
IFRS requires management to undertake an annual test for impairment of indefinite life assets and, for finite life assets, 
to test for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be 
recoverable. The Group currently undertakes an annual impairment test covering goodwill and other indefinite life assets 
and also reviews finite life assets to consider whether a full impairment review is required. 
Intangible assets recoverability is an area involving management judgment, requiring assessment as to whether the 
carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash 
flow projections which have been discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash 
flows, certain assumptions are required to be made. Note 11 details the assumptions used.

Legal and other professional costs of £215,000 were incurred primarily in relation to the acquisition of the Osprey 
Publishing group, see note 9 (2014: £218,000 incurred primarily in relation to the acquisition of Hart Publishing Ltd and the 
trade and assets of New Holland). 
Restructuring costs of £435,000 have been incurred as a result of the Group’s acquisition activities and the One Global 
Bloomsbury strategic reorganisation (2014: £547,000 incurred as a result of the Group’s acquisition activities and the One 
Global Bloomsbury strategic reorganisation).

The £795,000 deferred tax adjustment in respect of prior years for the year ended 28 February 2015 relates to increased 
certainty over the recoverability of provision temporary differences in the US.
The £484,000 current tax adjustment for the year ended 28 February 2014 includes an adjustment to align the prior year 
Group tax charge with recently submitted tax returns and the write off of old payable balances no longer due.
c)  Factors affecting tax charge for future years
The UK current tax rate will be reduced from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. We have applied the 20% tax rate for

9. Acquisitions
Osprey Publishing Group
On 22 December 2014 the Group acquired the issued share capital of Osprey Publishing Limited (‘Osprey’), the Oxford-
based military and natural history publisher, from private equity ownership, principally The Third Alcuin Fund LP, a fund 
managed by Alcuin Capital Partners LLP. The consideration of £4.6 million was satisfied by the payment of £3.2 million in 
cash on completion and the issue of 869,054 new Bloomsbury Ordinary shares to the value of £1.4 million.
The acquisition of Osprey increases our presence in niche special interest markets. It is complementary to, and will 
substantially enhance, our existing lists; in particular increasing the division’s expertise in natural history and military 
history publishing, as well as international sales. Over 50% of Osprey’s revenue is generated outside the UK, thereby 
increasing Bloomsbury’s benefit from the global book market.

years and imprint 20 years. The goodwill arising of £1,581,000 is attributable to the expected profitability of the acquired 
business and the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition.
The gross contractual trade receivable at acquisition is £1,644,000 of which £46,000 is the best estimate of the contractual 
cash flows that are not expected to be collected.
Transaction costs of £210,000 have been expensed in the year within administrative expenses. 
From 23 December 2014 revenue of £1,195,000 and profit before tax attributable to owners of the Company of £26,000 has 
been included in the consolidated income statement in relation to Osprey.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 March 2014 the revenue and profit attributable to shareholders of the combined 
entity for the current year would have been £117.0 million and £8.3 million respectively. These pro forma amounts do not 
include any possible synergies from the acquisition. The pro forma information is provided for comparative purposes only 
and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results

Prior year acquisition
Hart Publishing 
On 2 September 2013 the Group acquired the issued share capital of Hart Publishing Limited (‘Hart’), the Oxford-based 
legal publisher, from the management shareholders. An initial consideration of £6.5 million was paid in cash on completion 
from Bloomsbury’s own cash reserves. A further cash consideration of £0.5 million was payable on the achievement of 
certain revenue and title number targets for the period ending 31 March 2014. As these targets were met the amount was 
paid in the year ended February 2015. This is net of a working capital adjustment of £288,000 as the closing working capital 
was less than the target closing working capital anticipated at the point of acquisition. The acquisition is consistent with 
Bloomsbury’s strategy to increase its proportion of academic and professional revenues to 50% of total sales in five years’ 
time. Around 50% of Hart’s revenue is generated outside the UK, thereby increasing Bloomsbury’s benefit from the global 
book market. The acquisition enabled the Company to further develop its e-book publishing and expand the Bloomsbury 
Professional digital suite of services.

Identifiable intangible assets of £2,196,000 consist of publishing rights of £621,000, imprint of £1,110,000 and customer

relationships 14 years. 
The gross contractual trade receivable at acquisition is £556,000 of which £16,000 is the best estimate of the contractual 
cash flows that are not expected to be collected.
Transaction costs of £159,000 have been expensed in the prior year within administrative expenses. 
From 2 September 2013 revenue of £1,753,000 and profit before tax attributable to owners of the Company of £538,000 has 
been included in the consolidated income statement in relation to Hart.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 March 2013 the revenue and profit attributable to shareholders of the combined entity 
for the year ended 28 February 2014 would have been £110,648,000 and £7,738,000 respectively. These pro forma amounts 
do not include any possible synergies from the acquisition. The pro forma information is provided for comparative

Impairment testing
The recoverable amount of the Group’s goodwill has been considered with regard to value in use calculations. These 
calculations use the pre-tax future cash flow projections of each cash generating unit (‘CGU’) based on the Board’s 
approved budgets for the year ended 28 February 2016 and the Board approved five-year plan. The calculations include 
a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of the five-year plan with a long-term growth rate assumption 
applied.
The key assumptions for calculating value in use are:
Discount rates Revenue growth Long-term growth

Information 10.0 10.0 (9.8)-7.0 7.4-8.9 2.5 2.5
Discount rates
The discount rates applied to the cash flows are calculated using a pre-tax rate based on the weighted average cost of 
capital for the Group. This is adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates. The Group has considered 
the impact of the current economic climate in determining appropriate discount rates. 
Revenue growth rates
Growth rates have been calculated based on those applied to the Board approved budget for the year ended 28 February 
2016 and five-year plan. They incorporate future expectations of growth in backlist revenues and identified new revenue 
streams. 
Long-term growth rates
The five-year forecasts are extrapolated to perpetuity on the basis that the relevant CGUs are long established business 
units.
Gross margin
Gross margins have been based on historic performance and expected changes to the sales mix in future periods. 
Sensitivity
The Group has not identified any reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of 
goodwill of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

14. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
a) Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using the tax rate appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the 
asset or liability arises and the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets in respect of losses are only recognised to the extent that it is anticipated they will be utilised in the 
foreseeable future. The significant credit to the income statement primarily relates to increased certainty over the 
recoverability of provision temporary differences in the US and recoverability of trading losses in the UK.
b) The analysis for financial reporting purposes is as follows:

Deferred tax assets 3,607 2,095
Deferred tax liabilities (3,119) (3,177)

c) Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
The Group had deferred tax assets not recognised in the financial statements as follows:
28 February
 2015
£’000
28 February
 2014
£’000
Unused tax losses – 598
Non-trading losses 465 425
Total 465 1,023
The gross tax losses on which no deferred asset has been recognised were £nil (2014: £2,989,000). The remaining 
unrecognised losses from 2014 have been fully recognised in 2015 as the Directors now deem them fully recoverable. This 
relates to tax losses for a subsidiary in the UK. These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At 28 February 2015 the Group had non-trading losses of approximately £2.3 million (2014: 2.1 million). A deferred tax asset 
has not been recognised in respect of non-trading losses carried forward as it is not clear whether sufficient non-trading 
income against which the losses may be offset will arise in the Group in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the Group controls the timing of remittance and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values. The 
Group’s exposure to credit and currency risks is disclosed in note 23. Trade receivables principally comprise amounts 
receivable from the sale of books due from distributors. The average number of days’ credit taken for sales of books by the 
Group was 104 days (2014: 97 days). 
The majority of trade debtors are secured by credit insurance and in certain territories by overseas third party distributors.

The Group acquired Oxford International Publishers Limited (t/a Berg Publishers) in 2008. The contingent consideration 
arrangement is based on average revenues for the Berg Fashion element of the business and is payable based on results 
for the years ended 28 February 2015 and 29 February 2016. The maximum potential undiscounted amount of all future 
payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is £1,000,000, of 
which £439,000 has been recognised at 28 February 2015.

The Company has one class of Ordinary Share which carries equal voting rights and no contractual right to receive 
payment. No shares are held by the Company as Treasury shares. Directors and other employees of the Group have been 
granted options to purchase 2,371,666 (2014: 2,626,077) Ordinary Shares with an aggregate nominal value of £29,646  
(2014: £32,826) (note 21).
The increase in share capital in the year relates to the Ordinary Shares issued for the acquisition of Osprey Publishing, see 
note 9, and Ordinary Shares issued to satisfy share options exercised in the year.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial information 
of foreign operations.
Merger reserve 
The merger reserve comprises the amount that would otherwise arise in share premium relating to specific share issue, 
wherein more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares 
by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 2006.
The movement on the merger reserve in the year relates to the acquisition of Osprey Publishing, see note 9.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve arose on the purchase by the Company of its own shares and comprises the amount by 
which the distributable profits were reduced on these transactions. 
Share-based payment reserve
The share-based payment reserve comprises cumulative amounts charged in respect of employee share-based payment 
arrangements which have not yet been settled by means of an award of shares to an individual. 
Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust
The Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) is an independent discretionary trust established to acquire issued shares of the 
Company to satisfy any of the share-based incentive schemes (see note 21) and plans of the Company. All employees of the 
Group are potential beneficiaries of the EBT. The results and net assets of the EBT are included in the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group. 
During the year to ended 28 February 2015 550,354 shares held by the EBT were used to satisfy share option exercises under 
the Bloomsbury Performance Share Plan (see note 21). 79,597 EBT shares were used to satisfy the dividends due on the 
vested shares exercised. 
The market value of the 268,293 shares of the Company held at 28 February 2015 (2014: 898,244) in the EBT was £397,000 
(2014: £1,590,000). Whilst the trustee has power to subscribe for Ordinary Shares and to acquire Ordinary Shares in the 
market or from Treasury, it is not permitted to hold more than five per cent of the issued share capital without prior 
approval of the shareholders.
As at the date of signing this Annual Report, the Trust held 268,293 Ordinary Shares of 1.25 pence being approximately 
0.4% of the issued Ordinary share capital. 
Retained earnings
The retained earnings reserve comprises profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company and other items 
recognised directly through equity as presented on the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
21. Share-based payments
Options over shares of the ultimate parent undertaking, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, have been granted to employees of 
the Group under various schemes. 
The total share-based payment charge to the income statement for the year was as follows:

Equity settled share-based transactions 404 597
Cash settled share-based transactions 92 89
Total 496 686
National Insurance contributions are payable by the Company in respect of some of the share-based payment 
transactions. These contributions are payable on the date of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based 
payments and are therefore treated as cash settled awards. The Group had an accrual for National Insurance at  
28 February 2015 of £58,000 (2014: £48,000), of which none related to vested options. 
a) The 1994 Approved Executive Share Option Schemes (‘Approved 1994 ESOS’)
All Approved 1994 ESOS options outstanding at 28 February 2015 and 28 February 2014 have vested. No options have been 
granted under the scheme since 2004.

Grants under the Approved 1994 ESOS were made on an annual basis to selected employees, with the exercise price 
of options being not less than the higher of the nominal value of an Ordinary Share and the average middle market 
quotation of an Ordinary Share for the three dealing days immediately preceding the offer of options under the Scheme. If 
options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of the grant or if (except in certain circumstances) the 
employee leaves the Group, the options lapse.

b) The Bloomsbury Performance Share Plan 2005 (‘the PSP’)
The Group operates the PSP for Directors and senior employees. Awards under the scheme are granted as conditional 
share awards. The number of Ordinary Shares comprised in an award is calculated using a share value equal to either the 
average middle-market price of the Ordinary Share for the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date or the 
middle-market price on the dealing day before the award date. 
The vesting period is three years and the level of vesting is subject to the achievement of Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) and 
Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance conditions. For details of the performance conditions see the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 65 to 82. Awards are not exercisable after the vesting date and awards that vest on the 
vesting date are automatically exercised. Except in certain circumstances awards lapse if the employee leaves the Group.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
The share awards granted in the year to 28 February 2015 have been measured by New Bridge Street Consultants. The TSR 
element has been measured using the Stochastic model and the EPS element has been measured using the Black-Scholes 
model. The inputs were:
Performance condition Earnings Per Share Total Shareholder Return
Share price 162.5 pence 162.5 pence
Exercise price - -
Expected term 3 years 3 years
Expected volatility n/a 22.7%
Risk free interest rate n/a 0.8%
Fair value charge per award 162.5 pence 95.14 pence
The expected volatility was based on Bloomsbury’s share price volatility over the period prior to grant equal in length to 
the expected three year performance period. Half of each award is subject to an EPS performance condition (which is not 
factored into the valuation). Half of each award is subject to a Total Shareholder Return condition whereby performance 
is compared to the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding Investment Trusts) over a three year period from the date of grant. A 
median ranking results in 25% of shares subject to this performance condition vesting, rising to 100% for an upper quartile 
ranking. The discount for this TSR condition is calculated at the date of grant using the Stochastic model.
c) Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan 2005
The Group operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings related share option scheme under which employees 
are granted options to purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company in three years’ time, dependent upon their entering into 
a contract to make monthly contributions to a savings account over the period of the savings term. The Sharesave Plan is 
open to all UK employees.

d) The Bloomsbury Company Share Option Plan 2014 (‘the CSOP’)
The Group operates the CSOP for senior employees. Awards under the scheme were granted at an option price per share

Annualised EPS in excess of RPI element has been measured using the Black-Scholes model. The inputs were:
Performance condition Annualised EPS
Share price 162.5 pence
Exercise price 160.0 pence
Expected term 6.5 years
Expected volatility 27.5%
Risk free interest rate 1.5%
Fair value charge per award 51.25 pence
For the CSOP awards, volatility was calculated with reference to share price movements over the period prior to the grant 
date which is commensurate with the expected term. This results in a volatility of 27.5%.

22. Retirement benefit obligations
Pension costs
The pension costs charged to the income statement of £798,000 (2014: £602,000) relate to the Group’s defined 
contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements. 
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all qualifying employees.
The total cost charged to the income statement of £792,000 (2014: £597,000) represents contributions payable to 
these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes. At 28 February 2015 there were no prepaid 
contributions (28 February 2014: nil).
Defined benefit plan
A subsidiary company operates a defined benefit scheme for some staff which is accounted for in accordance with IAS 19. 
Accrual of benefits ceased in 1997, with the scheme now operated as a closed fund. There is no obligation in respect of 
medical costs. The scheme is actuarially valued every three years. The last full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 29 
February 2012 and updated to 28 February 2015 by a qualified independent actuary.
Contributions are paid by the employer at the rate of £1,777 per month, plus expenses as and when required. 
Contributions paid to the scheme during the year were £21,000 (2014: £34,000). The Directors’ best estimate of the 
contribution to be paid for in the year ending 28 February 2016 is £46,000. 
The Group’s policy is to fund the deficit in the scheme by additional contributions to meet the scheme’s commitment to 
members.
The financial assumptions used by the actuary for the update were as follows:
28 February
 2015
28 February
 2014
28 February
 2013
Discount rate 3.40% 4.40% 4.50% 
Inflation assumption 2.10–3.10% 2.50–3.40% 2.55–3.30% 
The scheme is closed and there are no active paying members, therefore no increases in payments have been applied. 
The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale 
covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The mortality assumptions adopted at 28 February 2015 are 110% of the standard tables PNxA00, Year of Birth, no age 
rating for males and females, projected using Long Cohort underpinned by 1.00% p.a. These imply the following life

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
There is no material difference between the fair value and book value of financial assets and liabilities. 
The contingent consideration is measured in accordance with Level 3 valuation techniques (which use inputs which have a 
significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data).
Financial risk management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management 
framework. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets 
and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance from the key risks of market risk 
(including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Board has approved the Group Treasury policies and procedures by which the Group Treasury function is to be 
managed. The Group Treasury function is headed by the Group Finance Director and is part of Bloomsbury’s Finance 
Department. It operates under a delegated authority from the Board. 
The treasury management policies and procedures focus on the investment of surplus operating cash likely to be needed 
in order to support Bloomsbury’s on-going operations, foreign currency requirements and interest rate risk management. 
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The policies are reviewed at least on an annual basis 
by the Group Finance Director and any amendments are approved by the Board. The Board is assisted in its oversight role 
by Internal Audit, who undertakes regular reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are 
reported to the Audit Committee. 
a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to 
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in 
interest rates. The Group incurs costs in the same currencies as it earns revenue creating some degree of natural hedging. 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by Group 
Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Group Treasury monitors the distribution of its cash assets so as 
to control exposure to the relative performance of any particular territory, currency or institution.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as 
funding, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of excess liquidity.
(i) Interest rate risk
The Group has significant interest bearing assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents and as such cash flows are 
dependent on changes in market interest rates.

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate financial assets
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore a change in 
interest rates at 28 February 2015 would not affect the income statement. 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The Group derived the following sensitivities to assess the impact of changes in interest rates, based on the effect of 
the market volatility in the current climate and the previous 12 months. The analysis assumes all other variables remain 
constant.

(ii) Currency risk
The Directors believe that in its current circumstances that the Group’s risk from foreign currency exposure is limited and 
no active currency risk management by hedging is considered necessary, as a significant proportion of revenues are 
matched by expenditure in the same local currency creating some degree of natural hedging.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The Group derived the following sensitivities based on the outstanding foreign currency denominated financial assets 
and liabilities at the year end. The sensitivity analysis includes loans to foreign operations within the Group where the 
denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or the borrower. 
The use of a 10% sensitivity rate has been determined based on the effect of the market volatility in exchange rates 
between the current and previous year end, and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change 
in foreign exchange rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity.

b) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s trade and rights income receivables. 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The amounts presented in the statement 
of financial position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on 
trading experience and the current economic environment. An analysis of the relevant provisions is set out in note 16.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings as assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies.
The Group determines its concentration of credit risk based on the individual characteristics of its customers and publicly 
available knowledge of specific circumstances affecting those customers. The Group defines counterparties as having 
similar characteristics if they are related entities. 
The Group has a significant concentration of credit risk due to its use of third party distributors. Credit limits for the final 
customers are set by the distributors based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit 
limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. The distributors belong to 
established international groups whose business includes a number of publishing interests and clients. The Group’s risk 
is limited as significant amounts outstanding through the UK distributors are secured by credit insurance, and in the US 
credit risk for significant amounts outstanding through distributors rests with the distributor.

c) Liquidity risk
The Directors do not consider that the Group currently has a significant exposure to liquidity risk, as the Group has limited 
borrowing and has sufficient cash deposits to meet its debts as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Cash flow budgets and forecasts are prepared by the operating entities of the Group, aggregated for the Group and 
regularly reviewed by the Board, and the actual cash position of the Group and each entity is compared monthly against 
budget. This allows management to ensure that each operating entity and the Group have sufficient cash to meet 
operational needs. Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above the balance required for working capital 
management is invested in interest bearing accounts and money market deposits. 
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility with Lloyds Bank plc. At 28 February 2015 the Group had drawn down 
£2.5 million of this facility with £13 million of undrawn borrowing facilities (2014: £12 million) available. This comprised of a 
£13.5 million committed revolving loan facility and a £2 million overdraft. The overdraft facility is available until November 
2015 and the loan facility matures in July 2016. The facility is subject to two covenants being a maximum net debt to EBITDA 
ratio and a minimum interest cover covenant. 
The Group’s financial liabilities are trade payables, accruals and other payables as shown above. Apart from the identified 
other payables due after one year and the contingent consideration of £439,000 due after one year (see note 19), all other 
financial liabilities are due within one year.
24. Operating leases

Later than one year and less than five years 5,529 4,989
After more than five years 3,394 4,555
Total 10,245 10,782
The operating leases represent rentals payable by the Group for certain office properties, vehicles and equipment. The 
lease at the headquarters in Bedford Square is for a period of twenty years from January 2010 with an option to break the 
lease at the tenth year. The operating leases over vehicles are in respect of company cars driven by certain employees. The 
operating leases over equipment are in respect of office equipment. 
25. Commitments and contingent liabilities
a) Capital commitments
The Group has no capital commitments relating to property, plant and equipment at the year end (2014: no commitments)
b) Other commitments
The Group is committed to paying royalty advances to authors in subsequent financial years. At 28 February 2015 this 
commitment amounted to £14,315,000 (2014: £15,251,000).
c)  Guarantees
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have guarantees to Lloyds Bank plc in place relating to the Group’s borrowing 
facilities, see note 23c). 
26. Related party transactions
The Group has no related party transactions other than key management remuneration as disclosed in note 5.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL

COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
28. Reporting entity
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the Company’s 
registered office can be found on page 149. The Company is primarily involved in the publication of books and other 
related services.
29. Significant accounting policies 
a)  Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations adopted by the European 
Union (‘EU’) at the time of preparing these financial statements and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least until June 2016, being the 
period of the detailed going concern assessment reviewed by the Board..
The Company accounting policies are consistent with the Group policies set out in note 2 of the consolidated financial 
statements. Key additional policies are stated below. 
b)  Parent company result
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to 
present the Company income statement or statement of comprehensive income. The Company’s profit for the year was 
£2,130,000 (2014: £4,705,000). 
c)  Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the Company financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised and in any future years affected. Critical judgments and areas where 
the use of estimates is significant are disclosed in note 2w) for the Group and are applicable for the Company.
d)  Application of new and amended standards and interpretations
The following amendments and interpretations were adopted by the Company for the year ended 28 February 2015 and 
have not had a material impact on the Company financial statements:
 ✷ Amendments to IAS 39, ‘Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting’, effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. The amendments mean there would be no need to 
discontinue hedge accounting if a hedge derivative was novated and certain criteria met.
 ✷ Amendments to IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’, effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2014. The amendments clarify some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial 
liabilities on the balance sheet.
The Directors are currently assessing the potential impact of other new and revised accounting standards, interpretations 
or amendments issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are currently endorsed but not yet effective. 
They have not been adopted early by the Company and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s 
financial statements.

e)  Investment in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less accumulated impairment in the statement of financial position. 
Investments are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there are any indicators of impairment. Any 
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the year they occur.
f)  Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payment instruments to certain employees of the Group. Equity-settled 
share-based payment transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of equity-settled share-based payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. 
Options granted under the Company’s share option schemes and sharesave scheme are equity settled. The fair values of 
such options have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model or a modified version of the same, based on publicly 
available market data. 
Awards granted under the Company’s performance share plan are equity settled. Half of any award granted under 
the plan is subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards 
is calculated using the Stochastic model. Half of any award granted under the plan is subject to an Earnings Per Share 
performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
Awards granted under the Company’s Share Option Plan are equity settled. The award is subject to an Adjusted Earnings 
Per Share growth performance condition. The fair value of this award is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
The Company recharges a share of the share-based payment charge to subsidiaries. This recharge is made via 
intercompany transactions.

The use of a 10% sensitivity rate has been determined based on the effect of the market volatility in exchange rates 
between the current and previous year end, and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change 
in foreign exchange rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or loss and equity.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
b)  Credit risk 
The Company has a significant concentration of credit risk due to its use of third party distributors. Credit limits for the final 
customers are set by the distributors based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit 
limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. The distributors belong to 
established international groups whose business includes a number of publishing interests and clients. The Company’s risk 
is limited as significant amounts outstanding through the UK distributors are secured by credit insurance. 
c)  Liquidity risk
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility with Lloyds Bank plc. At 28 February 2015 the Group had drawn 
down £2.5 million of this facility with £13 million of undrawn borrowing facilities (2014: £12 million) available. The facility 
comprises of a £13.5 million committed revolving loan facility and a £2 million overdraft. The overdraft facility is available 
until November 2015 and the loan facility matures in July 2016. The facility is subject to two covenants being a maximum 
net debt to EBITDA ratio and a minimum interest cover covenant.

EXPLANATION OF THE  
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
To Bloomsbury Shareholders and, for information only, to the holders of share options and awards under the 
Company’s share incentive schemes.
This document is important and requires your immediate attention.
1. If you are in any doubt as to the action you should take, you are recommended to seek your own financial advice 
immediately from your stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant, fund manager or other appropriate 
independent financial adviser authorised under the Financial Services and Markets act 2000.
2. If you sell or have sold or otherwise transferred all of your shares, you should send this document together with the 
accompanying Form of Proxy as soon as possible to the purchaser or transferee or to the stockbroker, bank or other 
agent through whom the sale or transfer was effected for delivery to the purchaser or the transferee.
Dear Shareholder
The 2015 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the “Company”) is to be held at 50 Bedford 
Square, London WC1B 3DP on Thursday 23 July 2015 at 12 noon. The formal notice convening the AGM is set out on pages 
153 to 156 below.
Information regarding the AGM, including the information required by section 311A of the Companies Act 2006 (the 
“Act”), is available from www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
The AGM is an important opportunity for the Directors to listen to the Shareholders and respond to their questions. It is 
also when Shareholders are asked to vote in favour of various resolutions related to the running and management of the 
Company. Therefore below are explanatory notes relating to the resolutions that you will be asked to consider and vote on 
at the AGM. Resolutions 1 to 7 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions and resolutions 8 and 9 will be proposed as special 
resolutions.
As at 12 noon on the date of this notice, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 75,003,734 Ordinary Shares of 
1.25 pence each (subject to any changes that will be notified to you at the beginning of the AGM). Each Ordinary Share 
carries the right to one vote at a General Meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the 
Company as at 12 noon on the date of this notice is 75,003,734.
As a Shareholder, you are entitled to attend and vote but, if you are not able to attend, then you may appoint one or more 
proxies to attend, speak and vote on your behalf.
As your vote is important to us, whether or not you intend to come to the AGM, you are asked to return the Form of Proxy 
provided to you. Completing the Form of Proxy will not prohibit Shareholders from attending, and voting at, the AGM in 
person.
The Ordinary Business to be proposed at the 2015 Annual General Meeting
Resolutions 1 (ordinary resolution) – Report and Accounts
To receive the report of the Directors and the financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2015, together with the 
report of the auditors.
Resolutions 2 (ordinary resolution) – Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
To approve the Annual Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and Annual Report on Directors’ 
Remuneration as set out on pages on pages 65 to 66 and 73 to 82 respectively of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts (for 
the year ended 28 February 2015).
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report, as set out in the first part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 
72 of the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts, was last approved by the shareholders at the AGM on 22 July 2014 and remains 
effective for up to three years.

Resolutions 3 (ordinary resolution) – Final Dividend
The Board proposes a final dividend of 5.08p per share for the year ended 28 February 2015. If approved, the 
recommended final dividend will be paid on 23 September 2015 to all shareholders who are on the register of members 
on 28 August 2015. Payments will be made by cheque or BACS (where there is an existing dividend mandate). The final 
dividend equates to an aggregate distribution to Shareholders of approximately £3.8 million making approximately £4.5 
million for the interim and final dividend together.
Resolution 4 (ordinary resolutions) – Re-election of a Director
In accordance with article 78.1 of the Articles of Association, one-third of the Directors who are subject to retirement by 
rotation are required to retire at the AGM. Wendy Pallot (who was last re-appointed as a Director at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company held in 2013) will retire at the AGM and, being eligible, offers herself for re-appointment. The 
Board has considered the appraisal of the performance of Wendy Pallot and recommends she is reappointed. 
Ian Cormack will retire as a Director at the conclusion of the AGM and will not stand for re-election.
Resolutions 5 (ordinary resolution) – Re-appointment of the auditor
The Board recommends that the incumbent external auditor, KPMG LLP, be re-appointed for a further year so that they are 
able to audit the Company’s report and accounts for the year ending 29 February 2016.
Resolutions 6 (ordinary resolution) – Remuneration of the auditor
The Board proposes that it be authorised to determine the level of the auditors’ remuneration.
Special Business to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
Resolution 7 (ordinary resolution) – Authority to allot Ordinary Shares
This replaces the general authority, last given at the 2014 AGM, for the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares pursuant to 
Section 551 of the Act. This resolution, if passed, would give the Directors the authority to allot up to 24,998,744 Ordinary 
Shares of 1.25 pence with a nominal value of £312,484 representing approximately 33.33% of the issued Ordinary Share 
capital of the Company at the date of this notice.
This authority, if granted, will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting and 15 
months from the date of passing this resolution. The Board has no present intention of exercising this authority granted by 
this resolution. The Board intends to seek its renewal at subsequent Annual General Meetings of the Company.
As at the date of signing the Directors Report for the 2015 Annual Report, the Directors had beneficial holdings of Ordinary 
Shares in the Company which in aggregate amounted to approximately 2.2% of the Ordinary Shares in issue. The Directors 
have been granted conditional share awards under the Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Performance Share Plan 2005 and 
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2014 Performance Share Plan and options granted under the Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan 2005 
that if they were to fully vest would entitle the Directors to further Ordinary Shares which in aggregate would amount to 
approximately a further 2.1% of the Ordinary Shares in issue. 
Resolution 8 (special resolution) – Disapplication of statutory pre-emption provisions
This resolution authorises the Directors to allot new Ordinary Shares for cash without first offering them, pro rata, to existing 
shareholders pursuant to Section 571 of the Act.
The maximum nominal value of new Ordinary Shares which may be so allotted under this authority is £46,877 or 3,750,186 
shares of 1.25 pence being equivalent to approximately 5% of the entire issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company at 
date of this notice. This authority will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting 
and 15 months from the date of passing this resolution.

Resolution 9 (special resolution) – Authority for the Company to purchase Ordinary Shares
With the authority of Shareholders in general meeting, the Company is empowered by the Articles of Association to 
purchase Ordinary Shares subject to the provisions of the Act. The Directors believe it is prudent to seek general authority 
from Shareholders to be able to act if circumstances arose in which they considered such purchases to be desirable. The 
Directors have no current intention to exercise the authority granted by this resolution and it will only be exercised if and 
when, in the light of market conditions prevailing at that time, the Directors believe that such purchases would increase 
earnings per share and would be for the benefit of Shareholders generally.
This resolution authorises the Company to purchase its own Ordinary Shares and either, depending on the circumstances 
at the time and subject to the provisions of the Act, to hold these as treasury shares or to cancel them. This authority would, 
if granted, expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting and 15 months from the 
date of passing this resolution.
The Company would be authorised to make market purchases of up to 7,500,373 Ordinary Shares of 1.25 pence with a 
nominal value of £93,754, being equivalent to approximately 10% of the issued Ordinary Share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) of the Company at the date of this notice. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) shall be not more than 5% 
above the average market value of the Company’s equity shares for the 5 business days prior to the day the purchase is 
made. The minimum price (exclusive of expenses) that may be paid shall be the nominal value of an Ordinary Share (1.25 
pence).
Action to be taken
As outlined above, information regarding the AGM is available from www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
Enclosed with this Notice of Meeting, you will find a reply-paid Form of Proxy for use at the AGM. Whether or not you are 
able to attend the AGM, you are advised to complete and return the Form of Proxy in accordance with the instructions 
printed on it.
If you wish to attend the AGM in person then the proxy appointment will not preclude you from doing so.
The Form of Proxy should be completed and returned as soon as possible to FREEPOST RSBH-UXKS-LRBC, PXS, 34 
Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU and, in any event, so as to reach such address no later than 48 hours before 
the appointed commencement time of the AGM (for which a prepaid business reply service has been provided). You may 
also deliver it by hand to Capita Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU during usual business 
hours, by such time.
Recommendations
The Board considers that the passing of Resolutions 1 to 9 is in the best interests of the Company and of the Shareholders as 
a whole and are most likely to promote the success of the Company. The Board unanimously recommends that you vote in 
favour of all the resolutions, as each of the Directors intends to do in respect of his or her own beneficial holdings of shares 
in the Company.
Yours faithfully

48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the Annual General Meeting.
5. Shareholders included on the register of members (in relation to Ordinary Shares held in CREST, pursuant to 
Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001) at 6 pm on 20 July 2015 will be entitled to attend and 
vote at the Annual General Meeting in respect of the number of Ordinary Shares registered in their name at that time. 
Changes to the register of members after that time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to 
attend or vote at the meeting.
6. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information 
rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the Shareholder by whom he/she 
was nominated (“Relevant Member”), have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy 
for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to 
exercise it, he/she, under any such agreement, may have a right to give instructions to the Relevant Member as to the 
exercise of voting rights. Your main point of contact in terms of your investment in the Company remains the Relevant 
Member (or, perhaps, your custodian or broker) and you should continue to contact them (and not the Company) 
regarding any changes or queries relating to your personal details and your interest in the Company (including any 
administrative matters). The only exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a response from you.
7. The statement of the rights of Shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to Nominated 
Persons. The rights described in this regard can only be exercised by Shareholders of the Company.

We acquire, develop and bring into production 
discovered but undeveloped oil and gas fields in 
the North Sea with proven but untapped potential. 
Then we transform them into profitable assets.
As a major independent E&P company we also 
target 10–15% of our annual investment into lower 
risk North Sea exploration.
Over the past seven years we have grown the value 
of our business by more than 23 times and we 
have positioned ourselves to continue generating 
growing cash flow from the North Sea. Overview of Our Business

“  The high prices currently  
being achieved for both oil  
and gas mean the Company’s  
cash flow generation is stronger 
than ever and during the second 
half of 2007 we delivered the 
strongest period of underlying

Venture Production plc 1 What we do, our goals and  
how we get things done
The Venture business model is 
designed to deliver maximum 
value to shareholders as follows:
Reduce acquisition, finding  
and development costs
•  ‘Smart’ deals 
•  Control capital costs
•  Sensible innovation
Value creation and corporate structure
We turn ‘stranded’ fields into profitable assets by applying  
advanced technology, modern operating practices and  
innovative commercial arrangements.
Venture is often referred to as a ‘new generation’ oil and gas 
company. But what does that mean exactly?
Venture is an independent company – part of a new generation  
of energy companies working collaboratively with governments, 
suppliers and larger companies to tap the full potential of fields  
left ‘stranded’ by a changing industry.
In today’s maturing oil industry, Venture is The New Generation.
Our strategy
•   Mature basin ‘acquisition and exploitation’ business model.
•   Focus on acquiring and developing proved but ‘stranded’  
reserves – no ‘wildcat’ exploration.
•   Focus on assets with development potential.
• 10–15% of annual investment into lower risk exploration.
•   Lower absolute reserves potential than ‘wildcat’ frontier  
exploration but lower risk and faster project cycle times.
•   Leading to better ‘risked returns’.
Implementation
•  Tight geographic focus: concentrated North Sea player.
•   Operatorship and large working interests: control over our destiny.
•   Core areas/production hubs: building competitive advantage.
•   Achieving critical mass and scale with portfolio diversification.
• Low risk exploration.
‘Stranded’ fields defined
Producing fields or undeveloped discoveries that:
•   May be too small to be economic for larger companies.
•   May need investment, modernisation or rehabilitation.
•   May no longer fit with a company’s strategy (e.g. a company  
decides to sell its North Sea fields in order to shift its focus overseas).
These fields often have huge potential for the right company with  
the right strategy.
Why are fields ‘stranded’?
Years of unprecedented mergers have made larger oil companies  
even bigger. It makes good economic sense for these larger companies 
to focus on bigger fields, using their vast resources where they will get 
the greatest return.
This has left many smaller fields ‘stranded’ or dormant. While these fields 
may be ‘marginal’ to a large company, they can be profitable to a smaller 
company with an innovative approach. Venture was created to take 
advantage of this opportunity in the UK market, emulating the successful 
precedents set in the North American market.
Lower our cost of capital
•  Efficient balance sheet 
•  Recycle capital faster
•  Maximise return on equity
Maximise cash margin
•  Maximise unit revenues 
•  Control lifting costs
•  Minimise cash taxes
Maximise cash 
margin

We achieve our goals by being...
Highly focused
Every aspect of our operation is designed 
to revitalise ‘stranded’ oil and gas fields. 
This is our core business, allowing us to 
focus on precisely the kind of expertise 
needed to make such fields a success.
Risk aware
Because Venture targets fields that have 
already been discovered, or are currently 
producing, and by only making limited 
investment in lower risk exploration 
we avoid the huge expenses and 
risks associated with ‘wildcat’ frontier 
exploration. We focus on proven oil and 
gas. We know the potential is there. 
We just need to tap into it, quickly and 
economically.
Lean and nimble
To thrive in this growing niche market, 
a company needs to be able to move 
quickly and decisively. At Venture, we 
have built a highly efficient organisation. 
Freed of large overheads and bureaucratic 
backlogs, we can focus on smaller assets 
and ensure their profitability.
Operators and owners
As operators and owners of many of our 
fields, we have far greater control over the 
safety, quality, and development of our 
assets. We can apply the right technology, 
the best people and the necessary 
resources to achieve success.
Committed to modern technology  
applied intelligently
Venture offers a range of innovative 
technical solutions, but it’s more than 
technology we bring to a field. We know 
when to use it. To ensure our fields are 
economical, Venture carefully chooses 
its technologies, looking at both the 
technical and financial needs of a field.
Trusted partners
We know that transferring operatorship  
of a field requires trust. At Venture, we have 
a highly experienced management team. 
We have a track record of success, 
dramatically increasing production in  
field after field. We have sound financial 
backing. Our commitment to health, 
safety and the environment is backed by 
action. We have worked hard to build a 
world-class organisation – a partner you 
can trust.

Venture has the business model, track 
record and liquidity to create and seize new 
opportunities to expand its asset portfolio  
and create future growth.
Eleven years ago Venture laid out its vision for 
a new approach to business in the oil and gas 
sector. That strategy has never wavered and we 
entered 2008 as the UK’s 6th largest independent 
operator with market capitalisation of over 
£1 billion and interests in 42 discovered and 
producing oil and gas fields. 
Venture has interests in 42 discovered 
and producing oil and gas fields in the 
North Sea and there are an estimated  
400 unexploited fields remaining.  
We also have interests in 38 licence  
blocks containing exploration prospects 
and/or leads.

Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Venture Production plc 7 Chairman’s Statement
John Morgan
2007 saw strong underlying performance in building the business,  
but a shortfall against our annual production objective. We indicated at 
the start of the year that there were project timing risks late in the year 
and in the event there were some significant delays. These, together with 
some operational issues beyond management’s direct control, meant that 
we failed to deliver our production growth objectives. All of this shortfall 
was delayed, rather than lost and major progress was made in delivering 
and de-risking important projects including the Kittiwake pipeline, the 
Ensign appraisal well, and the Chiswick Gamma well. Strong oil prices 
and strengthening gas prices meant that our cash generation capacity 
remained strong despite weak gas prices early in the year. I would like to 
express my thanks to all of Venture’s staff and contractors who worked 
very hard to deliver real progress and to overcome a number of very 
difficult challenges.
Safety and Environmental Management are top priorities for Venture 
and the year was another one of strong performance and commitment. 
The Board is pleased with the development of the Technical Integrity 
Management System and the Carbon Management Strategy. Enhanced 
environmental regulation means that this area will remain a major focus 
for management and the Board.
The Company has maintained a consistent strategy with its focus on 
‘stranded’ assets in the North Sea. The development of operational, 
technical and commercial capacity has allowed us to build a strong 
competitive position which, together with our sound balance sheet 
will allow us to continue to grow the business over the next few years. 
During 2007 we reviewed our strategic objectives and concluded that 
our financial and competitive strength and organisational capability 
allow us to set new and very ambitious objectives for the next four years, 
which would result in a doubling of the scale and value of the business. 
The Board believes that such challenging objectives must be properly 
incentivised and rewarded and an important new Long Term Share 
Incentive Plan will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting,  
designed to align senior management in the delivery of this  
new challenge.
The Board and its Committees have continued to exercise a positive 
approach to the governance of the Company. Reports from the 
Committees are included in this document and I would like to thank  
all my Board colleagues for their very constructive contributions.  
There have been a number of changes in Board composition during  
the year. These are described within the Directors’ Report on pages  
34 to 36.
Following these changes the Board comprised four Executive Directors, 
four independent Non-Executives, three non-independent Non-Executives 
and myself, the Non-Executive Chairman. This is now quite a large Board, 
but does not conform to corporate governance guidance that at least 
half the Board (excluding the Chairman) should be independent 
Non-Executives.
The Board has carefully considered how to balance the objective of not 
becoming unwieldy through size with assurance that the interests of all 
shareholders are being safeguarded. While the Board was satisfied that the 
existing independent Directors would achieve this, it decided that it was 
appropriate to add a further independent Director to provide additional 
tangible assurance that, although the Board is not in compliance with 
guidelines, the independent Director presence is powerful enough 
to demonstrably provide a full level of safeguard. A search process was 
initiated and I am delighted to welcome Andrew Carr-Locke to the Board 
from 3 March 2008. Andrew brings strong management experience and 
until recently was Group Finance Director of a major listed company.
Venture Production plc 8 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 I believe that we have an experienced Board with the right mix of skills 
to steer Venture through its next very challenging phase of growing the 
value of the business. 
During 2007 the Board indicated its intended priorities for the use of free 
cash flow generated: firstly, acquisitions or other internally generated 
business development opportunities which meet Venture’s strict 
investment criteria; secondly, maintaining debt at a sustainable long term 
level; and, thirdly, returning capital to shareholders through dividends, 
share buy-backs or other mechanisms. In 2007 a dividend of 50.0 pence 
per share was approved, comprising an ordinary dividend of 10.0 pence 
per share and a special dividend of 40.0 pence per share. This year the 
Board has proposed an ordinary dividend of 12.0 pence per share subject 
to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2008.

Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 9 Chief Executive’s Review
Mike Wagstaff
Introduction
During 2007, Venture continued the development of its North Sea 
business, participating in the drilling of 11 new wells, bringing two  
new fields on stream (Chiswick and Mimas), and completing some  
of the largest and most complex projects in the Company’s history.  
In addition, we have either completed or reached important milestones 
in the development of a number of key assets which, in aggregate,  
have substantially de-risked our business. 
Average net daily production for 2007 was 41,228 barrels of oil  
equivalent per day (boepd), a decrease of 7.7% over 2006. During 2007 ,  
the benefit of Venture’s strong underlying reservoir and well 
performance was impacted by certain exceptional operational events 
and project delays which included higher than anticipated downtime  
on GKA, delay in the start-up of production from the Chiswick field, delay 
in start-up of production from Chestnut and the continued delay in the 
anticipated gas ‘blow down’ within the Birch reservoir. In contrast to 
these disappointing timing impacts, elsewhere in the portfolio the  
‘A’ Fields and Goosander both outperformed expectations. Particularly 
encouraging individual field production performances came from both 
Annabel and Saturn which both continued to exceed expectations. 
Our southern North Sea (SNS) gas fields contributed 60% of total 2007 
Group production, slightly higher than expectations, with the balance 
from Venture’s central North Sea (CNS) oil fields. 
During 2007, Venture has continued to build its business through 
continued execution of our proven strategy, summarised as follows:
• The acquisition, development and production of proved but  
under-exploited oil and gas fields, known as ‘stranded’ reserves.
• Geographic focus as a North Sea development and production 
company.
• Continual development of our portfolio of interests in over 40  
North Sea oil and gas fields, less than half of which are currently  
in production.
Venture Production plc 10 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 • Leveraging of Venture’s substantial operational and development 
expertise we believe gives us a real and sustainable competitive 
advantage as an efficient and focused low cost operator.
• Continued enhancement of our very valuable long term strategic 
relationships with our core contractors which help to ensure the 
availability of key equipment and services in a tight market. 
At 31 December 2007, net proven and probable reserves were estimated 
to total 203 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe). This represents 
a modest 8.4% fall from the end of 2006, which is the first time in the 
Company’s history that annual production has not been replaced several 
times over. This pause in the growth of Venture’s reserves base is 
principally the result of the 2007 re-categorisation of probable reserves 
from the Pilot field to contingent resources, and also reflects the absence 
of any significant completed acquisitions during the year. 
During the year, Venture has positioned itself strategically and financially 
for the next phase of its growth. As planned, we successfully completed 
a major refinancing of the Company ahead of the current difficult capital 
markets conditions, including raising £151 million in new capital from 
two new strategic investors, which will better enable Venture to move 
quickly to take advantage of material acquisition opportunities in the 
North Sea.
Operational Overview
‘a’ Fields 
The Noble Julie Robertson (NJR) jack-up drilling rig continued to operate 
for Venture in the SNS under a long term contract. In light of Venture’s 
active SNS drilling campaign, this contract has recently been extended 
for a further 12 months through to late 2009.
During 2007, two appraisal wells were drilled on the Ensign gas field.  
The first, completed in January 2007, was drilled and completed and 
tested at rates of 12–15 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfpd). 
The second well drilled towards the end of the year was subsequently 
hydraulically fractured, utilising the boat and equipment developed for 
the Chiswick field development. This second well tested at flow rates  
of 42 MMscfpd, towards the top end of our pre-drill expectations.  
The results of this well will enable Venture to commit to the development 
of the Ensign field during 2008, with a target of first gas during late 2009.
During the first half of 2007, Venture sidetracked the Amanda discovery 
well originally drilled in 2003. This appraisal well was completed and 
tested at rates below expectations and is not economic on a stand-alone 
basis. The well was suspended awaiting the results of the Agatha 
exploration well, which is expected to be drilled in 2009. As a result, 
Venture decided to take a non-cash write-off of historic development 
cost of £11.2 million against the cost of the well drilled in 2003. 
In the third quarter of 2007, the Channon exploration well successfully 
drilled and tested. Stabilised gas flow at rates of up to 55 MMscfpd gross 
was achieved and the well has been suspended for future completion 
as a producer. Estimated net recoverable reserves from the Channon 
reservoir are 30 to 40 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which is at the top end of 
pre-drill expectations. Discovery of gas at Channon creates the potential 
for a joint development with the Barbarossa gas discovery located in 
block 47/9c, a subsea tie-back to nearby infrastructure. Venture will  
earn its 90% interest in Barbarossa once the appraisal/development  
well which was spudded in late February 2008 is drilled. Expected 
reserves from this well are around 30 Bcf net to Venture.
Greater Markham a rea (GMa )
During 2007, production from the GMA hub was in line with 
expectations and delivery rates benefited from the impact of the 
Markham Compression Tower, which was installed during late 2006.
On GMA, the highlight of 2007 was the start-up of production from  
the Chiswick field at the end of September. While first gas production 
was some six months later than originally planned due to the unexpected 
and unavoidable lack of an available well stimulation vessel in the North Sea, 
Venture’s ability to recover through the development of an innovative 
solution utilising a pumping spread on the back of a large supply boat is 
“ 2007 was an exciting year of operational and strategic 
progress for Venture and we successfully completed 
the largest and most complex engineering and field 
development projects ever undertaken by the Company.”
Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 11 Chief Executive’s  
Review – continued 
testament to our operational capability. Initial production was somewhat 
lower than anticipated due to a slower than expected clean-up of the 
first production well, although this is not expected to impact longer 
term production performance. In addition, Venture has now successfully 
drilled, fractured and tested the second Chiswick production well which, 
as recently announced, tested at higher than forecast rates. The well was 
successfully brought on stream in February 2008 and Chiswick will be a 
major contributor to Group production in 2008 and beyond. 
Greater Kittiwake a rea (GKa )
During 2007, production from the GKA hub was adversely affected  
by poor uptime availability of the tanker loading and export system.  
This loss of productive capacity continued into the fourth quarter, 
but was partially offset by continued strong reservoir performance, 
particularly from Goosander. Development activity on GKA in 2007 was 
focused on the construction and installation of the new export pipeline 
between the Kittiwake platform and the Forties Pipeline System. The new 
pipeline was successfully installed and brought on stream in November, 
and is already contributing to substantially improved operational uptime, 
and is expected to lower overall operating costs and allow GKA field life 
to be extended. 
In addition, during the fourth quarter, Venture successfully drilled an 
appraisal well on the Grouse oil field. This was successful and will lead to 
a fast track development of the field as a subsea tie-back to the Kittiwake 
platform. The Grouse production well is expected to come on stream in 
the first half of 2009. Looking further forward, the recently announced 
acquisition of an additional interest in, and operatorship of, the Bligh gas/ 
condensate field will, together with the nearby Christian field, form the 
core for the next phase of the development of the GKA hub beyond 2010.
‘Trees’
‘Trees’ production was stable during 2007. The Birch oil field has produced 
steadily but the anticipated gas ‘blow-down’ of the reservoir has not 
yet occurred. It is expected that this natural change in production 
characteristics will happen at some point and, when it does, more 
associated gas will start to be produced, thus raising the overall field 
production rate. Whilst reducing reported production volumes, the 
financial impact of this was limited as the gas produced from ‘Trees’  
is sold offshore at a large discount to benchmark market prices. 
During 2007, Venture commenced a major seismic reprocessing and 
interpretation study on the entire ‘Trees’ production hub, which will be 
completed during 2008. Whilst the analysis of the remaining potential 
in the southern part of the Sycamore development has not yet been 
completed, preliminary results of this study suggest that in the central 
part of the Sycamore field, there is limited re-investment opportunity. 
This has led to the Company taking a non-cash impairment charge  
in 2007 of £24.5 million, against the value of our historic investment  
in Sycamore.
Other CNS
Field development activity on our other oil assets in the CNS during 
2007 was focused on the Chestnut field. Installation of the production 
and support facilities on the new Sevan 300 floating production unit, 
the Hummingbird, was completed in December in Rotterdam. The 
Hummingbird was installed in the Chestnut field at the end of the year 
and offshore hook-up and commissioning work and subsea tie-in activity 
is ongoing, although progress on these activities has been slower than 
anticipated for a variety of reasons, including winter weather related 
issues. First oil is currently anticipated during the third quarter.
Ongoing subsurface studies using new data on the Chestnut reservoir 
have identified the potential to drill an additional production well in the 
field. This is expected to significantly increase recoverable reserves from 
the field, and it is anticipated that this project will be sanctioned during 
the first half of the year, leading to the well being drilled towards the end 
of 2008.
During the fourth quarter of 2007, drilling continued on the Selkirk 
appraisal well. The well was sidetracked into the crest of the reservoir 
structure, but has been suspended due to operational difficulties.  
The well has, however, proved up commercial reserves and the operator  
has commenced development planning.
An appraisal well on Pilot field in block 21/27a was drilled during the 
third quarter. Oil samples recovered from the Pilot well are somewhat 
heavier and more viscous than those from previously drilled Pilot wells, 
and this new data is being evaluated to better determine the extent of 
the commercially recoverable oil. Based on the well result, the probable 
reserves associated with Pilot have been moved to the contingent resources 
category, and an impairment charge of £9.0 million against the carrying 
value of the asset has been taken. 
To the south of Pilot, the appraisal well drilled adjacent to the Narwhal 
discovery failed to encounter hydrocarbons and the well was plugged 
and abandoned. The appraisal well drilled on Millburn discovery 
encountered 12 feet of oil-bearing sandstone which is considered  
sub-economic, and the appraisal well was also plugged and abandoned.
Trinidad
Venture retains a 40% shareholding in Ten Degrees North Energy Limited 
(TDNEL), an oil and gas production company based and registered in 
Trinidad. TDNEL produced an average of 1,522 boepd (609 boepd net) 
during 2007.
Corporate and Business Development
Over the last three years, Venture has focused on becoming an efficient 
acquisition, development and production operator and today, following  
a series of almost 50 acquisitions, it ranks as the sixth largest independent 
operator in the UK sector of the North Sea by gross operated production. 
In a mature basin such as the North Sea, Venture believes that its operating 
capability, size, scale and strategic and geographic focus give it a strong 
competitive position, and a positioning that Venture believes would be 
difficult to replicate.
Venture Production plc 12 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 In terms of completed transactions, 2007 represented a quiet year for 
both Venture and the North Sea oil and gas industry. In recent months, 
driven by the fundamentals in the global energy market, Venture has 
seen a significant increase in levels of asset trading activity in the North 
Sea, although this has yet to be translated into completed transactions. 
This activity is consistent with historical patterns seen in other mature 
producing regions such as the US Gulf of Mexico where, as the basin 
matures, ownership of substantial proportions of the basin’s oil and  
gas reserves has migrated from larger international oil companies,  
to more regionally focused independents. Venture believes that it is  
well positioned competitively to capitalise on this consolidation trend, 
which it believes will create significant opportunities for the Company  
to expand its business. 
To position itself financially for this anticipated phase of consolidation 
in the short to medium term, in July, Venture announced that it had 
entered into agreements with 3i Group plc and its affiliates (3i) and 
ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC and its co-investors (ArcLight), to make 
a significant strategic investment in Venture. In aggregate, when their 
subscription for a new convertible bond and shares purchased in the 
open market are taken together, 3i and ArcLight have made a total new 
investment of over £200 million in Venture. 
3i’s and ArcLight’s investments consist of a number of elements as follows:
• £151 million in newly issued 3.25% convertible bonds (CBs) due  
2010 which are convertible into 16.5 million newly issued Venture 
ordinary shares.
• Conversion of ArcLight’s existing North Sea Gas Partners (NSGP) 
interest into 6.0 million new Venture ordinary shares.
• 3i’s existing investment in Venture of 2.6 million shares.
• Both 3i and ArcLight made additional market purchases of Venture 
shares to take their total stakes to approximately 10% on a fully  
diluted basis.
In addition, during the second half of 2007, Venture completed a £600 
million refinancing of its debt facilities. This consists of two elements,  
a £365 million new corporate credit facility and a total of approximately 
£235 million in privately placed institutional loan notes, with final 
maturities of 10 and 15 years. Combined with the strategic investment 
from 3i and ArcLight, Venture now has strengthened financing sources 
from which to deliver its growth strategy.
In order to improve Venture’s ability to pursue opportunities through the 
UKCS Licensing Rounds, in early 2008 Venture formed two partnerships 
with two small UK exploration focused independents to pursue 
opportunities in the SNS and CNS, as part of the 25th UK Licensing 
Round which was recently announced.
Current Trading and Outlook
Operationally, we have had a good start to 2008 with the majority of 
operational issues, which impacted 2007 production performance now 
behind us. Our 2008 drilling programme has had an excellent start with 
results ahead of expectations seen on both the Ensign and Chiswick 
wells. 2008 is also proving to be a much more active year than 2007 
from a business development perspective, with five acquisitions already 
announced to date. 
In looking forward to the rest of the year, we note that Venture’s 2008/9 
development programme consists of a number of projects which are 
individually subject to the everyday risks this industry faces; some of 
which are beyond our direct control, and most of which impact timing  
of production, rather than the intrinsic value of our assets. We believe 
this year’s development programme is somewhat lower risk than 2007,  
in that there are fewer new production additions coming on stream 
earlier in the year, which contribute to the growth in production in  
2008. The two most significant are the second Chiswick gas well,  
which, as recently announced, has now been successfully brought on 
stream, and start-up of production from the Chestnut oil field. 
Venture’s production guidance for 2008, set around the end of 2007, 
assumed a start-up of production from Chestnut during the second 
quarter, and we now expect first oil production during the third quarter. 
The impact of each one month delay in the start-up of production from 
the field represents a reduction in annual average production for 2008 
of approximately 1,000 boepd. Notwithstanding this, we still continue 
to expect 2008 production to be within our guidance range of 50,000 
boepd +/- 10%.
The success of Venture’s business depends on the sustained delivery of 
our acquire, develop and produce strategy, leading to continued growth 
in reserves, production and cash flow over a sustained period. Between 
now and the end of 2009, Venture anticipates bringing on stream a total 
of eight significant new projects, which are expected to boost net 
production significantly from today’s levels. 
In summary, as a result of the strong operating performance of our 
business, combined with favourable commodity prices and increased 
activity in the acquisitions market, the Board remains very confident of 
the outlook for Venture’s business in 2008 and beyond.

Chief Executive
Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 13 energy Outlook
Growing populations and improving living standards across the  
world continue to drive demand for reliable, affordable energy for  
power and transportation. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation  
and Development (OECD) predicts that world energy demand will hit 
300 MMboe per day by 2030 (2008: 200 MMboe per day), primarily driven 
by demand from the fast growing, emerging economies – led by China.
Market Dynamics – Oil 
Whilst demand for oil in developed economies has stabilised over 
recent years – stagnating in the US since 2006 – the upward trend in 
consumption in the Middle East and China has accelerated. 
A tight supply/demand balance resulting in a small surplus oil supply 
has reduced global inventories, as production by countries who are not 
members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) 
declines and OPEC membership increases are too small to meet the gap. 
As the gap between demand and non-OPEC supplies is predicted to 
widen, the market will become more dependent on OPEC oil. 
The UK is already a net importer of oil to satisfy the demands of its home 
market and this is likely to rise in the future.
Coupled with concern about the vulnerability of supply, oil fundamentals 
are likely to keep prices high in the medium term with little spare 
capacity, tight supply/demand balance, strong economic growth and  
a weak US dollar.
Market Dynamics – Gas
Following a period of volatility in the first half of 2007, gas prices increased 
strongly in the second half of the year. This upward price pressure has 
continued into 2008, reflecting the link with global oil prices and the 
emergence of a global market for gas.
Traditionally, gas demand was satisfied by indigenous sources but  
this is rapidly changing. The UK market is now directly linked to the  
pan-European gas market through major pipelines to mainland Europe. 
Most notably, Norway has the ability to switch supply from the UK to 
mainland Europe, exposing the UK to the impact of European prices.
In addition, the increasing importance of liquid natural gas (LNG) is 
contributing to the growth of a truly global gas market. As LNG can be 
transported safely and economically over long distances, suppliers can 
divert resources to higher priced markets (in Asia, for example), thereby 
reducing supply into European markets. This causes a tightening of  
the supply/demand balance and has a subsequent positive effect  
on European gas prices.
These factors will tend to drive up gas prices in the UK over the medium 
term as demand for natural gas to fuel power generation remains high 
due to its lower C0 2 emissions compared with other fuels.
Resources, Skills and Capabilities
As a fast-growing organisation in a highly competitive global market, 
recruiting and retaining the right mix of skills and capabilities remains a 
priority for Venture. We continue to be successful at attracting staff with the 
requisite skill sets who can contribute immediately, as well as developing 
our own expertise. Staff numbers grew by 21 to 142 (2006: 121).
A good reputation in the market is as essential as offering competitive 
packages to secure scarce skills such as those of reservoir engineers, 
geologists and geophysicists. To date, Venture has been successful in 
recruiting employees with the key focus on both technical subsurface 
and commercial skills. Project engineering expertise is equally important, 
and our project managers have proved to be both innovative and 
focused in overcoming any obstacles to delivering to plan. The frac 
boat case study on page 29 is a prime example of the drive and lateral 
thinking within the organisation.
Venture not only is a highly technical organisation, but also operates in 
a distinctive, enterprising environment. We have a flat organisational 
structure allowing us to make timely decisions to enable our people to 
be able to work with a great deal of autonomy and take responsibility 
at every level. We have high expectations of our employees but give 
them the support they need to meet the challenges we set. Our recently 
introduced leadership programme, for example, focuses on raising 
standards of performance and developing better working relationships.
We have now reached the size where we can nurture our own talent 
and have implemented a targeted graduate recruitment programme. 
We focus on the leading universities with a reputation in geology, 
geophysics and reservoir engineering and will recruit at MSc level.  
As a smaller player, we are able to offer our graduate recruits much 
broader exposure and greater responsibility early in their working career.
Managing external relationships with our long term suppliers and 
contractors is a core capability for Venture. Building relationships based 
on partnership and delivering results using both internal and external 
resources have proved a powerful combination over the last few years,  
and we continue to invest in strengthening this important attribute 
through training.
Market Overview
Business and Operational Review
Venture Production plc 14 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Key Suppliers and Contracts Corporate Development
Excellence in supply chain management remains a critical success factor 
as continued momentum in the oil and gas industry has resulted in 
widespread shortages of materials, services and personnel. This scarcity 
of resources has contributed to rising development costs and increased 
uncertainty due to the pressure on availability of key equipment.
Venture’s core competence in this area is already delivering benefits.  
Our project execution costs are below industry norms and long term 
supply agreements mean we have access to substantial resources. 
These include drilling rigs and offshore construction related vehicles, 
with significant forward contracts signed at substantially below current 
market rates.
Building a Successful Supply Chain
Venture has a stable assembly of high performance contractors, and 
our strong reputation in the market was reinforced in February 2007 
when we achieved the ‘Best Purchaser Profile’ as assessed by First Point 
Assessment Ltd, who run the industry supply benchmarking scheme.
We have a well developed strategy focused on four key areas:
• Tactical flexibility and pace 
Ensuring we can adapt to changing circumstances quickly and 
intelligently, supported by the ability to make swift decisions.
• Active contract and relationship management 
Building a dedicated, well trained team of contract and relationship 
managers whose purpose is to create value from the supply chain.
• Becoming a great customer 
Attracting high performing contractors by being a high performance 
purchaser combining fair pricing with fair treatment.
• Far-sightedness 
Running an integrated advance project planning approach that 
includes materials and services.
Managing Key Relationships
Sound, long term relationships with three critical suppliers have enabled 
us to deliver highly complex projects on time and on budget, in tight 
market conditions where competition for resources has been high.
Long term contracts with Noble supported our drilling activities in 2007 
and will provide us with the drilling rig days we require going forward 
to 2011. Our four year relationship with Subsea 7 has already secured 
preferential access to scarce diving vessels, remote operated vehicles and 
pipe laying capacity.
Sevan Marine has provided an essential element of our innovative 
solution to exploit the potential of the Chestnut field. During 2007,  
it completed the construction of the Hummingbird floating storage and 
production vessel which will enable us to develop the field efficiently.
Positioned for Future Opportunities
The North Sea is a dynamic environment and in 2007 we ensured  
that Venture is well positioned to take advantage of a range of exciting 
opportunities. We secured access to significant additional capital to pave 
the way for continued investment in the current inventory whilst at the 
same time leaving scope for material future acquisitions.
Given the relative scarcity of sensibly priced assets with current 
production and attractive development potential, only a small portion  
of those new capital resources were deployed during this calendar  
year. However, as in previous years, a number of important acquisitions 
were completed and looking forward to the next two to three years,  
we anticipate a number of major North Sea asset transfers taking place.
New a ssets
Barbarossa
Early in the year, we announced a farm-in to the Barbarossa gas discovery 
(Venture operated – 90% net). This 30 to 40 Bcf field is located close to 
the Channon exploration well that was successfully drilled in July 2007. 
Barbarossa is a good example of an opportunity that has been given 
new life through the UK Government’s Promote licence initiative and 
it is typical of the kind of small, relatively simple tie-back opportunities 
that exist across the southern North Sea. As it lies close to the Channon 
discovery we have the opportunity to realise economies of scale by 
developing the two accumulations together.
Bligh, Carna, Marram and F3-Fa
Business development activity started strongly in the 2008 financial year 
with acquisitions of additional interests in Bligh and Carna within our 
existing licences and a farm-in to the Marram discovery in the East Irish 
Sea, a new area for Venture’s business development activity.
We increased our working interest in block 21/20d which contains the 
Bligh gas condensate discovery, through an acquisition from Shell EP 
Offshore Ventures Limited. With estimated reserves of around 30 MMboe 
gross, Bligh will become a natural follow-on project once the current 
Kittiwake oil fields reach the end of their productive life. If successful, it 
will extend the life of the platform by several years.
The completion of a farm-in agreement with Ithaca Energy (UK) Limited 
increases our equity in the Carna exploration prospect from 40% to 60%. 
Carna was one of the near term opportunities identified in the WHAM 
portfolio, with an estimated 85 to 200 Bcf of gross recoverable reserves.
We reached agreement with Hannu Exploration Limited, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of MPX Limited, to purchase 60% of its equity in blocks 110/4 
and 110/9b in the East Irish Sea through the drilling of a farm-in well. 
Farming into these blocks gives us access to the Marram gas discovery, 
which is estimated to contain gross recoverable reserves of 50 to 90 Bcf.
In March 2008, Venture acquired an estimated 58% operated interest in 
the F3-FA gas discovery for a royalty based consideration. Base case gross 
recoverable reserves are estimated to be around 60 Bcf.

Participation in Licensing Rounds
In February 2007, we were awarded two blocks in the 24th Licensing 
Round, one containing Stamford, a discovery close to our Greater 
Markham Area production hub, and the other containing the  
Whinchat and Wagtail appraisal prospects in the Greater Kittiwake Area.  
These awards add to Venture’s development inventory around existing 
producing fields, in line with the hub-focused element of our strategy. 
As one of the more significant and growing North Sea operators, we 
intend to participate in future licensing rounds in a more active way than 
in previous years. To this end, we have put in place two new strategic 
alliances, with MPX Oil and Gas Limited and Volantis Exploration Limited. 
These alliances will provide us with access to a range of new drilling 
opportunities and subsurface expertise complementary to that already 
possessed in-house.
WHa M a cquisition
In November 2007, we made the second corporate acquisition in 
Venture’s history, purchasing WHAM Energy plc, a small publicly listed, 
SNS focused exploration company with a portfolio of gas prospects close 
to existing Venture owned infrastructure. This portfolio is an exciting 
addition to Venture’s southern North Sea inventory and plans are being 
made to drill the first two opportunities during 2008.
Kittiwake to Forties Oil Pipeline
Our first major foray into infrastructure development came to fruition 
towards the end of November with the start-up of production through 
the new Kittiwake oil pipeline. This project is an interesting investment 
opportunity in its own right, as well as an enabler of future growth. 
The tariff income generated will not only service the debt but is also 
expected to deliver an attractive low-risk return to Venture shareholders 
through the Company’s 49.9% interest in North Sea Infrastructure 
Partners, the owner of the new pipeline.
Securing a Strong Platform for Growth
Perhaps the most significant development in Venture’s corporate  
growth during 2007 was the strategic investment made by 3i Group plc 
and ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC. The additional capital provided  
by these investors through the convertible bond and the purchase  
of additional shares gives each a fully diluted 9.9% stake in Venture.  
This major financial commitment underlines the shared belief that these 
two energy sector specialist investors have in the medium term prospects 
for the North Sea and, in particular, in Venture’s unique positioning.  
Each investor has known the Company and its senior management for 
several years and both see Venture as the ideal platform through which to 
invest in the future of the North Sea and capitalise on major opportunities.
Building Scale and Momentum
WHAM was a relatively small corporate acquisition, and we are 
continually evaluating similar opportunities where the combination of 
Venture’s scale and access to drilling and development resources will 
complement the technical and subsurface work done by smaller but  
less well established companies. 
We believe that the eventual recovery of hydrocarbons from the 
North Sea will be maximised through a small group of well funded 
independent operators with sufficient scale to explore for, develop  
and produce oil and gas fields through all commodity price and  
service sector cost cycles. 
Our business development strategy aims to position Venture as one 
of those larger operators that has the requisite scale and momentum 
to capture the significant remaining value from North Sea oil and gas 
reserves. With a strong balance sheet, good cash flow generation and  
an appetite for significant acquisitions, we entered 2008 ideally placed  
to continue our progress towards this medium term objective.
Business Development and Strategy
Venture’s strategy is designed around extending field life and maximising 
recovery of hydrocarbons, with a focus on targeting the vast array of 
‘stranded’ reserves that remain to be developed. Our strategy consists 
of a number of distinct elements, each tailored to the particular offshore 
business opportunities found in the North Sea, the fiscally stable and 
well resourced basin we have chosen to operate in.
Since the Company was founded in 1997, we have consistently delivered 
against each element of a carefully chosen strategic mix:
• Multiple acquisitions.
• Tight geographic hub focus.
• High working interests and control.
• Operator led field development.
• Infill drilling and satellite developments.
• Scale efficiency/low costs.
• Modern offshore technology/operating practices.
• Innovative commercial structures.
• Lower risk exploration.
It is important to note that not all elements have equal importance 
during any one fiscal period. However, they are all linked together and 
collectively over the medium term they will combine to deliver a strong, 
independent North Sea business, that we believe will become one of the 
relatively small set of important companies that will take over the mantle 
from the majors in developing the remaining potential in the North Sea.
As we look back on 2007 and contemplate the exciting future ahead it 
is clear that with the scale of the strategic platform we have built, we 
are ideally placed to emphasise the acquisitions and exploration drilling 
elements of our strategy in the short to medium term. We believe that 
we can keep operating costs at reasonable levels, despite current tight 
market conditions for services, and that the significant cash flows from 
our high working interests will deliver a strong balance sheet that is able 
to absorb the occasional negative drilling result or project delay. Smaller, 
less well established companies may struggle to do the same.
We will continue to be highly selective in our approach to acquiring 
assets, collections of assets or competitor businesses and we will 
continue to filter new exploration drilling prospects very carefully,  
using our in-house technical resources. However, with the momentum 
and shareholder backing we have established, we are also confident 
in our ability to take major accretive steps forward to becoming one of 
the most important operators in the North Sea. It is likely that over the 
next two years significant consolidation acquisition opportunities will be 
found and that fresh opportunity sets will emanate from such activity. 
The Company’s proven, value creation led strategy should be effective 
in monetising these opportunities, and this should provide Venture 
shareholders with an extremely attractive and profitable future.
Venture Production plc 16 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Strategy
Strategic Objectives
Venture has an exciting strategic vision focused around the following  
key goals:
• Strong cash flow generation.
• Double our value per share.
• Become one of the ‘Big Six’ UKCS independent operators as the 
industry consolidates.
• Deliver 90-125 Mboepd net production by 2010/11.
• Build 2P reserves of around 500 MMboe, supported by an equal 
volume of contingent resources .
We start from a position of strength. We have a high quality asset base, 
a strong balance sheet and an experienced team working in a market 
where there remain many attractive opportunities for growth.
Venture’s strong competitive position has been built through the 
application of a three stage business model and continuing to apply  
this will enable us to achieve our longer term strategic goals:
a cquire
We will retain a tight geographic focus on the North Sea, where we 
can target our expertise on the undeveloped ‘stranded’ reserves in an 
estimated 400 unexploited fields.
In 2008 we will be actively participating in the 25th UK Licensing Round, 
aiming to increase significantly the size of our oil and gas portfolios 
through strategic alliances formed with MPX Oil and Gas Limited regarding 
CNS assets and with Volantis Exploration Limited regarding SNS assets. 
Acquisitions will be used to accelerate growth to achieve our medium 
and long term strategic goals and ensure that Venture remains a 
consolidator as the majors continue to dispose of legacy assets.  
With a strong track record of almost 50 deals since we were founded  
and with substantial funding in place, we will be able to move quickly to  
secure acquisitions that match our criteria.
Develop
We are a low cost, efficient operator with a history of delivering market 
beating development costs through the 30 major development projects 
we have undertaken as operator since 2002. 
Our development programme is now substantial and able to deliver 
the economies of scale and standardisation that can be achieved 
by managing multiple projects. In order to continue to tackle the 
cost challenge, we must maintain our obsession with eliminating 
inefficiencies and our back-to-basics approach that focuses attention on 
essentials, as well as carefully introducing appropriate new technologies.
Managing our long term supplier relationships will remain a critical 
success factor and we have already secured the access to drilling rigs  
we need to deliver our exploration and development plans out to 2011  
at lower than current market rates.
We will continue to invest 10–15% of our capital expenditure budget 
in exploration. This will largely be in mature areas of reservoir and 
geologies where we have specific expertise, such as the Tertiary and 
Jurassic sandstones of the CNS and the Permian and Carboniferous 
sandstones of the SNS.
Produce
Access to infrastructure is key to maximising value from development 
and exploration, so we will focus primarily around existing production 
hubs, with infill drilling and satellite developments. We will continue to 
identify potential new hubs, and continually upgrade the portfolio as 
new projects mature. 
As the portfolio of on stream assets keeps growing, increased diversity 
of production continues to de-risk the business. In addition, as we are 
predominantly located in the North Sea, our production is relatively high 
margin with low political risk.

Oil and Gas Reserves
Venture Production plc 18 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Reserve Movements Reserves Assessment and Reporting
On the basis of UK SORP , Venture’s total net proved and probable 
reserves at the end of year 2007 were 203.0 MMboe, a reduction of  
8.4% compared to the end of year 2006.
Venture’s net reserves additions and revisions during 2007 included  
6.9 MMboe related to the discovery of economic gas reserves at 
Channon, and to improved performance from the Birch oil field and the 
Annabel and Saturn gas fields. The major downward revision during 
2007 was the re-categorisation of Pilot reserves from probable reserves 
to contingent resource as a consequence of the heavier than anticipated 
crude recovered in the appraisal well drilled in 2007. Venture continues 
to report its equity-accounted reserves holding in Ten Degrees North 
Energy Limited (Trinidad) which this year accounts for 4.7 MMboe of 
proven and probable reserves.
In 2007 Venture reacquired 75% of its interest in the Ensign field from 
NSGP as a consequence of the conversion of ArcLight’s NSGP interest 
into Venture ordinary shares.
Venture’s total resource base, including possible, contingent and 
prospective reserves, amounts to 609.0 MMboe.
The Company’s technical staff are highly skilled, with average industry 
experience of over 17 years. The Company relies primarily on its  
internal technical expertise, augmented by third party engineers,  
to ensure objective estimates of the Company’s reserves. The Company 
mitigates the risks associated with reserve estimation by adhering to a 
Company wide reserves policy and procedure that outlines the process 
transparently from technical staff to senior management. One of the 
main constituents of the procedure is that 100% of the Company’s total 
reserves are reviewed annually.
In addition to the reserves estimation carried out by the Company’s 
engineers, an independent engineer (DeGoyler and MacNaughton) 
conducts a report on the proved and probable reserves annually.
Venture has separately engaged RPS Energy (2005–2007) to provide 
an independent third party review of the Company’s procedures and 
methods for reserves estimation. The purpose of the review was to verify 
that the reserves estimates prepared by the Company’s technical staff are 
in accordance with the guidelines and definitions of the 2007 SPE/WPC/
AAPG/SPEE Petroleum Resources Management System (SPE PRMS) using 
accepted engineering principles. A variety of assets in various stages 
of development were evaluated, and RPS Energy confirmed that the 
procedures and methods utilised by the Company’s technical staff were 
appropriate and met the SPE PRMS guidelines.
Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 19 Our area of production and exploration focus is the North Sea,  
where we have a strong underlying reservoir performance underpinning 
our four production hubs. In terms of hydrocarbon split, our SNS gas 
fields contributed in the region of 60% of total 2007 production,  
with the balance coming from our CNS oil fields.
Central North Sea Oil
Our oil activities are focused in the CNS at two main producing hubs  
– ‘Trees’ and Greater Kittiwake Area (GKA). Our CNS assets contain  
107 MMboe 2P reserves and 337 MMboe total resources exposure.
‘Trees’
‘Trees’ production averaged 6,674 boepd in 2007 (2006: 9,595),  
which represents 16% of total group production. 
The current producing fields, Birch, Larch and Central Sycamore, are tied 
back to the Marathon operated Brae ‘A’ platform located to the north of 
the fields, and the South Sycamore field is tied back to the CNR operated 
Tiffany platform to the south of 16/12a. Production is exported via the 
Forties Pipeline System.
In 2007 Venture drilled the Ash exploration well which was dry.
Exploration activity at ‘Trees’ in 2008 is focused on the technical work 
needed to de-risk the potentially massive Cedar field and evaluate the 
commercial options. 
A seismic reprocessing project commenced across the entire ‘Trees’  
area in support of identifying further drilling opportunities.
Birch
The Birch field (Venture – 100%) continued to produce under natural 
depletion from the Z3 production well, with some intermittent 
production from the cycled well Z5. During 2007 no water injection 
support was provided to Birch in order to allow the reservoir pressure  
to drop below bubble point. 
The anticipated drop in pressure that would signal ‘blow-down’ of the 
reservoir did not materialise during the year; this could indicate higher 
volumes of oil in place, with the potential for infill drilling opportunities.
Larch
Larch (Venture – 100%) continued to produce in line with expectations 
during the year, with better compression uptime on Brae ‘A’ providing 
gas lift support. Water injection into the Z7 well has been managed in 
order to provide pressure support to the producer while maximising 
recovery from the field.
Sycamore
At Sycamore (Venture – 100%), through continuous water injection 
into the Central Sycamore SW2 well during 2006, the reservoir pressure 
recovered to a sufficient level to bring the SP2 production well back on 
stream. Production from SP2 was intermittent as a result of lower than 
expected water injection rates from Brae. However, the well continues  
to produce in line with expectations.
Preliminary results of a major seismic reprocessing and interpretation 
study on the entire ‘Trees’ production hub suggest that there is a limited 
re-investment opportunity in Central Sycamore. This led to the Company 
taking a non-cash impairment charge in 2007 of £24.5 million against the 
value of our historic investment in Sycamore.
The South Sycamore production well SP4, drilled and completed in late 
2005, continued to produce on natural depletion throughout 2007 in 
line with forecast. The possibility of drilling a further well into South 
Sycamore is under investigation.
a sh
Following successful commercial negotiation with CNR, agreement was 
reached to drill an exploration well into Ash (Venture – 100%) from the 
Tiffany platform. The well was spudded in December 2006, and reached 
TD in the first quarter of 2007. It encountered good quality sands, however, 
they were found to be water-bearing and the well was suspended 
pending possible re-use as a sidetrack candidate into South Sycamore.
Cedar
Technical work commenced on the Cedar prospect which has a very  
large hydrocarbon potential (unrisked recoverable resources of 88 MMboe). 
This work will be completed in 2008, utilising the new seismic data to  
de-risk and better define the opportunity.

GKA performed strongly during the year, although production was 
adversely affected by poor uptime availability of the tanker loading and 
export system, prior to a newly installed pipeline coming on stream in 
the fourth quarter to replace it.
Production averaged 9,115 boepd (2006: 7,756) representing 22% of 
Group production. Fields currently in production are Kittiwake, Mallard, 
Gadwall and Goosander which performed particularly strongly during 
the year – ahead of expectations. Production from the various fields is 
tied back to the Kittiwake platform which processes and then exports 
the crude oil. 
Export for most of the year was via the Single Anchor Loading system 
into a shuttle tanker to transport the crude onshore. Adverse weather 
conditions in the early part of the year, combined with some accidental 
third party damage to the tanker loading base, resulted in temporary loss of 
productive capacity until the successful installation of the new 33km export 
pipeline between the Kittiwake platform and the Forties Pipeline System. 
The new pipeline provides a more robust, long term solution for GKA 
production. It was brought on stream in November 2007 and is expected 
to substantially improve operational uptime and allow GKA field life to 
be extended. With reservoirs performing ahead of expectations overall, 
this is a major step forward. 
During the 24th Licensing Round, we were awarded block 21/17 with 
our GKA partner, Dana Petroleum (E&P) Limited. This contains two 
discoveries: Whinchat and Wagtail.
Kittiwake
The Kittiwake field (Venture – 50%) continued to produce in line  
with expectations. The principal value of Kittiwake is the manned 
platform, which is the central processing and export hub for all our  
GKA production.
Mallard
Production from the Mallard field (Venture – 50%) continues to exceed 
expectations. Water flood from both the north and south of the 
horizontal production well has been managed to maximise the recovery 
through 2007. Further simulation work is being undertaken to identify 
whether an additional production well in the northern area of the field 
would recover additional reserves.
Business and Operational Review

Review of Assets (continued)
Gadwall
Gadwall (Venture – 50%) was shut-in for most of 2007 as pipeline 
capacity was allocated to Mallard which continued to produce strongly. 
Periods of production in 2007 have confirmed that Gadwall continues to 
have a well potential of over 4,000 boepd at low water cut. Subsurface 
work is in progress to evaluate further reserves potential to the north of the 
existing production well.
Goosander
Since production start-up Goosander (Venture – 50%) has delivered 
rates above initial expectations. In addition, there appears to be strong 
pressure support from the underlying aquifer and this will enable 
Venture to deplete the reservoir efficiently without the need to drill a 
water injection well. This means a potential capital expenditure saving  
of around £29 million. Reservoir studies are ongoing to assess the  
benefit of an additional production well.

in 2007 at rates of over 10,000 boepd on a restricted choke. The well  
was completed and the tree installed. Pipeline and umbilical have  
been ordered and a pipe lay slot booked for third quarter of 2008 in 
order to tie the well back to the Goosander riser base. First production  
is scheduled for the first half of 2009, ahead of original plan.
Christian and Bligh
The Christian and Bligh discoveries lie to the east of Mallard in blocks 
21/20b and 21/20a respectively and these ‘stranded’ reserves provide  
mid term development opportunities within Venture’s portfolio.
Christian (Venture – 50%) was discovered in 1990 by 21/20b-4st2 and tested 
at 6,364 boepd from the Fulmar reservoir. The discovery lies 5km east of 
Mallard and it is planned to develop the field as a single HPHT well tied back 
to Mallard and onwards to the Kittiwake platform. A field development plan 
will be submitted in 2008 with a well scheduled for 2009.
Bligh (Venture – 30.5%) is a gas condensate discovery found in 1993 by 
the 21/20a-5 well which tested at rates of 15.4 MMscfpd and 2,750 boepd 
from Fulmar sands. Venture is currently assessing development options 
for Bligh as a tie-back to Kittiwake.
The new pipeline provides a more robust, long term solution for  
GKA production. It was brought on stream in November 2007 and  
is expected to substantially improve operational uptime and allow  
GKA field life to be extended.

Chestnut Field
As a result of field development activity on the Chestnut field (Venture 
– 69.9%), we anticipate first oil production in the third quarter of 2008. 
Installation of the production and support facilities on the new Sevan 300 
floating production unit, the Hummingbird, was completed in December 
2007 in Rotterdam. The Hummingbird was installed in the Chestnut field 
at the end of the year and offshore hook-up and commissioning work is 
ongoing. Ongoing subsurface studies using new data on the Chestnut 
reservoir have identified the potential to drill an additional production well in 
the field. This is expected to significantly increase recoverable reserves from 
the field and it is anticipated that this project will be sanctioned during the 
first half of 2008 leading to the well being drilled towards the end of 2008.
Other Central North Sea a ssets
The appraisal oil well results in the Pilot field (Venture – 70.4%) produced 
heavy oil with higher viscosity than anticipated and further work is now 
being done to determine the extent of the commercially recoverable oil. 
Based on the well result, the probable reserves associated with Pilot have 
been moved to the contingent resources category and an impairment 
charge of £9.0 million against the carrying value of the asset has been taken.
An appraisal well was drilled in the Narwhal field, to the south of Pilot, 
and this proved to be dry. The appraisal well drilled on the Millburn 
discovery encountered 12 feet of oil-bearing sandstone which is 
considered sub-economic and the appraisal well was also plugged  
and abandoned.
During the fourth quarter of 2007 , drilling continued on the Selkirk appraisal 
well (Venture – 31.5%) but was suspended due to well control problems. 
However, economic volumes were found and the operator has started 
development planning.
A provisional field development plan was submitted for West Wick 
(Venture – 28.46%) based on a tie-back to the Captain platform.  
2008 activity will focus on negotiations with Captain owners once 
Venture assumes operatorship.
Evaluation and appraisal work in 2008 will focus on Acorn and  
Beechnut (Venture – c. 80%) and Appleton (Venture – 100%) and 
Halley (Venture – 40%) fields, where we have established significant 
opportunities. A decision on the requirement for an Acorn appraisal  
well will be made in the first half of 2008.
An ongoing joint study with Talisman on the Appleton/Halley area will 
be concluded in 2008, with commitment to a Halley appraisal well likely 
to be the first phase of activity.

Southern North Sea Gas 
Our gas activities are situated in the SNS area where we have 42 blocks. 
At the end of 2007, we had two production hubs – ‘A’ Fields and GMA. 
Our SNS assets contain 91 MMboe 2P reserves and 272 MMboe total 
resources exposure.
‘a’ Fields
Venture’s ‘A’ Fields production hub comprises six producing gas fields 
– Audrey, Ann, Alison, Annabel, Saturn and Mimas, which together 
produced 20,367 boepd (2006: 25,972), and represented 49% of  
total Group production. ‘A’ Fields will continue to be a core hub for  
at least the next decade. 
Production performance in 2007 reflects a natural decline, although 
production from Annabel and Saturn continued to exceed expectations.
a nnabel 
Since the start of production in 2005, the Annabel field (Venture – 100%) 
has consistently outperformed expectations. We anticipate continued 
strong performance without the need for further capital expenditure, 
but an ongoing remapping exercise may identify additional drilling 
opportunities.
a udrey
Audrey’s two unmanned platforms support production from the Audrey 
field (Venture – 100%) and provide a tie-back route for Annabel, as well as 
a control for the Ann and Alison fields. A two year asset integrity project 
commenced in 2007 to secure facility life to 2020. 
ann/alison
The Ann and Alison fields (Venture – 100%) continue to perform in line 
with expectations. Evaluation of a potential workover of the Ann A4 well 
is ongoing with a decision due in 2008.
Saturn
The Saturn development (Venture – 22%) is operated by ConocoPhillips 
and includes the Atlas, Hyperion and Rhea accumulations. The Saturn 
field is continuing to exceed expectations, and a remapping exercise is 
underway to identify drilling opportunities.
Review of Assets (continued)
Mimas
The production well in the Mimas field (Venture – 15%) was drilled and 
completed by ConocoPhillips, the field operator, in June 2006. The well 
was tied back to the Saturn LOGGS pipeline and came on stream in  
June 2007 with performance in line with expectations.
a manda/a gatha
The Amanda discovery well (Venture – 100%), originally drilled in 2003,  
was sidetracked in the first half of 2007 and tested at rates uneconomic on 
a stand-alone basis. However, there is the potential for a joint development 
with the Agatha prospect (Venture – 100%), to the north of Amanda, which 
is due to be drilled in 2009. Reservoir studies are also in progress to explore 
options to increase well deliverability.
ensign
The Ensign field (Venture – 100%) straddles SNS blocks 48/14 and 
48/15a. Discovered in 1986, the gas-in-place volumes represent one of 
the largest proven undeveloped gas fields in the area. The Noble Julie 
Robertson drilled and completed a vertical appraisal well on Ensign and 
confirmed gas-in-place volumes of approximately 300 Bcf with rates of 
12-15 MMscfpd achieved during the production test. 
A second appraisal well was drilled in the fourth quarter of 2007 and was 
hydraulically fractured using the boat and equipment developed for the 
Chiswick field. It was tested at stabilised rates of over 42 MMscfpd, at the 
high end of expectations, with field development due to commence in 
2008 targeting first gas in late 2009.
a dele
The Adele prospect (Venture – 100%) is located in block 49/11a  
north east of the Audrey field. Subsurface mapping is ongoing to  
define the size (c. 30 Bcf unrisked) and risk of the prospect better  
prior to the commencement of well planning. The well is currently 
planned for late 2009/early 2010.
48/15b
The 48/15b block (Venture – 100%) was awarded in the 22nd Licensing 
Round and, following an extensive seismic reprocessing effort, Venture 
has committed to drill an exploration well on the block. Prospect 
mapping is currently being finalised with a view to drilling commencing 
in late 2008. 
easington Catchment a rea
Channon
Venture operates two blocks in the SNS area 47/3h (Venture – 47.1%) and 
47/8c (Venture – 55.8%). These blocks contain the Channon prospect 
and Venture’s average equity holding is 54%. An exploration well was 
successfully drilled and tested in the third quarter of 2007 flowing at 
a rate of 55 MMscfpd of gas, limited by the throughput of the test 
equipment. Estimated recoverable reserves are 30–40 Bcf net with  
initial production rates of 35 MMscfpd (net to Venture) which is at the 
top end of expectations. It is planned to develop Channon jointly with 
Barbarossa which is currently being drilled.

Venture Production plc 26 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Following on from our acquisition of WHAM, completed in 
November 2007, Venture now has access to a number of additional 
exciting exploration prospects in the SNS. 
Barbarossa
Venture has farmed-in to the SNS block 47/9c (Venture – 90%) to drill an 
appraisal well on the Barbarossa field, which was discovered in 1982 by 
well 47/9b-4. A single well development is planned which targets initial 
reserves in the range of 30–35 Bcf gross (29–32 Bcf net to Venture), but 
with significant potential upside. The appraisal well is scheduled to be 
drilled in early 2008 with the Noble Julie Robertson rig and if successful 
would be developed jointly with Channon.
east Irish Sea
Marram
Blocks 100/4 and 100/9b (Venture – 60%) contain the Marram discovery 
in the Morecambe Bay area of the East Irish Sea, where an appraisal 
well is planned during 2008/9 as part of a multi-operator campaign. 
The discovery lies within 25km of four potential off-take routes and on 
trend with both the producing Hamilton and Lennox fields. Blocks 100/4 
and 100/9b also have exploration prospectivity and contain up to six 
additional Sherwood sandstone exploration leads.
u K SNS exploration a creage
Following on from our acquisition of WHAM, completed in November 2007 , 
Venture now has access to a number of additional exciting exploration 
prospects in the SNS. The area covers 18 blocks and includes 14 
prospects (two ready to drill) plus numerous leads. 
Key near term opportunities include:
Carna
Carna (blocks 43/21b and 43/22c) is planned to spud in September 2008, 
with Venture as operator, and is a commitment well. Venture recently 
completed a farm-in on a modest promote on this well to increase our 
total equity to 56% across the two blocks. Following a successful well, 
the field is likely to be developed via an NUI with one or two wells to the 
nearby Garrow field and then via Trent into the ETS (Venture – 25%). 
a lcyone
Alcyone is an exploration prospect in block 53/3d to the south east of 
Leman and is 100% owned by Venture. It is a commitment well which is 
planned to be drilled in the second/third quarter of 2009. A provisional 
well location has been identified and well design will commence in the  
third quarter of 2008. The development is provisionally planned to be  
a single subsea tie-back to Leman.
Blocks 48/3 and 48/4
Blocks 48/3 and 48/4 have a number of interesting opportunities, 
although the most promising are the Morpheus and Hypnos prospects 
to the north of the blocks. Seismic reprocessing work/interpretation is 
ongoing across the acreage to identify a suitable well to bring forward. 
There is a contingent well commitment for 2008 on this non-operated 
(Venture – 16%) licence. Likely development is a subsea tie-back to 
Ravenspurn North. 
Blocks 43/11 and 43/12
These 100% Venture owned blocks are located to the west of the 
Esmond/Forbes area and north of Carna. The main prospect on this 
Promote licence is a Carboniferous target to the south east of the blocks 
called Andromeda. A 3D seismic survey is planned for 2008 to better 
define closure to the north east for Andromeda and the geometry of a 
number of leads on the block. A contingent well is planned for 2009. 
Schooner South east
This 100% Venture owned prospect is a possible extension of the 
Schooner field into the Venture operated block. Subsurface studies are 
ongoing in 2008 with a potential well proposal in late 2008 for a well in 
2009. Tie-back is likely to be to Schooner. There is the potential for a joint 
development with the Topaz and Garnet fields.
Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 27 Greater Markham a rea
Situated on the median line between the UK and Dutch sectors of the 
North Sea, GMA contributed 4,506 boepd during 2007 (2006: 1,393), 
representing 11% of total Group production. 
The highlight of 2007 was the start-up of production from the Chiswick 
field at the end of September and a second key project was the 
commissioning of the Markham Compression Tower, which resulted in 
increased operational and production performance. 
Markham
The Markham gas field (Venture – 37.5% unitised interest) straddles the 
UK and Dutch sectors of the SNS and has been producing since 1992. 
The facilities have been developed over several years and comprise 
the manned central processing and production platform located in 
Dutch block J/6a, an unmanned satellite well and production platform 
(ST-1) and the installation of the compression tower which collectively 
re-enforce Markham as a major transportation hub for the area. The 
Markham field itself continues to perform in line with expectations.
Chiswick
Located in UK block 49/4a, the Chiswick field (Venture – 100%) has 
been developed via an unmanned platform tied back to Markham. 
After drilling and completion of the first development well (Chiswick 
Alpha) early in 2007, it had to be suspended due to the unavailability of 
a suitable stimulation vessel. Venture was able to develop an innovative 
solution, utilising a pumping spread mounted on the deck of a large 
supply boat, and successfully performed a multiple fracture stimulation 
resulting in a well capable of delivering over 50 MMscfpd. The well 
was brought into production in September via the unmanned satellite 
platform tied back to Markham.
The second Chiswick development well (Chiswick Gamma) has now 
also been drilled, completed and hydraulically fractured. The estimated 
unconstrained production capability of the well was 75 MMscfpd, 
materially in excess of pre-drill expectations. The well has recently  
been tied into the producing infrastructure and is on stream.
In March 2008, Venture acquired the remaining 5% interest in block 49/4a 
that it did not already own.
Windermere
The Windermere gas field (Venture – 20%) lies in block 49/9b, about 
7km west of Markham, and has been in production since 1997. The field 
was developed via an unmanned production platform tied back to the 
Markham ST-1 platform with two production wells, one of which

Review of Assets (continued)
currently produces. It is planned to insert two velocity strings into 
these wells in 2008 to improve long term performance, following the 
improvements seen with the new compression facilities at Markham.
J3c
The J3c field (Venture – 4.025% unitised interest) was discovered in 1995 
by well J6-A5 drilled from the Markham J6A platform. The field straddles 
the boundary between J/3a and J/6 and is unitised, with 23% of reserves 
deemed to lie within the J/6 block. Venture has 17.5% of the J/6 block and 
hence holds a 4.025% unitised interest. It is anticipated that the field will 
continue to produce until 2025 without further capital investment.
Kew
The Kew field (Venture – 100%) is located east of Chiswick in UK waters, 
and the discovery well 49/5-4 drilled in 1988 proved the existence of gas 
in the Carboniferous sandstone. 
The development of Kew requires a single horizontal well with multiple 
hydraulic fractures that can be tied back to the Chiswick platform.  
Well planning is under-way and we expect to drill Kew in 2008.
Stamford
Located in the UKCS 24th Licensing Round, block 49/10c, the Stamford 
discovery (Venture – 100%) is ideally situated for a short subsea tie-back 
to the Markham platform. Drilling is due to commence in 2008, with first 
gas targeted for winter 2008/9.
F3-Fa
F3-FA (Venture – 58%) is located 230km north of Den Helder and 
is estimated to contain gross recoverable reserves of 60 Bcf. The 
development plan envisages a subsea completion and tie-back  
to nearby host infrastructure.
Battersea
The Battersea exploration prospect (Venture – 100%) is located north 
of Markham and is a Rotliegend feature with unrisked reserves of 
approximately 35 Bcf. Subsurface evaluation is ongoing and we expect 
to be in a position to drill an exploration well in early 2009.
Wandsworth
The Wandsworth exploration prospect (Venture – 100%) is a 
Carboniferous play, located east of the Chiswick field, and is estimated  
to contain unrisked reserves of over 100 Bcf. The initial evaluation has 
been completed and well design and planning is under-way prior to 
drilling in 2009. In the event of a successful well, the development  
would be as a tie-back to the Chiswick or Markham platforms.
Outlook
The pace and momentum will continue into 2008, and we will be 
actively participating in the 25th UK Licensing Round with our strategic 
partners, MPX Oil and Gas Limited and Volantis Exploration Limited. 
With an unrisked resource potential of 609 MMboe, we have entered 
2008 with a strong, well-balanced portfolio and significant near term 
opportunities.

Venture Production plc 28 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Frac Boat Case Study
With an aggressive timetable to meet to bring the Chiswick 
Alpha field on stream, when Venture found that the vessel it 
had planned to use had been withdrawn from the North Sea  
it had to come up with an alternative solution. These vessels 
are essential to fracture certain reservoirs to aid the flow of 
hydrocarbons.
An innovative application of existing technology produced the 
solution. Working in partnership with Schlumberger, the team 
converted a traditional offshore supply vessel to a well stimulation 
vessel in less than two months.
Equipment and personnel from all over the world had to be brought 
together as pumping equipment was installed onto the Siem Mariner, 
one of the biggest supply vessels at around 900m
2
 of deck space.
Drive and determination made sure these logistical and technical 
challenges were overcome and the newly commissioned frac boat 
successfully completed its first operations at Chiswick Alpha, before 
going on to undertake fracture work at the equally successful 
Chiswick Gamma and the Ensign appraisal wells. 
Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 29 completed, preliminary results of this study suggest that in the central 
part of the Sycamore field there is limited re-investment opportunity. 
Accordingly, an impairment charge of £24.5 million has been made 
reducing the carrying value of the Sycamore field to its projected value 
in use to the business.
• In aggregate, these charges reduce the reported operating profit and 
profit before tax for the year by £62.8 million (2006: £3.9 million) and 
the profit for the year by £31.4 million (2006: £1.9 million).
Lifting costs, excluding dry hole costs, per boe produced rose by  
14.1%. This is in part attributable to higher well workovers of £9.7 
million (2006: £7.7 million), the impact of fixed costs spread over lower 
production volumes and to the underlying cost escalation being seen 
across the industry.
On a unit basis, the charge for depreciation, depletion and amortisation 
is broadly comparable with the prior year.
Operating profit fell by 35.9% to £1 16.6 million (2006: £181.9 million) primarily 
due to the charges relating to unsuccessful exploration and development 
activities and asset impairment described above. Excluding the impact 
of these charges, the underlying operating profit margin per unit sold 
improved by 4.9% from £12.54/boe in 2006 to £13.16/boe in 2007. 
The key performance indicators discussed above measure the unit 
profitablilty of the Company and aid understanding of the trends in 
profitability of the business.
Net finance expense was higher in 2007 compared to 2006. This was 
driven by a higher level of borrowings and the unwinding of the equity 
component of the convertible bond. Details of the finance income and 
expense are shown in Note 7 to the accounts.

Financial Review 
Income Statement
Revenue of £358.3 million for the 12 months ended 31 December 2007 
(2006: £360.3 million) was 0.6% lower than 2006. This reflects a 7 .7% 
reduction in production to 41,228 boepd (2006: 44,706 boepd) which was 
largely offset by the impact of higher prices, particularly in the second half 
of the year. 
Gas accounted for 65% of production and 52% of revenues at an effective 
realised price (ERP) of £21.06/boe (2006: £23.60/boe). Oil represented  
35% of production and 48% of revenues at an ERP of £34.14/boe  
(2006: £25.30/boe).
Charges to the income statement have been made following the results of 
a number of wells drilled in 2007:
• There is a charge of £18.1 million (2006: £3.9 million) relating to 
exploration activities where hydrocarbons were not encountered  
with respect to Ash, Millburn and Narwhal (2006: North Channel  
and Moonraker).
• There is a charge of £1 1.2 million (2006: nil) relating to development costs 
written off. This reflects the write-off of the original drilling investment in 
the Amanda field in 2003, in accordance with recommended accounting 
practice for the oil and gas industry. The spend in connection with the 
sidetrack completed in 2007 , which encountered hydrocarbons but at a 
rate uneconomic on a stand-alone basis, has been carried forward as an 
asset under construction pending assessment of the potential for a joint 
development with the Agatha prospect.
• There is a charge of £33.5 million (2006: nil) relating to the impairment 
of assets on the Sycamore and Pilot fields. The appraisal well on the Pilot 
field was drilled in 2007 and produced heavy oil with higher viscosity 
than anticipated, which has impacted the potential commercial viability 
of the oil. As a result, a £9.0 million impairment charge has been made. 
During 2007 , Venture commenced a major seismic reprocessing and 
interpretation study on the entire ‘Trees’ production hub, which will be 
completed during 2008. Whilst the analysis of the remaining potential 
in the southern part of the Sycamore development has not yet been 
Venture Production plc 30 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 The effective tax rate for the year was 52.4% (2006: 53.8%) with the majority 
of the Group’s profits being subject to UK Corporation Tax at 30% and a 
Supplementary Charge of a further 20%. Further details on the income  
tax expense for the year are shown in Note 8.
Balance Sheet
The Group had fixed tangible assets of £818.6 million (2006: £664.6 million) 
reflecting continuing field development and acquisition activity over the 
period, in particular on the Chiswick and Ensign developments.
The intangible assets of £53.3 million (2006: £47.9 million) arose on the 
acquisition of WHAM Energy plc in 2007 and CH4 in 2006. Under IAS 12, 
the deferred tax attributable to the difference between the fair value of 
assets and tax written-down value has been recognised, resulting in the 
recognition of a significant deferred tax liability. The goodwill is subject to 
impairment testing annually.
The investment of £16.3 million (2006: £11.1 million) is made up of the 
investment in NSIP , the investment in the Sevan Production General 
Partnership and our interest in TDNEL. 
Derivative financial instruments are included as a liability in 2007 (2006: 
asset) reflecting the value of the hedges in place at year end compared 
to commodity prices at that time. Further details are given in Note 25.
The deferred tax liability has increased from £193.4 million at 31 December 
2006 to £200.4 million at 31 December 2007 , mainly due to the profits made 
in the period, the tax on which will be payable in future periods.
Cash Flow and Funding
The net cash generated from operating activities was £240.2 million  
(2006: £273.5 million). This was offset by expenditure on investing activities 
of £223.6 million (2006: £244.4 million). 
Venture elected to pay £16.0 million of cash taxes in January 2007 to take 
advantage of the ability to offset 2005 Capital Allowances against the higher 
tax rate for 2006 which reflects the increase in the Supplementary Charge 
from 10% to 20% for 2006 and later years. 
“  The closing balance sheet  
reflects the strength of Venture’s 
business with a cash balance of  
£158.4 million and a substantially 
unutilised borrowing facility.”
In July 2007 , the Company paid a dividend totalling £67.6 million (2006: nil), 
representing a payment of 50.0 pence per share, of which 10.0 pence was 
an ordinary dividend and 40.0 pence per share was a special dividend. 
In August 2007 , the Company issued £151.0 million of 3.25% unsecured 
convertible bonds due 2010, as part of the strategic investment in the 
Company by 3i Group plc and its affiliates and ArcLight Capital Partners,  
LLC and its co-investors through an affiliate. 
In August 2007 , the Company also put in place a new medium term 
committed corporate debt facility of £350.0 million. This new facility 
replaces Venture’s previous borrowing base facility. In November 2007 , 
this facility was successfully syndicated to a syndicate of 1 1 banks. Despite 
difficult credit market conditions, demand for the facility was strong and 
allowed Venture to increase the size of the facilities to £365.0 million. 
In addition, the Company raised US$424.0 million and £25.0 million in a 
private placement of notes with US and UK institutional investors in August 
2007. These notes have final maturities of between 10 and 15 years and are 
at a fixed rate. Further details of these financial instruments are provided in 
Notes 2 and 25. 
Taken together, these funds will help finance the ongoing development  
of Venture’s existing asset base as well as fund potential future acquisitions.  
The closing balance sheet reflects the strength of Venture’s business  
with a cash balance of £158.4 million and a substantially unutilised  
borrowing facility.

Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 33 Directors’ Report
The Directors present their report and audited accounts for the year 
ended 31 December 2007.
Principal Activities
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings 
is oil and gas production. Its specific focus is on the exploitation of 
discovered but undeveloped fields, known as ‘stranded’ reserves, 
through the application of modern technology and oil field operating 
practices. 
Business Review
The Companies Act 1985 requires the Directors’ Report to include a 
Business Review of the Company, giving a true and fair review of the 
business of the Group and its subsidiary undertakings plus a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties. The Business Review should also 
include analysis using financial and other key performance indicators 
(KPIs), as well as information relating to environmental and employee 
matters. The Business Review must also provide an indication of likely 
future developments in the Group’s business and an assessment of the  
Group’s position and prospects. 
A review of the Group’s business performance during 2007, position at 
the year end and likely future developments are reviewed in the Business 
and Operational Review (pages 14 to 29), the Chairman’s Statement 
(pages 8 and 9) and the Chief Executive’s Review (pages 10 to 13).  
The Financial Review (pages 30 and 31) covers financial aspects of the 
Group’s performance during the year with risk management and controls 
being addressed within the Corporate Governance Report (pages 37  
to 44). A report on Corporate Social Responsibility appears on pages 54  
and 55.
The information in all of these sections, which fulfils the requirements  
of the Business Review, is incorporated into this Directors’ Report  
by reference. 
Results and Dividend
The Group’s profit for the year ended 31 December 2007 amounted to 
£48.2 million (2006: £81.6 million), which will be transferred to reserves.
The Directors have proposed a final ordinary dividend of 12.0 pence  
per share (2006: 10.0 pence). No special dividend is proposed  
(2006: 40.0 pence).
Dividends have been waived on the holdings of Venture Production IOM 
Employee Benefit Trust. 
Dividend Policy
As an oil and gas production company, Venture is required to maintain 
high and sustained levels of capital reinvestment into its business. Up 
to 2005, Venture had invested far greater levels of capital than it had 
generated in operating cash flow. This shortfall has been funded by 
a combination of debt and equity financing. During 2006 and 2007 
Venture generated free cash flow expenditures and expects to continue 
doing so.
In utilising any free cash flow generated, the Board has determined 
the following priorities: first, acquisitions or other internally generated 
business development opportunities meeting Venture’s strict investment 
criteria; second, the repayment of part of the Group’s outstanding 
debt to sustainable long term levels; and third, the return of capital to 
shareholders through dividends or other mechanisms.
During the course of 2007 , Venture spent £13.9 million (£6.3 million  
cash and £7 .6 million equity) on the acquisition of WHAM Energy plc.  
In addition, a substantial proportion of the shares needed to satisfy  
share-based incentive compensation schemes for management and 
employees have been met by purchasing shares in the market, as well as 
through the issue of additional new shares. Details of the shares purchased 
by the Company are shown below under the Authority to Purchase  
Shares section.
This flexible policy will continue, allowing Venture to manage the 
purchase of acquisitions, which are an important but unpredictable part 
of Venture’s growth.
Charitable and Political Donations
During the year the Group made charitable donations amounting to 
£18,162 (2006: £1,270). A Social Investment Policy has been approved 
by the Board and is based around our employees’ links in the local 
communities. The Group operates an informal ‘Employee Matched 
Funding Scheme’ within pre-determined social and financial criteria. 
No political donations were made and no political expenditure was 
incurred during the year.
Creditor Payment Policy
It is the Company’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in 
accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between the Group 
and its suppliers, provided that all trading terms and conditions have 
been complied with.
At 31 December 2007, the Group had an average of 40 days purchases 
outstanding (2006: 25 days).
Directors
The current Directors of the Company and their biographical details 
are contained on pages 32 and 33 and their interests, including share 
options in the Company’s share capital, are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 50.
On 16 June 2007, Rod Begbie was appointed as Corporate Development 
Director, having joined Venture in 2002 as Corporate Development 
Manager. This reflects the importance of this activity to our next stage of 
development and the Board’s wish for clear Board level accountability.
Following the announcement of the strategic partnership with  
3i Group plc and its affiliates and ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC in July 
and subsequent approval of the £151 million convertible bond financing 
in August, two new Non-Executive Directors were appointed. Robb 
Turner, co-founder of ArcLight, was appointed on 12 September and 
Graeme Sword, a partner with 3i’s Oil, Gas and Power business unit, 
joined the Board on 24 October.
Venture Production plc 34 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Marie-Louise Clayton, having indicated her intention to leave the Board 
earlier in the year, was replaced as Finance Director by Peter Turner on  
6 December. 
On 3 March 2008 Andrew Carr-Locke joined the Board as an additional 
independent Non-Executive Director. 
The Company’s Articles of Association require that one third of the 
Directors must submit themselves for re-election each year by rotation. 
Additionally, newly appointed Directors will submit themselves for 
election at the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment. 
No Director was or is materially interested in any contract which was 
significant in relation to the Group’s business, other than his service 
contract, where appropriate, during or at the end of the period.  
Details of service contracts are set out on pages 49 and 50. During the 
year, the Company maintained insurance for its Directors and Officers.
An evaluation has been carried out of each Director’s performance 
during the year and it has been concluded that each Director continues 
to be effective and demonstrates a strong commitment to the role.
Substantial Shareholdings
At 10 March 2008 the Company’s share register of substantial 
shareholdings showed the following interests in 3% or more of the 
Company’s issued share capital:
 Number of Ordinary Shares %
 
Schroders Investment Management 15,576,117 10.88

Note 26 on page 93.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Company’s AGM will be held on 14 May 2008 at the Copthorne 
Hotel, Huntly Street, Aberdeen and the Notice of Meeting has been 
circulated separately to shareholders with this report.
Authority to Purchase Shares
The authority given at last year’s AGM held on 6 June 2007 for the 
Company to purchase in the market up to 13,349,629 of its ordinary shares, 
representing 10% of the issued share capital, expires on 14 May 2008. 
Shareholders will be asked to give a similar authority at the 2008 AGM.
No shares have been purchased under the authority granted at the 
AGM in 2007, however, 2,173,250 ordinary shares of 0.4 pence each were 
purchased in January and February 2007 under the authority granted  
in 2006 for a total consideration of £15.8 million at an average price of 
£7.26 per share. The shares were purchased in an on-market programme 
of buying back the Company’s shares, initiated in May 2006.
At the date of this report all the shares bought back had been transferred 
out of treasury into the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust to meet 
obligations under employee share plans.
No dividends are paid on treasury shares and no voting rights attach  
to them.
Employees and Employment Practices
Employees are encouraged to become involved in the Group’s operating 
performance and in all matters that affect them. Regular performance 
updates are provided by the Executive team and also on employment 
related matters such as appraisal training, stress counselling workshops 
and winter driver training.
A significant proportion of the employee bonus arrangements are linked 
to overall Group performance and employee involvement in key targets 
is encouraged through appropriate incentive schemes. Employees are 
also actively encouraged to participate in the Company’s Share Incentive 
Plan, which all employees are eligible to join after six months’ service.
The Group remains committed to improving the skills, knowledge and 
competence of all employees and appropriate training is provided in a 
number of areas.
The development needs of all employees are reviewed as part of the 
annual appraisal process and development activity is a key part of this 
process.
The Group acknowledges the importance of its workforce and its aim is 
to attract, retain and motivate high calibre employees.
The Group gives full and sympathetic consideration to the employment, 
training, career development and promotion of disabled employees.  
As far as employees who become disabled during their employment  
are concerned each case is judged on its own specific circumstances.
The Group is opposed to all forms of discrimination and offers equal 
access to employment, promotion and development regardless of 
gender, race, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, age and disability.
Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 35 Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare accounts for each financial 
year, which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
of the profit or loss for that year. In preparing these accounts, the Directors 
are required to:
•	 S e l e c t	s u i t a b l e	a c c o u n t i n g	p o li c i e s	a n d	t h e n	a p p l y	t h e m	c o n s i s t e n t l y .

to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts.
•	 P r e p a r e	t h e	a c c o u n t s	o n	t h e	g o i n g	c o n c e r n	b a s i s	u n l e s s	i t	i s	
inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will  
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Group and Company and for ensuring that the accounts comply with 
the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors and Disclosure of Information to Auditors
So far as the Directors are aware there is no relevant information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware and each Director has taken all the 
steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to be aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information. 
The Directors will place a resolution before the AGM to re-appoint 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of the Group to hold office until 
the conclusion at the next general meeting, at which the accounts are laid 
before the Company.

Directors’ Report
continued
Venture Production plc 36 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Corporate Governance Report
Introduction
Throughout the year, the Board has remained committed to ensuring that 
high standards of corporate governance are maintained Group wide.
This year saw a number of new Directors appointed, which has further 
strengthened the Board. Two of these appointments were as a result of 
the strategic investment acquired by 3i Group plc and its affiliates and 
ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC. The Board was also further expanded by 
the creation of a new Executive role of Corporate Development Director 
which reflects the importance of corporate and business development 
to the next phase of Venture’s growth.
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Company complied with the provisions of the Combined Code 
during 2007, except in the following areas:
A.3.2
Combined Code Position
At least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise  
Non-Executive Directors determined by the Board to be independent.
Company Position
At the beginning of the year the Company was compliant with this 
provision, but following the appointment of Rod Begbie in June, Robb 
Turner in September and Graeme Sword in October, it now comprises 
less than half the Board who are independent Non-Executive Directors.
Explanation
An evaluation of the composition of the Board has been undertaken 
and in order to fully comply with this provision of the Code, the Board 
would need to comprise at least 15 members. The Board wishes to 
avoid becoming unwieldy due to its size, as this may impact upon its 
current flexibility and effectiveness. It remains satisfied that the existing 
independent Non-Executive Directors are capable of safeguarding 
shareholders interests. Notwithstanding this, the Nominations Committee 
has recently overseen the recruitment of one new independent  
Non-Executive Director, although it should be noted that even following 
this appointment, the Board is not compliant with this provision.
A.4.1
Combined Code Position 
A majority of the members of the Nominations Committee should be 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
Company Position
Throughout 2007 the Nominations Committee comprised two 
independent Non-Executive Directors, the Chairman and the  
Chief Executive.
Explanation
The Board believes that it is important for the Chief Executive to be a 
member of the Nominations Committee and to be formally involved  
in the nomination process for new Board members.
The Board, its Structure and Directors
The Board formulates its strategy and monitors the operating and 
financial performance of the Company, whilst recognising its key role  
as the link in the chain of authority between the shareholders and the 
Chief Executive and its responsibility to represent and promote the 
interests of shareholders.
The Board is accountable to all shareholders for the performance of 
the Company and has a written schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision. These include the approval of interim and financial statements; 
long term objectives and strategy; the annual business plan; operating 
and capital expenditure budgets; policy on hydrocarbon and currency 
hedging; risk management policy; reserves reporting; and all other 
corporate governance arrangements.
All other matters, including implementing the Board’s decisions on 
reserved matters, are delegated to the Chief Executive. The Chief 
Executive is responsible in turn for establishing a clear system of 
delegation and accountability for all aspects of corporate performance. 
Where the Board approves policy, it both sets the standards to be 
observed by the whole Company and provides a clear framework for 
delegation. The schedule of matters reserved for the Board is available  
at www.venture-production.com.
As at 31 December 2007, the Board comprised the Chairman, four 
Executive Directors, four independent Non-Executive Directors and 
three non-independent Non-Executive Directors. Details of changes 
during the year are set out in the Directors’ Report on pages 34 to 36.
The Non-Executive Directors bring a wide range of business, financial 
and international experience to the Board. Biographical details of each 
Director are set out on pages 32 and 33.
Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and clearly 
defined and have been set out in writing and approved by the Board.  
No individual has unfettered powers of decision making. The Chairman  
is responsible for the leadership and governance of the Board, and 
the Chief Executive for the management of the Company and the 
implementation of the Board strategy and policy on its behalf.
The Chief Executive is supported by the Executive Committee and 
Executive team which are comprised of the senior management from 
throughout the business.
Senior Independent Director
Mark Nicholls, the Deputy Chairman, has been appointed as the Senior 
Independent Director (SID) and he is available to speak to shareholders 
if they have concerns which contact through the normal channels of 
Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director has failed to resolve or for 
which such contact is inappropriate. No such meetings were requested 
during the year.

Re-Election of Directors
The Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association require that 
one third of the Directors must submit themselves for re-election each 
year by rotation. Additionally, newly appointed Directors will submit 
themselves for election at the AGM following their appointment.  
The Board has decided that all Directors should submit themselves 
for re-election at each AGM. This is consistent with the annual review 
process for individual Board members, which includes the review of 
appointment terms and conditions and confirmation of expected time 
commitments for Non-Executive Directors.
Independence of Directors
As outlined above, the composition of the Board has changed during 
the year following the appointment of an additional Executive Director, 
Rod Begbie and two new non-independent Non-Executive Directors, 
Graeme Sword and Robb Turner. Larry Kinch is also acknowledged as not 
being independent based upon the Code’s definition, as he is a founding 
member of Venture and a major shareholder. This has led to the Board 
not complying with Code provision A.3.2. 
Board and Committee agendas and supporting papers are distributed 
seven days in advance of each meeting and in the instances where a 
Director has not been able to attend Board or Committee meetings,  
any comments he or she may have are relayed in advance to the 
Chairman of the meeting.
All Directors have access to the Company Secretary and, if required,  
also to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Induction and Development of the Non-Executive Directors
New Directors are given a tailored induction programme covering 
the overall position of Venture; the role of the Board and the matters 
reserved for Board decision; the function and terms of reference of  
Board Committees; the Company’s corporate governance practices; 
key policy areas and the latest financial and operational information 
concerning the Company. They also meet all the Executive Directors  
and the Company Secretary and key members of the management  
team and are briefed on their legal and other duties and obligations  
as a Director of a listed company.

During the year the Company also held a number of additional Board and Committee meetings by minuted conference calls. These were often called 
at short notice between the scheduled meetings.
Venture Production plc 38 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 As part of the annual appraisal process, Directors are invited to identify 
any areas in which they would benefit from training and the Company 
will seek to identify appropriate programmes to meet their needs.  
This is supplemented by routine briefings on major developments.  
For example, during the year, amongst other briefings, the Directors 
were updated on the implications of the Transparency Directive and  
the new Companies Act 2006.
Role of the Non-Executive Directors
The roles and responsibilities of the Non-Executive Directors are  
set out in their appointment letters and their key responsibilities,  
which are mainly supervisory, are to recommend, advise and monitor 
matters relating to:
•	 T h e	s t r a t e g y	o f	t h e	C o m p a n y .
•	 T h e	C o m p a n y ’ s	p e r f o r m a n c e .

and in the Company generally.
•	 T h e	a p p o i n t m e n t	o f	k e y	e m p l o y e e s	a n d	o ffi c e r s .
A copy of the standard letter of appointment for a Non-Executive Director 
is available on the Company’s website. The Non-Executive Directors meet 
periodically, often just before a Board meeting, without the Executive 
Directors present. During 2007 they met three times as a group.
Directors’ Indemnities and Insurance
The Companies (Audit Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004 
came into force in April 2005 and amended the provisions of Section 
310 of the Companies Act 1985 to give companies the power to extend 
indemnities to Directors against liability to third parties, excluding 
criminal and regulatory penalties, and to pay Directors’ legal costs as 
they are incurred. If judgement is given against a Director, or if the 
individual is convicted, the Director is liable to reimburse the Company  
in relation to the legal costs received.
In June 2007, the Company obtained shareholder approval at its AGM to 
amend the Articles of Association to give it authority to provide funding 
for Directors’ defence costs. Letters of indemnification have been issued to 
all Directors and will be issued to new Directors to provide an indemnity 
to the extent permitted by legislation. 
The Company also maintains Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover  
in respect of any legal action taken against the Directors in connection 
with their duties.
Board Committees
The Board has established a number of Committees in order to assist it  
in fulfilling its role and responsibilities. The terms of reference of each of 
the Board Committees are reviewed on a regular basis and are available 
to view at www.venture-production.com.
Nominations Committee
A Nominations Committee has been established and comprises John 
Morgan, its Chairman, Mark Nicholls, Alan Jones and Mike Wagstaff.  
The terms of reference of the Committee set out its key objectives  
which include the regular review of the Board structure, size and 
composition and any recommendations are then submitted to the  
Board for consideration. The Committee is also responsible for 
identifying and nominating candidates for the approval of the Board, 
to fill Board vacancies, as and when they arise. During the year the 
Committee, in conjunction with Spencer Stuart, was responsible for 
recommending the recruitment of Peter Turner as the Company’s  
new Finance Director, in place of Marie-Louise Clayton who left the 
Company in December.
In March 2008, the recruitment of Andrew Carr-Locke as a new 
independent Non-Executive Director was announced, and this process 
was overseen by the Committee in conjunction with recruitment 
consultants, Egon Zhender. 
Although the Committee only met formally once during the year,  
it held a number of both formal and informal Committee calls in  
exercise of its duties.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee reviews the Interim and Annual Accounts, 
internal controls and the results of the audit with the external auditors, 
maintaining an effective relationship with them. The Committee also 
reviews the scope of the audit and other non-audit services and 
recommends the remuneration of the external auditors to the Board. 
It makes recommendations on the appointment, re-appointment or 
removal of the Company’s external auditors and during the year the 
Board accepted the Audit Committee’s recommendations to re-appoint 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s external auditor.  
The Committee reports its activities and makes recommendations  
to the Board.
For details on fees paid to the external auditors, see Note 4 to the 
Accounts on page 74.
Deloitte & Touche LLP have been appointed as tax advisors to the 
Company to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair 
the independence or objectivity of the external auditors.
Committee Composition
Throughout the year, the Committee comprised Mark Nicholls 
(Chairman), Alan Jones and Tom Ehret; details of their attendance 
at Committee meetings is shown on page 38. Representatives from 
the external auditors attended three meetings and, in addition, have 
unrestricted access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee has the discretion to decide who, other than its members, 
shall attend the meetings and during the year the Finance Director and 
Chief Accounting Officer attended each meeting.
The Board is of the opinion that the Committee meets the requirement to 
have at least one member, in Mr Nicholls, possessing recent and relevant 
financial experience. It will be seen from the Directors’ biographical details 
on pages 32 and 33 that he and the other members of the Committee 
bring to it a wide range of experience in the financial and oil and gas 
sectors in the UK and internationally. As stated above, Andrew  
Carr-Locke has recently been recruited as a new independent  
Non-Executive Director. Andrew was formerly Finance Director of 
George Wimpey PLC and also possesses recent and relevant financial 
experience. He was appointed to the Committee with effect from  
3 March 2008 to further strengthen the composition of the Committee.

Terms of Reference
The Audit Committee is authorised to investigate any activity within its 
terms of reference, which are reviewed on an annual basis. It has access 
to the external auditors, who in turn have unrestricted access to the 
Committee. If required and at the Company’s expense, the Committee 
can obtain outside legal and or other independent professional advice. 
None was obtained during the year.
Overview of Activities
During the year under review, the Audit Committee followed a programme 
structured around the annual reporting cycle and reports from both 
management and the external auditors. Principal activities included:
•	 R e v i e w	o f	t h e	P r e li m i n a r y	A n n o u n c e m e n t ,	t h e	A n n u a l	R e p o r t	a n d

receives reports from the external auditors identifying any accounting 
or judgemental issues requiring its attention.

In addition to the principal activities outlined above, the Committee also 
received a number of reports and presentations throughout the year.
These included presentations on the Company’s information technology 
developments, an annual tax review and an update on a review of internal 
controls carried out by KPMG. KPMG also presented to the Committee 
during the year a review of internal financial controls which concentrated 
on five key processes. Progress has been made to address the issues 
identified.
The Committee acted as an appropriate sounding board for the 
management on these activities and the wide-ranging experience  
of its members ensured thorough and valuable consideration was  
given to the matters under discussion.
Internal Audit Function
The Committee continually monitors the need for the establishment 
of an internal audit function, bearing in mind the growth in size and 
complexity of the Company, in accordance with provision C.3.5 of the 
Combined Code. Venture currently obtains independent confirmation 
on the operation of internal controls from a variety of sources. KPMG 
had been appointed on a continuing basis during the year to provide 
an external review of the financial controls within the Group, having 
particular regard to the efficiency of key financial processes and the 
implementation of best practice.
As an operator, Venture is subject to audits by the non-operating 
joint venture parties. These audits cover all charges made to the joint 
account and compliance with the administration of the joint operating 
agreement. In its own right, Venture undertakes audits on significant third 
party contracts, utilising the services of specialist independent auditors. 
Where Venture has a concern over a particular area, a specific review  
will be instigated using either internal or external resources as required 
under the direction of the Audit Committee. This approach of utilising 
the diverse skill set within the Company, supplemented by external 
individuals, enables Venture to cover the full range of business risks  
that it faces without having to employ full-time resources focused on 
internal control reviews. The results of all audit reviews are reported  
to the Audit Committee.
Following input from the Audit Committee, the Board has again  
decided against establishing a formal ‘in-house’ internal audit function. 
This decision is partly a function of scale, but more importantly, it is 
believed that an alternative approach to identifying and dealing with 
risk areas is a better fit for the Company. This involves examining the 
overall risk review, including the specific areas of financial management 
and control, and, together with the external auditors, identifying areas 
that require further analysis or benchmarking. This work will then be 
undertaken by the appropriate internal or external resources.
The decision on the establishment of an internal audit function will 
continue to be reviewed on an annual basis.
Performance Evaluation
During 2007 the Committee carried out an internal performance 
evaluation, designed to produce an objective assessment of the 
Committee’s performance and the effectiveness of the external audit 
function. It was concluded that the Committee and the audit process 
were effective and that the Committee had appropriate terms of 
reference and achieved its remit.
One issue raised that has been addressed during the year is the timing 
and location of meetings to ensure that the Committee has adequate 
opportunity to fully consider all areas within its remit. It was agreed that 
in order to do this, wherever possible, meetings should be de-coupled 
from the formal Board meeting schedule. 
Briefings and training are provided, where appropriate, to ensure that 
the Committee remains informed of all material developments in best 
practice and regulation concerning its remit.
An evaluation of the Company’s auditor was also carried out at the same 
time, with input provided by each member of the Committee as well as 
regular attendees. Feedback was provided to the Audit Partner by the 
Committee’s Chairman. 
Remuneration Committee
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages 45 to 53 and 
provides detailed information on the Company’s remuneration policies  
and practices.
Venture Production plc 40 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Executive Committee
Composition of the Executive Committee changed during the year,  
with the appointment of Rod Begbie in June, and Peter Turner replacing 
Marie-Louise Clayton in December. At the year end the Committee 
comprised Mike Wagstaff (Chairman), Jon Murphy, Peter Turner and 
Rod Begbie. Meetings are held on a regular basis, within clearly defined 
delegated powers concerning operational matters.
The Board has delegated authority to the Executive Committee in a 
number of areas, including:
•	 A p p r ov a l	o f	i n d i v i d u a l	u n b u d g e t e d	c a p i t a l	e x p e n d i t u r e / c o m m i t m e n t

security that may be required in respect of contracts or agreements 
that have been approved by the Board.
Board Assessment
In March 2008, the Board carried out a review of its performance during 
2007 and discussed opportunities for improvement. A list of issues 
and topics was compiled by the Chairman and circulated ahead of the 
discussion, with a clear opportunity to raise additional issues. Board 
members were free to submit views confidentially in writing, but in 
practice none did so and all participated in the discussion. 
Following the outcome from the 2006 assessment, the Board agreed to 
reduce the number of formal Board meetings to five per annum and one 
Board call, supplemented as necessary by additional calls. The meetings 
in March and December are now held over two days to allow additional 
consideration of year end and budgeting matters, respectively. During 
2007, the Board has also received a number of presentations by senior 
managers from throughout the business, as this was considered to be  
an appropriate way for the Directors to receive increased exposure to  
the Company’s management.
The Board unanimously agreed that the process for Board, Committee 
and Director assessment was appropriate to the size and structure of  
the Company.
Individual Director assessments are based on a self-assessment process 
which is followed up by a conversation with the Chairman who consults 
with his colleagues as necessary. This process ties in with the annual 
agreement renewal process for Non-Executive Directors.
Mark Nicholls, the SID, led an assessment of the Chairman’s performance 
during 2007, at which the Chairman was not present. A range of tasks 
were reviewed and the Board unanimously reaffirmed its view that 
he remained fully independent in both character and judgement and 
continued to allocate sufficient time to fulfil his duties as the Chairman  
of a FTSE 250 company.
Risk Management and Internal Control
The Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the Company’s 
systems of internal controls and is responsible for the controls including 
financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. In 
accordance with the provisions of the Turnbull Report, the Board is also 
responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of those controls. 
Such a control system can only provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss and is designed not 
to eliminate risk, but to enable the Company to achieve its corporate 
objectives within a managed risk portfolio.
The Board receives regular reports from the executive management  
that enables it to assess the nature of business risks and allows it to 
review the effectiveness of the controls in place to manage them.  
As Venture has increased significantly in scale over the last few years,  
the risk process has also grown in breadth and complexity to support it. 
The Board has fully reviewed the changes in process during the course  
of the year and will continue to do so going forward.
Recognising and managing risk is a process that occurs at all levels  
within the business and is an inherent part of the management 
culture. The process recognises not only the downside risks, but also 
opportunities that might otherwise be missed. In an environment that is 
itself subject to increasing market, legislative and environmental changes, 
the dynamic and cultural nature of this risk process is essential to maintain 
its currency. At the operational level, managers are responsible for 
ensuring that their staff and contractors carry out risk assessments of  
all projects and activities to identify potential hazards. 
Where appropriate, independent third parties with additional specialist 
skills contribute to these assessments. When risks cannot be removed, 
controls are identified and implemented and their effectiveness 
monitored throughout the life cycle of the project and activity.
At the corporate level, the Directors formally review all significant risks 
to the business. The results of the processes described above and, in 
particular, of the annual risk assessment review, are brought to the  
Board in a summarised form.
This identifies the key risks, the likelihood of occurrence, the potential 
impact on the business and the actions being identified and implemented 
to control or mitigate the risks. The Board reviews this assessment and 
brings its own ‘top down’ contribution and judgement to bear with 
particular reference to risks of a strategic nature. 
The resultant findings are fed back to the organisation through 
management to ensure a common understanding and the 
implementation of necessary actions.
The Board formally reviewed risk as a separate topic twice during 2007 
with the objective of providing assurance that changing circumstances 
are being monitored, that the process is robust and that necessary 
actions are being implemented.
Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 41 Corporate Governance Report
continued
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility, under the Combined Code, 
to establish and maintain the Company’s system of internal control that 
safeguards its assets and to ensure the reliability of financial information 
for both internal use and external publication. 
Internal control systems reflect the particular scale of operations, business 
risks, cost effectiveness and overall needs of the Company. Controls are 
designed to identify and manage risk rather than eliminate all risks to 
which the Company is exposed. 
As a result, any system of internal control can only provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The attention to internal control continued during 2007 and has been 
externally validated by KPMG, demonstrating an increase in controls and 
documented processes.
Key Risks
After Board evaluation of the business risks presented by management, 
the following key risks facing the business are identified.
Communication to Investors/Analysts/External Parties
This risk centres on the difficulty of providing accurate and consistent 
information about business performance when outcomes are subject 
to many influences outside direct management control. The Company 
is committed to an open and timely process of market communication. 
During 2007, we have enhanced the level of communication with 
shareholders and analysts. The potential for enhanced volatility of 
performance during the year was identified and communicated. 
Nonetheless, the combined effects of lower gas prices early in the 
year, weather impacts and uncontrollable operational issues has been 
higher than anticipated and the challenge of preventing these issues 
from overshadowing real progress remains very real. The Company 
is committed to maintaining a high level of transparency and 
communication, with a strong focus on value creation and will set  
c l e a r	s t r a t e g i c	o b j e c t i ve s	t o	2 0 1 0 / 2 0 1 1 .
Business Valuation
The risk is that, despite enhanced communication with shareholders, 
the underlying value of the business is not fully reflected in the share 
price. This creates concerns around cost of capital and the generation 
of unwelcome approaches geared to taking advantage of commodity 
price volatility, rather than returning underlying business value to 
shareholders. A high level of communication concerning value has been 
maintained with key institutional shareholders. A project to strengthen 
the group of core strategic shareholders resulted in two new strategic 
shareholders taking a combined holding of around 20% in the Company, 
each of them now having Board representation. This development has 
reduced the risk of a pre-emptive, undervalued take-over approach 
being successful. We will continue to communicate the underlying 
business strength and will target continued profitable growth.
Statement of Reserves
There is a robust and externally validated process applied to Venture’s 
reserves statements. Reserves are reviewed by the Board twice yearly 
and the producing field reserves are subject to an annual third party 
audit. During 2007, the process successfully reflected significant 
adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative. With the existing 
process in place, the Board perceives this risk as relatively low, but 
believes it should continue to be highlighted as a key risk because  
of its fundamental relationship to value.
Relevance of Venture’s Business Model to Deliver Its Strategic Objectives
There has been a very strong focus on strategy during 2007, which  
has reinforced the view that Venture’s business model remains valid. 
There is evidence that the market for ‘stranded’ assets in the North Sea 
is changing, with more and larger blocks of assets becoming available. 
With this development, the competitive environment is also likely to 
change. We continue to believe that Venture has major competitive 
advantages in this situation, although maximising the leverage of these 
strengths is becoming a more sophisticated task, making it difficult to 
predict the precise timing with which growth assets will be added to  
the portfolio. This makes it important to express strategic objectives  
with the appropriate balance between growth and value per share.
Third Party Infrastructure
In common with all operators, Venture relies on third parties to deliver  
its products to market. The successful development of Chiswick, together 
with the installation of the Kittiwake pipeline, has provided significant 
elements of infrastructure diversification. The fact remains that we 
will continue to have a high degree of dependence on third party 
performance. Sound relationships and good communication with third 
party management remains a very high priority and we will continue to 
review further diversification as part of our strategic approach.
Technical Risk
It is paramount to the Board that Venture has a comprehensive 
understanding of both subsurface and topside asset risks. This is an 
area of constant review and analysis within the Company to ensure the 
existence of the right technical skills, control processes and relationships 
with third parties. The Technical Integrity Management System has now 
been fully implemented and its operation reviewed at Board level.  
This system assures sound understanding and management of structural 
risks. Enhanced project evaluation procedures have been implemented 
and an experienced Senior Technical Manager has been recruited.  
This move is focused on enhancing the consistency of approach to and 
providing quality assurance on technical evaluation and presentation  
of risk across all assets and projects.
Organisational Capability
Venture’s organisational scale and capacity has continued to grow with 
the Group now having over 140 full-time employees. The risk continues 
to be managed, with good progress being made in developing an 
extended management team and strengthening a number of technical 
and commercial skill areas. The recruitment and retention record 
continues to be good at a time of very high competition for people. 
Venture has continued to recruit experienced and talented people who 
wish to work in a creative and flexible environment. With continuing 
growth and high workloads, progress in this area will continue to be  
a key priority for management.
Performance by Contractors/Suppliers
In current tight markets it is essential that close and value-adding 
relationships are created with suppliers and contractors. Venture has 
pioneered a partnership approach and this has continued to work well. 
Venture Production plc 42 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 However, market pressures have become much greater over the last 
12 months and the nature of this risk has increased to reflect not just 
performance assurance, but also basic access to equipment and services, 
as well as the level of cost and its management. Venture’s experience 
over the last three years has contributed to its competitive strength.  
The issue is now one of heightened strategic significance and building 
on our track record here is a very high priority.
Health, Safety and Environmental Performance
HSE has continued to be a top priority and performance has been good. 
Nevertheless, the Board considers that it must continue to be reviewed 
as a key concern area at Board level. The challenge of environmental 
performance, with substantial additional regulatory requirements,  
has grown and is receiving greater management focus. New KPIs are 
being developed and implemented across this area. The emphasis on 
the performance of both Venture and its contractors must remain high  
and a focus for senior management leadership.
Oil/Gas Balance
The risk here is that a product imbalance could introduce an undesirable 
skewing of risk in the business. Venture’s attitude to hydrocarbon type 
has so far been neutral, with the emphasis being on quality of deal in 
relation to building the portfolio and project quality for developments. 
The result of the outcomes of various projects now means that, based on 
the existing portfolio, the Company is heading towards a significant bias 
to gas production and reserves over the next few years. 
There are some specific risks in relation to gas. Firstly, with gas prices lagging 
oil as costs increase, there is a degree of margin pressure on gas. Secondly, 
gas infrastructure developments (including those between mainland 
Europe and the UK) together with increasing LNG capacity have created 
a degree of short term price uncertainty. It is our view that the market for 
gas – especially for power generation – will continue to grow in the medium 
term and that the major producers will continue to act rationally in their 
own economic interests. We remain convinced that, with proper care in the 
selection of projects, the gas market will remain profitable. We will, therefore, 
continue to evaluate all projects in relation to their value and profitability. 
Nevertheless, the potential for greater volatility in gas markets is recognised 
and will require continued focus with appropriate hedging policies and 
operational policies clearly geared to maximising profitability and value.
The Board is in agreement that appropriate processes and controls are  
in place to manage these risks effectively and will review the actions  
on a regular basis.
Risk Identification, Evaluation and Management
The process of identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the 
Company is continuous. The key procedures the Board have established 
with a view to providing effective internal control are as follows:
Management Structure
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for decision by the Board. 
Each Executive Director has a defined sphere of overall responsibility 
and can also act as part of the Executive of the Board on certain defined 
issues. The Executive team, made up of the Executive Directors and 
senior managers, meet formally on a bi-weekly basis to review current 
business matters, take decisions and identify any areas of concern.  
This group is supported by a broader group of lead managers.
Financial Authorities
The management structure is supported by a Financial Authorities 
schedule, which clearly specifies authority by role and type of expenditure 
across the organisation. This document is maintained on the Business 
Management System together with supporting processes and is owned 
by the Finance Director.
Quality and Integrity of Personnel
High quality personnel are essential to the control environment.  
The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high 
recruitment standards and the encouragement of personnel to identify 
and take responsibility for their own development training.
Identification of Business Risks
The Board is ultimately responsible for identifying the major business 
risks faced by the Group and for determining the appropriate course  
of action to manage those risks. However, each employee has an active 
role in identifying and communicating business risks within the Group. 
This involvement in identification and management of risk is encouraged 
through the annual risk review process. The Board also engages independent 
professional advice on risk assessment matters as required.
Budget and Business Plan
Each year the Board approves a budget, by month, plus a business plan 
for the next four years. 
This details the proposed work programme, production and financial 
performance indicators and incorporates sensitivity for factors such as 
commodity price and exchange rates. Performance is reported to the 
Board monthly with significant variances explained, key risks identified and 
forecasts updated. Executive management has a quarterly performance 
review meeting at which the business to date is reviewed and a plan going 
forward is assessed, with particular emphasis on delivery of that plan.
Investment Appraisal
Capital expenditure commitment is controlled by reference to the 
approved budget and authorisation levels. Capital or non-routine operating 
expenditure above specified levels requires standard documented 
proposals and evaluations to be submitted to the appropriate financial 
authority holder. Venture utilises its in-house expertise to implement 
rigorous review of all investment proposals at both peer and management 
levels. Increasingly this will be supplemented by the use of external 
expertise where this is appropriate. Performance is reported to the Board 
monthly with significant variances explained, key risks identified and 
forecasts updated. Complete technical, commercial, financial and legal 
due diligence work is carried out on potential asset and corporate 
acquisitions.
Monitoring of the Internal Control Systems
The Board has agreed reporting procedures to monitor key risk areas 
on an ongoing basis, including health and safety, legal and financial 
matters. An annual risk assessment review is completed and presented 
to the Board, which identifies key risks, the probability of these risks 
occurring, their impact if they do occur, the strategy for handling the risk, 
an assessment of the controls and procedures in place and actions being 
taken to manage risks. The assessment of risk is monitored throughout 
the year and formally reviewed once every quarter by management.
Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007

No material items for 2007 have been notified.
There is also a formal ‘whistle blowing’ policy that encourages anyone 
associated with Venture to bring forward any concerns in relation to its 
operation or reporting. The policy is widely communicated and provides 
a route of discussion direct to the Non-Executive Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. No items for 2007 have been notified.
The Board considers that, having undertaken the procedures outlined,  
it has monitored the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and 
that no significant failings or weaknesses were identified.
Communication with Shareholders
Investor interest in Venture continues to grow as the scale of our operations 
increases. This increased interest is being successfully addressed by an 
increasingly active investor relations programme, fronted mainly by the 
Company’s Executive Directors, and continued development of a wider 
range of communication channels. 
The Board continues to believe that effective communication with 
shareholders and other stakeholders is a critical competence for the 
Company and it therefore remains a high priority. 
Confidential feedback reports prepared by third parties after each results 
‘roadshow’ and Analyst Day are made available to the Board, as are all 
equity analyst research notes.
Venture maintains regular dialogue with all stakeholders through the 
formal channel of results presentations, stock market announcements, 
Annual Reports and Accounts, Interim Accounts and at the AGM.  
The Company also issues operational and trading updates prior to 
entering into closed periods and seeks to provide timely market 
guidance on production levels and trading as appropriate throughout 
the year. The Company conducts investor ‘roadshows’, during which 
senior management meet face-to-face with institutional shareholders, 
immediately after each results announcement. In addition, a large 
number of ad hoc shareholder meetings are held during the year, 
organised either through the Company’s joint brokers or in response  
to direct requests from institutional fund managers. 
The Company also maintains a less formal dialogue with shareholders 
through regular two-way communication with a growing number of 
equity research analysts, fund managers and private client stockbrokers. 
Private investors continue to be encouraged to communicate directly 
with the Company and the corporate website has been designed to 
provide detailed information on Venture’s assets, as well as including a 
dedicated investor relations section. Shareholders and other interested 
parties can subscribe to receive Company specific news updates by 
email by registering online on the website, and contact details are also 
provided on the website whereby specific queries can be emailed 
directly to the Company. 
During January 2008 the Company held its annual Analyst Day at 
which senior management gave a series of presentations on various 
aspects of the Company’s business. Equity research analysts and major 
institutional shareholders were invited to attend and the full Venture 
senior management team were available for questions. A copy of the 
presentation materials has been made available to all stakeholders 
via the corporate website. It is Venture’s policy to publish all such 
presentations on the website at the same time as they are given live.
The Company’s communication programme, aimed specifically at 
private client stockbrokers, regional pension funds and smaller financial 
institutions, has proved successful and will be maintained. During 2007, 
this programme was extended to target medium-sized institutions not 
currently serviced through the Company’s joint brokers. 
Amongst larger institutions, Venture has also seen increased  
international interest, particularly from North America and Europe, and 
efforts to target these institutions have increased. During 2007 and 
early 2008, management made trips to the United States, Canada and 
Continental Europe to meet with investors for the second year running, 
and it is intended that this will become a regular feature in the annual 
investor relations programme going forward. In addition, management 
schedule a conference call for US and European institutions as part of 
each results ‘roadshow’.
Investors are encouraged to attend and participate in the AGM at which, 
in addition to the formal business of the meeting, the Chief Executive 
provides a review of the most recent results and commentary on current 
business development and activity. The Chairmen of each of the Board 
Committees are available at the AGM to answer any shareholder questions. 
The SID is also specifically available to meet with shareholders to discuss 
any concerns either at the AGM or through other channels, and at other 
times if deemed more appropriate. The full Board of Directors attends 
the AGM.

Venture Production plc 44 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Directors’ Remuneration Report
Part I – Unaudited Information
This report was prepared by the Remuneration Committee and has been 
approved by the Board of Directors.
Throughout 2007, the Committee comprised its Chairman Alan Jones, 
John Morgan, Mark Nicholls and Tom Blades.
The Board believes that it is entirely appropriate for the Board Chairman  
to serve on this Committee, so long as he does not chair it. The Committee 
met five times during the year and members attendance is shown 
on page 38. These meetings were supplemented by four minuted 
conference calls.
Although not members of the Committee, Mike Wagstaff and Jon Murphy 
attended some of the Committee meetings during the year, by invitation, 
but were not involved in discussions relating to their own remuneration.
Terms of Reference
The terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed and amended, 
as necessary, on an annual basis and at the review carried out in January 
2008 a minor amendment was made in order to bring them up to date 
with best practice. The terms of reference ensure that the Committee is 
focused on developing and managing a remuneration policy which will 
attract and retain high quality Executive Directors and motivate them 
by aligning their interests with those of the shareholders. This is done by 
linking a significant proportion of their reward to the achievement  
of corporate and individual performance objectives.
These terms also require the Committee to review and determine the 
level and structure of remuneration provided to the senior management 
team, as well as the overall remuneration policy for all the employees.
Committee Evaluation
In January 2008, the Committee carried out an evaluation of its 
performance during 2007 in accordance with the Combined Code. 
The evaluation had previously been carried out using questionnaires 
completed by the Committee members. However, it was decided that 
for 2007 an evaluation would be carried out at a specially convened 
meeting and the process was led by the Chairman. 
A number of recommendations were made including:
•	 A d d i t i o n a l	t i m e	b e	a l l o c a t e d	a t	e a c h	B o a r d	M e e t i n g	f o r	t h e

Advice to the Committee
During 2007, the Committee continued to receive information and 
advice from the consulting firm MM & K Limited (MM & K). In particular, 
advice has been received concerning the following:
•	 R e m u n e r a t i o n	f o r	E x e c u t i ve	D i r e c t o r s	i n	b r o a d l y	s i m i l a r	c o m p a n i e s .

to the treatment of leavers.
•	 T h e	p r e p a r a t i o n	o f	t h i s	r e p o r t .
In addition, in January 2007 , a trading division of MM & K, The Share Option 
Centre, was engaged to provide co-ordinated administration services 
for all Venture share schemes. MM & K is not retained to provide advice 
to any other part of the Company other than in supporting Executive 
management from time to time in the formulation of recommendations 
concerning policy interpretation for consideration by the Committee. 
From January 2008, Global Shares have been engaged to take over the 
administration of the Company’s share schemes and MM & K have no 
further involvement in this process.
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors,  
Management and General Staff
The underlying remuneration policy applicable to all employees is to 
position base salaries at or around the median level for comparable 
positions in similar companies within the industry. This policy has been 
established for a number of years. The Committee continues to believe 
that this is the correct strategy going forward, but reviews it on a regular 
basis to ensure that it remains appropriate, especially in changing market 
conditions. The base salary is supplemented by a number of additional 
mutually consistent non-pensionable schemes which have been designed 
to reward Executive Directors, managers and employees alike for 
their performance against challenging objectives, both personal and 
corporate, which support long term growth of the Company and focus 
strongly on long term value creation.
All employees are entitled to join a Share Incentive Plan (SIP), after an 
initial six month qualification period. Additionally, Executive Directors 
and a small number of key senior managers have been invited to 
participate in the Long Term Share Incentive Plan (LTIP 2006), which was 
introduced in June 2006 to replace the Long Term Share Incentive Plan 
(LTIP 2003) which matured on 31 December 2006.
The annual bonus arrangements for Executive Directors and senior 
managers were considered by the Committee in 2004 to establish 
a more structured framework for determining bonuses, which 
demonstrate clear linkages between short term performance and 
reward. These considerations led to the introduction, following approval 
at the AGM in 2005, of the Annual Deferred Share Bonus Plan (ADSBP)  
for key senior management.
Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 45 Directors’ Remuneration Report
continued
In 2006, the Committee agreed to introduce a similar scheme for the 
remainder of the organisation. The new scheme was designed to provide 
substantial benefits by establishing a clear and consistent framework to 
link performance and reward, with a clear balance between personal  
and corporate objectives. 
The Committee further considered that such a scheme could provide 
a strong recruitment and retention mechanism in a market which 
was becoming increasingly competitive. These considerations led to 
the introduction of the Employee Annual Bonus Plan (EABP), which 
extended throughout the organisation an opportunity to take annual 
bonuses in shares. The EABP is considered by the Committee to be 
another beneficial step in aligning employee interests with those of the 
shareholders.
Under the EABP , targets are set for both corporate and personal 
performance, with employees being able to take up to 35% of base 
salary as cash. Any bonus in excess of 35% of salary must be deferred. 
Participants may also elect to defer bonus. Deferred bonus is increased 
by 50% and converted into shares which are released after two years, 
subject to continued employment. For the purposes of the EABP , shares 
are bought in the market and held by Venture Employee Benefit Trust 
(EBT) pending release. 
Following a review of the Company’s annual bonus plans, the Committee 
has decided to consolidate the ADSBP and the EABP . This consolidation, 
which took effect from 1 January 2008, will enable ADSBP participants 
to receive a greater proportion of any annual bonus award in cash. 
The consolidation should also simplify the Company’s annual bonus 
arrangements. Maximum individual bonus awards are not affected by 
these changes, the implementation of which does not require formal 
shareholder approval.
Following the AGM in 2006, the LTIP 2006 was implemented for Executive 
Directors and senior management as a replacement for the successful 
LTIP 2003. The LTIP 2006 was designed to retain and motivate key 
Executives in line with the current strategic plan.
The LTIP 2006 scheme has the following objectives:
•	 T o	i m p l e m e n t	a	f o l l o w - o n	l o n g	t e r m	s c h e m e	t o	e n s u r e	t h a t	t o t a l

the shareholders.
Allocations have been made on an annual basis within the rules of 
the scheme and as referred to later in this report, a proposal is to be 
submitted to shareholders at the 2008 AGM to replace the LTIP 2006.
Maximum share award levels as a percentage of base annual salary are:
Chief Executive 300%
Executive Directors 250%
Senior Management 200%
The whole of the award is distributable only if Exceptional performance 
is achieved in respect of all performance measures. The distribution and 
weightings applicable to each of the four performance target measures 
are as follows:
 Threshold Target Exceptional
 
Production (boepd) 12.5% 18.75% 25.0%
Reserves (MMboe) 12.5% 18.75% 25.0%
Comparative TSR 7.5% 11.25% 15.0%
Venture’s Annualised TSR 17.5% 26.25% 35.0%
Distribution of share award 50.0% 75.0% 100.0%
The LTIP 2006 embraces the following principles:
•	 T h e	p l a n	o p e r a t e s	ove r	t h r e e	y e a r	r o l li n g	p e r f o r m a n c e	c y c l e s ,

of strategic business goals.
When the LTIP 2006 was implemented, the Committee acknowledged 
that the comparator group for measurement of TSR performance was 
small. This situation has been kept under review by the Committee, 
whose view remains that there is only a small number of comparably 
sized companies with similar business models operating in the oil and 
gas sector.
Summary of Policy Issues
The changes made over the preceding years to the Company’s 
remuneration policies, described above, reflect the Committee’s  
desire to take a consistent approach throughout the organisation.  
The Committee has determined to adhere to the principles of  
median base salaries supplemented by focused incentive awards  
related to annual performance and long term value creation.
Venture Production plc 46 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 The Committee continues to believe that a long term equity incentive, 
linked to challenging transparent targets designed to reward value 
creation, is a vital component of Executive Directors’ remuneration. 
The Committee also believes that the changes introduced in recent 
years, together with the proposed new LTIP , provide a comprehensive 
framework for delivery and retention, with excellent alignment between 
staff and shareholder interests.
The Committee will continue to review all remuneration policies and 
practices to ensure they remain consistent with good industry practice.
Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Reporting Principles
The Committee has decided to continue with the principle of reporting 
awards made in respect of the reporting year even though these may 
not be received until the following year or later.
Base Salary
Following advice from MM & K, increases ranging from 2.5% to 21% were 
recommended by the Remuneration Committee in March 2008 to bring 
Executive Director salaries generally in line with the stated policy of 
paying at the median level.
Base salaries will be increased from 1 April 2008 as follows:
 
MJ Wagstaff Chief Executive £400,000
JD Murphy Chief Operating Officer £250,000
PA Turner Finance Director £230,000
RM Begbie Corporate Development Director £230,000
None of the Executive Directors holds any other directorships in listed 
companies. However, the Committee has determined that an Executive 
Director may receive any fees for acting as a director of another company, 
subject to Board approval. 
Awards to be Paid in 2008 or Later in Respect of  
2007 Performance
The Annual Deferred Share Bonus Plan
The ADSBP was applied for the full year with the following objectives:
•	 A li g n m e n t	o f	t h e	r e m u n e r a t i o n	o f	E x e c u t i ve s	a n d	s e n i o r	m a n a g e r s

•	 A li g n m e n t	o f	i n t e r e s t s	w i t h	t h o s e	o f	s h a r e h o l d e r s .
Bonus awards are made on the achievement of both corporate and 
personal objectives, using an equal weighting for each, with bonus 
potential a defined percentage of base salary.
Threshold, Target and Exceptional performance levels are set for each 
element of the corporate objectives and the maximum award payable 
under the ADSBP for Exceptional performance is 150% of base salary for 
Executive Directors and 112.5% for senior management. The relevant 
bonus award is converted into shares and held on behalf of participants 
by the EBT for two years from the date of award after which they are 
released to participants, subject to continued employment. 
Participants have an option to receive an award in cash but the award 
value is then reduced by one third.
The corporate objectives and their weightings for 2007, for each of the 
performance levels, were:

The Committee conducted a detailed review of performance in 2007 
in respect of both corporate and personal objectives. The latter were 
focused on issues considered by the Board to be important to address, 
but lay outside the normal business objectives or deemed necessary 
for the long term prosperity of the organisation and its ability to grow. 
The Remuneration Committee also took a subjective view of the way 
management dealt with difficult operational issues which arose during 
the year.
It was noted that 2007 had been a challenging year, during which the 
strong underlying performance of the Company’s asset base had been 
overshadowed by the impact of a number of extraneous events which 
resulted in average net daily production for 2007 of 41,228. At the year 
end, net proven and probable reserves were estimated to total 203.0 
million barrels of oil equivalent (including Trinidad) which was 8.4% 
below the 2006 outturn.

released in April 2010. 
As at the date of this report no election had been made by the Executive 
Directors in respect of the choice between cash and shares.
*Pro-rata from date of appointment to Board.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
The Committee has decided that corporate performance objectives 
must be achieved to justify an award of Free Shares, up to a maximum 
value of £3,000 for each participating employee. 
The Committee’s view was that the level of corporate performance 
achieved in 2007 represented 66.6% of the target resulting in an allocation 
of SIP Free Shares to the value of £2,000 to each participating employee.
Long Term Share Incentive Plan (2003)
As stated above, the LTIP 2003 matured on 31 December 2006 and 
resulted in an award of 125.8% of Target performance. Accordingly  
the following share awards were made to the Executive Directors  
on 30 May 2007:
MJ Wagstaff 1,258,000
JD Murphy 1,006,400
M-L Clayton 503,200

The Committee supports the Board’s recommendation that the LTIP 
2006 be replaced by a new LTIP linked directly to the Company’s 
strategic plans for the next three to four financial years. A resolution is  
to be considered at the AGM in May 2008. Details of the proposed new 
LTIP can be found in the Notice of AGM. 
Venture Production plc 48 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 The Venture Production Company Limited Unapproved  
Share Option Plan
It was the Company’s policy to promise to grant share options to new 
employees on joining the Company and at subsequent specified dates. 
The nature of the promises varied depending upon whether the date of 
joining was before or after 1 April 2001. If the date of joining was before 
1 April 2001, the promise was either a Tranche 1 promise (conditional 
upon remaining in employment at the proposed date of grant) or a 
Tranche 2 promise (conditional upon remaining in employment and on 
the attainment of corporate performance targets at the proposed date 
of grant). Employees receiving a Tranche 1 promise were granted options 
on the date on which they joined the Company and then subsequently 
on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the joining date. 
Employees receiving a Tranche 2 promise were due to receive options 
subject to the attainment of corporate performance targets for the 
financial years ending 31 December 2001, 2002 and 2003. Grants were 
then made on 1 April following the end of the financial year and on the 
relevant anniversaries of that date, subject to the employee continuing 
in employment.
Employees joining the Company on or after 1 April 2001 were promised 
a grant of options conditional upon the attainment of corporate 
performance targets as set by the Committee. In each case, the 
e m p l o y e e	w a s	g r a n t e d	o p t i o n s	o n	h i s / h e r	d a t e	o f	j o i n i n g	w i t h	a	p r o m i s e	
of further awards on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of 
the joining date subject to remaining in employment. Options remain 
exercisable for ten years from the date of grant, not the date of promise. 
Consequently, as the last Tranche 2 promises were granted in 2006, they 
will remain exercisable until 2016.
No options were awarded to the Executive Directors under this plan  
in 2007.
The Venture Production plc 2002 Employee Share Option Scheme
The scheme has both HMRC approved and unapproved sections (A & B 
respectively).
Awards of options under Section A of the scheme are made at the 
discretion of the Committee and at market value at the date of grant.
The targets are established by the Committee and the subsequent level 
of awards is decided and approved by the Committee following a review 
of performance. Options cannot be exercised more than ten years after 
the date of grant. Grants will be limited to £30,000 worth of ordinary 
shares per employee, calculated by reference to the market value of the 
Company’s ordinary shares at the time the options are granted.
Awards of options under Section B are subject to rules which are broadly 
similar to those applying to Section A. However, limits are set such that 
no individual shall be awarded options if the aggregate value of all 
options or participation in any other employee share scheme operated 
by the Company in the 12 month period preceding the proposed date  
o f	g r a n t	e x c e e d s	4 0 0 %	o f	h i s / h e r	a n n u a l	r e m u n e r a t i o n	a t	t h e	t i m e	o f	 
the proposed grant.
The Board exercised the power conferred by the rules of the Scheme to 
increase the limit on the amount of options which may be granted to an 
individual from 200% to 400% of base annual salary. The Board’s decision 
to increase the limit was made to facilitate the grant of options over 
60,000 shares at 775.0 pence per share to Peter Turner in connection with 
his appointment as Finance Director under Section B. 
Share Acquisitions
The Company has an ongoing policy whereby it funds the EBT monthly 
to make market purchases of shares in order to satisfy the requirements 
of the various share-based incentive schemes.
A regular review is carried out to ensure that the EBT has sufficient shares 
to cover its contingent liabilities.
Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
Remuneration for the services of Non-Executive Directors is set by 
reference to practice in comparable companies. Fees payable to 
individual Directors reflect the time commitment each Director is 
expected to make to the Company, bearing in mind any representation 
on or chairmanship of Board Committees.
The annual fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors in office at the 
year end, were as follows:
JC Morgan  £75,000
MP Nicholls £50,000
AM Jones  £45,000
T Blades  £35,000
T Ehret  £35,000
LW Kinch  £15,000
RE Turner  £15,000*
GD Sword  £15,000 †
* Fees payable to ArcLight Energy Partners
† Fees payable to 3i plc
There were no increases in the fees payable to the Non-Executive 
Directors during 2007 and the next review will take place in 2008.
Service Contracts and Letters of Appointment
The Company’s policy is that service contracts of Executive Directors 
should have notice periods of six months, but it recognises that for future 
external appointments a longer initial period might be required. In that 
event, the notice period would reduce to six months after a set period. 
Each Executive Director has a rolling one year service contract and each 
is subject to six months’ notice at any time. Mike Wagstaff entered into a 
contract on 5 May 2005, Jon Murphy on 11 March 2002, Peter Turner on  
7 November 2007 and Rod Begbie on 3 July 2007.
In the event that an Executive Director’s employment is terminated as 
a result of a change in control of the Group, or if he or she is required 
to take an alternative non-equivalent position within six months of a 
change in control, then this will be deemed to be constructive dismissal

Marie-Louise Clayton
Marie-Louise Clayton resigned as a Director of the Company with 
effect from 6 December 2007 and the service agreement between the 
Company and Ms Clayton was terminated by mutual agreement on  
31 December 2007. 
When Ms Clayton first indicated her intention to leave, she agreed to 
remain with the Company for about eight months until 1 November 
2007 (Ms Clayton’s service agreement provided for not less than six 
months’ notice of termination). In return, the Committee agreed to  
make the following payments on or about the termination date,  
subject to deductions for income tax and National Insurance 
contributions where applicable: 
•	 A	t e r m i n a t i o n	p a y m e n t	o f	£ 1 6 0 , 0 0 0 ,	r e p r e s e n t i n g	e i g h t	m o n t h s ’

into Ms Clayton’s personal pension plan.
In addition, it was agreed that Ms Clayton would receive the deferred 
share portion of the bonus awarded to her in respect of the year ended  
31 December 2006 (amounting to 41,848 shares) together with a cash 
payment of £16,739, representing the special dividend, equivalent to  
40.0 pence per share, paid in respect of those shares. 
Ms Clayton is also eligible for a cash bonus of £177,996 in respect of her 
performance for the year ended 31 December 2007.
By the beginning of October, the Company had not selected a successor 
to Ms Clayton as Group Finance Director and it was agreed that, in return 
for an additional payment of £50,000, Ms Clayton would remain with the 
Company until the year end. Ms Clayton has also agreed to be available,  
if requested by the Board, to attend meetings after the year end, 
including meetings concerning the preparation of the 2007 Annual 
Report and Accounts of the Company.

The graph shows the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for Venture 
Production plc against the TSR for the Financial Times Stock Exchange 
(FTSE) 250 index and the TSR for the FTSE All Share Oil and Gas Producers. 
The Committee believes the FTSE All Share Oil and Gas Producers to 
be the most appropriate index with which to compare the Company’s 
performance, as it includes many of the companies against which 
the Company directly competes and which are included in the same 
comparator group when determining median base salary levels.

Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 53 “Our aim is to cause no harm to people  
or the environment. We consider HSE 
management as an integral part of our 
business and our duty as a corporate 
citizen. We believe that the discipline 
needed and the motivation that inevitably 
results from achieving and maintaining 
high HSE standards will contribute 
directly to the commercial success of  
the Company.”
Jon Murphy 
Our Approach
Our approach to corporate social responsibilities reflects our culture 
– direct, disciplined and commercially focused. We recognise that we 
have an impact on our environment, on the working lives of our people 
and on our local communities. Equally important, the way in which we 
conduct our business has a direct impact on our reputation and our 
licence to operate. 
We believe in working closely with other members of our industry to 
build a pragmatic legislative framework. Jon Murphy is a Board member 
of Oil and Gas UK, the organisation that represents the UK offshore oil 
and gas industry to government and regulatory bodies. Jon is also the 
Board Director with responsibility for Health, Safety and the Environment. 
Venture is a leading member of the Southern North Sea Environmental 
Forum, an informal network that Venture established and which enables 
its 23 members to share information on environmental studies and  
other issues. 
In Holland, Hans Versteeg (Operations Director) represented Venture 
Production Nederland BV on, and was Vice-Chairman of the Executive 
Committee of, NOGEPA, the organisation that represents the oil and gas 
companies operating in the Netherlands.
As a successful oil and gas production business Venture creates jobs, 
designs and implements new technology, returns profits to shareholders 
and through employment, expenditure in the community and taxation 
contributes to the economic health of the nation. Venture adapts to 
change whilst investing for the long term and recognises the need to 
extract oil and gas in the safest and most environmentally responsible 
and efficient way. We recognise that there are a variety of perspectives 
existing with regard to our industry and we encourage regular 
engagement with a broad range of stakeholders.
Keeping Our People Safe
Our integrated Health, Safety and Environmental policy is approved at 
Board level and is signed by both Mike Wagstaff, Chief Executive and Jon 
Murphy, Chief Operating Officer. The Board regularly challenge the policy 
and require performance reports and evidence to demonstrate that we  
are keeping people safe and managing environmental issues responsibly. 
The policy is the foundation of our HSE management system, underpinning 
our continuous improvement process and driving our targets.
Although the majority of our employees work in our Aberdeen head 
office or our Dutch office in Hoofddorp, our operations involve many 
people working offshore on behalf of Venture on our production 
installations and on our contracted drilling rigs. 
We include all of our employees and contractors in our measurement  
of lost time injury frequency rates (LTIFR). In 2007 nearly 1.5 million  
man-hours were worked across our licence blocks with a LTIFR of 1.3 
(2006: 0.8). The industry average is around 3.5. During 2007 there were 
only two minor finger injuries, one on our Markham J6A platform and 
one on a contracted drilling rig.
Managing Our Environmental Impact
We work hard to mitigate any negative effects that our operations 
may have on the environment, balancing the challenges of a growing 
business, increasing regulatory pressures and a keen desire to minimise 
any impact our activities have upon the environment. We constantly 
review the ramifications of meeting regulatory changes. All our projects 
are subjected to a rigorous environmental assessment and all applications 
to the Regulator made in 2007 were approved.
Emissions to air and discharges to sea are all now strictly regulated 
through detailed permits and allowances. As these levels reduce and 
our business expands, we anticipate that to allow compliance with these 
permits we will increasingly be purchasers in the various trading schemes. 
Performance
Managing our environmental performance in order to deliver continuous 
improvement is key to the organisation. Communicating our performance 
to key stakeholders is also an essential component of a fully functioning 
Environmental Management System (EMS).
In the UK the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform 
(DBERR) requires that all operators have an EMS that is accredited to  
ISO 14001 or registered to the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), 
or which has been externally verified as meeting the requirements of 
an international standard. Furthermore, all operators must produce an 
annual statement by 1 June each year which includes a description 
of the operator’s environmental policy, goals, objectives and targets. 
The report, which must be available to the public, will also include a 
summary of performance in relation to the aforementioned policy,  
goals, objectives and targets. Venture’s EMS was externally verified in 
2006 and the 2007 report to DBERR will be made before the middle of 2008.
The Company’s Dutch operations are subject to agreements made under 
the Dutch environmental covenant. This lays down specific environmental 
tasks and aims for the Dutch oil and gas industry as a whole. In response 
to the requirements of the covenant, the Company produces an annual 
environmental plan which summarises its performance against these 
objectives. This annual plan is published in May. 
In addition, existing regulations concerning oil in produced water and 
atmospheric emissions requires discharge and emission data for the 
previous calendar year to be verified by an accredited auditor by the  
end of the first quarter. This exercise ensures that the data submitted  
to various trading schemes is accurate. 
Corporate and Social Responsibility
Venture Production plc 54 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 With these dates in mind, a report of Venture’s corporate environmental 
performance will therefore be made available in May 2008, when it will be 
posted for viewing on the Company website (www.venture-production.com). 
Notwithstanding the above, some of the key issues in 2007 are 
summarised below:
•	 W e	e x p e r i e n c e d	o n e	m a j o r	o i l	sp i l l	i n	A p r i l	f o l l o w i n g	a n	i n c i d e n t

currently under review by the regulator.

and in 2008 we will be implementing our Carbon Management Strategy.

part of an ongoing awareness programme to ensure that staff are  
kept up to date with legislative changes, the latest EU directives, 
changes in Government policy and best practice initiatives.
People
Maintaining a strong Company culture and clear values is particularly 
important for a fast-growing organisation like Venture that operates 
in a tight labour market. Open consultations on how our core values 
– people, communication, action – are operating in practice, take 
place periodically and help identify any changes required in working 
conditions. ‘Town Hall’ or open forum meetings, attended by everyone 
in the Company and hosted by the Chief Executive, are used to 
communicate progress, discuss issues and talk about future plans.
Community
We believe our employees are our strongest link with our local 
communities. It is through encouraging our employees voluntary  
efforts that we will support those communities.
In May we put in place a formal social investment policy that promotes 
employee involvement in community initiatives, backed by an ‘Employee 
Matched Funding Scheme’ where Venture will match the money raised 
on approved projects. 
Getting Involved
Five teams (some 20 people) entered the gruelling Caledonian 
Challenge, walking 54 miles within 24 hours from Fort William to  
Loch Lomond and raising in the region of £40,000 for charity.
Over a third of our Aberdeen based staff competed against 40 other 
local companies in a Corporate Decathlon – ten events spread over the 
year – including a Highland Games finale – raising funds for the Scottish 
charity, Children 1st.
We also supported an innovative funding scheme put forward by one of 
our key contractors for four of its sites. Performance against HSE targets

Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 55 We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements  
(the financial statements) of Venture Production plc for the year ended  
31 December 2007 which comprise the Group Income Statement,  
the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent 
Company Cash Flow Statements, the Group and Parent Company 
Statements of Recognised Income and Expenses and the related notes. 
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has 
been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no 
other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom  
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements  
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given 
in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. 
The information given in the Directors’ Report includes the specific 
information presented in the Business and Operational Review and 
Financial Review that is cross-referred from the Business Review section 
of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has  
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all  
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration  
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined Code 
(2003) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to 
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks 
and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s 
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider 
whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other 
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the 
Operating and Financial Review and the Corporate Governance Report. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the 
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information 
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to  
be audited.

Venture Production plc 62 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1. Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007
Basis of Preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union (EU) and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 1985, applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments). A summary of the more important 
Group accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of 
new accounting standards in the year.
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at 
the date of the financial statements and the reporting amount of income and expenses during the year. Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
During the year, the Group has reclassified all costs relating to unsuccessful exploration activities to a separate line item on the face of the income 
statement. Comparative figures have been restated as a result of this reclassification. Additionally, the fair values provisionally accounted for on the 
acquisition of CH4 during 2006 have been finalised in the year and this has resulted in a restatement of prior year comparatives.
Consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of 
more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered 
when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group. They are de-consolidated from the date on which control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair 
value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded 
as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the 
income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated as part of the consolidation 
process. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies  
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Critical Estimates and Judgements
The main estimates made by the Group included decommissioning estimates, estimates of future capital expenditures used in the calculation of 
depreciation, depletion and amortisation (DD&A) and hydrocarbon reserve estimates. See accounting policy on each item for further information.
The main judgements made by the Group included the forecasts and assumptions used in the impairment review of non-financial assets,  
tax provisioning and deferred tax asset recognition. See accounting policy on these items for further information.
Investments in Associates
The Group’s investments in its associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These are entities in which the Group has significant 
influence and which are neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. The financial statements of the associates are used by the Group to apply the equity 
accounting method. The reporting dates of the associates and the Group are identical and all use consistent accounting policies.
The investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associates, 
less any impairment in value. The income statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the associates. 
Joint Ventures
The Group is engaged in oil and gas development and production through incorporated and unincorporated joint ventures. The Group accounts for  
its share of the results and net assets of these joint ventures as jointly controlled assets.
In addition where the Group acts as operator to the joint venture, the gross liabilities and receivables (including amounts due to or from non-operating 
partners) of the joint venture are included in the Group consolidated balance sheet. 
Notes to the Financial Statements
Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 63 1. Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007 (continued)
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from sales of oil and natural gas is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred, which is when title 
passes to the customer. For oil and natural gas, this generally occurs when product is physically transferred into a vessel, pipe or other delivery mechanism.
Revenue resulting from the production of oil and natural gas properties in which Venture has an interest with other producers is recognised on the 
basis of Venture’s working interest (entitlement method). Consequently, for sales in respect of oil liftings sold, adjustments for overlift (liftings greater 
than production entitlement) and underlift (production entitlement greater than liftings) are recorded against cost of sales at market value.
Tariff revenue from the use of the Group’s platform and pipeline facilities is recognised when products are physically transferred into a vessel, pipe  
or other delivery mechanism.
Segmental Reporting
Segmental reporting follows the Group’s internal reporting structure, and accordingly, its primary segment reporting is by business segment.  
A business segment is engaged in providing products within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that are different  
from those segments operating in other economic environments. In the opinion of the Directors, the operations of the Group comprise two classes  
of business, oil production and gas production. 
Foreign Currency Translation
(a) Functional and Presentation Currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the Company’s functional 
and presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and Balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.  
Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash  
flow hedges.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the closing rate.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired 
subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Separately recognised goodwill is tested 
annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses  
on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs or groups of CGUs 
that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Expenditure
Oil and gas exploration and development expenditure is accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
Expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area is expensed immediately to the income statement.
Notes to the Financial Statements
continued
Venture Production plc 64 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Expenditure directly associated with an exploration well is capitalised on a licence by licence basis. Costs are held, un-depleted, on the balance sheet 
under exploration assets, until the success or otherwise of the well has been established. Costs will continue to be held as an asset if the results indicate 
that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial. All such carried costs are subject to technical, 
commercial and management review at least once a year to confirm the intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery. When this is 
no longer the case, the costs are written off. When proved reserves are determined and development is sanctioned, the relevant costs are transferred  
to development and producing assets.
Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, 
is capitalised within development and producing assets on a field by field basis.
Upon commencement of production, these costs are amortised on a unit of production basis that is calculated on budgeted capital expenditure and 
proven and probable reserves.
Property, Plant and Equipment
All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation,  
the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if any, and for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. The purchase price or construction cost is the 
aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group, and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance 
are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost less their residual values over their estimated useful lives, 
as follows:
Plant and machinery 10–33%
Office equipment 25%

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying amount is written 
down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation 
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment 
loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s net realisable value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which 
there are separately identifiable cash flows. These CGUs are aligned to the business unit and sub-business unit structure that the Group uses to manage 
its business. Cash flows are discounted in determining the value in use.

continued
1. Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007 (continued)
At each reporting date, where there are indicators of impairment, the net book value of the CGU is compared with the associated expected  
discounted future post-tax net cash flows. If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the income statement as impairment. 
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using forward curve pricing for the first five years and management’s view of the 
long term price thereafter. Cash flows are discounted to present value using a discount rate of 8%. Forecasted production profiles are determined on an 
asset by asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques.
Where there has been an impairment charge in an earlier period, that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a change in 
circumstances to the extent that the discounted future net cash flows are higher than the net book value at the time. In reversing impairment losses, 
the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or the carrying value that would have been determined  
(net of depletion) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
Deferred Consideration
Deferred consideration relates to the future cash consideration payable in respect of acquisitions which is contingent on the outcome of future events. 
When an acquisition agreement provides for an adjustment to the consideration contingent on future events, provision is made for that amount if the 
adjustment is probable and can be measured reliably. The amount provided is included in the cost of the acquisition. When the final amount payable  
is determined, or when revised estimates are made, the acquisition cost and provision are adjusted accordingly. Deferred consideration is recorded at  
its fair value. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and comprise oil in tanks and pipelines and materials. Cost values for stocks of oil  
are calculated using a weighted average cost for the year.
Under/Overlift
Lifting or offtake arrangements for oil and gas produced in certain of the Group’s jointly owned operations are such that each participant may not 
receive and sell its precise share of the overall production in each period. The resulting imbalance between cumulative entitlement and cumulative 
production less stock is ‘underlift’ or ‘overlift’. Underlift and overlift are valued at market value and included within debtors and creditors respectively. 
Movements during an accounting period are adjusted through cost of sales, such that gross profit is recognised on an entitlement basis. The Group’s 
share of any physical stock is accounted for at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Assets Held for Sale
Assets held for sale are stated at fair value on the basis that they are available for immediate sale in their present condition, subject only to terms that 
are usual and customary for sales of such assets and that the sale is highly probable at the balance sheet date.
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms  
of the receivables.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, bank overdrafts and deposits held at call with banks with maturity dates of less than three months. 
Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, 
net of tax, from the proceeds. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options, for the acquisition of a business, are included 
in the cost of acquisition as part of the purchase consideration. 
Dividends on ordinary shares are not recognised as a liability or charged to equity until they have been declared.
Venture Production plc 66 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued  
or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction 
costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
The Group is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). They have therefore, been 
consolidated in the financial statements of the Group. Shares acquired by and disposed of by the EBT are recorded at cost. The cost of shares held  
by the EBT is deducted from shareholders’ equity.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference 
between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings 
using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after 
the balance sheet date. 
Convertible Bonds
The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond. 
This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity. The remainder of the proceeds of the 
convertible bond represents the value of the equity conversion option and this component of the bond is recognised in shareholders’ equity.
Capitalised Interest
Interest is capitalised gross of related tax relief during the period of construction, where it relates either to the financing of major projects with long 
periods of development, or to dedicated financing of other projects. All other interest is charged against income. 
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.  
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature  
of the item being hedged. The Group designates derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception 
and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of 
hedged items. At the point of settlement, any payments or receipts relating to hedge transactions are included in revenue.
Cash Flow Hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, are recognised in equity net  
of deferred income tax. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity, including the associated deferred income taxes, are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the 
hedged item will affect profit or loss (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing 
in equity at that time remains in equity, and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a 
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income 
statement.
Derivatives that Do Not Qualify for Hedge Accounting
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Such derivatives are classified as at fair value through profit or loss, and changes  
in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 67 Notes to the Financial Statements

1. Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007 (continued)
Fair Value Estimation
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing parties, other 
than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest. Where available, market values are used to determine fair values. Where market values 
are not available, fair values are calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates. 
Taxation
The tax charge, including UK corporation tax and overseas corporate tax, represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Tax currently 
payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from the profit reported in the income statement due to items that are not 
taxable or deductible in any period and also due to items that are taxable or deductible in a different period. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Current UK Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) is charged as a tax expense on chargeable field profits included in the income statement and is deductible for 
UK corporation tax. Deferred PRT is provided for in full, using the effective PRT rate method.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities  
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset  
or liability in a transaction other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction effects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, 
it is not accounted for. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Operating Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.
Pension Costs
The Group pays contributions to personal pension schemes of employees, which are administered independently of the Group. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Share-Based Payments
The Group currently has various share-based payment schemes for its employees and Directors, details of which are given in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
The fair value of share-based awards is determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the effect of any market-based performance 
conditions. This fair value, adjusted by the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of key performance measures, 
is expensed uniformly over the vesting period. The corresponding credit is taken to the employee benefit reserve. The proceeds on exercise of share 
options are credited to share capital and share premium.
The fair values are calculated using a binomial option pricing model with suitable modifications to allow for employee turnover after vesting and early 
exercise. The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, risk free rate of interest 
and patterns of early exercise of the plan participants.
Decommissioning 
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full at the commencement of oil and natural gas production. The amount recognised is the present 
value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. A corresponding tangible fixed asset of 
an amount equivalent to the provision is also created. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production and transportation 
facilities. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the fixed asset. Unwinding  
of discount is treated as a finance cost.

Acquisition of WHAM Energy plc
On 12 November 2007, the Group acquired 100% of the voting shares of WHAM Energy plc (WHAM), a listed company based in the United Kingdom.
The total cost of the combination was £15,600,000 and comprised cash and an issue of equity instruments. The Group issued 1,065,464 ordinary shares 
with a fair value of £7.16 each, being the published price of the shares of Venture Production plc at the date of exchange.
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of WHAM as at the date of acquisition and the corresponding carrying amounts immediately 
before the acquisition are shown below. The fair value adjustments relate primarily to the recognition at fair value of the acquired interests in oil and 
gas assets and the impact of the adoption of Venture accounting policies. The impact of recognising deferred tax on the fair value of the assets and 
liabilities is to reduce the value of the net assets acquired and thereby increase the goodwill on acquisition.

Exploration costs written off relate to unsuccessful exploration activities where hydrocarbons were not encountered.
Development costs written off reflects the write-off of the original drilling investment in the Amanda field in 2003. 
 
During 2007, Venture commenced a major seismic reprocessing and interpretation study on the entire ‘Trees’ production hub, which will be completed 
during 2008. Whilst the analysis of the remaining potential in the southern part of the Sycamore development has not yet been completed, preliminary 
results of this study suggest that in the central part of the Sycamore field there is limited re-investment opportunity. Accordingly, an impairment charge 
of £24,500,000 has been made, reducing the carrying value of the Sycamore field to its value in use. Analysis will be finalised upon completion of further 
technical work on this development during 2008. Impairment of assets also includes a write-down of £8,963,000 of the appraisal oil well on the Pilot 
field, which was drilled in 2007 and produced heavy oil with higher viscosity than expected.

9. Earnings Per Ordinary Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the EBT and treasury shares.
     2007 2006
Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company (£’000)     48,175 81,593
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (thousands)    135,479 126,565
Basic earnings per share (pence per share)     35.6 64.5
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. The Company has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: convertible debt and share options. 
The convertible debt is assumed to have been converted into ordinary shares and the net profit is adjusted to eliminate the interest expense and the 
unwinding of discount on convertible debt less the tax effect. For the share options, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that 
could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value  
of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.

Additions during the year relate to goodwill arising on the acquisition of WHAM (£4,406,000), and on the acquisition of NSGP (£940,000).
During the year, the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired as part of the CH4 acquisition were finalised. This has resulted in the recognition of a 
deferred PRT liability of £1,141,000 and an additional deferred income tax liability of £3,589,000. The impact of the above was to increase goodwill arising 
on the acquisition by £4,730,000 to £46,517,000. The 2006 comparatives have been restated to reflect this.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently, if there are any indications that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill acquired 
through business combinations is allocated, at acquisition, to CGUs, that are expected to benefit from that business combination. 
As noted above, the main element of goodwill relates to the acquisition in 2006 of CH4. Impairment tests for CH4 are carried out based on future cash 
flows of GMA.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. These calculations are based on the life of field models for the 
CGU. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding future production, oil and gas prices and operating costs. The discount 
rate used for the calculation was 8%.
14. Assets Classified as Held for Sale and Disposal Groups
On completion of the acquisition of CH4, the Group decided to dispose of its interest in NSIP (ETS) Limited to its associate company, North Sea 
Infrastructure Partners Limited. The disposal of the Group’s interest in the company occurred on 22 January 2007 (Note 5).
The net assets of NSIP (ETS) Limited classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2006 totalled £2,928,000 consisting of assets of £3,391,000  
(including cash of £1,003,000) and liabilities of £1,093,000.

The Group currently has various share-based payment schemes for its employees, details of which are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The charge in the Group and Company income statement for these schemes is £4,981,000 (2006: £10,169,000) of which £373,000 (2006: £5,612,000)

£614,000) related to the Employee Annual Bonus Plan and £499,000 (2006: £1,546,000) related to other schemes.
2003 Long Term Share Incentive Plan
5,303,771 shares were distributed to participants under this scheme on 30 May 2007.
2006 Long Term Share Incentive Plan
There are currently 14 employees participating in this scheme. 
The weighted average of the Group’s estimate of the proportion of awards that will vest under the three performance targets in 2007 is 75% (2006: 75%). 
This does not allow for failure to satisfy market-based performance conditions, as these are built into the fair value. Awards are provisional because they 
are dependent on the performance targets being met and also on continuing employment of the participants. All outstanding awards under the LTIP 
will vest after 31 December 2010, subject to all performance targets being met and the individuals remaining in employment.
In 2006, 828,323 shares were awarded under the 2006 LTIP with an average fair value of £5.03. 
2007 Long Term Share Incentive Plan
There are currently 14 employees participating in this scheme. For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the awards subject to market-based 
performance conditions, a Monte Carlo pricing model has been used. The share price volatility of 34% is based on the historical data of the Group.  
All outstanding awards under the LTIP will vest after 31 December 2011, subject to all performance targets being met and the individuals remaining  
in employment.
The risk free rate of return of 5.4% is based on the implied yield available on zero coupon gilts, with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime  
of the awards. A dividend yield of 0% is used in the calculation.
In 2007, 627,624 shares were awarded under the 2007 LTIP , with an average fair value of £5.06.

Annual Deferred Share Bonus Plan
Sixteen Executive Directors and senior managers are members of the 2007 ADSBP (2006: 14) which was first introduced in 2005. The scheme comprises 
both share and cash awards as individuals awarded bonuses under the ADSBP can elect to take a proportion of the bonus in cash and the remaining 
bonus as deferred shares.
Shares in respect of the 2007 award will be released on 6 April 2010 (2006: 6 April 2009). If the individual leaves before 6 April 2010 then the shares are 
forfeited. The estimated proportion of awards to be taken as shares and cash are 70% and 30% respectively (2006: 70% shares and 30% cash).
For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share-based awards, a binomial pricing model has been used. The share price volatility used of 34% 
(2006: 31%), the risk free rate of return of 5.6% (2006: 4.4%) and the dividend yield of 0% (2006: 0%) are derived in a consistent manner to those used for the 
2007 LTIP. The charge for awards to be taken in shares is calculated using a fair value of £103 per £100 of bonus to be taken as shares (2006: £105 per £100 of 
bonus).
Employee Annual Bonus Plan
All staff excluded from participation in the ADSBP are eligible to participate in the EABP. The scheme comprises both share and cash awards, as individuals 
awarded bonuses under the EABP can elect to take a proportion of the bonus in cash and the remaining bonus as deferred shares.
Shares in respect of the 2007 award will be released on 1 January 2010 (2006: 1 January 2009). The estimated proportion of awards to be taken as shares 
and cash are 50% and 50% respectively (2006: 30% shares and 70% cash).
For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share-based awards a binomial pricing model has been used. The share price volatility used of 34% 
(2006: 31%), the risk free rate of return of 5.6% (2006: 4.4%) and the dividend yield of 0% (2006: 0%) are derived in a consistent manner to those used for the 
2007 LTIP . The charge for awards to be taken in shares is calculated using a fair value of £103 per £100 of bonus to be taken as shares (2006: £105 per £100 of 
bonus).
Other Schemes
Details of the Group’s other share-based plans are included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

These decommissioning costs are expected to be incurred in the period from 2008 to 2023. The provision has been based upon existing technology, 
current legislation requirements and discounted using a rate of 7.5% (2006: 7.5%). The estimated decommissioning costs and the pre-tax discount rate 
applied take into account the effects of inflation and risks and uncertainties concerning amounts to be settled in the future.
25. Financial Instruments
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for 
managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. 
Market Risk
Venture is exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign exchange and commodity prices. The Group actively monitors these exposures.  
To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments. 
The Group’s objective is to reduce, where it deems appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest 
rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices. It is the Group’s policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures. 
The Group expects that any loss in value for these instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
The Group uses the pound sterling as its reporting currency. As a result, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange movements, primarily in the 
US dollar and euro. Consequently, it enters into various contracts that reflect the changes in the value of foreign exchange rates to preserve the 
value of assets and commitments. In general, the Group’s revenues in crude oil sales are denominated in US dollars, while its gas sales revenues are 
denominated in pounds sterling. Where possible, the Group’s policy is to reduce significant exposures to movements in foreign currency exchange 
rates through hedging foreign currency exposure for up to 50% of forecast net US dollar revenues. Venture also uses forward contracts to hedge  
certain anticipated net revenues in foreign currencies. The Group marks to market these forward contracts and thus changes in the forward contract 
fair values are booked to the income statement and reverse in the income statement over the term of the contracts.
Overview of Our Business Accounts & Notes Governance Our Performance in 2007
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Venture Production plc 87 25. Financial Instruments (continued)
Net investments in foreign countries are long term investments. Their fair value changes through movements of currency exchange rates. In the very 
long term, however, the difference in the inflation rate should match the currency exchange rate movement, so that the market value of the foreign 
non-monetary assets will compensate for the change due to currency movements. For this reason, the Group does not hedge the net investments  
in foreign subsidiaries.

have been £5,151,000 lower (2006: £6,979,000 lower).
Commodity Price Risk
The Group has exposure to price risk related to anticipated revenues from crude oil and natural gas. A change in those prices may alter the gross margin 
of the Group. Accordingly, it enters into commodity futures, forward and option contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated revenues.
To manage commodity price risk and deliver stability to the investment programme, the Group’s policy is to allow hedging of commodity price 
exposure up to 50% of its oil and gas production. In exceptional circumstances and only with the prior approval of the Board, up to 75% of such 
production may be hedged. Hedges have been put in place with a variety of providers.
If the average gas price had been 10% higher or lower during 2007, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have been £4,365,000 higher or lower 
(2006: £5,670,000 higher or lower). 
If the average oil price had been 10% higher or lower during 2007, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have been £4,253,000 higher or lower 
(2006: £3,130,000 higher or lower). 
Interest Rate Risk
The Group manages its net exposure to interest rate risk through negotiating fixed rate financial debt in its financial debt portfolio. The Group has no 
exposure to variability in its cash flows due to interest rate risk as it borrows at rates of interest which are fixed in advance. At 31 December 2007, all of 
the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates (2006: 12%).
Credit Risk
Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk the Group periodically 
assesses the financial reliability of customers. The Group’s major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned 
by international credit rating agencies. The nominal value less impairment provision of trade accounts receivables and payables are assumed to 
approximate their fair value. The Group’s policy is to deal with customers with an ‘A’ rating or better where possible. At 31 December 2007, 100%  
(2006: 100%) of trade receivables were such customers.
The Group also has credit risk relating to cash held on deposit. The Group’s policy is to deposit cash at institutions with an ‘A’ rating or better where 
possible. 100% of the cash held on deposit at 31 December 2007 (2006: 100%) was held with such institutions.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. Liquidity, funding 
risks and related processes and policies are overseen by management. Venture manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis based on business 
needs and through numerous sources of finance in order to maintain flexibility.
Capital Risk
The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure with a diversified range of funding including equity, convertible bonds, bank debt 
and privately placed loan notes. The Group continually monitors its capital structure, to ensure this is in line with business needs, ongoing asset 
development and to fund potential future acquisitions. During the year, its borrowing base banking facility was replaced with a medium term 
committed corporate debt facility of £365,000,000, £151,000,000 was raised through the issue of 3.25% unsecured convertible bonds and a further 
$424,000,000 and £25,000,000 in a private placement of notes was secured with US and UK institutional investors. As a result, there are externally 
imposed covenant requirements with which the Group is fully compliant. These covenants include the ratio of borrowings to EBITDA and interest cover.

All of the derivative instruments used for the purposes of hedging the oil and gas prices are effective for hedge accounting purposes.
All of the hedging instruments used for anticipated transactions mature during 2008 and 2009, and were contracted with the intention of hedging 
anticipated transactions which are expected to occur in 2008 and 2009. The instruments are intended to hedge the commodity price risk arising from 
the highly probable forecast transactions with commodity price risk. 
The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the derivative instruments, previously deferred in equity, is recognised in the income statement 
within revenue when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
There has been no charge recognised in the year relating to ineffectiveness of derivates that are hedge accounted (2006: nil).
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of derivative financial instruments.

a monthly basis.

$2.0025 to £1.

We acquire, develop and bring into production 
discovered but undeveloped oil and gas fields in 
the North Sea with proven but untapped potential. 
Then we transform them into profitable assets.
As a major independent E&P company we also 
target 10–15% of our annual investment into lower 
risk North Sea exploration.
Over the past seven years we have grown the value 
of our business by more than 23 times and we 
have positioned ourselves to continue generating 
growing cash flow from the North Sea. Breathing new life  
into the North Sea

2009 Business Review Nautical Petroleum plc 02
The heavy oil discount to Brent has continued to narrow over the 
last year as heavy oil production declines in Mexico and 
Venezuela, reducing supply to the US and North West Europe 
markets.
In addition there are a number of large scale refinery modifications 
in Europe which are due to come on stream in 2010 and 2011. 
These are aimed at absorbing heavier oil at a time when supply of 
these oils is declining.
 
The UK production of heavy oil has been significant, mainly from 
Captain, Harding, and Alba, but these fields are also in decline, the 
most recent published figures indicate an annual drop of 20%.
The market for these UK heavy oils remains strong, specifically 
from specialist refiners. This is reflected in prices achieved for 
Alba, Captain and Harding. Both Captain and Harding have 
recently traded at a small premium to Brent. The specialist refiners 
in North West Europe are now looking further afield for supplies. 
Some cargoes from Australia are now finding homes here.
The heavy 
oil market
With interests in Kraken and Mariner, the location and specific  
oil qualities of these oils put us in a strong position to meet  
this demand.
We at Nautical Petroleum recognise the challenges that heavy oil 
presents from both a technical and marketing aspect. We 
understand the importance of early marketing and are working 
closely with the consumers to find solutions to maximise value for 
the Company.  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 03

Nautical Petroleum is pleased to report  
to Shareholders a further year of 
significant progress in the development  
of its asset portfolio. 
John Conlin
Chairman
Chairman’s 
statement
Nautical Petroleum is pleased to report to Shareholders a further 
year of significant progress in the development of its asset portfolio. 
This progress has however been tempered by a period driven 
primarily by the dramatic collapse in oil prices seen in the second 
half of 2008 and the onset of global recession. Our market 
capitalisation bottomed out at a value equivalent to our cash in 
hand, where it remained for some six months. Plainly at oil prices 
of around $40 per barrel, the market assigned no value to our 
portfolio of discovered hydrocarbons or our diverse exploration 
portfolio. Stimulated by the welcome fiscal boost from the 
Chancellor’s April 2009 budget announcement of the new Field 
Allowance’s for heavy oil fields, and subsequently by a recovery in 
oil price to levels above $70, the share price has stabilised to its 
current level. 
While short term oil prices trends can be very uncertain there is 
reasonable consensus that over the medium to long-term 
timeframe, prices will not drop below $70 per barrel for a sustained 
period, while the probability of further growth remains. 
Importantly for our future heavy oil production streams, the 
narrowing of the discount related to heavy oil is also a broadly 
accepted trend. 
With this commodity pricing backdrop, the potential value of 
Nautical’s interests in the successful development of Mariner and 
Kraken is still very heavily discounted but we are confident that 
increasing value will be attached to these assets once the 
respective Joint Ventures move these field developments into the 
execution phase. This therefore remains our top priority and key to 
this is the role of Statoil on Mariner. 
Mariner
Statoil’s strong commitment to the Mariner project, highlighted 
recently in the media and during the recent visit of its CEO to the 
UK, is greatly encouraging. Moreover their experience of 
developing heavy oil fields becomes increasingly visible in the 
diverse range of technical studies initiated by them to identify the 
optimal shape of a Mariner development.
As an example, Statoil has applied geophysical techniques proven in 
their successful Grane heavy oil field by acquiring two further 
seismic surveys during the period. These mark the first major 
operational activities on Mariner since the extended well test in 
1997. Both surveys have significantly improved our understanding of 
the Maureen and Heimdal reservoirs and we anticipate the improved 
imaging will be reflected in updated reservoir forecasting models 
early in 2010. All the signs are that the Mariner development is 
economically robust and moving inexorably forward to project 
sanction and Field Development Plan (FDP) submission in 2011 with 
first oil in 2015.
One consequence of the projected first oil date of 2015 is the 
decision to reclassify the Maureen hydrocarbons from reserves to 
contingent resources in line with industry best practice on 
resource definition. Based on updated estimates from the Operator 
Statoil, combined gross contingent resources for the Maureen and 
Heimdal reservoirs combined are now 369mmbo gross (90mmbo 
net). This compares to 274mmbo (67mmbo net) carried in 2008. 
Kraken
Nautical operates the Kraken discovery with a 35% equity share, 
and therefore dictates the pace of development. It is also important 
to note that the oil viscosity in Kraken is within the range of the 
Captain Field which currently produces at around 25,000bopd and  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 05
is targeting a recovery factor of over 50%.
While buoyed by the tremendous results of 9/2b-2, the failure of a 
third well (9/2b-3 drilled in September/October 2008), albeit 
aggressively located to the northeast of the discovery wells to 
chase an upside resources scenario, needed to be fully understood. 
As a result, a controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) survey 
was commissioned to further define the extent of the reservoir. 
Enhanced seismic processing and regional studies are also in 
progress. In combination with the CSEM results, this study 
programme is focussed on the identification of the target for a 
further appraisal well to be drilled in the first half of 2010.
 
As a result of the dry well 9/2b-3, the gross contingent resource 
estimate for Kraken has been reduced from 106mmbo (37mmbo 
net) to the 83mmbo (29mmbo net) contained in a core area to the 
north and south of the two successful wells. Encouragingly, the 
new seismic data has identified significant exploration potential to 
the west of the core area. 
Development concept studies have meanwhile continued, with the 
Joint Venture favouring a phased development solution. It is 
anticipated that the results of the upcoming well can be quickly 
incorporated into our assessment, and hence we believe that it 
remains realistic to target project sanction and FDP submission by 
the end of 2010.
Rest of the Portfolio
Whilst Kraken and Mariner have been our key areas of focus, we 
continued to strengthen our position on the East Shetland Platform 
by adding a further six blocks to the portfolio in the 25
th
 Licensing 
Round. We were also pleased to further consolidate our position in 
France with the award of two further licences.
Financial Positioning 
Since the inception of Nautical in 2005, £38m has been raised of 
which £19.1m remained at year end. Nautical remains debt free 
and our £7.5m secured debt facility remains undrawn and fully 
available. The impact of the global financial crisis on the cash 
positions of small and mid cap E&P companies in particular, 
suggests that our creative farm-out deals of the recent past may be 
more challenging to replicate in the immediate future. 
Nevertheless, we are confident that we have sufficient financial 
resources to meet the immediate needs of the business as we 
progress Kraken and Mariner towards development decisions.
Looking further ahead, we continue to position the Group to obtain 
the necessary financing to implement our heavy oil development 
strategy through the most effective combination of debt, equity 
funding and other means. In that regard, the fact that a number of 
capital raisings have recently being achieved in the E&P sector at 
moderate discounts, is evidence of emerging confidence in the 
sector. In parallel, we continue to receive encouraging signals from 
advisers and the principal lending institutions of fertile ground for 
project financing particularly for those heavy oil projects put under 
the spotlight by HM Government’s fiscal encouragement.
Capability
We continued with our model of outsourcing evaluation work 
during the period, enabling us to keep our administration 
expenses to a minimum, whilst maintaining access to a highly 
capable group of technical experts. That this works so effectively, 
is a tribute to the cohesion and versatility of the core executive 
team. In particular, the commercial creativity of the team is widely 
acknowledged and will serve Nautical well in our efforts to 
capitalise on our portfolio of opportunities. However, looking 
forward to a sharpened focus on field development definition in 
Mariner and Kraken and the consequential major investment 
decisions, it is our intention to complement the core in-house team 
with a full-time Engineering Manager.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ian Williams who led 
Nautical energetically as chairman through its formative years 
until his departure at the end of 2008. The Board would also wish 
to express our appreciation for the supportive leadership of Patrick 
Kennedy who took on the role of acting Chairman during the first 
half of 2009.
Moving Forward in 2010 
The past 12 months has been turbulent for E&P companies, and 
whilst the overall economy remains fragile there are signs of 
confidence returning to the sector. Importantly for Nautical, there 
is some evidence albeit mixed as yet, of a lower cost environment 
emerging and having successfully preserved our financial 
resources during this period of instability, we are now better 
positioned to take advantage of this.
Our planned activity for next year anticipates a further appraisal 
well on Kraken as we push towards the goal of project sanction 
and FDP submission by the end of 2010. In parallel we expect 
Statoil to continue to progress toward concept selection on 
Mariner and award of the contract for Front End Engineering and 
Design (FEED). Whilst our key focus will remain on Kraken and 
Mariner, we will continue to progress our exploration portfolio, 
with the first material activity scheduled to be the drilling of the 
Catcher prospect in Q2, 2010.

Steve Jenkins
Chief Executive Officer
Nautical is committed to progressing 
both Mariner and Kraken to FDP 
submission and adding value to the 
third leg of material appraisal and 
exploration opportunities
Chief Executive’s
review
Nautical is pleased to report that against the backdrop of difficult 
economic conditions during the period significant progress has 
been made. 
Steady Progress in Challenging Times
During the period Nautical focused on the technical development 
and appraisal of our cornerstone assets by drilling a well and 
acquiring both test and controlled source electro magnetic (CSEM) 
surveys over Kraken and participating in three seismic surveys 
over Mariner. 
Exploration activity was somewhat muted, restricted to an 
operated seismic survey over blocks 8/5 and 9/1. During the 
autumn a planned well on the Hydra block encountered an 
extensive period of severe weather conditions which prevented  
the well spudding and resulted in the demobilisation of the rig.  
The period also saw a drop of over $100 per barrel in the Brent spot 
price before recovering to a more comfortable $70 per barrel, well 
above the break even price for both the Company’s main projects.
Costs have not fallen in line with the oil price, especially on semi 
submersible day rates which remain around $250,000 per day. 
Fortunately large jack up rigs rates have fallen to around $150,000 
per day and can be utilised on most of Nautical’s blocks. It has 
become apparent that rig stacking is occurring as service 
companies seek to maintain day rates and insulate their exposure 
to the cost decreases seen elsewhere in the industry. Whilst 
unhelpful, Nautical believes competition will remedy this situation 
and we hope to see rig rates following the downward trends of 
other services.
A Good Result from the Chancellor
Nautical’s share price tracked the fall in global equity markets, 
with the AIM market particularly impacted by the economic and 
financial crisis which gripped the industry in the period. However 
the Company received a welcome uplift in the April budget, with 
the introduction of the new Field Allowance in which licence 
holders will be able to offset against the Supplementary Charge 
(20%). Heavy oil related developments have been given a Field 
Allowance of £800m as a specific target. This will enhance the 
value of all Nautical’s heavy oil portfolio and specifically improve 
the profitability of the Kraken and Mariner developments. Nautical 
has been engaged with Government since inception to secure this 
positive fiscal change, as both an individual company and through 
the Chairmanship of the Oil and Gas Independents Association 
(the main voice of UKCS independents). The company is pleased 
with this outcome and will continue to try to secure further 
incentives for both exploration and development activity.
Managing Our Portfolio Through Growth and Judicious 
Pruning
Nautical is committed to progressing both Mariner and Kraken to 
FDP submission and adding value to the third leg of material 
appraisal and exploration opportunities which has benefited from 
the addition of a producing asset (Keddington). Including the 
awards in the 25th Licensing Round, blocks secured post round 
and two further awards in France, the augmented portfolio now 
consists of 25 blocks (18 licences) of which 11 blocks (8 licences) 
are operated by Nautical. However through active portfolio 
management this will be reduced through relinquishments of 
blocks with diminished prospectivity, thus enabling resources to 
be directed towards the most promising blocks.
  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 07
We look forward to an increased level of 
operational activity in the coming year 
as we progress Mariner and Kraken 
further towards development decisions, 
as well as seek further resources from 
our exploration portfolio through 
successful drilling. 
Mariner – Less Risk and Increasingly Robust
Statoil (UK) Ltd (operator) continues to share Nautical’s enthusiasm 
and commitment to bring Mariner to development. Activity levels 
remained high with the acquisition of three seismic surveys 
namely, high resolution 3D seismic, ocean bottom cable (OBC) 
seismic and a platform site survey. The combination of the 3D and 
OBC (a technique proven on the Grane heavy oil field – Norway) 
was successful in imaging and defining the areal distribution of 
the Heimdal Sandstone reservoir and defining the Top Maureen 
Sand reservoir (increasing the hydrocarbon column). Additionally 
areas of Maureen Sand erosion proved to be more limited than on 
previous mapping. These increased volumes have not been 
included in the quoted resources since modified reservoir 
simulations have yet to be run. Furthermore studies through the 
period which have revealed reduced platform drilling costs, 
increased recovery rates, decreased water cut (using autonomous 
valves) will also be incorporated in the simulation and we aim to 
report the anticipated increase in resources in 2010.
The joint venture intends to pass through a major decision gate at 
the end of 2010 before submitting an FDP in 2011, followed by first 
oil in 2015.
Kraken – An Operated Substantial Accumulation
A third well was drilled on the north east flank of the Kraken 
hydrocarbon accumulation, 3.3km ENE of the successful 9/2b-2 
well and 5km from the 9/2-1A discovery well. The well was 
designed to intersect the oil water contact and investigate the 
upside (P10) resources. The reservoir (Heimdal Sandstone) proved 
to be absent. However, there are still substantial best estimate 
contingent resources (83mmbo gross, 29mmbo net) both around 
the successful wells and to the north and south. Exploration upside 
is evident to the west with best estimate prospective resources of 
114mmbo gross (40mmbo net).
Considerable technical efforts are focused on predicting the areal 
distribution of the reservoir over Kraken. Both sedimentological 
and seismic studies will be integrated with CSEM survey results 
to locate an appraisal well to be drilled in 2010 prior to submitting 
an FDP before end 2010. We are strengthening our management 
team to fulfil our ambition for first oil in 2012.
Again Nautical was successful in mitigating risk and reducing  
its financial exposure by farming out the 9/2b-3 appraisal to  
both Canamens Energy and Celtic Oil Limited, resulting in a  
zero cost participation in the well and an additional cash bonus to 
be received on FDP approval. 
Exploration and Appraisal Opportunities – Expansion in 
the UKCS and France
Nautical continues to be a significant operator and an active joint 
venture partner, although operational activity was below 2008 
levels with a seismic survey acquired over the Scylla channel 
(blocks 8/5 and 9/1) and the aborted spud of the Hydra well in 
block 3/27a. The Scylla prospect proved to be too high risk and 
small, consequently both blocks and the Hydra the will be  
allowed to lapse or be relinquished. On a more positive note  
the new operator of Catcher (Blocks 28/9 and 28/10b) will  
drill a well in the first half of 2010 (postponed due to Oilexco 
entering administration).
Further interpretation of recently reprocessed seismic has 
confirmed the large Merrow prospect at Collyhurst (Permian) level 
and identified further leads. The joint venture is currently 
identifying onshore drilling locations.
Nautical strengthened its position on the East Shetland Platform with 
the award of six blocks (four as operator) and securing the merger of 
the previously relinquished portion of 9/2b with the retained area. In 
the Moray Firth two additional blocks were secured post round to add 
to the award of Block 15/21g (containing the exciting ‘Spaniards’ 
prospect, downdip from tested oil). 
At the end of 2008 Nautical purchased its first production (10% of the 
Keddington field) from Egdon Resources. We see considerable upside in 
this field and aim to drill a sidetrack in late 2009 to boost production.
Our position in France has also been strengthened by two further 
awards, Pontenx and Gex. Both permits offer heavy oil appraisal/
development opportunities with added conventional oil upside in 
Pontenx and potentially large oil/gas traps in the Jura basin (Gex). 
These complement the existing development opportunity in St 
Laurent (Grenade-sur-Adour) and the large gas prospect beneath 
the Audignon Ridge.
We have made strong applications for heavy oil exploration blocks 
in Europe and are negotiating on a potential heavy oil field 
reactivation. Being mindful of overstretching our treasury we will 
concentrate on evaluating discovered oil blocks in the upcoming 
UKCS 26th Licensing Round. 
Oil portfolio audit
RPS Energy audited our oil portfolio held at 30 June 2009. Resources 
quoted in this report refer to the figures verified by this audit. All 
contingent resources and prospective resources are best estimates.
Firm Heavy Oil Demand Coupled with a Stable Price
Nautical agrees with the consensus that the oil price will remain 
stable and will rise as the world emerges more fully from recession 
and demand rises. We see this price upswing being mirrored or 
being more acute for naphthenic crude as world sources are few 
and distant and the UKCS heavy oil production is in rapid decline. 
The fall in development costs and the recently announced tax 
incentives, combined with this price scenario make our 
development projects increasingly robust and attractive. 
A More Active Future
We look forward to an increased level of operational activity in the 
coming year as we progress Mariner and Kraken further towards 
development decisions, as well as seek further resources from our 
exploration portfolio through successful drilling. Your board will 
make every effort to gain equity markets appreciation of our 
potential, resulting in a share price that fully reflects the 
Company’s substantial net resources.

Block 9/2b (Licence P1077) 
(Nautical 35% Operator)
Nautical’s first awarded licence in the UKCS is located on the East 
Shetland Platform, west of the North Viking Graben. The Kraken 
structure is a large 3 way dip closed high on which oil was 
discovered in the Heimdal Sandstone Member of the Tertiary 
(Palaeocene) system by the 9/2-1A well drilled in 1985 and 
successfully appraised by the joint venture’s 9/2b-2 commitment 
well in 2007. This appraisal well not only encountered oil bearing 
Heimdal Sandstone which correlates with the 9/2b-1A well (known 
as Unit III sands) but also penetrated an additional thin lower oil 
bearing Heimdal Unit I sandstone.
The results of 9/2b- 2 proved an oil column of at least 77 metres 
and an oil down to (ODT) 51 metres deeper than 9/2- 1A. A third 
appraisal well, drilled in September 2008, was located in a down 
dip area to the northeast of the discovery wells in order to 
substantiate the oil column by intersecting the oil water contact 
and to investigate the upside (P10) resources. However, in this 
outlying area, the Heimdal Sandstone Member proved to be 
absent, which limits the northeastern upside and curtails the best 
estimate contingent resources to 83mmbo (29mmbo net) in the 
core area and to the north and south of the 2 successful wells. 
There are additional best estimate prospective resources of 
114mmbo (40mmbo net) to the west of the fault, above the ODT in 
the 9/2b-2 well.
The reservoir quality in all sands is excellent, exhibiting both high 
porosity and permeability. Gravity of the oil is 15° API and 
viscosity is around 110cp or less, being a higher API and much less 
viscous than both Bressay (1,000-1,500cp) and Bentley (>2,000cp) 
and more similar to the producing Captain Field which is expected 
to exceed a 50% recovery and continues to produce at around 
25,000 bopd.
The fact that an oil water contact (OWC) was not encountered in 
the 9/2-1A and 9/2b-2 wells enhances the probability that the 
aquifer support will be through an edge water drive rather than a 
bottom water drive which allows improved control over water 
production and injection thus optimising oil production and 
ultimate recovery from the reservoir. This is supported by 
geochemical analysis which indicates that, although the oil is 
biodegraded, it is not water washed implying the water leg is 
remote from the core of the structure.
During 2009, controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveying, 
a relatively new geophysical technique to the North Sea designed 
to distinguish high resistivity oil zones from their surroundings, 
has been commissioned to further define the extent of the 
reservoir. A single test line acquired in January has confirmed a 
high resistivity anomaly which is indicative of oil filled sands both 
to the north, east and south of the discovery wells but not around 
the 9/2b-3 well which is consistent with the sands being absent. 
Given these encouraging results a broader CSEM coverage of six 
lines was acquired in June aimed at delineating the oil filled sands 
over the structure. Further encouragement is evolving from the 
preliminary processing of these data. 
Enhanced seismic processing techniques such as special  
filtering and regional structural and sedimentological studies  
are in progress to more accurately predict sand distribution over 
Kraken. These studies along with detailed analysis of seismic 
amplitudes interpreted at shallower Heimdal levels will be 
combined with the CSEM results and integrated with previous 
models to define the reservoir distribution and to establish a target 
for a further appraisal well. Nautical intends to drill this in the first 
half of 2010 prior to submitting a field development plan (FDP) to 
the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) by the  
end of 2010. The joint venture is currently favouring a phased 
development solution. 
Through judicious farmouts to both Canamens AS and Celtic Oil 
Limited, Nautical has retained a substantial interest and 
operatorship of this large oil discovery. The most recent 
farmdowns have resulted in Nautical’s exposure to the 9/2b-3 well 
being reduced to zero and the securing of an additional cash bonus 
on FDP approval.

Mariner Block 9/11a (Licence P726)
(Nautical 26.67%)
Operated by Statoil Hydro ASA and located on the East Shetland 
Platform, west of the Viking Graben, the Mariner oil accumulation, 
discovered in 1981 and with 15 subsequent well penetrations, is 
the largest, most highly appraised undeveloped discovery in the 
UKCS. These wells have tested oil at 1,000 to 1,595bopd from both 
the Palaeocene Maureen Sandstone and the shallower Heimdal 
Sandstone. Both sands have excellent reservoir characteristics and 
during an extended well test (EWT) in 1997 a single horizontal well 
in the Maureen Sandstone produced 662,000 barrels of oil over 63 
days at a maximum rate of 14,991bopd (14.5 API).
During the period the joint ventures’ resources were focused on 
characterising and defining the areal distribution of the shallower 
Heimdal Sandstone reservoir and enhancing our already detailed 
knowledge of the deeper Maureen sandstone. Statoil have applied 
the proven geophysical techniques used in their successful Grane 
heavy oil field by acquiring two further seismic surveys. Firstly in 
June 2008, a high resolution 3D seismic survey was acquired to 
enhance the interpretation of the Maureen reservoir. In August 
2008 Statoil added a 3D ocean bottom cable (OBC) survey over the 
core of the Heimdal reservoir to record shear wave seismic data 
which is beneficial to the interpretation of the low impedance 
contrasts typical of the oil filled sands. These mark the first 
operational activities over the discovery since the EWT.
The new 3D seismic has been successful in defining the top of  
the Maureen sand which now appears to be shallower than 
previously mapped in some areas which will increase the 
hydrocarbon column and volume. As anticipated, the OBC data 
has imaged the main Heimdal channels and other sand bodies 
higher in the sequence. Both the improved Maureen and Heimdal 
reservoir models will be input into reservoir simulations by end 
2009. Production profiles for both reservoirs are expected to be 
generated in early 2010.
Since successfully passing through a major decision gate in 
October 2008 Statoil has been identifying development options  
and will shortlist and propose the preferred development concept 
before the next major decision gate at the end of 2010. 
Following on from site surveys acquired in the summer of 2009 
over three considered production platform locations, geotechnical 
and environmental studies will be conducted to aid platform 
design and development.
Considerable operator effort has been guided towards evaluation of 
polymer injection to improve oil recovery factor and simplifying well 
design to reduce costs. Furthermore the use of autonomous valves 
in the completion assemblies to control water influx has shown 
encouraging test results. In addition blending tests to both decrease 
viscosity and increase marketability is yielding positive outcomes. 
Prior to the performance of the above work programme the operator 
reported best estimate contingent resources of 369mmbo gross 
(90mmbo net) for both the Maureen and Heimdal reservoirs. 
Mariner is a large, economically robust development which will 
pass through the next decision gate at the end of 2010 before 
commencing Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) and 
completing an Environmental Impact Assessment in 2011. This 
will lead to project sanction by the joint venture followed by FDP 
submission during 2011 and first oil in 2015 or earlier if Maureen 
wells are pre-drilled.

Located in the Outer Moray Firth adjacent to Ivanhoe, Rob Roy and

discovery, 14/30a-2, named Tudor Rose. The well encountered a 24 
metre oil column beneath a 3 metre gas cap at around 1000 metres 
subsea within Tertiary, Dornoch formation sands. Further 
prospects have been mapped on 3D seismic within the Lower 
Cretaceous Kopervik sand and the Jurassic Sgiath sand.
Interpretation of 208 square kilometres of 3D seismic was completed 
in the period, yielding encouraging results. The western pinch out of 
the Dornoch sands was confirmed and the area of the stratigraphic 
trap in two sand bodies (one undrilled) extended to the south. 
Gas anomalies (1 coincident with the gas in 14/30a-2) were 
mapped within the stratigraphic closure. Nautical attributes 
49mmbo of gross best estimate contingent resources to the Tudor 
Rose discovery. Pending further engineering studies and the 
interpretation of recently acquired amplitude versus offset (AVO) 
seismic volume, the Joint Venture will then decide if a new well is 
merited by early 2011.

(Nautical 15%)
This Traditional 24th Seaward Licensing Round Block is located  
on the West Central Platform, west of the Central Graben and 
the nearby Guillemot Field.
The blocks are undrilled but contain numerous structural/
stratigraphic leads and prospects at both Eocene (Tay Sandstone) 
and two large Jurassic leads. Traps are defined on recent 3D 
seismic which has been reprocessed and interpreted, revealing 
several seismic anomalies. The strongest and most convincing is 
over the Catcher prospect in the Palaeocene, where a seismic 
amplitude anomaly (class 2 AVO) indicates a thick sand sequence 
which is likely to be oil bearing. A flatspot evident on the seismic, 
which corresponds to closing contour within the prognosed  
thick, clean sand of this prospect, supports the opportunity  
for an oil accumulation.
Encore Oil assumed operatorship due to the uncertainty created by 
Oilexco being placed into administration. Subsequently Premier 
purchased Oilexco’s interest and have agreed to honour previous 
farmin arrangements which includes Nautical’s 20% carry. The 
operator will drill the Catcher well in the first half of 2010, the site 
survey for the agreed well location having already been acquired.

Awarded as a Traditional Licence in the 24th Seaward Licensing 
Round in 2007, the blocks are located in the East Irish Sea Basin 
adjacent to Walney Island on the Cumbrian coast. There are 
numerous oil and gas shows in the offshore wells and hydrocarbon 
migration through these prospective blocks is proven by heavy oil 
columns and hydrocarbon shows in the onshore wells to the east.
Integration and interpretation of over 700 kilometres of reprocessed 
onshore, transition zone and offshore seismic combined with 
gravity, magnetics and outcrop data has confirmed the existence 
of the large Merrow prospect at the Permian Collyhurst Sandstone 
and a significant lead, named Sea Serpent, at the Triassic Ormskirk 
Sandstone. The Collyhurst Sandstone has tested gas elsewhere in 
the basin and is under production at the onshore Elswick Field. 
Merrow appears to be analogous to the basin margin Lennox oil 
and gas field, to the south. The joint venture is currently identifying 
an onshore location from which to drill a directional well offshore 
to test the Merrow prospect before 2011.

St Laurent Permit (Nautical 22%)
The Saint Laurent Permit in South West France contains several 
large hydrocarbon exploration plays and the undeveloped Grenade 
heavy oil accumulation. The discovery well, Grenade-Sur-Adour-1 
was drilled by SNEAP (Elf) in 1975 and encountered a 97 metre oil 
column of 10 API oil in Cretaceous Albian carbonates. Between 
1976 and 1985 around 8,000 barrels of oil were recovered from 
intermittent tests, the well being finally plugged and abandoned 
during a period of low oil prices in 1985.
The Grenade 3 appraisal well drilled in 2008 did not encounter 
hydrocarbons. Studies are focused on determining the extent of 
this accumulation and whether to sidetrack or abandon the GAR-3 
well. Best estimate gross oil in place is now estimated to be 88 
million barrels (0.9 million net recoverable).
Deeper in the geological section to the south-west the joint 
venture has reprocessed 2D seismic data and successfully 
delineated a large subsalt gas prospect in the Triassic Bunter 
Sandstone under the Audignon Ridge. The operator estimates best 
net prospective resources of 3TCF (660BCF net to Nautical). A 
farmin partner is being sought prior to drilling this high potential 
prospect. The Conseil De Mines granted a renewal of the St 
Laurent permit up to August 2013. 
Pontenx Permit (Nautical 20%)
Awarded in December 2008, the Pontenx Permit is located in 
south-west France on the southern margins of the Parentis Basin, 
an oil productive region on the west coast of France, and covers an 
area of 313 square kilometres. This licence contains the abandoned 
Mimizan Nord heavy oil field and a number of other high potential 
prospects with good oil shows and tests. 
The licence has a 4 year term and the initial 2 year programme will 
comprise the reprocessing and interpretation of the existing 
seismic data, a review of the rejuvenation potential of the Mimizan 
Nord field and detailed geological studies.
The Mimizan Nord field produced 3.5mmbls of 12 API oil from the 
Apto-Albian cretaceous reefal limestone from 1960 to 1986. 
Various other wells on the blocks have yielded encouraging results, 
with a number testing oil at rates up to 250bopd.
Gex Permit (Nautical 20%)
The Gex Permit covers an area of 932 square kilometres and is 
located in eastern France near the Swiss border. 
The area is located in the Alpine Molasse/Jura Basin where  
active oil seeps, bitumen mines and shallow drilling has proven  
an extensive zone of shallow (<500 metres) oil in the Molasse 
sands and deeper drilling indicates a working hydrocarbon  
system with trapping potential. The majority of wells on the  
block encountered oil.
The initial focus on the deeper targets will be the large surface Grand 
Cret anticline which has closure at Triassic level. Analysis of recently 
collected oil samples, geological studies and the interpretation of 
the existing seismic should give increased definition of both the 
Grand Cret and the other illustrated anticlines.

In challenging times Nautical has successfully maintained a 
strong cash position and remained debt free whilst continuing to 
progress our operational and pre-development activity.
Results
The Group made a loss after taxation of £5.9m for the year (2008: 
£4.5m). This included exploration and evaluation expenses of 
£4.5m, a £2.4m charge relating to the extended well test 
equipment and administration expenses of £1.6m, offset by  
£0.5m in net foreign exchange gains, finance income of £1.3m  
and a net taxation credit of £0.7m.
Exploration and evaluation expenses were primarily related to 
unsuccessful exploration costs on 3/27a Hydra and 8/5 & 9/1 Scylla.
A concerted effort had been undertaken to utilise the extended 
well test equipment over the past two years, however this has not 
been successful. As a consequence, the decision was made in 
December 2008 to impair the asset, resulting in a £2.4m non-cash 
charge to the income statement. 
Administration costs of £1.6m (2008: £1.5m) continued to be 
managed tightly and included a non-cash charge of £0.2m (2008: 
£0.4m) relating to share option charges.
Farmouts were completed on 9/2b Kraken, 3/27a Hydra and 8/25 
Selkie during the year with receipts in excess of the carrying  
value of assets disposed of, resulting in a net gain of £0.5m. The 
completion of the farmout of 9/2b Kraken resulted in a partial write 
back of the provision for deferred taxation, resulting in a deferred 
tax credit of £1.1m, which was offset by a deferred tax charge  
of £0.4m.
Balance sheet
As at 30 June 2009, the Group has net assets of £59.8 (2008: 
£65.5m), dominated by capitalised exploration and evaluation 
assets of £48.9m (2008: £56.4m) and cash and deposits of £19.1m 
(2008: £20.1m). The Group continues to be debt free. 
Cash flow 
Our cash management continued to be very strong during the year, 
with £19.1m cash and deposits at year end. £11.9m of cash and 
past cost contribution was received during the year from farmouts, 
sufficient to fund the £11.5m that was spent during the year on the 
continued exploration and evaluation of our assets.
Our £7.5m secured debt facility with the Bank of Scotland, was 
extended during the year to May 2012 and remains undrawn and

review  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 21
Against a background of low interest rates, interest received on 
cash and deposits was £0.8m (2008: £1.0m), equivalent to half of 
our overall administration spend. 
At year end our cash and deposits were primarily deposited with 
the Bank of Scotland, however subsequent to year end funds have 
also been placed with Abbey, Scottish Widows Bank and Anglo 
Irish Bank. 
New Field Allowances
Nautical welcomed the Chancellor’s 2009 Budget announcement of 
the introduction of new Field Allowance’s applying to small fields, 
heavy oil fields and high temperature/high pressure fields. 
Under the existing North Sea Fiscal Regime, a conventional UKCS 
oil field is subject to taxation of 30%, plus a Supplementary Charge 
of 20%, equating to a 50% charge on taxable income. As a 
consequence of the new Field Allowances announced, heavy oil 
fields have been given a per field allowance of £800m, which 
licence holders are able to utilise to offset the Supplementary 
Charge, providing a tax benefit of up to £160m per field. Both 
Kraken and Mariner qualify for the heavy oil field allowance and 
we see this as a highly positive development to ensure continued 
investment in the North Sea.
Outlook
Nautical’s share price performance over the period reflects the 
reality that the Company hasn’t been immune to recent economic 
conditions. We will continue to manage our cash resources wisely 
and reserve spending only for those activities which we believe 
will lead to a material increase in shareholder value.
The development of the Group’s assets going forward will depend 
not only on technical success, but also on the continued ability of 
the Group to obtain financing through the availability of debt and 
equity funding and other means. Based on the year end cash 
position of £19.1m and the full availability of the £7.5m secured 
facility, the Group currently believes it has sufficient financial 
resources to meet the immediate needs of the business as we 
progress Kraken and Mariner towards development decisions.
Whilst the overall economy is fragile and the farmout market 
remains soft, we are encouraged by the recent capital raising 
transactions in the E&P sector, which suggest both an 
improvement of the capital markets and a refocusing on the North 
Sea sector. This, combined with the tax incentives for heavy oil, a 
more competitive cost environment and a steadier oil price, gives 
Nautical significant cause for optimism.

Principal business risks
The Directors are responsible for the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management activities and internal control processes. As a participant in the

Financial risks:
Cost inflation »
Oil price movements and fluctuation in discounts for heavy oil »
Adverse taxation legislative changes »
Co-venturer and third party counterparty credit risk »
Operational risks:
Loss of key employees »
Delay and cost overrun on projects, including weather related delay »
HSE incidents »
Poor reservoir performance »
Exploration and appraisal well failures »
Strategic and external risks:
Weak capital markets, inhibiting efficient capital raising »
Commercial misalignment with co-venturers »
Oil price volatility » Governance Nautical Petroleum plc 26
The risks set out above are not exhaustive and additional risks and uncertainties may arise or become material in the future. Any of the 
risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties discussed in this document, could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is 
no absolute assurance that the Group’s exploration and development activities will be successful. The Group seeks to manage these risks 
through its portfolio management, balancing risk across a range of prospects and leads, carrying varying technical and commercial risks, 
and carefully managing the financial exposure to each through the arrangements set out with joint venture partners. 
Going concern
Following the Board’s review of the Group’s financial position and forward cash forecasts, the Directors are of the view that the Group has 
adequate financial resources to continue its operational activities and meet its liabilities as and when they fall due for the foreseeable 
future and for a period of at least 12 months from the date of authorisation of these financial statements. For this reason the financial 
statements are prepared on a going concern basis.

Information on the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee is included in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual 
Report. The report of the Remuneration Committee will be the subject of an ordinary resolution at the Annual General Meeting.

Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no information relevant to the preparation of their report of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of the relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. This confirmation is given, and should be 
interpreted, in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.

Remuneration report Governance Nautical Petroleum plc 28
As the Company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange, it is not required to comply with 
the provisions of the Combined Code. However, the Board is committed to the high standards of good corporate governance embodied in 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and seeks to apply the principles of the Combined Code where practicable for a company 
of Nautical’s size and complexity.
Board of Directors
The Board is responsible for the direction and overall performance of the Group with emphasis on policy and strategy, financial results 
and major operational issues. 
The Code recommends that smaller companies should have at least 2 Non-Executive Directors. Following changes in the year the Board 
now comprises 3 Executive and 3 Non-Executive Directors, one of which is the Chairman, who are independent of management and do 
not participate in the Group’s bonus or pension schemes although the Non-Executive Directors have share options and Mr P Kennedy is  
a shareholder.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, thus ensuring a division of responsibility at the head of the Group. 
The current Executive Directors are all employed under service contracts with the Company. The services of I Williams and H Thanawala 
until 17 October 2008 and P Jennings until 31 October 2008 were secured through a contract for services with International Energy 
Services Limited, a related party. 
All Directors are subject to re-election by shareholders every 3 years and, on appointment, at the first Annual General Meeting after 
appointment. Appropriate directors and officers’ liability insurance has been arranged by the Company.
Meetings of the Board of Directors
The Board meets at least 4 times a year after all relevant information has been circulated in good time, to discuss a formal scheduled 
agenda covering key areas of the Group’s affairs including operational and financial performance and quarterly management accounts. 
All members of the Board are expected to attend Board Meetings which are scheduled in advance. There was full attendance at all 
meetings throughout the year.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by P Kennedy and its other member is J Conlin. Executive Directors may attend by invitation. The 
minutes of every meeting are taken by the Company Secretary and circulated to the Board at the next Board Meeting at which the 
Chairman provides a verbal report of meetings of the Committee.
The Audit Committee, which meets at least twice a year, is responsible for keeping under review the scope and results of the audit, its 
cost effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the auditors. It also has oversight responsibility for public reporting and the 
Company’s internal controls. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by P Dimmock and its other member is J Conlin. The minutes of every meeting are taken by the 
Company Secretary and circulated to the Board at the next Board Meeting at which the Chairman provides a verbal report of meetings of 
the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee, which meets at least twice a year, is responsible for considering the remuneration packages for executive 
directors and the bonus and share option strategy for the Group and making recommendations as appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for reviewing the performance of the Executive Directors and ensuring that they are 
fairly and responsibly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Group’s overall performance. The Committee’s scope extends to 
all remuneration of Directors including bonus and share options.
None of the Committee has any day-to-day involvement in running the Company and no director participates in discussions about his 
own remuneration.
Nominations Committee
A Nominations Committee was established prior to the appointment of Mr J Conlin as Non-Executive Chairman and currently comprises 
S Jenkins, P Dimmock and P Kennedy. It reviews and recommends to the Board the appointment of Directors and is charged with 
ensuring the necessary balance of skills, knowledge and experience is maintained and represented on the Board. The Nominations 
Committee considers that the current composition of the Board is satisfactory to provide the appropriate governance, administration and 
business counsel in respect of the Company’s affairs.

Relations with Shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given high priority. Extensive information about the Group’s activities is provided in the Annual 
Reports and Accounts and the Interim Report, which is sent to all shareholders. There is regular dialogue with institutional investors as 
well as presentations to analysts to the time of the release of the annual and interim results. The Company maintains a website (www.
nauticalpetroleum.com) for the purpose of improving information flow to shareholders as well as potential investors. The website 
contains all press announcements and financial reports as well as extensive operational information about the Group’s activities and 
enquiries from individual shareholders on matters relating to their shareholdings and the business of the Group are welcomed. The Board 
encourages shareholders to attend the Annual General Meeting, at which members of the Board, are available to answer questions. 
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and is supplied with information to enable it to discharge its 
duties. Internal control systems are designed to meet the particular needs of the Group and to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to meet business objectives. The internal controls cover financial, operational and compliance matters and are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. The Group’s internal controls can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or 
loss or the risk of failure to meet business objectives. Governance Nautical Petroleum plc 30
Group financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the Group financial statements unless they are satisfied that they present fairly the 
financial position of the Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and  »
then apply them consistently;
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable  »
information;
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand  »
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial performance; and
state that the Group has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements. »
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009 31
We have audited the Group financial statements of Nautical Petroleum plc for the year ended 30 June 2009 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 28. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Sections 495 and 496 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out of page 30 the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practice Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 30 June 2009 and of its loss for the year then ended; »
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and »
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. »
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the group financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or »
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. »
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Nautical Petroleum Plc for the year ended 30 June 2009.

Notes to the financial statements
1. Authorisation of Financial Statements and Statement of Compliance with IFRS
The Group’s financial statements of Nautical Petroleum plc for the year ended 30 June 2009 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 6 November 2009 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Stephen Jenkins and William Mathers. 
Nautical Petroleum plc is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on 
AIM on the London Stock Exchange.
2. Accounting policies for the Consolidated Financial Statements
(2.1) Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of IFRSs (International Financial 
Reporting Standards) as adopted by the European Union (EU) as they apply to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the 
year ended 30 June 2009, and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Board has reviewed the accounting policies set out below and considers them to be appropriate to the Group’s business activities. 
On 1 April 2005 the Company became the legal Parent Company of Nautical Holdings Limited in a share-for-share transaction and 
changed its name from Bullion Resources plc to Nautical Petroleum plc. Due to the relative size of the companies, Nautical Holdings 
Limited shareholders became the majority holders of the enlarged share capital. Further, the Company’s continuing operations and 
executive management became those of Nautical Holdings Limited. Accordingly, the substance of the combination was that Nautical 
Holdings Limited acquired Nautical Petroleum plc in a reverse acquisition. The share capital of the Group is determined using reverse 
acquisition rules as set out in the note on share capital.
(2.2) Basis of consolidation 
These consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of Nautical Petroleum plc (“Nautical”) and its 
subsidiaries as at 30 June 2009, including the results of the subsidiaries, which are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent 
Company using consistent accounting policies. 
All intercompany balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-group transactions are 
eliminated in full. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and 
continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control is normally evident when Nautical, or a company which it 
controls, owns more than 50% of the voting rights of a company’s share capital. 
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented separately in the income 
statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders’ equity.
Where a minority interest is acquired, the difference between the cost of the additional interest in the subsidiary and the minority 
interest’s share of the assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at the date of the acquisition of the minority 
interest is reflected as being a transaction between owners and the difference is therefore taken to equity.
(2.3) Significant accounting judgements and estimates
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management make judgements and estimates. The key assumptions 
concerning the future, and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial year are as follows:
The Group determines whether the exploration and evaluation assets are impaired in accordance with policy 2.7. »
The estimates determining the unwinding of the discount on long-term conditional payments, being the expected timings of field  »
development approval and first oil on the Mariner field.
The Group determines whether the Extended Well test equipment has been impaired in accordance with policy 2.8.  »
(2.4) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenues can be reliably 
measured. 
(2.5) Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in UK sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are 
measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency using the 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the 
functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the income statement. 
The functional currency of Nautical Petroleum AG (NPAG) changed in the year to June 2007 from US dollars to UK sterling. The trigger for 
the change was an underlying change in the currency in which the majority of the underlying cash flows are denominated. At the time of 
the change in October 2007 major work programmes were being undertaken in NPAG, including drilling and seismic, which were 
predominantly denominated in UK sterling. Annual Report and Accounts 2009 37
Up until October 2007 NPAG was accounted for as a foreign subsidiary whereby the assets and liabilities of this subsidiary were 
translated into UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and its income statement was translated at the 
weighted average rates for the period. The exchange differences arising on the translation were taken directly to a separate component of 
equity (“Cumulative Translation Reserve”). On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating 
to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. 
(2.6) Intangible assets – Exploration and evaluation assets
Capitalisation
Certain costs (other than payments to acquire the legal right to explore) incurred prior to acquiring the rights to explore are charged 
directly to the income statement. All costs incurred after the rights to explore an area have been obtained, such as geological and 
geophysical costs and other direct costs of exploration (drilling, trenching, sampling and technical feasibility and commercial viability 
activities) and appraisal are accumulated and capitalised as intangible exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) assets. 
E&E costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities. At completion of appraisal activities, if technical feasibility is 
demonstrated and commercial reserves are discovered, then, following development sanction, the carrying value of the relevant E&E 
asset will be reclassified as a development and production asset, but only after the carrying value of the relevant E&E asset has been 
assessed for impairment, and where appropriate, its carrying value adjusted. If, after completion of appraisal activities in an area, it is not 
possible to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability or if the legal right to explore expires or if the Company decides not 
to continue exploration and evaluation activity, then the costs of such unsuccessful exploration and evaluation is written off to the 
income statement in the period the relevant events occur. 
Impairment 
If and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an E&E asset may exceed its recoverable amount an impairment 
review is performed. For E&E assets when there are such indications, an impairment test is carried out by grouping the E&E assets with 
the development and production assets belonging to the same geographical segment to form the Cash-Generating Unit (“CGU”) for 
impairment testing. The equivalent combined carrying value of the CGU is compared against the CGU’s recoverable amount and any 
resulting impairment loss is written off to the income statement. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined as the higher of its 
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 
Acquisitions and Disposals
Farm-in and farm-out transactions of E&E assets are accounted for at cost. Costs are capitalised according to the Group’s interest, net of 
premium received or paid, as costs are incurred. Proceeds from the disposal of an E&E asset, or part of an E&E asset, are deducted from 
the capitalised costs and the difference recognised in the income statement as a gain or loss.
(2.7) Development and Production assets
Capitalisation
Development and Production (D&P) assets are accumulated into single field cost centres and represent the cost of developing the 
commercial reserves and bringing them into production together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves 
previously transferred from E&E assets as outlined in the policy above. 
Depletion
Costs relating to each single field cost centre are depleted on a unit of production method based on the commercial proven and probable 
reserves for that cost centre. Development assets are not depreciated until production commences. The amortisation calculation takes 
account of the estimated future costs of development of recognised proven and probable reserves, based on current price levels. Changes 
in reserve quantities and cost estimates are recognised prospectively from the last reporting date. 
Impairment
A review is performed for any indication that the value of the Group’s D&P assets may be impaired. For D&P assets when there are such 
indications, an impairment test is carried out on the cash-generating unit. Each cash-generating unit is identified in accordance with IAS 
36. Nautical’s cash-generating units are those assets which generate largely independent cash flows and are normally, but not always, 
single development or production areas. If necessary, additional depletion is charged through the income statement if the capitalised 
costs of the cash-generating unit exceed the associated estimated future discounted cash flows of the related commercial oil and  
gas reserves.
(2.8) Plant and equipment
All equipment is stated at cost less depreciation unless otherwise shown. Cost includes all relevant external expenditure incurred in 
acquiring the asset. No property assets are held within the Group.
The initial cost of equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes and any directly 
attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Expenditures incurred 
after the equipment has been placed into operation, such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, are normally charged 
to the income statement in the year in which the costs are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the 
expenditure has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of an item of equipment 
beyond its original assessed standard of performance, the expenditures are capitalised as an additional cost of equipment.  Accounts Nautical Petroleum plc 38

(2.8) Plant and equipment continued
Depreciation
The Group selects its depreciation rates carefully and reviews them regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances. When 
determining expected economic lives, the Group considers the expected rate of technological developments and the intensity at which 
the assets are expected to be used. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life. Useful lives of major classes of 
depreciable assets are:
Extended well test equipment 20 years
Computer equipment        3 years
The useful life and depreciation method are reviewed periodically to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent 
with the expected pattern of economic benefits from items of equipment. 
An item of equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any 
gain or loss on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised. 
Impairment
At each balance sheet date, reviews are carried out of the carrying amounts of the assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from the 
other assets, estimates are made of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate appropriate to the specific asset or cash-generating unit. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
(2.9) Joint ventures
The Group is engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production through unincorporated joint ventures. The Group 
accounts for its share of the results and net assets of these joint ventures as jointly controlled assets. Where Nautical acts as operator to 
the joint venture, the gross liabilities, cash and receivables (including amounts due to or from non-operating partners) of the joint venture 
are included in the Group balance sheet.
(2.10) Provisions
Provision for Decommissioning
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full as an asset and liability when the obligation arises. The asset is included within 
development and productions assets. The liability is included within provisions. The amount recognised is the estimated cost of 
decommissioning, discounted where appropriate to its net present value, and is reassessed each year in accordance with local conditions 
and requirements. Revisions to estimated costs of commissioning which alter the level of provisions required are also reflected in 
adjustments to decommissioning asset.
Conditional payments
Non-current conditional payments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with the unwinding of the 
discount passing though income statement as a finance cost. At each balance sheet, the estimates used to determine the discount 
period are assessed and changes made as appropriate, with the effect of the change being recorded in the current year. 
 
(2.11) Financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand and deposits held with banks with original maturities of 3 months or less.
Short-term deposits
Short-term deposits comprise deposits held with banks which mature in between 3 and 12 months at the balance sheet date.
Long-term deposits
Long-term deposits comprise deposits held with banks which mature in more than 12 months at the balance sheet date.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value. Fair value is considered to be the original invoice amount, discounted 
where material. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the Income Statement if there is objective 
evidence that the receivable is impaired.  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 39
(2.12) Financial liabilities
Trade and Other Payables 
Current trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value. Fair value is considered to be the original invoice amount, 
discounted where material. 
(2.13) Taxation
Current tax
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on 
tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: 
where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a  »
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the  »
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future; and
deferred income assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the  »
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
offset, only if a legally enforcement right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate 
to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise income tax is 
recognised in the income statement.
(2.14) Employee benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable for the year are charged to the income statement. 
(2.15) Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the year in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant individuals become fully entitled to the 
award (“vesting point”). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments and value 
that will ultimately vest. The income statement charge for the year represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the 
beginning and end of that year. 
The fair value of share-based remuneration is determined at the date of grant and recognised as an expense in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, taking account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
The fair value is determined by use of a binomial model.
(2.16) Separately disclosable items
Items that are both material in size and unusual and infrequent in nature are presented as separately disclosable items in the income 
statement or separately disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The Directors are of the opinion that the separate disclosure of 
these items provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying business performance.
(2.17) Commitments and contingencies
Commitments and contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements. They are disclosed unless the possibility of an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. A contingent asset is not recognised in the financial statements but 
disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Accounts Nautical Petroleum plc 40

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements. 
Upon adoption of IFRS 8, the Group will have to disclose information to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and 
financial effects of the different business activities in which it engages and the economic environment in which it operates. For the 
Groups’ current business activities, the identification, aggregation and measurement of reportable segments under IFRS 8, would not 
result in any differences from the Groups’ current interpretation of IAS 14 Segment Reporting, the prevailing standard that IFRS 8 will 
replace. IFRS 8 will however, require additional disclosures for each reportable segment as follows:
Criteria for identification  »
Nature, geographic location of business and main customers  »
Financial performance metrics, both Income Statement and Balance Sheet  »
Inter-segment transactions  »
Differences in Accounting policy and methodology between segments »

The exploration and evaluation balance represents the costs related to the fields currently being evaluated and appraised. The amounts 
written off relate to unsuccessful exploration costs primarily due to licences being relinquished or in the process of being relinquished, 
principally the 3/27a Hydra and 8/5 and 9/1 Scylla licences. The disposals of exploration and evaluation assets relate to the farmouts of 
9/2b Kraken, 3/27a Hydra and 8/25a Selkie, which were completed during the year.
The above balances include amounts relating to a 6.67% interest in the Mariner Field, being carried by the Company. Upon field 
development approval, the party to the carry agreement has the option to earn back its 6.67% interest by reimbursement of costs during 
the development phase. These costs amount to approximately £9.5m as at June 2009 (2008: £9.0m). If the party declines to take up its 
option, the Company retains the 6.67% interest upon payment of £1.
In December 2008 management carried out an impairment review on the extended well test equipment in accordance with the policy set 
out in note 2.9 and considered the following:
Due to the specialist nature of the equipment there had been infrequent interest from companies wishing to rent or buy it. »
In the absence of a binding sale agreement or an active market, management is required to make their best estimate of fair value less  »
cost to sell.
Although there had been some interest over a number of years in the equipment none of the enquiries had led to tangible results.  »
Therefore in the current difficult financial markets and the general slow down in industry activity during the past year, management 
have impaired the asset in full.
The equipment was disposed of in June 2009 for zero consideration, although there is a possibility of future consideration if the  »
purchaser finds a buyer. Management do not think the probability of this to be sufficient to attribute any value to it. Accounts Nautical Petroleum plc 44

In addition to the above balances for tax losses and accelerated capital allowances, which were recognised at a tax rate of 50%, the  
group has a deferred tax asset not yet recognised at a tax rate of 28% of £3.5m (2008: £2.4m), which has not been recognised as a result  
of existing uncertainties of their realisation. These arise from tax losses of £3.4m (2008: £5.3m), depreciation in excess of capital 
allowances of £6.3m (2008: £3.2m) and deferred consideration of £2.8m (2008: £nil). The tax losses are available indefinitely against  
future taxable profits.

At 30 June 2009 a £20k provision has been made for decommissioning costs related to the Keddington field. 
Conditional payments comprise 2 amounts relating to the Mariner Field of: (1) $4.0m due on Field Development Plan (FDP) approval by 
the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) which is not expected before 2011; and (2) $2.8m due on first oil which is not 
expected before 2014. The Company believes these events to be sufficiently probable as to provide for their payment. The liabilities were 
acquired as part of the acquisition of the Alba Resources (Holdings) Group in August 2005. At this date they were fair valued. The 
movement in the year includes both exchange movements and unwinding of the discount, which are shown in the income statement. 
The change in estimates applies to a revision of the estimated trigger dates.
19. Borrowing facility
On 2 November 2007, the Group entered into an 18 month £7.5m borrowing facility with the Bank of Scotland for general working capital 
purposes. On 30 March 2009 this facility was extended to 31 May 2012 with any amounts drawn repayable in full by that date. No 
amounts had been drawn at the balance sheet date. The facility is secured by a first ranking debenture over the assets of the Company 
and the assets of certain subsidiaries, principally Alba Resources Limited which has a 26.67% interest in the Mariner field. Interest is 
chargeable at 3 or 6 months LIBOR, as chosen by the Company, plus a margin of 2.75%.

There is no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of the financial instruments.
Financial risks
The Group is exposed to financial risks arising out of market risks, credit risks and liquidity risks. The Board reviews and establishes 
appropriate policies for the management of these risks and monitors them on a regular basis.
Market risks
Market risks relate to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risks.
(1) Commodity price risk
The Group has only a small amount of revenue, so is not exposed to any material commodity price risk on its financial instruments. Accounts Nautical Petroleum plc 46
Notes to the financial statements continued
20. Financial instruments continued
(2) Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposure whereby expenditure is incurred in currencies which are not the functional currency of 
the relevant Group company (UK sterling). The primary exposure is to the US dollar. The Group monitors exchange rate movements and 
considers forward purchase of US dollars prior to major capital programmes requiring dollars.
The non-current liabilities are payments which are triggered on future events as set out in note 18, which are in US dollars. The impact of 
a 10% change in the UK sterling/USD exchange rate would have caused ±£344k (2008: £320k) effect on the profit before tax.
(3) Interest rate risk
The Group has not drawn on its bank facility. If it were to do so, it would be exposed to interest movements, as the rate is linked to LIBOR 
rates as described in note 19.
There is an insignificant risk of change in value of cash deposits.
Credit risks
Credit risk is primarily that a partner fails to pay amounts due causing financial loss to the Group. The Group currently has limited 
exposure to such credit risk. Maximum exposure would be the amounts shown in the balance sheet.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on the financial institutions with which it holds cash, short-term deposits and deposits maturing in 
greater than one year. At June 2009 the Company had a £1.0 million deposit which matures on 2 July 2010 with Abbey National (part of 
the Santander group). Substantially all other cash was with Bank of Scotland, except for small balances with BNP Paribas and UBS. 
Subsequent to the year end, further funds were placed with Abbey, Scottish Widows and Anglo Irish Bank. 
Liquidity risks
Liquidity risk is the risk that sources of funding for the Group’s business activities are not available. As a business which primarily 
focuses on oil and gas exploration and appraisal, the primary source of funding of the Group’s activities is equity. The Group has been 
successful in raising equity on a number of occasions, most recently in October 2007, when £20.0m (before issue costs) were raised. 
When appropriate, the Group seeks to supplement equity funding with borrowing and a £7.5m facility was secured with Bank of Scotland 
in November 2007 for general working capital purposes, which has been extended to May 2012. The Board always ensures that there is 
sufficient funding available before committing to any significant expenditure. In addition the Group has been successful at mitigating 
risk through its farmout programmes whereby the majority of expenditure on its drilling programmes is borne by partners. There is 
currently, therefore, limited exposure to a liquidity risk. 
The maturity profile of the Group’s non-current financial liabilities is dependent upon certain events as explained in note 18. The current 
liabilities are all due within 1 year. The Group’s payment policy is to settle amounts in accordance with agreed payment terms which is 
typically 30 days.
Capital management 
The Group defines capital as the total equity of the Group. The objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it makes the 
maximum use of its capital to support its business and maximise shareholder value. There are no external constraints on the Group’s 
capital. As the Group’s primary focus is on exploration and appraisal, equity has been the principal form of funding. A credit facility has 
been arranged with Bank of Scotland in order to provide added flexibility (see note 19). As the Group begins to develop its fields, debt will 
be become more significant.

Under reverse acquisition accounting, the legal parent is Nautical Petroleum plc, but the Group results at the date of acquisition are as if 
Nautical Holdings Limited were the parent. The value of the shares at the date of acquisition is based on the value of the share capital of 
Nautical Holdings Limited at the date of acquisition (1 April 2005). Following the reverse acquisition, the Group shows the additions 
made for Nautical Petroleum plc only. The reverse acquisition capital adjustment is the deemed value of capital acquired on the reverse 
takeover and the associated number of shares is the share capital issued for the takeover. Annual Report and Accounts 2009 47

The Group announced on 24 November 2005 the acquisition of 22% of the St Laurent Permit onshore France field with the consideration 
to be satisfied by the issuance of 19,388 new ordinary shares of 20p each. The seller has not yet requested the issue of these shares. 
On 4 July 2005 the Group announced the issuance of 583,334 warrants to subscribe for new ordinary shares at 400p per share exercisable 
up to 3 July 2009. The Company has the right to require warrant holders to exercise their warrants should the closing price of the 
Company’s ordinary shares remain above 800p per share for 90 consecutive trading days in the year to 3 July 2009. These warrants 
expired post year end without being exercised.
On 3 January 2006 the Group announced the issuance of 731,890 warrants to subscribe for new ordinary shares at 400p per share 
exercisable up to 3 January 2010. The Company has the right to require warrant holders to exercise their warrants should the closing 
price of the Company’s ordinary shares remain above 800p per share for 90 consecutive trading days in the year to 3 January 2010.

The options were all granted under the Nautical share option scheme rules (with the exception of the 50,000 options granted on 23 
September 2005 in association with the acquisition of the Alba Resources (Holdings) Group), whereby from the date of issue 25% are 
exercisable after 6 months, 25% after 12 months, 25% after 18 months and 25% after 24 months. The options must be exercised within 8 
years of issue. The exercise price is the highest of either: the nominal value of the shares (20p), the average price for the 30 days 
preceding grant date or the price on grant date. None of the Directors exercised options during the year. I Williams and H Thanawala 
resigned on 17 October 2008 and therefore had until 17 October 2009 to exercise any exercisable options. None were exercised.
The weighted average share price in the year was 55.7p (2008: 194.2p). The weighted average remaining contract life at 30 June 2009 was 
4.90 years (2008: 5.55 years). The weighted average fair value of options granted in the year was 13.96p (2008: 84.8p). 
The expense recognised for share-based payments in the year to 30 June 2009 was £243k (2008: £450k).

22. Reconciliation of movements in equity
The reconciliation of movements in equity is detailed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The following is a description of 
the nature and purpose of each reserve.
Share capital and share premium
The Group’s share capital and share premium are explained in note 21.
Cumulative translation reserve
The cumulative translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not UK sterling and any fair value adjustments associated with their acquisition. These 
movements related to Nautical Petroleum AG, which changed its functional currency from US dollars to UK sterling in October 2007, 
following which no further movements have been recorded.
Other reserves
Other reserves comprise the following:

Warrant reserve       263 263
Capital reserve       14,031 14,031
       29,169 29,169
The capital contribution arose on the formation of Nautical Holdings Limited (see note 21 for explanation of reverse acquisition 
accounting) when equipment was contributed to the Company.
The merger reserve arises from UK law for merger relief, which sets out rules for subsidiaries acquired in whole or in part for shares, 
where at least 90% of the Company is acquired. In such circumstances, where the Company prepares accounts under UK GAAP, the 
investment in the Company’s financial statements is at the nominal value of the shares issued. In the Group’s financial statements, the 
premium is recorded in the merger reserve.
The warrant reserve shows the value of share warrants issued.
The capital reserve arose from the fair value exercise on acquisition of Nautical Petroleum AG. Annual Report and Accounts 2009 49

Directors’ responsibilities for the Parent Company financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; »
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; »
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in  »
the financial statements;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue   »
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Nautical Petroleum plc Company only accounts 2009 Accounts Nautical Petroleum plc 52
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Nautical Petroleum plc for the year ended 30 June 2009 which comprise the 
Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 29 to 38. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Sections 495 and 496 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 30, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the 
parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 30 June 2009; »
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and »
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. »
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in  
our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from  »
branches not visited by us; or
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or »
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or »
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. »
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Nautical Petroleum plc for the year ended 30 June 2009.

29. Accounting policies
(a) Basis of accounts preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
accounting standards. In addition to the requirements of UK accounting standards, the accounting for oil and gas exploration and 
production activities is guided by the Statement of Recommended Practice (“SORP”) “Accounting for Oil and Gas Exploration, Production 
and Decommissioning Activities” issued by the UK Oil Industry Accounting Committee on 7 June 2001. The financial information has 
been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the SORP.
(b) Exploration, evaluation and development expenditure
All costs incurred after the rights to explore an area have been obtained are accumulated and capitalised as intangible exploration and 
evaluation (E&E) assets. If facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the E&E asset may exceed its recoverable amount 
an impairment review is performed.
Development and Production (D&P) assets are accumulated into single field cost centres and represent the costs of developing the 
commercial reserves and bringing them into production together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves.
When production commences the capital costs incurred plus an estimate of future costs of development are depleted on the unit of 
production method based on proven and probable reserves for the cost centre. Changes in reserve quantities are recognised 
prospectively from the last reporting date.
(c) Depreciation
The cost of fixed assets is written off over their expected useful lives as follows:
Computer equipment        3 years
As of June 2009 the Company no longer has any equipment capitalised.
(d) Foreign currencies
Assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the 
transactions; monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated at the year end rate of exchange. 
(e) Share-based payments
Employees (including Directors and senior Executives) of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby these individuals render services as consideration for equity instruments (“equity-settled transactions”).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant individuals become fully entitled to the 
award (“vesting point”). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments and 
value that will ultimately vest. The income statement charge for the year represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as 
at the beginning and end of that year. 
The fair value of share-based remuneration is determined at the date of grant and recognised as an expense in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, taking account of the estimated number of shares that will vest. The fair value is determined 
by use of a binomial model.
(f) Investments in subsidiaries
The Company records investments in subsidiaries at cost less provision for impairment. Where subsidiaries have been acquired in part 
for shares and at least 90% of the Company has been acquired the merger relief provisions of the Companies Act 2006 have been applied. 
The share element of the transaction is recorded at the nominal value of the shares issued.
30. Losses attributable to Nautical Petroleum plc
The loss for the year dealt with in the accounts of Nautical Petroleum plc was £876k (2008: £2,222k). As provided by s408 of the 
Companies Act 2006, no profit and loss account is presented in respect of Nautical Petroleum plc.

Supplementary information
Audit of Reserves and Resource Volumes for Annual Report and Accounts of Nautical Petroleum plc (“the Company”)
We have been asked to provide an updated comment on the resources and reserves estimates for two of the assets of the Company.
The Company asserts that there have been no material technical changes to the inputs and methods that the Company would use in the 
estimation of these quantities, save for the following material changes to the data or interpretations available that have taken place on 
the following assets over the past year: -
Mariner  » (License P.335, UKCS Block 9/11a): the new Operator, Statoil (UK) Ltd, has continued studies and data acquisition to better 
understand the reservoirs. The net result of the new data and studies has been to increase its estimate of the recoverable volumes in 
the Mariner and Heimdal formations. RPS has not had sufficient access to data to verify these estimates. However, given the new 
Operator’s experience in the heavy oil play in the region and the rigour of in its methods, of RPS has no reason to assume that these 
estimates are invalid.
Kraken  » (License P.1077, UKCS Block 9/2b): a third well has been drilled in Kraken, which was dry and resulted in a reduction in 
estimated Contingent Resources. RPS has reviewed the Best Estimate Contingent Resources quoted in the Annual Report and 
concurs with this estimate.
On this basis, we can repeat our opinion that the Company’s estimates of Best Estimate Contingent Resources are, in aggregate, 
reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles as set forth 
in the Petroleum Resource Management System (2007) and the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas 
Reserve Information, both promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers et al .
We draw your attention to the following points:
The recoverable volumes in the Mariner field have this year been classified as Best Estimate Contingent Resources (development  »
pending) in line with the Operator’s revised classification, with which we concur.
Estimates of Reserves and Resources are inherently imprecise and uncertain. Presentation of a single estimate does not illustrate the  »
inherent uncertainty in the methods used to arrive at the estimate.
Many of the Company’s projects remain relatively immature and are the subject to ongoing technical evaluation by the Company. As a  »
result there is a large range between low and high volume estimates. Although we deem the estimates to be reasonable, these 
estimates may be subject to significant change as new data becomes available.
We have not reviewed the “risking” or “chance of success” associated with any of the Prospective or Contingent Resources in your  »
portfolio.
Yours faithfully,
R. T. Kelly

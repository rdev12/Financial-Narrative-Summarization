Advent Communications
Vislink plc
Advent revolutionised television news 
with the world’s first commercial “flyaway”
satellite news-gathering (SNG) system 
in 1989. For the first time, TV news crews 
were within hours of providing live coverage
of almost any major story, anywhere in the
world. A member of the Group since 2000,
the company manufactures world-class
carbon fibre antennas, up-link trucks and
electronics, and has offices in London,
Singapore and Dubai. Their customers
include Reuters, the BBC and most major

Introduction
In 2007 , we delivered year-on-year growth in a number of key
financial performance metrics including underlying revenue, margin,
earnings per share and cash generated from operating activities.
We also successfully completed the acquisition of Western Technical
Services which is in line with our strategic growth plan to build US
service and integration revenues in the broadcast, law enforcement
and security markets.
Financial results
In 2007 the adjusted operating margin has improved to 15.9 per
cent of revenue (2006 – 14.2 per cent) generating a 13.5 per cent
increase in adjusted earnings per share.
Revenue for the year grew by 7 .4 per cent, excluding the effects 
of exchange on translation of £4.9 million and reduced sales 
on the completed legacy Venezuelan contract of £4.0 million.
Headline revenues were £98.6 million (2006 – £100.5 million). 
The Group has been able to continue to improve its operating 
profit and operating margins. The adjusted operating profit, 
being operating profit from continuing operations before the
amortisation of acquired intangibles, increased by 9.6 per cent 
to £15.7 million (2006 – £14.3 million). This increase is after an 
adverse impact from foreign exchange on translation of £0.8 million.
Operating profit from continuing operations was up by 9.9 per cent
to £14.2 million (2006 – £12.9 million). Profit before tax was up by
10.1 per cent to £14.0 million (2006 – £12.7 million).
The Group net cash inflow generated from operating activities was
£9.3 million (2006 – £8.4 million). After increased capital expenditure
and acquisition costs the Group held net funds of £3.5 million at 
December 31, 2007 (December 31, 2006 – £3.9 million).
Dividend and shareholder returns
The basic undiluted earnings per share for the year was 6.47 pence
(2006 – 5.65 pence). After adjusting for the amortisation of acquired
intangibles, the adjusted earnings per share increased 13.5 per cent 
to 7 .21 pence (2006 – 6.35 pence). As a result of this strong
performance, the Board is proposing a 25 per cent increase in the 
full-year dividend to 1.25 pence per share (2006 – 1.00 pence).
Board and management changes
Ian Scott-Gall, our Chief Executive, has announced that he will be
retiring at the end of this financial year. On behalf of the Board, 
and our employees I would like to thank Ian for his substantial
contribution to the Group over the last nine years, during which 
time the Group has been transformed through acquisitions and
strong organic growth into a group of highly profitable technology
businesses. The search for a new Chief Executive is now underway.
Tony Finizio has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer of 
our US operations. At the same time we strengthened the US
management team by appointing Morgan Kurk as President 
of MRC. Morgan was previously Vice President and General 
Manager of the Andrew Corporation Wireless Solutions Group.
In 2007, we delivered year-
on-year growth in a number 
of key financial performance
metrics including underlying
revenue, margin, earnings 
per share and cash generated
from operating activities.

Executive remuneration
We have addressed the issues that were raised by the shareholders 
at the 2007 Annual General Meeting of the Company in respect 
of certain elements of executive remuneration. A circular was sent 
to all shareholders on February 21, 2008 containing the details of 
the changes proposed. These were subsequently approved at an
Extraordinary General Meeting on March 7 , 2008.
Current trading and outlook
Our progress in the defence satcom market has been hampered by
the delay in the initiation of certain US programmes. Whilst these 
are starting to be announced, actual purchase orders have yet to be
released and as a result revenues from the Defence Law Enforcement
and Security (“DLES”) market for both MRC and Advent will be lower
than expected in 2008. 
Our RF businesses were expected to benefit from the introduction 
of new products for the growth opportunities created by the move
from Standard Definition (SD) to High Definition (HD) within the
professional broadcast market. However, the US economic outlook
has worsened and will have an impact on the level of broadcast
orders to be received this year by MRC.
On the positive side, the FCC has now ruled that the 2GHz 
re-channelisation programme has to be completed by March 5,
2009. This will result in increased deliveries of equipment in 2008
and opportunities for WTS to increase revenue through the provision
of further integration services to the programme. 
We are continuing to invest into the DLES markets, both in personnel
and new products. Our plans for geographic expansion will continue
and we have now opened a sales office in Dubai to enable the RF
businesses to develop the customer base in this important region.
Demand for Hernis’ systems from the marine and offshore markets
continues to be strong with growth in LNG marine transportation
and as a result of oil and gas exploration and extraction from harsher
environments being made economically viable by the higher 
oil prices. Hernis is expected to continue to perform strongly.
The Group has invested in seeking out growth from entry into the
adjacent sectors of the broadcast market by way of a significant
acquisition using debt finance, but given our caution over the current
economic outlook we have decided not to proceed further with this
acquisition. We will continue to consider acquisition opportunities
within our current markets.
In summary, we achieved a 13.5 per cent increase in adjusted
earnings per share in 2007 , however the adverse trading conditions 
in the US in both our broadcast and DLES markets are expected to
reduce our 2008 results below the Board’s previous expectations.
The Group, with its strong product range, remains cash generative.
Finally I would like to thank all our employees for their contribution
over the last 12 months.

Intrinsically safe marine CCTV systems market leadership
Sales into the marine safety market through our Norwegian business,
Hernis, represent 16 per cent of Group revenue. The strategy for
Hernis is to maintain its close relationship with the oil and gas
companies, ship owners and ship builders around the world. 
With regional offices in Brazil, Houston and Singapore, Hernis is well
positioned to service its global customers and maintain its market
leadership through product innovation and highly effective channel
management. The current strong oil price will continue to sustain
high levels of investment into offshore exploration and marine
transportation and related loading facilities. This will sustain growth 
in the offshore and marine markets for Hernis. 
We will continue to invest in the facilities in Norway to meet the
growth in the business. Our investment in Wireless Power and
Communications A/S (WPC) (an associate company) is providing
Hernis with new products based on the application of induction
charging and data transfer technology for the marine safety market.
The first products will enter production in the first half of 2008.
Evolving our products and service capability 
We have continued our investment in the development of HD
encoding and advanced high data rate modulation systems to
maintain our market leading technology and market share. 
We will continue to invest in the application of new technologies,
with increasing use of software-driven products, to meet our
customers’ requirements for more automation and integrated 
field upgradable systems. In order to support our products we 
have established service centres in Hong Kong and South America 
for the RF businesses and in Brazil and Singapore for Hernis. 
We have implemented a unified corporate level product strategy
across the related RF businesses of Advent, Link and MRC under the
guidance of the Chief Technology Officer. We have also formed a
strategic Technology Committee with senior management from each
business to maintain a focus on our strategic development direction
and to review competing and complementary technologies.
Earnings enhancing strategic acquisitions
Part of the Group strategy is to create incremental long term
recurring revenue opportunities by building a US Technical Services
business through organic and acquisition led growth. The acquisition
of Western Technical Services (“WTS”) in July 2007 is enhancing
service revenues from the 2GHz re-channelisation programme 
and the DLES markets, as well as providing the prospect of recurring
revenues as the broadcast customers move towards contracted 
out fee services. This provides the Group with a stepping-stone
towards being able to provide full “turnkey” project management
and integration services in the US, utilising the strength of our 
market leading products.
Summary
In 2007 we acquired WTS to establish a Technical Services business 
in the US market that will be supplemented with organic growth. 
We have increased our investment in new products and channels 
to market in order to deliver our growth strategy across our 
target markets. The Group is moving towards meeting its 
strategic objectives.
Ian Scott-Gall
Chief Executive 
Introduction
We remain committed to our strategy of increasing shareholder
value through organic growth and acquisitions. The strategy will be
delivered through our focus on our strategic objectives, which are to: 
1. Maintain market leadership in the television broadcast contribution
technology segment
2. Establish a global presence by providing high quality wireless
transmission systems for defence, law enforcement and 
security markets
3. Remain the world leader for the provision of intrinsically safe
marine CCTV systems
4. Evolve our products to meet the specific needs of our 
growth markets
5. Seek out earnings enhancing acquisitions. 
Our strategy in action
Broadcast market leadership
Broadcast sales represent 74 per cent of Group revenue. In the US 
we have maintained a market share in excess of 60 per cent in the
television broadcast contribution market. Over the last three years
this sector of the market has been dominated by the 2GHz BAS
relocation programme. The FCC has now agreed to extend 
the programme to March 5, 2009. The programme, which has 
expanded in total value, will provide a significant contribution 
to 2008 revenues. The programme has to move rapidly into 
the implementation phase to meet this deadline and this creates 
further opportunities for us to grow revenues in our US technical
services business. 
Outside of the US we are seeking to increase our international
presence by developing sales channels to growing Middle and 
Far Eastern markets through regional sales offices. We already 
have offices in Singapore and Hong Kong and in January 2008 
we opened a regional office in Dubai. We expect to increase 
our market share by capitalising on the potential for equipment 
upgrades to high definition (HD) and high data rate IP systems.
Developing the DLES markets
DLES sales currently represent 10 per cent of Group revenue. 
We will grow our DLES markets through increased investment 
in our products and sales channels. During 2007 a dedicated
international DLES team was established and the existing US 
team was strengthened.
Our product development programme included new satellite
products to meet the specific needs of the market that will enter
production in the first quarter of 2008. The development of this
market has been slower than we had wished and sales opportunities
will start to flow in the second half of the year.
In the US we have a good track record in the LES market with steadily
increasing sales. We have strong relationships with city and state
police forces as well as with the National Guard. We are succeeding 
in developing the growing airborne digital video surveillance market;
MRC secured milestone helicopter video downlink and receive
systems orders from several large US municipalities and international
security agencies. In addition a US network of specialist defence 
value added resellers has been set-up.  Global markets Broadcast

Review of operations in 2007
Our markets
The Group has a global spread of revenues. In 2007 , 58 per cent of
the Group’s sales were in North America, 21 per cent in the UK and
Europe, 1 1 per cent in Asia and 10 per cent in the rest of the world.
The operating businesses sell into three distinct global markets;
broadcast, defence, law enforcement and security (DLES), and marine
safety. Broadcast sales represent 74 per cent of Group revenues, 
DLES 10 per cent and marine safety 16 per cent.
Group sales in the broadcast market were lower in 2007 at 
£72.8 million (2006 – £77 .6 million) primarily due to lower sales 
in South America of £4.0 million following the completion of the 
VTV contract. Revenues from North America increased, despite the
impact of foreign exchange, as we continue to benefit from the 
2 GHz re-channelisation programme. Internationally the demand 
for HDTV, news and sports programming and the proliferation of 
TV channels is driving infrastructure spend by the broadcasters.
In the broadcast market each of our brands, Advent, Link and MRC,
are recognised within the broadcast industry as market leaders with
specialist knowledge. Each has well-established routes to market. 
In the Americas we are utilising MRC’s established market strength 
to distribute all three brands through a combination of directs sales,
value added resellers and distributors. The acquisition of WTS has
given the Group another route to market, and the ability to sell
turnkey solutions alongside integrated products and systems. 
In international markets each business manages its sales through a
combination of direct sales from regional offices, sales agents and
distributors. As part of our strategy to develop our sales channels 
we have opened a regional office in Dubai in January 2008. 
Sales in the DLES markets were £9.5 million. We have had success 
in the US in developing our law enforcement and security channels 
to market and increased sales. Advent has also had sales success in
Asia. Our defence sales, particularly US satcoms, were disappointing
as several major spending programmes have been delayed. 
It remains our strategy to develop the DLES market through
continued investment. 
Sales into the marine safety market have increased 27 per cent to 
£16.2 million. The market is sub-divided into onshore and offshore 
oil and gas and marine (including high risk vessels such as tankers and
cargo ships as well as cruise and naval vessels). The growth in the year
has come from offshore and marine markets. With the oil and gas
companies continuing to invest in exploration of harsh environments
and the strong build programme for new Liquid Natural Gas (LNG)
vessels we expect Hernis to continue to see an increase in demand
for its products.
Truly Innovative Solutions

The UK business consists of three activities, the satellite communications
business of Advent, the wireless camera business of Link and the
legacy CML international projects business. Following the completion
of the VTV contract CML project sales decreased by £4.0 million, 
in line with expectations. Sales in the core UK RF businesses of 
Advent and Link were up 7 .6% to £33.7 million.
The adjusted operating profit from the core businesses of Link 
and Advent was up by 29 per cent (£1.5 million), with both
businesses contributing higher returns. Operating profits in 2006 
had been depressed by a final charge in respect of the VTV contract
of £1.0 million, which was completed in the first quarter of 2007 . 
Advent has experienced sustained broadcast market demand for 
its satellite technology, with particular success in the European and
Asian markets. Advent’s strength is its strong brand awareness, 
class-leading products in terms of performance and reliability.
Significant broadcast contract wins included a £1.0 million contract
to supply transmission products to a West African state broadcaster
and a £4.1 million order from a European broadband satellite 
services provider for a large fixed earth station project. In addition, 
Advent is building momentum in the DLES market having won 
a £1.2 million order from a government customer in Central Asia,
supplied 12 mobile satellite uplinks to INDRA, a major European
defence integrator, and supplying 20 mobile systems to a
government integrator in China.
Advent has two key product launches in the first quarter of 2008. 
The Summit flyaway system, a joint programme with MRC, is the 
first dedicated ruggedised satellite terminal to be launched by the
Group. This is an auto acquisition terminal designed to provide 
a fully integrated solution for rapid deployment and secure satellite
communications. In addition Advent are introducing a fully motorised
auto acquisition version of the popular 1.9m and 2.4m Mantis
products to meet the need for deskilled operation in global defence
and security markets. 
Link has seen sales growth Internationally. Link continues to benefit
from the sale of High Definition (HD) products in both Europe 
and Asia as well as in the US via MRC. As a tribute to its growing
international presence Link has received the Queen’s Award for
international Trade in 2007 , adding to their success in 2004 when
they won the Queen’s Award for Enterprise: Innovation. Link’s latest
ultra low delay HD products are creating demand and the roll out 
of their new wireless camera radios is well underway. In particular 
Link have secured several orders for the supply of HD systems for 
the Beijing Olympics. Link products have been used in a number of
high profile events during the year including the 2007 US PGA tour,
the Rugby World Cup and the onboard radio cameras used to record
and transmit live the record breaking TGV train travelling at 360mph. 
Link expect to build on their success in 2008. Link are partnering 
with Advent in the creation of the Dubai regional sales office and 
the International DLES sales effort with new product developments.
Link has attended the International DLES exhibitions alongside 
Advent and MRC to demonstrate its expertise. There has been
particular interest from the law enforcement and security market
in the application of Link city centre cellular diversity networks that
are already in place in the UK and Europe.

MRC has an estimated 60 per cent share of the North American
electronic newsgathering (ENG) market, and a strong customer 
base in the Americas and Asia/Pacific regions. During the year 
WTS was acquired to create incremental long term recurring
revenue opportunities by building a US Technical Services business.
This provides the US business with a stepping-stone towards 
being able to provide full “turnkey” project management and
integration services.
MRC sales revenues increased 4.3 per cent in local currency to 
$1 16.9 million (2006 – $1 12.0 million). WTS contributed additional
sales of $1.6 million. Reported sales, after the effect of adverse
foreign exchange translation, were 2.4 per cent lower at 
£59.3 million. Operating profits at MRC were down 7 .6 per cent 
in local currency million as a result increased material costs. 
MRC purchases approximately 35 per cent of its material from Link
and Advent in sterling and suffered increased costs as a result of 
the weakness of the US dollar. WTS broke even in the period post
acquisition. The foreign exchange translation impact on the 
US business was to reduce like for like profit by £0.8 million. 
The US domestic broadcast market remains strong with demand
continuing to be driven by the 2Ghz re-channelisation programme
for which MRC launched two new key products at the NAB 
exhibition in April 2007 . The acquisition of WTS will enhance 
service revenues from the 2GHz programme and provide both 
MRC and WTS with opportunities to cross sell products and services.
Outside of the re-channelisation programme the US domestic
broadcast market has remained flat. However, the programme
provides only for the replacement of analogue products with SD
digital products. There are significant opportunities beyond the
programme to upgrade the new digital platforms that are being
installed to HD. With shorter life cycles for digital products we 
expect the underlying broadcast market in the US to grow on 
a regional basis once the re-channelisation programme has been
completed. The addition of WTS provides the prospect of recurring
revenues as the broadcast customers move towards contracted 
out services for maintenance of their RF networks.
Growth in service revenues
The acquisition of WTS established a strong US services organisation in both 
the US broadcast and law enforcement markets and meets the changing 
needs of our customer base who require easy to use world-class equipment 
and professional services to maintain their own competitive edge.
New sales channels
During 2007 a dedicated defence and law enforcement sales team was recruited; 
and we committed to establishing regional hubs to get closer to our customers 
and drive growth in the Middle and Far East broadcast markets.

Market leadership
The 2 GHz Relocation Programme that resulted in a step change for our 
US broadcast business has been extended until March 2009. MRC continue 
to maintain their market share for the provision of new digital equipment 
under the programme and are also providing installation services.
MRC has an estimated 60 per cent
share of the North American 
ENG market 20 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007
Progress continues to be made in developing the US defence 
and law enforcement markets. During the year MRC supplied 
$6.6 million of the Advent Mantis satellite antennas, as part of 
a system to support voice, video and data transport for a US
Government user. MRC are also successfully developing the 
US law enforcement and security market, and in particular the
airborne digital video surveillance market. MRC’s multi-band 
video microwave equipment was chosen by the New Jersey State
Police (NJSP) for their state-wide video and communications upgrade
for homeland security, law enforcement and emergency response. 
MRC have continued to invest in product development. During the
year MRC introduced new radio platforms that give the ability to
support both SD and HD utilising the Link IPR and a new expandable
central receive diversity system. All the new products represent
significant enhancements to existing market leading news gathering
capabilities, providing amongst the most efficient workflow solutions.
The microwave transmission products enable editors and engineers
to extend their newsrooms into the field through wireless IP 
enabled network extension with remote control capabilities. 
Further developments and enhancements will be launched at 
NAB in 2008.

Hernis, our Norwegian business, has had a record year for both sales
and operating profits. Hernis has improved its margins despite the
currency pressures of selling into international markets. 
Hernis have pioneered the integration of intrinsically safe marine
CCTV with other systems including process control, fire, gas and
intruder alarms. Hernis sells into the global marine safety market 
and service centres. Hernis has been very successful in developing 
its markets and customer relationships through a network of business
partners and creating regional sales and technical support centres 
in Singapore, Houston and Brazil. Within the industry Hernis has
achieved class type approval for their explosion proof camera
housings that differentiates them by providing quality assurance 
for their products and systems.
Growth for Hernis has come from strong marine and offshore 
oil and gas markets. Hernis have a market leading position for 
the supply of systems for the new Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) vessels. 
The increasing level of investment in offshore oil and gas rigs by the
major oil companies has led to an increase in demand for products
and systems for floating rigs and drill ships. Hernis have also benefited
from increased demand for offshore oil and gas installations such 
as jetties and terminals. The domestic Norwegian offshore market 
for Hernis has been particularly strong, contributing to a 31 per cent
increase in European sales. The Singapore operation has also seen
growth in both business and personnel. As a result Asian market sales
were up 48 per cent and now represent 35 per cent of revenue.
During 2007 Hernis became the first Group company to have 
its environmental assurance system to be certified according to
ISO14001. Environmental measures have been integrated into the
day-to-day operations and awareness has been increased amongst
the staff as a result.
Hernis had another record year 
in 2007 with sales increasing 
29 per cent
Growing markets 
Hernis are a specialist equipment supplier and integrator benefiting from massive 
investment in the global marine oil and gas markets. Our leadership in the LNG 
carrier and other offshore markets puts us in a strong position to develop the 
rapidly growing onshore market.

Research and development
We are committed to investment in research and new product

Expenditure in 2007 was £5.8 million representing 5.9 per cent 
of revenues (2006 – £5.4 million, 5.4 per cent). In addition the 
Group has capitalised development costs in the year of £2.8 million
(2006 – £1.8 million). The amortisation of development costs 
of £1.1 million (2006 – £1.0 million) is included in the 
reported expenditure.
Finance costs
The net interest charge for the year was £0.24 million 
(2006 – £0.26 million). Included within the interest charge is 
£0.19 million (2006 – £0.22 million) in respect of the unwinding 
of the discounting of the deferred consideration associated with

Services to their present value. Net interest paid in the year was 
£nil (2006 – £0.07 million).
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was £5.03 million (2006 – £4.97 million).
The UK current tax charge was £1.20 million (2006 – £0.35 million)
and the overseas current taxation in the year was £3.63 million 
(2006 – £5.12 million). Overseas taxation represents Norwegian

taxes in respect of the US business. There was a deferred tax charge
of £0.19 million (2006 – credit of £0.50 million). 
The effective tax rate for the year was 36.0 per cent (2006 – 
39.2 per cent) compared with the standard UK corporation tax 
rate applicable during the year of 30 per cent, which reflects the
higher tax rate (40 per cent) that is attributable to the proportion 
of the Group’s taxable profits generated in the US. The prior year
Group tax charge included an overseas tax prior year adjustment of
£0.39 million in respect of an IRS audit, against which the Company 
is appealing. Excluding this one-off charge the prior year effective

Cash flows
Group cash and cash equivalents was £7 .00 million at 
December 31, 2007 (2006 – £8.16 million). 
The Group generated net cash from operating activities of 
£9.25 million in the year (2006  – £8.37 million) after a net
absorption of working capital of £3.90 million (2006 – £3.23 million)
primarily as a result of an increase in trade debtors due to a higher
level of sales in December. A further £0.08 million was generated
from the proceeds of the issue of new ordinary shares 
(2006 – £0.58 million).
Investing activities absorbed £6.09 million of cash (2006 –

(2006 – 1.00 pence). The payment of the dividend will absorb
approximately £1.7 million of cash. Subject to the approval of
shareholders, the dividend will be paid on July 18, 2008, to those

Foreign currency risk
The largest exchange risk to the Group in terms of its reported results
lies in the translation of the results of the US business from US dollars
to sterling at the average rate ruling for the year. To a lesser extent
the Group’s results are also affected by the translation of the results
of Hernis, our Norwegian business. In the year to December 31, 2007
the adverse translation impact on revenue was £4.9 million and on
operating profits the adverse impact was £0.8 million, relative to the
rates used in 2006. The principal exchange rates used by the Group
in translating overseas profits and net assets into sterling are set 
out in the table below.

Risk management
The Board regularly reviews the full range of business risks facing 
the Group. The approach adopted is to identify, evaluate and
manage the likely impact of risk on the Group’s business objectives.
Where the risks are unavoidable they are managed through 
business controls and where appropriate through insurance 
and treasury activities.
The Group has a programme of regular risk assessment, which
incorporates internal control reviews of both a financial and 
non-financial nature. A process of continuous review has been 
in place throughout the year at an operating company level to
consider the risk environment and the effectiveness of controls. 
The results of reviews, initiatives and progress on implementing
control improvements are regularly reported to the Board.
Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements contains 
a review of the financial risks facing the Group together with a 
review of the critical accounting estimates and judgements used 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

development programmes that result in innovative new products 
for the Group as well as improvements to existing products.
Expenditure on research and development in 2007 amounted 
to £4,763,000 (2006 – £4,401,000), excluding amortisation of
capitalised costs. In addition development costs of £2,839,000 
(2006 – £1,810,000) were capitalised.
8. Financial risk management
The Group’s policies on financial risk management are set out in 
note 3 to the financial statements. 26 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007
9. Social responsibility
The Board takes regular account of the significance of social,
environmental and ethical matters. The following specific matters 
fall under the broad definition of Social Responsibility.
Employees
The Group recognises the role that its employees play in its 
success. Each operating company within the Group has lines of
communication in place to ensure that employees are consulted 
with and kept informed of issues relevant to them. Staff notices,
emails and staff meetings are used to communicate immediate
issues to them. In addition the operating companies produce their
own newsletters for both internal and external purposes.
The Group provides employees with access to training carried out
both within the organisation and on external accredited courses 
that are relevant to an employee’s role and development.
It is the policy of the Group not to discriminate between employees
or potential employees with disabilities or on the grounds of 
age, race, religion, sex or political belief and to offer the same
employment opportunities, training, career development and
promotion prospects to all. 
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always 
fully considered bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant
concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled,
every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the 
Group continues and the appropriate training is arranged. It is the
policy of the Group that the training, career development and
promotion of a disabled person, so far as possible, be identical 
with that of other employees.
Employee share scheme incentives
Vislink plc operates a number of share-based incentive schemes on
an all-UK employee and discretionary basis for the benefit of the
Group’s employees and its senior management. The aim of the
share-based incentive schemes is to align the interests of the
employees with those of the Company’s shareholders.
At December 31, 2007 the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP)
held 840,000 (2006 – 550,850) shares in the Company representing
0.60 per cent of the issued share capital (2006 – 0.40 per cent). 
The ESOP has waived its rights to receive dividends.
Health and safety
It is the policy of the Group to ensure the health and welfare 
of employees by maintaining a safe place and system of work. 
This policy is based on the requirements of employment legislation,
including the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.
Environmental management
The Group is committed to environmental management through a
process of continuous improvement. As manufacturers of electronic
equipment the Group’s businesses are compliant with the latest
legislation for the European Union (EU) directives regarding Waste
Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and the Restriction of
Hazardous Substances (RoHS). In particular the RoHS directive
required the phasing out of hazardous substances in new products.
In order to comply with this legislation all new products are designed
to use lead free components and lead free solder. Existing products
have been redesigned where possible. 
During 2007 Hernis has achieved the International environmental
management system standard of ISO 14001 for its operations in
Norway. Our UK factory is registered with the environment agency
and has a producer compliance scheme for the recycling of all
electrical and electronic waste produced on site. The UK factory 
is aiming to achieve ISO 14001 in 2008. Our US factory at MRC
operates on an equivalent basis.
All our businesses are conscious of the need to reduce their 
waste and carbon footprint through energy management and
recycling schemes. 
The Group actively encourages all shareholders to contribute towards
a greener countryside by registering for our registrar’s eTree service
under which we dedicate a tree to be planted on each registered
shareholder’s behalf in a UK reforestation area. This can be accessed
through the investor relations page on the Group website at
www.vislink.com.
Creditor payment policy
The Group operates a decentralised supplier payment system. 
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in
accordance with those terms agreed between each operating
company and its suppliers, provided that all trading terms and
conditions have been complied with. The aggregate creditor 
days for the UK subsidiaries is 36 (2006 – 48).
The Company is a holding company and has minimal trade
purchases; therefore, its numbers of days’ purchases outstanding 
is not meaningful.
Charitable and political donations
The Group made a number of charitable donations in support 
of local communities totalling £8,500 through its UK and overseas
subsidiaries during the year (2006 – £2,730). No political donations
were made.
10. Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 2 Gresham Street,
London EC2V 7PQ on Wednesday May 21, 2008 at 12.00 noon.
Share capital resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting to renew for a further year the directors’ authority to allot
equity securities for cash other than to existing shareholders on 
a pro rata basis and to authorise purchases by the Company of its 
own shares. 
The Board are also asking shareholders to approve the adoption by
the Company of new Articles of Association (the “New Articles”)
primarily to take account of changes in English company law 
brought about by the 2006 Companies Act. The principal changes
introduced in the New Articles are summarised on page 91.
The 2006 Act is being implemented in phases with a phase 
expected to come into force on 1 October 2008. It is proposed 
to make further revisions to the Articles with effect on and from 
1 October 2008 to cater for changes being introduced by the 
2006 Act from this date relating to Directors’ conflicts of interest. 
The Resolution also caters for the Directors’ conflicts of interest
provisions of the 2006 Act being brought into force at a later date. 
An explanation of these Special Business resolutions is given in 
the accompanying notice of the Annual General Meeting on 
pages 86 to 91.

1 1. Statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
In the case of the individuals who are directors of the Company at 
the date when this report was approved:
> So far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware, and
> Each of the directors has taken all the steps they ought to have
taken individually as a director in order to make themselves aware
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
12. Independent auditors
The independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , have
indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution 
that they be re-appointed will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting. 
13. Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
United Kingdom company law requires the directors to prepare
consolidated financial statements for each financial year that give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the
Group as at the end of the financial year and of the results of the
Group for that period.  In preparing the consolidated financial
statements, the directors are required to:
> select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
> make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
> state that the consolidated financial statements comply 
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; and
> prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
will continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above
requirements in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper books of account
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to
ensure that the consolidated financial statements and Directors’
remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 1985 
and, as regards to the Group financial statements, Article 4 of 
IAS regulations. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. The directors are also responsible for the
maintenance and integrity of the Vislink plc website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of consolidated financial statements may differ from legislation in
other jurisdictions.
By order of the Board
J R Trumper
Company Secretary
April 4, 2008 Corporate governance statement
The Board is committed to ensuring that high standards of corporate
governance are maintained throughout the Group and has a 
formal corporate governance policy in place that clarifies the 
Group’s position on all significant matters. The Board believes that
maintaining high standards in this area is a fundamental part of
discharging its responsibility for leading, controlling, protecting 
and growing the value of the Group  for shareholders.
This report shows how the principles of corporate governance
contained in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, which 
is appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
(“the 2003 Code”) have been applied to the Group. The Board has
also adopted the requirements of the revised Code that was issued 
in June 2006 and applies to reporting periods commencing after
November 1, 2006. References to the Combined Code below refer 
to both the Combined Code (2003) and the Combined Code (2006).
For the purpose of applying the 2006 Code the Group qualifies as a
smaller company.
Statement of compliance with the Combined Code
Throughout the year ended December 31, 2007 the Group has been
in compliance with the Combined Code of provisions on Corporate
Governance except for the matters referred to below:
C3.1: For the period from May 23 to October 1, 2007 the Audit
Committee did not have a member with recent and relevant financial
experience, neither did it have two independent non-executive
directors. Both of these exceptions were rectified with the
appointment of Oliver Ellingham.
Tim Trotter, and before him Bob Morton, the Group’s Chairman, were
members of the Audit and Remuneration Committee whilst serving
as Chairman. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Combined Code
the Board is entirely satisfied as to their independence whilst serving
as Chairman, as neither had day-to-day involvement in the business
and both brought wholly independent judgement to the Board.
Further explanation of how the principles have been applied is set
out below and, in connection with directors’ remuneration, in the
Directors’ remuneration report on pages 32 to 36.
Directors
Board effectiveness
The Board comprises the non-executive Chairman, three executive
directors, two independent non-executive directors and a non-
independent non-executive director. The size of the Board and the
balance between executives and non-executives is considered to 
be appropriate to the Company’s size and scope of activities and
provides for effective operation.
A schedule of formal meetings of the Board, Audit Committee 
and Remuneration Committee is arranged each year in line with 
the Company’s management reporting, and interim and annual
reporting cycles. During the year the Board met formally 1 1 times.
Attendance at meetings was as follows:
Board Audit Remuneration Nomination

Note 1: In attendance for part of the meeting.
Note 2: Oliver Ellingham was appointed during the year and has attended all
meetings since his appointment. Bob Morton attended all meetings up to
his retirement.
In addition to the formal schedule of meetings the Board held
discussions with executive directors and senior operational managers
on strategy, business development and other topics important to the
Group’s progress.
The Chairman is responsible for the running of the Board. 
Through the executive he ensures that all directors receive sufficient
relevant information on financial, business and corporate issues 
prior to meetings. The Chief Executive’s responsibilities focus on 
co-ordinating the Company’s business and implementing Group
strategy. The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring that
Board procedures are complied with. All directors are able to take
independent professional advice in furtherance of their duties if
necessary and have access to the Company Secretary.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it. It is
responsible for overall Group strategy, acquisition and divestment
policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects and
consideration of significant financial matters. It monitors the
exposure to key business risks and reviews the strategic direction of
individual trading subsidiaries, their codes of conduct, their annual
budgets, their progress towards achievement of those budgets and
their capital expenditure programmes. The Board also considers
environmental and employee issues, Board and key appointments. 
It ensures that all directors receive appropriate training on
appointment and then subsequently as appropriate.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, all directors
are subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity after
their appointment. The Articles also provide that at least one-third of
the directors are subject to re-election by rotation at each Annual
General Meeting.
Biographical details of the directors are set out on page 24. 
The Board has established three permanent committees, the Audit
Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration
Committee. These operate within defined terms of reference, which
are reviewed by the Board annually. Full details of the terms of
reference are provided on the Group website at www.vislink.com.

AGM notice/shareholder information
Chairman and Chief Executive
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the running 
of the Board and the executive responsibility for running the Group’s
businesses. The Company is in compliance with Combined Code by
separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive. The Chairman
met the independence criteria on his appointment. 
Board balance and independence
The recognised senior independent non-executive director is 
Robin Howe, who took over the role from Tim Trotter on May 23,
2007 . The Board recognised the need for a second independent
non-executive director in order to retain the appropriate Board
balance and appointed Oliver Ellingham on October 1, 2007 . 
Board performance evaluation
The recognised senior independent non-executive director, 
Robin Howe, has undertaken a formal review of the operation of the
Board and its Committees. This has included individual discussions
with the executive directors and the Chairman. His findings and
recommendations were reported to the Company Secretary. 
The evaluation in respect of the period under review found no
significant weaknesses. 
Re-election
As reported in the Directors’ report on page 25, James Trumper 
and Tony Finizio retire by rotation and, in accordance with the 
Articles of Association and being eligible, offer themselves 
for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Oliver Ellingham was appointed by the Board as a non-executive
director with effect from October 1, 2007 and is therefore now
seeking election by shareholders.  
The Audit Committee
Membership and duties
The Audit Committee consists of the three independent 
non-executive directors under the chairmanship of Oliver Ellingham,
the other members being Tim Trotter and Robin Howe. As a 
qualified Chartered Accountant Oliver Ellingham has the relevant
financial experience as required by the Combined Code. Prior to 
Mr Ellingham’s appointment the Committee was chaired by 
Bob Morton and then subsequently by Tim Trotter. The Group Chief
Executive and the Group Finance Director are normally invited to
attend each meeting as are the external auditors, who have direct
access to the Chairman of the Committee at all times. The Audit
Committee also meets with the external auditors without the
presence of executive directors, for independent discussions. 
The duties of the Audit Committee include the review of the Group’s
financial controls and accounting policies, the review of the findings
of the external auditors and assisting the Board in ensuring that the
published consolidated financial statements give a true and fair 
view and in securing reliable internal financial information for 
decision making. 
Any significant non-audit work undertaken by the external auditors 
is approved by the Audit Committee to ensure that the auditors’
independence is not compromised. In addition the Audit Committee
reviews the need for an internal audit department at least annually. 
Activities
The Committee meeting held in March 2007 was principally
concerned with the draft financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2006, together with the draft preliminary results
announcement. The Committee considered the report of the
external auditors on the full-year audit, concentrating on issues 
of judgement and audit focus identified in the audit plan. 
The Committee meeting held in August 2007 was principally
concerned with the draft interim financial statements for the 
period ended June 30, 2007 , together with the draft interim results
announcement. The Committee considered the report of the
external auditors on the half year review concentrating on key 
areas of work, including the consistency of the application of
accounting policies.
The Committee meeting held in December 2007 with the external
auditors was principally concerned with the plan and approach for
the audit for the year ended December 31, 2007 . In addition the
audit fees for 2007 were agreed, the auditors independence was
reviewed and engagement letters were approved.
The Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee reviews the structure, size and
composition of the Board. It also ensures that there is adequate
succession planning in regard to the Board and senior appointments.
During the year under review the Committee met to consider the
membership of the Board, and was responsible for the appointment
of Oliver Ellingham as an independent non-executive director. 
The Committee used external consultants to assist in locating 
suitable candidates for the appointment. 
The Committee is chaired by Tim Trotter. The other members are 
Ian Scott-Gall, Robin Howe and Len Mann. Oliver Ellingham joined the
Committee subsequent to his appointment. The Group Company
Secretary also attends the meetings. 
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of the non-executive directors
under the Chairmanship of Robin Howe. Its responsibilities are to
advise upon and make recommendations to the Board on the
Group’s remuneration policies and, within the framework established
by the Board, to recommend the remuneration of the executive
directors. The Chief Executive is also invited to attend meetings to
discuss remuneration packages and bonus schemes for senior
executives in the Group.  
Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee will measure the performance 
of the executive directors and key members of senior management
as a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus
awards and share plan awards to the Board for final determination. 
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is recommended by
the executive directors and takes account of the time spent on Board
and Committee matters. The Board as a whole will make the final
determination but no director plays a part in any discussion about his
own remuneration. The Committee may consult the Chief Executive
about its proposals and has access to professional advice from inside
and outside the Company.
The Group’s compliance with the requirements of the Combined
Code are detailed further in the Directors’ remuneration report as 
set out on pages 32 to 36.  Relations with shareholders
The Board welcomes enquiries from both institutional and private
investors throughout the year and responds quickly either verbally 
or in writing to queries received from both. The Chief Executive and
the Group Finance Director meet at regular intervals with institutional
investors to discuss the Group’s performance and objectives. 
The Chairman, non-executive directors and other executive directors
are available to attend meetings with shareholders if they are
requested to do so. 
The Group, via its website at www.vislink.com provides up-to-date
information on the Company and its operating subsidiaries, including
all stock exchange announcements and downloadable copies 
of the most recent report and accounts and interim statements. 
The website also provides a communication channel to the Group 
via email. Shareholders may now elect to receive all shareholder
documents electronically by registering with the Group’s registrars.
The Company uses its Annual General Meeting as an opportunity 
to communicate with its shareholders and encourages their
participation. As in previous years, it is the intention of the Board 
to incorporate a presentation reviewing the Group’s objectives and
strategy, followed by a question and answer session with members 
of the Board at the next Annual General Meeting on May 21, 2008.
The notice of the Annual General Meeting is sent to shareholders at
least 20 working days’ in advance of the date of the meeting and
contains details of the separate resolutions that are proposed for
shareholder approval. The notice of the Annual General Meeting is
set out on page 86.
Financial reporting
Reviews of the performance and financial position of the Group 
are included in the Chairman’s introduction, the Chief Executive’s
strategy review and the Operating and financial review on 
pages 14 to 23. The Board uses these, together with the Report of
the directors on page 25, to present a balanced and understandable
assessment of the Group’s position and prospects. 
The directors’ responsibilities in respect of the consolidated financial
statements are described in the Report of the directors on page 27 .
Responsibility for risk and internal control
The Group has an internal control system in place, in line with 
the Turnbull guidance, which is designed to protect shareholders’
investments by safeguarding the assets of the Group and facilitating
its efficient operation. The Board considers that strong internal
controls are integral to the sound management of the Group, and 
it is committed to maintaining strict financial, operational and risk
management control over all its activities.
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss. There is an ongoing
process for identifying, evaluating and managing risks that are faced
by the Group through the management reporting structures, which
have been in place during 2007 and up to the date of approval of
the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Board regularly reviews the strategy for the Group together with
its medium term objectives. A risk assessment has been undertaken
relative to these objectives to ensure that there are appropriate
controls and reporting mechanisms in place in order that the Board
can manage the risk of failing to meet these objectives.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal
control for the period covered by the accounts in accordance with
the requirements of the Combined Code. During the year no
significant weaknesses have been found.
The key elements of internal control within the Group to monitor 
the key risks are described below.
Control environment
There is a clear organisation structure in place and levels of authority
are well defined and responsibility for operational control of the
overseas subsidiaries is delegated to local general managers. 
Whilst management guidelines and a comprehensive management
reporting package are in place for all subsidiaries, the Group also
monitors these controls by a number of means including regular
internal review.
Identification and evaluation of risks and control objectives
The Board has the primary responsibility for identifying and
evaluating the major risks facing the Group and developing
appropriate policies and procedures to manage them. It identifies
the key risks faced by the Group, and delegates responsibility for
managing those risks to senior management. The effectiveness 
of the risk control procedures in place are reported on at least
annually to the Board.
Financial reporting 
The Group operates a comprehensive budgeting, financial reporting
and forecasting system. Each subsidiary is required to complete
divisional management accounts on a monthly basis which compare
actual results with budget and with prior year results, these are
reviewed at both executive and board level meetings to ensure 
that variances and discrepancies are identified on a timely basis.
Towards the end of each financial year the operating businesses
prepare budgets for the following year. The Board reviews budgets
before they are formally adopted. The Group reports to its
shareholders at the half year and full year-ends.
Main control procedures
There are a number of key control procedures in place which are
reviewed on an annual basis by the Board. These cover the key risks
faced by the Group and are predominantly of an operational and
financial nature.
Monitoring systems used by the Board
The Group finance department consolidates and monitors the 
Group information monthly, and a full financial review is presented 
at each Board meeting, accompanied by relevant divisional and
Group accounts and appropriate key performance indicators for 
each subsidiary. Each Group company compiles forecasts of profits
and cash flows reflecting their current expectations which are 
also monitored by the Board. In addition the Board considers the
following matters:
> Commercial risk. All significant commercial contracts are
reported to the Board and are controlled by the use of appropriate
vetting processes and authorisation levels.

> Investment appraisal. The Group has a clearly defined framework
for controlling and reporting acquisitions, disposals and capital
expenditure including the use of appropriate authorisation levels.
> Legal matters. Significant litigation and legal matters are reported
to the Board.
> Operating business financial controls. The executive has
defined the financial controls and procedures that each operating
business is required to comply with. Key controls over major
business risks include reviews against key performance indicators
and exception reporting. The operating businesses make periodic
assessments of their exposure to major business risks and the
extent to which these risks are controlled. These are reviewed by
the executive and reported to the Board.
> Strategic planning. The executive management are responsible
for keeping the Board appraised of the Group strategy. The Board
reviews strategic plans as part of the ongoing business 
planning process. 
> Computer systems. Much of the Group’s financial management
information is processed by and stored on computer systems.
Accordingly the Group has established controls and procedures
over the security of data held on computer systems. 
> Internal audit. The Group does not have an internal audit function
although the head office team fulfils some functions of an internal
audit department and has undertaken internal audit work
throughout the financial year. The directors believe the Group falls
into the category of small for this purpose. The Audit Committee
reviews the need for an internal audit department at least annually.
Going concern
The directors confirm that, after making enquiries, they have a
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the consolidated financial statements.
By order of the Board
J R Trumper
Company Secretary
April 4, 2008 Directors’ remuneration report
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of 
the Companies Act 1985 (“the Act”) and also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good
Governance relating to directors’ remuneration. As required by the
Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting of the Company at which the consolidated financial
statements will be approved. 
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members
on the “auditable part” of the Directors’ remuneration report and 
to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been
properly prepared in accordance with the Act. The report has
therefore been divided into separate sections for the audited and
unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has a Remuneration Committee, which is constituted
in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The current members of the Remuneration Committee are Robin
Howe, who chairs the Committee, Tim Trotter and Oliver Ellingham
who are independent non-executive directors. Bob Morton also
served on the Committee prior to his retirement.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest
(other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No director
plays any part in discussions about his own remuneration. 
The Remuneration Committee has access to both internal and
external advice including, where appropriate, information on the
remuneration of similar executives in comparable organisations. 
Remuneration policy
It is the policy of the Board to ensure that remuneration packages
offered to executive directors and senior management are designed
to be competitive to attract, motivate and retain executives of the
high calibre needed for the long term development of the Group
and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. 
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for
executive directors and senior management:
> Basic annual salary (including directors’ fees) and benefits;
> Annual bonus payments;
> Share incentive schemes; and
> Pension arrangements
The Group’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of executive directors should be performance related.
As described below, executive directors may earn annual incentive
payments in addition to their basic salary together with the benefits
of participation in share incentive schemes.
As a result of the issues raised by shareholders at the 2007 Annual
General Meeting of the Company in relation to elements of the
current executive remuneration policy, the remuneration policy 
has been thoroughly reviewed by the Committee in conjunction with
its retained independent remuneration advisors, Halliwell Consulting.
As part of this process the Committee has consulted with the
Company’s principal shareholders and the main shareholder
representative bodies such as the Association of British Insurers 
(“ABI”) and the National Association of Pension Funds (“NAPF”) on 
the detailed terms of the new executive remuneration policy.
Following the period of consultation the Committee proposed 
three new incentive schemes to shareholders in a circular dated
February 21, 2008. The proposals comprised the creation of 
the following:
> A Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) – a share plan under which
conditional awards (or nil-cost options) of shares with performance
conditions attached are made at no cost to participants.
> A Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) – a share plan under which all
employees can purchase shares which subject to the retention 
of those shares and continued employment with the Company 
for three years will be matched by the Company.
> A US Share Purchase Plan – an employee share purchase plan
established as a sub-plan to the SIP which will allow US employees
to participate on similar terms to their UK counterparts.
At a General Meeting held on March 7 , 2008 all three proposals were
approved by shareholders. No awards have been made under these
schemes at the date of this report. 
Basic salary and benefits
Each executive director’s basic salary and benefits are reviewed
annually having regard to performance and are intended to be
competitive but fair using information provided from both internal
and external sources. Benefits include the provision of a car
allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance and permanent
health insurance. 
Ian Scott-Gall’s current salary of £230,000 was set on April 1, 2007

Performance related bonus
The Remuneration Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year for a cash bonus to be paid. Bonus parameters
address the financial performance of the Group as well as key goals and strategic objectives. The Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance
Director are entitled to an annual bonus agreed by the Remuneration Committee, which is limited to the achievement of specific objectives and
the underlying annual growth in the earnings per share of the business. The bonus was capped at 100% of basic annual salary. The remaining
executives have bonus plans that are based on the underlying performance of the business for which they are responsible.
For the year under review Ian Scott-Gall and James Trumper were awarded performance related bonuses of £75,920 and £49,510 respectively.
Tony Finizio has received a performance related bonus of $104,650 in respect of the performance of MRC for the year under review, under the
terms of his contractual arrangements with MRC. 
For financial years beginning January 1, 2008 cash bonuses will be earned based on two criteria to be set by the Committee, subject to a
maximum award of 100% of basic annual salary, as follows:
> A bonus of up to 50% of basic annual salary based on satisfying earnings per share growth targets; 
> A bonus of up to 50% of basic annual salary based on satisfying revenue growth targets.
Share options
Following the review of the remuneration policy referred to above, the Remuneration Committee will no longer use Share Option Schemes.
These will be replaced by the introduction of the approved LTIP , SIP and SPP . The following comments are made in respect of the historic share
option schemes and awards.
The Group operates both an Inland Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme and an Unapproved Share Option Scheme. The Group’s historic
policy was to grant options to executive directors and senior management at the discretion of the Committee taking into account individual
performance and according to their position in the Group. Generally, it was the Group’s policy to phase the granting of share options rather
than to award them in a single block to any individual. 
With the exception of certain options granted to Ian Scott-Gall in 1999, as detailed below, the exercise of options granted to executive
directors under the scheme is not dependent upon performance criteria, since the options are awarded as an incentive or for individual 
past performance. Details of total options granted during the year can be found in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Group also operates an Inland Revenue Approved Sharesave Scheme open to eligible employees (including executive directors) in the
United Kingdom who have worked for the Group for a minimum qualifying period and agree to save a fixed amount for a period of either
three or five years under an approved savings contract. Inland Revenue rules limit the maximum amount that can be saved by a participant 
to £250 per month. Options in normal circumstances are exercisable for six months following the completion of the savings contract utilising
the proceeds of the contract.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Group has introduced an LTIP following approval by shareholders on March 7 , 2008. Although no awards have been made under the
scheme at the date of this report the principal performance conditions under the scheme for the initial grant will be:
> EPS growth – the initial grant of awards has an EPS growth performance condition which has to be satisfied for the release of 50% of shares
subject to the award.
> Comparative TSR – the grant of awards has a comparative TSR performance condition which has to be satisfied for the release of 50% of
shares subject to the award.
The table below sets out the performance conditions used in conjunction with the first awards under the LTIP .

Pension arrangements
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme and it is the Group’s policy that only basic salaries are pensionable for executive
directors. For Ian Scott-Gall and James Trumper the Company contributes 20 per cent of their basic salary. Link contributed 10 per cent of Len
Mann’s salary up to March 31, 2007 . MRC match Tony Finizio’s annual contribution to the MRC 401K pension scheme of US$2,000. There are
no pension arrangements for non-executive directors. There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for current directors. Directors’ remuneration report

Performance graph
Vislink shares are quoted within the TechMARK index, and the directors believe that this provides the most appropriate comparative
performance measure. The following graph shows the Group’s performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the
performance of the TechMARK. The chart shows the theoretical change in value of a shareholding in the Company over the last five years,
assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase additional units of equity at the closing price on the ex-dividend date.
Directors’ service contracts
Ian Scott-Gall and James Trumper have a rolling 12 month service contract with the Company, which requires one year’s notice for
termination. On termination of these executive directors’ service contracts there is entitlement to predetermined compensation, linked to
annual salary and contractual benefits. Mr Scott-Gall’s contract is dated March 25, 1999 and that of Mr Trumper is dated March 23, 2000. 
Tony Finizio was appointed an executive director on December 2, 2004 and has a letter of appointment dated January 5, 2005. Mr Finizio’s
appointment is for a period of 12 months and thereafter until termination by either party not giving less than three months notice in writing.
Mr Finizio is not entitled to any directors’ fees or any other benefits in relation to his position as a director of the Company although he is
entitled to the reimbursement of expenses properly incurred in the performance of his duties. Mr Finizio’s employment as Chief Operating
Officer of the US businesses is governed by a service agreement dated August 1, 2000 with Vislink Inc. Mr Finizio is under a fixed term
contract to December 31, 2008.
Change of control
The Remuneration Committee had previously approved the creation of an Executive Exit Bonus Plan for the executive directors and other
senior management in the Group. This scheme was terminated following the approval of the new remuneration policy by shareholders on
March 7 , 2008.
The Remuneration Committee have approved a Senior Management Bonus Scheme for the senior management of Hernis Scan Systems. 
The scheme is intended to provide a reward to the senior management of Hernis in the event that Hernis is disposed of to a third party outside
of the Group. The bonus pool would be 20 per cent of the capital appreciation in the value of Hernis, after the associated costs of such a sale,
above Norwegian krone 96.0 million (£8.9 million). The scheme is capped at a gross sale consideration of Norwegian krone 165.0 million
(£15.3 million) giving a maximum bonus pool of Norwegian krone 13.8 million (£1.3 million). The scheme expires on December 31, 201 1.
Non-executive directors’ service contracts
Tim Trotter was appointed a non-executive director of the Company by way of a letter of appointment dated December 28, 2000. The initial
term of appointment is for a period of five years subject to re-election at annual general meetings of the company at which he is required to
retire by rotation. On March 1, 2005  Mr Trotter’s appointment was extended for a second term of five years with effect from January 1, 2005.
There is no provision within the contract for compensation for early termination of office.
Robin Howe was appointed a non-executive director of the Company by way of a letter of appointment dated April 4, 2006. The initial term
of appointment is for a period of five years from June 1, 2006 subject to re-election at annual general meetings of the Company at which 
he is required to retire by rotation. There is no provision within the contract for compensation for early termination of office. Len Mann and
Oliver Ellingham have a similar letters of appointment dated March 27 , 2007 and September 26, 2007 .
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on
independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies. 
The non-executive directors cannot participate in the Company’s share option schemes, do not participate in any performance related bonus
schemes and are not eligible to join the Company’s pension scheme.

AGM notice/shareholder information
To the members of Vislink plc
We have audited the Group consolidated financial statements of
Vislink plc for the year ended December 31, 2007 which comprise
the Consolidated Group income statement, the Consolidated Group
balance sheet, the Consolidated Group cash flow statement, the
Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity and the
related notes. These Group consolidated financial statements have
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of Vislink plc for the year ended December 31, 2007 
and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that 
is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group consolidated financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of
directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group consolidated financial
statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for 
and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
section 235 of the companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed
by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group consolidated
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group
consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation. We also report to you if whether, in our opinion, the
information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the Group
consolidated financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding director’s remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined
2006 Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures 
or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group consolidated
financial statements. The other information comprises only the
Directors’ report, the Chairman’s introduction, the Operating 
and financial review and the Corporate governance statement. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the Group consolidated financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the Group consolidated financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
Group consolidated financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Group consolidated financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group
consolidated financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the Group consolidated financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at December 31, 2007 and 
of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended; and 
> the Group consolidated financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
> the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with 
the Group consolidated financial statements.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements
have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities (including derivative
instruments) at fair value through the income statement. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed 
in note 4.
New accounting standards and interpretations have been issued during the year. The Group’s approach to these is as follows.
(a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007
IFRS7 , “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”, and the complementary amendment to IAS 1, “Presentation of financial instruments – Capital
disclosures”, introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of
the Group or Company’s financial instruments, or the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables.
IFRIC 8, “Scope of IFRS 2”, requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments, where the identifiable
consideration received is less than the fair value of the financial instrument issued in order to establish whether or not they fall within the
scope of IFRS 2. This standard does not have any impact on the Group or Company’s financial statements.
IFRIC 10, “Interim financial reporting and impairment”, prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill, in
investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date. This standard
does not have any impact on the Group or Company’ s financial statements.
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 but not relevant 
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2007 but are not relevant to the Group or the Company’s operations: 
> IFRS 4, “Insurance contracts”; 
> IFRIC 7 , “Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyper-inflationary economies”; and
> IFRIC 9, “Re-assessment of embedded derivatives”. 
(c) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted
early by the Group 
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s
accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2008 or later periods, but the Group and Company have not adopted them early. 
The Group is currently reviewing the impact of these standards on the future consolidated financial statements. 
> IFRIC 1 1, “IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after March 1, 2007); 
> IAS 23 (Amendment), “Borrowing costs” (effective from January 1, 2009); and
> IFRS 8, “Operating segments” (effective from January 1, 2009).

(d) Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and not relevant for the Group and Company’s operations 
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group and Company’s accounting periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2008 or later periods but are not relevant to the Group or Company’s operations: 
> IFRIC 12, “Service concession arrangements” (effective from January 1, 2008);
> IFRIC 13, “Customer loyalty programmes” (effective January 1, 2008); and
> IFRIC 14, “IAS 19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction” (effective January 1, 2008).
Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
The Group consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiaries are all entities
over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 
50 per cent of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured as
the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly
attributable to the acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are
also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries and the Company are prepared for the same reporting year as the Group, in accordance with UK
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). Adjustments are made on consolidation to bring into line any dissimilar accounting
policies that may exist. 
(b) Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, generally
accompanying a shareholding of between 20 and 50 per cent of the voting rights. 
The results and assets and liabilities of the associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net
assets of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of
acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
Segmental reporting
The Group’s internal organisational and management structure and its system of internal financial reporting to the Board of Directors is based
on the geographical location of its businesses where its products are produced and its service delivery activities are based. These comprise
three regions, the United Kingdom (UK), the United States of America (US) and Norway. The UK comprises the businesses of Advent
Communications (satellite products), CML International Projects and the wireless camera systems of Link Research. The US comprises the
microwave radio broadcast business of MRC and the technical services business of WTS. Norway comprises the marine CCTV business of
Hernis. These businesses comprise the basis for the Group’s primary segmental reporting.
Segment revenue, expenses and results include transactions between businesses. Such transactions are accounted for at competitive market
prices charged to unaffiliated customers for similar products. Inter-segmental transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
Secondary segmental reporting is provided by reference to revenue by product category and markets.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling
(GBP), which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions in the Company and its subsidiaries are translated into their functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from 
the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the 
income statement.
Other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date and other non-monetary assets at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. 43 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007
AGM notice/shareholder information
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(c) Group companies
Trading results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
> assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date;
> income and expenditure for each income statement are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year; and
> all resulting exchange differences arising from restatement of the opening balance sheets and trading results of overseas subsidiaries are
recognised as a separate component of shareholders equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and
translated at the closing rate.
Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration for the interest in subsidiary undertakings over the fair value to
the Group of the net tangible and intangible assets and any contingent liabilities acquired. Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually
for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on
the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purposes of impairment testing. The allocation is made to cash generating units that are
expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Goodwill is allocated to each business segment within the
Group’s segmental reporting.
Goodwill in associates is included in “investments in associates” and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance.
Prior to January 1, 1997 , goodwill was written-off to reserves in the year of acquisition. Goodwill arising after January 1, 1997 was amortised
over its estimated useful life; under IFRS such amortisation ceased on December 31, 2003. Since January 1, 2004 it has been subject to
impairment reviews as above.
(b) Acquired intangibles
Intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Following the initial
recognition, the carrying amount of an intangible asset is its cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged on the basis of the estimated useful life and the expense is taken to the income statement (note 13).
(c) Research and development costs
Research expenditure is written-off as incurred. 
Where development expenditure meets the criteria for capitalisation as set out in IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” the costs are capitalised and
amortised over its useful economic life from the date of commercial manufacture of the product. The key eligibility criteria for capitalisation
relate to:
> The identification of development costs. In general the Group’s research and development activities are closely inter-related and it is not
until the technical feasibility of a product can be determined with reasonable certainty that development costs are separately identifiable;
and
> The generation of future economic benefit. Intangible assets are not recognised unless the resultant product is expected to generate future
economic benefit in excess of the amount capitalised.
Development costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the products with which they are associated. Amortisation commences
when a new product is in commercial production. The average amortisation period is three years. If a product becomes unviable the deferred
development costs are written-off. 
Investments
All investments are initially recorded at cost, being the fair value of consideration given including the acquisition costs associated with the
investment. Subsequently they are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis, if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
value may not be fully recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment
T angible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated in order to write off the cost of property plant and equipment, other than land, over their estimated useful lives by
equal annual instalments using the following rates:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2%
Leasehold improvements The remaining term of the lease
Plant, tools, test and computer equipment 10%–33%
Fixtures and fittings 10%
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of
completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work
performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs
incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Inventory and work in progress
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on normal levels of cost and activity and comprises cost of
purchase and, where applicable, cost of conversion to current condition. Cost of purchase includes charges such as freight or duty where
appropriate. Cost of conversion includes direct labour, direct expenses and fixed and variable production overhead expenditure.
Net realisable value comprises the actual or estimated selling price (net of trade but before settlement discounts), less all further costs to
completion, and less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Work in progress is stated net of amounts taken to cost of sales under long term contracts. The amount by which turnover exceeds a
payment received on account is included in debtors as amounts recoverable on long term contracts. Payments on account in excess of work
in progress are included in creditors as payments received on account.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, being the original invoice amount, less provision for impairment. A provision for
impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the
original terms of the receivable. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or delinquency in payments (more than 30 days’
overdue) are considered indicators that a trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s
carrying value and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an
allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within “sales and marketing costs”. When a trade
receivable is uncollectible it is written-off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written-off are credited
against “sales and marketing costs” within the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of
less than three months, reduced by overdrafts to the extent that there is a right of offset against other cash balances.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short term deposits as defined
above net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Proceeds in excess of the nominal value of shares issued are allocated to the share premium account
and are also classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are deducted from the
share premium account. 
Where shares are issued in part or full consideration for the acquisition of more than 90 per cent of the issued share capital of another
company, the excess of value attributed to the shares over the nominal value of shares issued is allocated to the merger reserve. The merger
reserve is also classified as equity.
Where any group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any directly
attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs, is included in equity
attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised at fair value. Payables are discounted to their present value using the effective interest method only where the
impact is significant.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised at the fair value of proceeds received. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Borrowing costs are expensed in the income statement under the heading “finance costs”. Arrangement and facility fees together with bank
charges are charged to the income statement under the heading “administrative costs”. 45 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Current and deferred taxation
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the
countries where the Company’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management evaluates positions taken in
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred corporation tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of all
temporary differences except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill in business combinations. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and tax losses, to the extent
that they are regarded as recoverable. They are regarded as recoverable where, on the basis of available evidence, there will be suitable
taxable profits against which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted. The carrying value of the amount
of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable
profit will be available to allow all, or part, of the tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred corporation tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or
the liability is settled, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.
Employee benefits
(a) Pension obligations
The Group employees are members of defined contribution money purchase schemes where the obligations of Group companies are
charged to the profit and loss account as they are incurred. The Group has no further obligations once the contributions have been paid.
(b) Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share based compensation plans. The fair value of employee share plans is calculated using
an option-pricing model. In accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based payments” the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the
vesting period of the plans. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual levels of options vesting.
(c) Employee Share Ownership Plan
The Group’s Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) is a separately administered trust. The Company guarantees liabilities of the ESOP , and
the assets of the ESOP mainly comprise shares in the Company. The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP have been included in the
consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Provisions
Provisions are made in respect of residual onerous long leasehold properties where expected future rental costs are in excess of expected
income from subletting. 
Provision is made for product warranty claims to the extent that the Group has a current obligation under warranties given. Warranty accruals
are based on historic warranty claims experience. Provisions are discounted to their present value where the impact is significant.
Revenue recognition
(a) Sale of goods and services
Revenue represents net amounts receivable from outside customers for goods sold by Group companies in the ordinary course of business
and excluding value added tax. Sales are recognised in accordance with IAS 18 “Revenue”, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership
of the goods are transferred to the customer, the sales price agreed and the receipt of payment can be assured. 
Long term contracts are recognised in revenue on the basis of the sales value of work performed during the year by reference to expenditure
to date as a percentage of total expected costs to complete on a contract-by-contract basis. 
(b) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time apportionment basis.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts and currency swaps to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange rates. These financial
instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. Any changes in fair value are
charged to the profit and loss account. 
The Group’s policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculation. The Group does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
purposes. 
None of the Group’s derivative contracts qualify for hedge accounting and are valued (i.e. by marking to market) at the balance sheet date
and any resulting profits or losses are taken to the income statement. 
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

3 Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk) credit and liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of the financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
Risk management policy is carried out through a central treasury function within the executive management team at the Group’s head
office. The treasury function identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. The Board
provides written principles for overall risk management whilst the central treasury function provides specific policy guidance for the operating
units in terms of managing foreign exchange risk, credit risk, cash and liquidity management and the use of hedging instruments.
(a) Market risk 
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily between the 
US dollar and GBP and to a lesser extent between the Norwegian Krone and GBP . Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial
transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
At a transactional level the UK business units have a neutral exposure to foreign currency transactions, in that their revenues in Euros and 
US dollars match their purchases. Foreign currency bank accounts are maintained to minimise exchange risk by trading currencies into sterling
only when forecast surpluses or deficits are expected to arise. Hernis, the Group’s Norwegian subsidiary has a net exposure to revenues in 
US dollars and enters into forward contracts to fix its income from predicted future currency inflows. Approximately 35 per cent of Hernis’
sales are in US dollars. The US business of MRC has an exposure to purchases from the UK subsidiaries in GBP . Approximately 35 per cent of
MRC’s cost of goods sold comes from its fellow subsidiaries in the UK. The flow of cash from MRC to the UK businesses is managed by central
treasury through forward contracts and swaps in order to minimise the risk to both MRC and the Group. As at December 31, 2007 the Group
had hedged US$7 .0 million of payments to the UK for the period to June 30, 2008 by way of forward contracts.
The exchange risk to the Group in terms of its reported results lies in the translation of the results of the US business from US dollars to GBP
and to a lesser extent on the translation of the results of Hernis, the Norwegian business. The Group’s accounting policy is to translate the
profits and losses of overseas operations using the average exchange rate for the financial year and the net assets and liabilities of overseas
subsidiaries at the year-end exchange rate. It continues to be the Group’s policy not to hedge the foreign currency exposures on the
translation of overseas profits or losses and net assets or liabilities to sterling as they are considered to be accounting rather than cash
exposures.
The principal exchange rates used by the Group in translating overseas profits and net assets into GBP are set out in the table below.
Average rate, Average rate, Year-end rate, Year-end rate, 
Rate compared to GBP 2007 2006 2007 2006
US dollar 2.00 1.84 1.99 1.96
Norwegian Krone 1 1.72 1 1.81 10.81 12.19
At December 31, 2007 if the US dollar had weakened by 5 cents (2.5 per cent) against the GBP with all other variables held constant, post 
tax profits for the year would have been £128,000 lower (2006 lower by £166,000) as a result of foreign exchange losses on translation of 
US dollar denominated profits and GBP based liabilities in the books of US subsidiaries. Profit is less sensitive in 2007 than in 2006 due to 
the lower level of dollar denominated trading. Equity would have been £401,000 lower (2006 – £430,000 lower) due to foreign exchange
losses on the translation of the net investments in dollar denominated overseas operations.  47 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007
3 Financial risk management continued
(ii) Cash flow and interest rate risk
The Group has no significant interest bearing assets; the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes
in market interest rates.
At December 31, 2007 the undrawn balance on the three-year revolving credit facility was £19.0 million. The loan represents the Group’s
most significant exposure to interest rate risk. The Board reviews and agrees the policy for managing interest rate risk, and the policies have
not changed during the financial year or since. Full details of the Group’s borrowings are given in note 23 to the financial statements.
Had the average interest rate been 100 basis points higher or lower in 2007 then the Group’s post tax profits would not have been materially
different due to the relatively low level of net borrowings during the year.
The Group’s policy in relation to the finance of its overseas operations requires that sufficient liquid funds be maintained in each of its 
territory subsidiaries to support short and medium term operational plans. Where necessary short term funding is provided by the holding
company. In the UK the working capital bank facility and the management of liquid funds in excess of operational needs are controlled
centrally. Typically excess funds are placed as short term deposits, to provide a balance between interest earnings and flexibility.
It is the Group’s policy not to trade in financial instruments. The Group does not use interest rate swaps. The Group does not speculate 
in foreign currencies and no operating company is permitted to take unmatched positions in any foreign currency. The Group will use
borrowings in currencies other than GBP where appropriate to specific transactions, such as overseas acquisitions. This policy has been 
in force throughout the financial year and remains so.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the sale of goods and services to customers. It is the Group policy to obtain deposits from customers where possible,
particularly overseas customers. In addition the Group will seek confirmed letters of credit for the balances due. The nature of the customer
base (for example national TV stations, government procurement agencies) makes the use of credit insurance inappropriate. Credit risk is
managed at the operating business unit level and monitored at the Group level to ensure adherence to Group policies.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group’s liquidity risk management policy is to maintain sufficient cash and available funding through an adequate amount of committed
credit facilities from its bankers. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, central treasury aims to maintain flexibility in
funding by keeping committed credit lines available, as disclosed in note 23.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Consistent with other businesses the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by
total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including “current and non-current borrowings” as shown in the consolidated balance
sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is the sum of net debt plus equity.
The Group is currently ungeared, having net cash. It is the stated strategy of the Group to grow both organically and through acquisition.
Acquisitions would be funded through an appropriate combination of equity and borrowings. Future gearing would not be expected to
exceed 50 per cent.
Fair value estimation
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their book value. In the case of
bank loans due in more than one year the fair value of the financial liability is also assumed to be the current book value by virtue of the fact
that any discounting applied would not be at a significantly different discount rate as the current rate of interest being paid on the loans. 
In the case of other non-current liabilities due after more than one year the future cash flows are discounted in arriving at the book value 
and therefore book value equates to fair value. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined by using quoted forward 
exchange rates at the balance sheet date.

4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made accounting judgements in the determination of the
carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual
outcomes will differ from those assumptions and estimates. The following judgements have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the financial statements.
Acquired intangibles
Intangible assets (intellectual property rights and customer relationships) were deemed to have been acquired as part of the net assets of Link
Research Limited in 2005 and Western Technical Services in 2007 . These intangible assets were capitalised at their fair value at the date of
acquisition. Determining the value of acquired intangibles required the calculation of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the
intangible assets at a suitable discount rate in order to calculate their present value. In addition an estimate of the useful life of the intangible
asset has to be made, over which period the cash flows were expected to be generated. The carrying amount of acquired intangibles at the
balance sheet date was £3.6 million (note 13). 
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires the estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been
allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit at a
suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £24.4 million.
Details of the impairment review are provided in note 12. 
Deferred tax assets
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on sufficient taxable profits being generated in certain territories in future periods. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the balance sheet date was £0.6 million (note 27). In addition there were £3.2 million of
deferred tax assets not recognised.
Warranty provisions
Included within the balance sheet are warranty provisions amounting to £1.2 million (2006 – £1.0 million) (note 26). Management believes
that these provisions are adequate to cover the future risk of product warranty claims based on historic claims history applied to the current
revenue levels.
Impairment of trade receivables
The carrying amount of receivables at year-end was £22.0 million (2006 – £16.1 million), against which there was an impairment provision 
of £0.5 million (2006 – £0.5 million) (note 19). Trade receivables that are less than three months past due are not considered impaired 
unless there are specific financial or commercial reasons that lead management to conclude that the customer will default. Older debts 
are considered to be impaired unless there is sufficient evidence to the contrary that they will be settled. Management believe that the
provision is adequate to cover the risk of bad debts.
Inventory provisions
The carrying amount of inventory at year-end was £15.8 million (2006 – £14.5 million) after a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of
£2.3 million (2006 – £3.3 million) (note 17). During the year £1.4 million of the provision was utilised following the scrapping and sale of
obsolete inventory. The provision was increased by £0.4 million as part of the on-going provisioning review with the charge being made to
cost of sales in the income statement. Management believe that the provision is adequate to cover the risk of obsolete and excess inventory.
Share-based payments
A number of accounting estimates and judgements are incorporated within the calculation of the charge to the income statement in respect
of share-based payments. These are described in more detail in note 29.  49 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007

Foreign tax 3,633 5, 1 18

Deferred tax
UK corporation tax (166) (264)
Foreign tax 357 (237)
Total deferred tax 191 (501)
Total taxation 5,026 4,968
UK Corporation tax is calculated at 30 per cent (2006 – 30 per cent) of the estimated assessable profit for the year. Foreign corporation taxes
for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
There is no tax impact associated with items that have been taken directly to equity. There is no tax impact for the Group associated with the
dividend proposed (note 10).
b) Factors affecting tax charge for period
The current tax charge for the period is higher (2006 – higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK (30 per cent).
The differences are explained below:

Capital allowances less/(greater) than depreciation 52 (89)
Other timing differences 238 (53)
Total taxation 5,026 4,968
c) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The Group will be able to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation and to utilise the benefit from UK tax losses, which will reduce UK
tax payments in respect of future years.
The Group’s overseas tax rate is higher than those in the UK primarily because the profits earned in the United States are taxed at a rate 
of 40 per cent.
As part of the current year tax charge the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recalculated at a tax rate of 28 per cent (2006 – 
30 per cent) to reflect the future rate of corporation tax at which they are expected to crystallise. The effect on the overall Group tax charge
has not been material. 55 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007

£000 £000 
Final dividend paid of 1.00 pence per share (2006 – 0.50 pence per share) 1,381 681
In addition the directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ending December 31, 2007 of 1.25 pence per share
which will absorb an estimated £1,732,000 of shareholders’ funds. It will be paid on July 18, 2008 to shareholders who are on the register of
members on June 27 , 2008.
1 1 Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive
potential ordinary shares. The dilutive shares are those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average
market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Diluted earnings per share 8,930 138,765 6.44p 7 ,707 138,589 5.56p
Adjusted earnings
The directors believe that adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share provide
additional useful information on underlying trends to shareholders. These measures are used by management for internal performance
analysis and incentive compensation arrangements. The term “adjusted” is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be
comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies. The principal adjustments are made in respect of the
amortisation of acquired intangibles.
The reconciliation between reported and underlying earnings and basic earnings per share is shown below:

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from
that business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those
regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimates
discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. 
The growth rates are based on management’s expectations sourced from the Group’s strategic plans, and thereafter a terminal growth rate
of 3 per cent is used. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
For Link Research, MRC and WTS the goodwill was reviewed for impairment as at December 31, 2007 in accordance with IAS 36. 
The expected cash flows for the next two years, sourced from the Group’s business plans for each CGU, exceed the current book value 
of goodwill. Therefore goodwill is not considered to be have been impaired.
An impairment review has been undertaken in respect of the goodwill associated with the Advent satellite operation. The basis for the review
was to assess the strategic plans for the business and to discount the future expected cash flows using the Group’s weighted average cost of
capital (WACC) in accordance with IAS36 “Impairment of Assets”. The Group’s estimated WACC was 10.5 per cent. This figure is based on a
cost of equity of 10.3 per cent (using the capital asset pricing model and a beta of 0.689 sourced from Bloomberg) and a cost of debt of
6.25 per cent. The WACC reflects the Group’s mix of debt and equity.
The Board considered the estimated discounted cash flows for the Advent satellite operation from the business plan for the next two years
and the Group’s strategic plan for the following three years. Thereafter growth at the rate of 3 per cent was assumed to be reasonable. 
The Board also applied various sensitivity analyses to the expected cash flows, paying particular regard to shortfalls in sales growth and
anticipated margin improvements. The Board also reviewed the performance of Advent in 2007 against the prior year projections used in 
the impairment review last year. Having reviewed all the relevant calculations and the sensitivities the Board are satisfied that, based on the
current and past projections for the businesses, there has not been an impairment of goodwill in 2007 . 57 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and unrelated. Due to
this management believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables. The value
of fully performing receivables at December 31, 2007 is £13,219,000 (2006 – £6, 189,000).
Trade receivables that are less than three months past due are not considered impaired unless there are specific financial or commercial
reasons that lead management to conclude that the customer will default. At December 31, 2007 trade receivables of £8,253,000 (2006 –
£9,454,000) were past due but not impaired. The credit quality of the Group’s customers is good, being a combination of large broadcast
stations (public and private); shipping, oil and gas businesses, government agencies and departments. Controls within Group companies are
in place to ensure that appropriate credit limits are in place. The overdue amounts relate to customers with no history of default. The ageing
of these receivables is as follows:

At December 31, 2007 trade receivables of £496,000 (2006: £487 ,000) were impaired and provided for in whole or in part. The provision of
£496,000 (2006: £487 ,000) is set against specific customer debts. In general customer debts that are considered impaired are as a result of
contractual disputes rather than as a result of customer cash flow difficulties. The ageing of these receivables is as follows:

Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written-off, when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable mentioned above. The Group does not
hold any collateral as security.

The bank loans and overdrafts are secured by fixed and floating charges over the Group’s assets and by cross-guarantees between the
Company and certain UK and US subsidiaries. All borrowings are denominated in pounds sterling. The fair value of borrowings equals their
carrying amount as the impact of discounting is not significant. The finance leases are denominated in US dollars.
Bank loans bear interest at floating rates detailed below. No interest is borne on other financial liabilities totalling £1, 178,000 which comprise
provisions for warranty costs as described in note 26. Other than a warranty provision of US$1,047 ,000 (£526,000) provisions are
denominated in GB pounds sterling.
The Group has a revolving facility of £20,000,000 drawn on a monthly basis. Interest is charged at 1.0 per cent over LIBOR.
Unsecured borrowings comprise loan notes issued to the former shareholders in Link Research Limited of £2,500,000 (2006 – £1,750,000).
The Group does not use interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings. The effective interest
rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows:
2007 2006
Bank overdraft 6.50% 6.00%
Bank borrowings – revolving credit 7.1 1% 6.25%

Deferred consideration for acquisitions 1,332 –
The Vendors of Western Technical Services are entitled to deferred consideration calculated on the basis of the financial trading performance
of the business. The maximum deferred consideration that can be earned is $3.0 million (£1.5 million) between 2008 and 2010, with
payments being made within three months of the end of each financial year. The deferred consideration has been discounted to its present
value at the rate of 6.75%.
During 2007 £185,000 (2006 – £223,000) of discount has unwound and has been charged to finance costs in respect of deferred
consideration (note 8). Of this, £32,000 relates to the acquisition of WTS and £153,000 to the acquisition of Link Research Limited.
25 Financial instruments
Numerical financial instrument disclosures are set out below. Additional disclosures are set out in the accounting policies (notes 2 to 4) and
also in note 23.
Currency derivatives
The Group, from time to time, utilises currency derivatives in the form of forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge significant 
future transactions and cash flows. The forward contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group’s principal markets. 
The accounting policies for financial instruments have been applied to the line items below:
2007 2006 2007 2006
Assets Assets Liabilities Liabilities
£000 £000 £000 £000
Forward foreign exchange contracts – cash flow hedges 25 – 11 –
Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability as the maturity of the forward contracts is within 12 months.
At the balance sheet date the Group had contracted to sell US dollars under forward contracts. These contracts are in place to address
specific exchange exposures in the first half of 2008. At December 31, 2007 the fair value of the forward contracts was estimated to be
£3,516,000 (2006 – £nil) based on a marked to market valuation at the balance sheet date. The fair value has been charged to “other losses”
in the consolidated income statement.
At the balance sheet date the Group held no currency swaps (2006 – swaps with a nominal value of US$5.0 million with a fair value of £nil).
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity
The Group has no foreign currency borrowings which it has designated as a hedge against its investment in its subsidiaries in the USA 
and Norway. 65 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007

27 Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate appropriate to the country in which the
deferred tax liability or asset has arisen. 
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences to the extent that they are regarded as
recoverable against future profits. No deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries. As the earnings are
continually reinvested by the Group no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

Executive and SAYE options granted after November 7 , 2002 are valued using the Black Scholes option pricing model. There are no
performance conditions included in the fair value calculations. The Group has no obligation, legal or constructive, to settle the options 
in cash.
The fair value of the options granted during the year was £39,000 (2006 – £206,000). The significant assumptions used in the calculation 
of fair value were as follows:

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years. The risk free
rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
The Group recognised total expenses of £1 19,000 (2006 – £122,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year.

35 Acquisitions
On July 30, 2007 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Focus Communications, Inc trading as Western Technical Services
(“WTS”).
The maximum cash consideration, excluding acquisition costs and dependent on performance, is US$5.5 million (£2.7 million). 
The initial consideration was US$2.5 million (£1.2 million) and a further US$3.0 million (£1.5 million) is payable over three years dependent 
on performance.
Below is a summary of the valuation of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired and the calculation of goodwill:

Cash consideration (including acquisition costs of US$194,000) 2,693 1,352
Cash and cash equivalents acquired (122) (61)
2,571 1,291
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of WTS is attributable to the anticipated growth in profitability of the business and the future operating
synergies with other Group companies.
The deferred consideration of US$3.0 million (£1.5 million) payable over the next three years has been discounted to its present value at a rate
of 6.75 per cent to US$2.59 million (£1.30 million) at the date of acquisition.
In the period to December 31, 2007 an interest charge of £32,000 has been made to reflect the increase in the present value of the deferred
consideration at December 31, 2007 .
WTS contributed revenue of £838,000 and an operating profit of £6,000 to the Group in the period after acquisition. If the acquisition of
WTS had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have increased by £837 ,000 and Group
profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have reduced by £163,000. 73 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007
36 Contingent liabilities and commitments
The Group has contingent liabilities of approximately £1.2 million in respect of performance bonds, advance payment guarantees, terminable
indemnities, documentary credits and bills of exchange at December 31, 2007 (2006 – £3.3 million).

The aggregate future minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

The Group leases a number of office and factory premises under operating leases. None of these leases contain contingent rentals.
The Group has capital expenditure contracted for but not provided at December 31, 2007 of £nil (2006 – £325,000).
Share options granted between April 5, 1999 and April 5, 2002 under unapproved schemes are subject to employers’ and employees’
national insurance on the gain made on the exercise of such options by UK employees. At December 31, 2007 an accrual of £14,000 has
been made in respect of this liability (2006 – £24,000).
37 Pensions

1 Accounting policies
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985. They have been prepared under
the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
A summary of the more important accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to
previous policies on adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
Investments
All investments are initially recorded at cost, being the fair value of consideration given including the acquisition costs associated with the
investment. Subsequently they are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis, if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
value may not be fully recoverable.
Tangible fixed assets
T angible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated in order to write-off the cost of property plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives by equal annual
instalments using the following rates:
Plant and computer equipment10%–33%
Deferred taxation
Deferred corporation tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in respect of all
temporary differences except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill in business combinations. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and tax losses, to the extent
that they are regarded as recoverable. They are regarded as recoverable where, on the basis of available evidence, there will be suitable
taxable profits against which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted. The carrying value of the amount
of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable
profit will be available to allow all, or part, of the tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred corporation tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or
the liability is settled, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date and
non-monetary assets at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Instruments qualify for hedge
accounting where the underlying asset or liability has characteristics, which can be directly related to the instrument transacted. The gains
and losses on those instruments qualifying for hedge accounting are recognised in the financial statements over the life of the transaction.
Where a derivative financial instrument no longer meets the criteria for a hedge, the instrument is restated at market value and any gains 
or losses are taken directly to the profit and loss account. The Group excludes all short term debtors and creditors from the derivatives and
financial instruments disclosed other than those on currency risk relating to monetary assets and liabilities. 79 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007

1 Accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
The fair value of employee share plans is calculated using an option-pricing model. In accordance with FRS 20 “Share-based payments” the
resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the plans. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect the
expected and actual levels of options vesting.
Dividends
Under FRS 21 dividends are not to be recognised as a creditor until the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Pensions
Company employees are members of money purchase schemes where the obligations of the Company are charged to the profit and loss
account as they are incurred.
Changes in accounting policies
The Company has adopted FRS 29, “Financial instruments: Disclosures”. The adoption of this standard represents a change in accounting
policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly. There is no prior year adjustment to reserves resulting from adopting this
standard, as its provisions relate to disclosure.
2 Profit for the year
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account, 
statement of total recognised gains and losses and cash flow statement for the year. Vislink plc reported a loss for the financial year of
£1,380,000 (2006 – profit of £1,518,000).
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in SSAP 25 and no geographical or segmental analysis of results is provided as this
analysis is disclosed in note 5 to the Consolidated Group financial statements.

The directors approved the financial statements on April 4, 2008. Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of Vislink plc
85 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Vislink
plc for the year ended December 31, 2007 which comprise the
balance sheet and the related notes. These parent company financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set
out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
remuneration report that is described as having been audited
We have reported separately on the consolidated Group financial
statements of Vislink plc for the year ended December 31, 2007 .
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ remuneration report and the parent company financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom  Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in accordance with section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you
whether, in our opinion, the information given in the Directors’ 
report is consistent with the parent company financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company
financial statements. The other information comprises only the
Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration
report, the Chairman’s introduction and the Operating and financial
review. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be
audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
parent company financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent company financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the parent company financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at
December 31, 2007; and
> the parent company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
> the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
parent company financial statements.

Notes
1. Shareholders are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any
of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at
the Annual General Meeting. A shareholder may appoint more
than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights
attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. 
A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company. A form of
proxy which may be used to make such appointment and give
proxy instructions accompanies this notice.
2. T o be valid any form of proxy or other instrument appointing a
proxy must be received by post or (during normal business hours
only) by hand at Vislink plc, c/o Computershare Services plc, 
PO Box 82, The Pavilions, Bridgewater Road, Bristol BS99 7NH 
no later than 12.00 noon on May 19, 2008, or 48 hours before
the time of any adjourned meeting.
3. The return of a completed form of proxy, other such instrument
or any CREST Proxy Instruction (as described in paragraph 8
below) will not prevent a shareholder attending the Annual
General Meeting and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so.
4. If you are a person who has been nominated under section 146
of the 2006 Act to enjoy nomination rights (a “Nominated
Person”) you may, under an agreement between you and the
member of the Company who has nominated you, have a right
to be appointed (or have someone else appointed) as a proxy 
for the Annual General Meeting. If you do not have such a proxy
appointment right, or you do but do not wish to exercise it, you
may have a right to give instructions to the member who has
appointed you as to the exercise of voting rights.
5. If you are a Nominated Person, the statement of the rights 
of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in
paragraphs 1 to 3 above do not apply. The rights described in
these paragraphs can only be exercised by registered
shareholders of the Company.
6. To be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting
(and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of
the votes they may cast), shareholders must be registered in the
Register of Members of the Company at 6.00 pm on May 19,
2008 (or, in the event of any adjournment, by 6.00 pm on 
the day, two days before the day of the adjourned meeting).
Changes to the Register of Members after the relevant deadline
shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to
attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting.
7 . CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by
using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST
Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and
those CREST members who have appointed a voting service
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on
their behalf.
8. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using 
the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated 
in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (“EUI”)’s
specifications, and must contain the information required for
such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual. The message,
regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy
or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously
appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so 
as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID 3RA50) by 12.00 am
on May 19, 2008. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be
taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied
to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the
issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST
in the manner prescribed by CREST . After this time any change 
of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the appointee through other means.

9. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, 
or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make
available special procedures in CREST for any particular message.
Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply 
in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if 
the CREST member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored
member, or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to
procure that his/her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)
take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a
message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any
particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are
referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
10. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
1 1. The Company, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated
Securities Regulations 2001, specifies that only those
shareholders registered on the Register of Members of the
Company as at 6.00 pm on May 19, 2008 (“the specified time”)
shall be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General
Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their
name at that time. Changes to entries on the Register of
Members after the specified time shall be disregarded in
determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the
Annual General Meeting. If the Annual General Meeting is
adjourned the shareholders, to be so entitled, must have been
entered on the Register of Members at a time which is 48 hours
before the time fixed for the adjourned meeting or, if the
Company gives notice of the adjourned meeting, at the time
specified on that notice.
12. Shareholders should note that it is possible that, pursuant to
requests made by shareholders under section 527 of the 2006
Act, the Company may be required to publish on a website a
statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the
Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the
conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual
General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an
auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous
meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in
accordance with section 437 of the 2006 Act. The Company
may not require the shareholders requesting any such website
publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 
or 528 of the 2006 Act. Where the Company is required to place
a statement on a website under section 527 of the 2006 Act, it
must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later
than the time when it makes the statement available on the
website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual
General Meeting includes any statement that the Company has
been required under section 527 of the 2006 Act to publish 
on a website.
13. As at April 4, 2008 (being the last business day prior to the
publication of this Notice) the Company’s issued share capital
consists of 138,593,588 ordinary shares, carrying one vote 
each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company 
are 138,593,588.
14. You may not use any electronic address provided within this
notice or any related documents (including the form of proxy) to
communicate with the Company other than as expressly stated.
15. Copies of:
> the directors’ service contracts or letters of appointment;
> the Company’s current Articles of Association, and the
Company’s proposed new Articles of Association marked to
show the changes made to the current Articles; and
> the Company’s proposed Articles of Association as amended by
Resolution 1 1 marked to show the changes made to the
proposed new Articles of Association
will be available for inspection between the date of this notice and
the Annual General Meeting at the Company’s registered office and
at the venue of the Annual General Meeting for 15 minutes prior 
to the commencement of the Annual General Meeting until 
its conclusion. Explanatory notes
89 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007
To the Notice of the Annual General Meeting
Resolution 1: Reports and Accounts
The directors are required by law to present to the Annual General
Meeting the audited accounts and the reports of the directors and
the auditors contained in the Annual Report and Accounts.
Resolution 2: Directors’ remuneration report
The Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the
Company to produce a yearly report on directors’ remuneration 
and to put an annual resolution to shareholders for approval 
of that report. The Directors’ remuneration report for which 
approval is sought is set out on pages 32 to 36 of the Annual Report
and Accounts.
Resolution 3: Declaration of dividend
Final dividends must be approved by shareholders but cannot exceed
the amount recommended by the directors. If the Annual General
Meeting approves resolution 3, the final dividend in respect of 2007
of 1.25 pence per ordinary share will be paid on July 18, 2008 to
holders of ordinary shares who are on the register of shareholders 
on June 27 , 2008 in respect of each ordinary share.
Resolutions 4 – 6: Election and re-election of directors
Under the Company’s Articles of Association one-third of the
directors must retire at each Annual General Meeting. All retiring
directors are eligible to seek re-election by shareholders if they so
wish. Mr J R Trumper and Mr A Finizio retire by rotation and, in
accordance with the Articles of Association and being eligible, offer
themselves for re-election.
In addition, the Company’s Articles of Association require any new
directors appointed by the Board to retire from office and offer
themselves for election by shareholders at the next Annual 
General Meeting following their appointment. Mr O B Ellingham 
was appointed by the Board as a non-executive director with effect
from October 1, 2007 and is therefore now seeking election 
by shareholders.
Biographical details of the directors standing for election are set out
on page 24 of this Annual Report and Accounts and re-election
details are on page 25. In compliance with the combined code,
Messrs Trumper, Finizio and Ellingham have not participated in
discussions on their own election or re-election; the remainder of the
Board have, however, reviewed their positions and wholeheartedly
support their election and re-election as directors. In the case of the 
non-executive directors, the Board has reviewed their independence
and confirms that they remain fully independent of management.
Resolution 7: Re-appointment of auditors
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general
meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company, 
to hold office until the end of the next such meeting.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated that they are willing 
to continue in office as the Company’s auditors for another year.
Accordingly, this resolution proposes their reappointment and, in
accordance with standard practice, gives authority to the directors 
to determine their remuneration.
Resolution 8: Disapplication of pre-emption rights
If equity securities are to be allotted for cash, section 89(1) of the
1985 Act requires that those equity securities are offered first to
existing shareholders in proportion to the number of shares held by
them at the time of the offer and then in compliance with the
technical requirements of the 1985 Act.
This resolution, if passed, will allow the directors to allot shares and/or
sell treasury shares for cash without the need to first offer them to
existing shareholders in accordance with the 1985 Act. This power is
limited to the allotments of equity securities and/or sale of treasury
shares for cash up to a maximum nominal amount of £173,241,
which is equivalent to 5 per cent of the total issued ordinary share
capital of the Company as at April 4, 2008 and allotments of equity
securities and/or sale of treasury shares in connection with a rights
issue or other offer to shareholders, subject to the directors’ ability to
make arrangements to deal with certain legal or practical problems
arising in connection with such offer. This power will expire at the
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2009 or 15 months
after the date of passing of the resolution, whichever is the earlier.
Resolution 9: Purchase of own shares
The directors believe that it is in the interests of the Company and its
shareholders to continue to have the flexibility to purchase its own
shares and this resolution seeks authority from shareholders to do 
so. The Board has no immediate intention of using this authority,
moreover the directors would only intend to exercise this authority
where, after considering market conditions prevailing at the 
time, they believed that the effect of such exercise would be to
increase the earnings per share and be in the best interests of
shareholders generally.
The effect of such purchases would either be to cancel the number
of shares in issue or the directors may elect to hold them in treasury
pursuant to the Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury
Shares) Regulations 2003 (the “Regulations”), which came into force
on December 1, 2003.

90 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007
The Regulations enable certain listed companies to hold shares in
treasury, as an alternative to cancelling them, following a purchase of
own shares by a company in accordance with the 1985 Act. Shares
held in treasury may subsequently be cancelled, sold for cash or used
to satisfy share options and share awards under an employee share
scheme. Once held in treasury, a company is not entitled to exercise
any rights, including the right to attend and vote at meetings in
respect of the shares. Further, no dividend or other distribution of the
Company’s assets may be made to the Company in respect of the
treasury shares. The Company would consider holding any of its own
shares purchased as treasury shares as this would give the Company
the ability to re-issue treasury shares quickly and cost effectively 
and would provide additional flexibility in the management of 
its capital base.
This resolution if passed would renew the authority given at the
Annual General Meeting held on May 23, 2007 and would be limited
to 13,859,358 ordinary shares, representing approximately 10 per
cent of the issued share capital as at April 4, 2008. The directors 
intend to seek renewal of this power at each subsequent Annual
General Meeting.
As of April 4, 2008 there were options outstanding over 3,433, 198
shares, representing 2.5 per cent of the Company’s issued share
capital (excluding treasury shares). If the authority to buy back shares 
given by this resolution were exercised in full, this would represent 
2.8 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding 
treasury shares).
Resolution 10 – Adoption of new Articles of Association
The directors are also asking shareholders to approve the adoption 
by the Company of new Articles of Association (the “New Articles”)
primarily to take account of changes in English company law brought
about by the 2006 Act. The principal changes introduced in the 
New Articles are summarised on page 91 of this Annual Report and
Accounts. Other changes, which are of a minor, technical or clarifying
nature, have not been noted. A copy of the New Articles marked 
to show changes being proposed by Resolution 10 to the existing
Articles are available for inspection, as noted within the Notice of
Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 1 1 – Amendment of the New Articles
The 2006 Act is being implemented in phases with a phase expected
to come into force on October 1, 2008. It is proposed to make
further revisions to the New Articles with effect on and from October
1, 2008 to cater for changes being introduced by the 2006 Act from
this date relating to directors’ conflicts of interest. Resolution 1 1 also
caters for the directors’ conflicts of interest provisions of the 2006 Act
being brought into force at a later date. A copy of the revised New
Articles marked to show changes being proposed by Resolution 1 1 
to the New Articles are available for inspection, as noted within the
Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Due to the phased implementation of the 2006 Act, it is likely that
further related changes to the Articles of Association will be proposed
at a future Annual General Meeting to incorporate provisions
currently scheduled to come into force at a later time. Summary of the principal proposed changes 
to the Company’s Articles of Association
91 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007
1. Articles which replicate statutory provisions
Provisions in the Company’s current Articles of Association (“Current
Articles”) which contradict provisions contained in the 2006 Act are
in the main amended to bring them into line with the 2006 Act.
2. Form of resolution
The Current Articles contain a provision that, where for any purpose
an ordinary resolution is required, a special or extraordinary resolution
is also effective and that, where an extraordinary resolution is
required, a special resolution is also effective. This provision is being
amended as the concept of extraordinary resolutions has not been
retained under the 2006 Act.
The Current Articles enable shareholders to act by written resolution.
Under the 2006 Act public companies can no longer pass written
resolutions. These provisions are not therefore being incorporated in
the New Articles.
3. Convening General Meetings
The provisions in the Current Articles dealing with the convening of
general meetings and the length of notice required to convene
general meetings are being amended to conform to new provisions
in the 2006 Act. In particular a general meeting to consider a special
resolution can be convened on 14 days’ notice whereas previously 
21 days’ notice was required.
4. Votes of shareholders
Under the 2006 Act proxies are entitled to vote on a show of hands
whereas under the Current Articles proxies are only entitled to vote
on a poll. Multiple proxies may be appointed provided that each
proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different 
share held by the shareholder. The New Articles reflect these 
new provisions.
5. Conflicts of interest
The 2006 Act sets out directors’ general duties, which largely codify
the existing law, but with some changes. Under the 2006 Act, from
October 1, 2008 a director must avoid a situation where he/she has,
or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may
conflict with the Company’s interests. The requirement is very broad
and could apply, for example, if a director becomes a director of
another company or a trustee of another organisation. The 2006 
Act allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and
potential conflicts, where appropriate, where a company’s articles of
association contain a provision to this effect. The 2006 Act also allows
a company’s articles of association to contain other provisions for
dealing with directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty.
Resolution 1 1 (as set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting)
amends the Articles of Association with effect from October 1, 2008
to give the directors authority to approve such situations and to
include other provisions to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with
in a similar way to the current position.
There are safeguards which will apply when directors decide whether
to authorise a conflict or potential conflict. Firstly, only directors who
have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take
the relevant decision, and secondly, in taking the decision the
directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most
likely to promote the Company’s success. The directors will be able to
impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they think
this is appropriate.
The amendments to the Articles of Association proposed in
Resolution 1 1 also contain provisions relating to confidential
information, attendance at board meetings and availability of board
papers to protect a director being in breach of duty if a conflict of
interest or potential conflict of interest arises. These provisions will
only apply where the position giving rise to the potential conflict has
previously been authorised by the directors. It is the Board’s intention
to report annually on the Company’s procedures for ensuring that
the Board’s powers to authorise conflicts are operated effectively.
6. Electronic and web communications
Provisions of the 2006 Act which came into force in January 2007
enable companies to communicate with shareholders by electronic
and/or website communications. The New Articles continue to allow
communications to shareholders in electronic form and, in addition,
they also permit the Company to take advantage of the new
provisions relating to website communications. Before the Company
can communicate with a member by means of electronic and/or
website communication, the relevant member must be asked
individually by the Company to agree that the Company may send or
supply documents or information to him/her by such means, and, in
relation to communications by website, the Company must either
have received a positive response or have received no response
within the period of 28 days, beginning with the date on which the
request was sent. The Company will notify the member (either in
writing, or by other permitted means) when a relevant document 
or information is placed on the website and a member can always
request a hard copy version of the document or information. 
The Company will contact shareholders at a later date in relation 
to obtaining the relevant consents.
7. Directors’ indemnities
The 2006 Act has in some areas widened the scope of the powers of
a company to indemnify directors and to fund expenditure incurred
in connection with certain actions against directors. In particular, a
company that is a trustee of an occupational pension scheme can
now indemnify a director against liability incurred in connection 
with the company’s activities as trustee of the scheme. In addition, 
the existing exemption allowing a company to provide money for 
the purpose of funding a director’s defence in court proceedings
now expressly covers regulatory proceedings and applies to
associated companies. The New Articles contain provisions reflecting
these changes.

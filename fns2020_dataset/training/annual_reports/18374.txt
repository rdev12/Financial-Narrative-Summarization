Chairman’s Statement
Overview
FY2015 was a transformational year for 
the Group with record revenues and a 
significant return to profitability. When I 
joined the Board we had limited financial 
resources, market expectations of £5.00m 
turnover, a demoralised workforce and 
management team and lack of appropriate 
Board structure. However, our key 
stakeholders – customers, employees 
and shareholders – continued to be 
supportive as they believed in the Group 
and the significant potential of this new and 
emerging market. The Board would like to 
thank these stakeholders for their support 
and patience.
The plan we established at the start of 
the year built upon the investments made 
and the product set of the Group and 
I am delighted that this has delivered 
an exceptional year of growth in all key 
metrics. We have achieved 69% growth 
in turnover, returned to profitability, 
re-established cash generation, built a 
strong management team and Board and 
restored morale within the business. We 
have also achieved a substantial increase 
in recurring revenues providing improved 
visibility and quality of earnings. These 
are significant achievements given the 
position the Group was in just a year ago.
The increase in demand for back office 
workforce optimisation solutions has been 
triggered by the ongoing global trend of 
businesses looking to improve customer 
service, operational efficiency, cost control 
and risk management. The Group’s 
products deliver guaranteed benefits 
for its customers in each of these key 
result areas and it has an enviable track 
record of successful implementations and 
customer retention. 
This market demand, together with our 
ability to develop and deliver products 
which meet our customer needs, provides 
a firm foundation for the Group. 
The investments we have made in the 
Group this year have further strengthened 
our market position and were 
underpinned by the placing we completed 
in January 2015. The successful raise 
of £3.19m, in addition to the £0.55m of 
convertible loan notes issued in February 
2014, was a strong endorsement of our 
strategy. 
Board Developments
The last financial year also saw the Board 
strengthened through the appointment 
of a number of new Directors, alongside 
myself and Elizabeth, bringing with 
them extensive relevant experience 
that is already benefitting the business. 
Following my appointment as Non-
Executive Chairman, John Brougham 
and Mark Brady were both appointed as 
independent Non-Executive Directors, 
Jonathan Kay was appointed Chief 
Financial Officer and Elizabeth Gooch was 
confirmed as the Chief Executive Officer.
Current Trading & Outlook
FY2015 was a year of transformation 
for the Group. Building on the steps we 
have taken to build a robust platform 
for growth during the past year, the 
Board is confident that the Group is well 
positioned to continue momentum into 
the coming year. We will continue to invest 
in our market leading product, whilst also 
building the sales and marketing required 
to enable us to earn our place as the 
global leader in the market we pioneered. 
We will also complement organic growth 
with strategic acquisitions as and when 
opportunities arise. 
We look forward to continuing to deliver 
value for our customers and excellent 
results for our shareholders.
Duncan McIntyre
Chairman 
24 March 2015

Chief Executive’s Statement
Overview
In FY2015 a number of the strategies 
that we had invested in prior to the last 
financial year began to be realised.
• Following our acquisition of Xtaq 
Limited in FY2011 we converted their 
pilot projects into successful customer 
implementations. We then invested 
in these and a number of other pilot 
projects with global and international 
customers, all with significantly greater 
roll-out potential than our traditional UK 
customer base. In 2012 we secured 
a strategic partnership with Aspect 
Software Inc. to support roll-out to 
these customers as well as distribute 
our product throughout the world. We 
also launched our Managed Cloud 
Services solution. 
• All of these strategies depressed our 
financial results during this period but 
the investments were made with the 
intention of benefitting our prospects 
and performance for the future. The 
challenges and changes during our 
2013 financial year created a difficult 
period, but with renewed focus we have 
now begun to realise their potential. 
• I am therefore delighted that in 
FY2015 each of these investments has 
contributed to transforming our results:
• We have secured ten significant 
contract wins in the period, when 
previously this has been on average 
three to four, including roll-outs to 
global customers, partner sales in 
new territories and contract wins in 
three new verticals. Customers in 
these verticals have benefited from 
our development strategy of building 
products that address cross-sector 
issues. These customers have also 
achieved the same benefits as those in 
our traditional markets. 
• As a result of our investment in our 
partnership distribution channel and our 
global customers, international sales 
now account for 37% of our turnover 
and we intend to continue investment in 
this growth area in the coming years. 
• Finally, our Managed Cloud Services 
solution is gaining traction leading 
to a significant increase in recurring 
revenues, a record order book of 
£15.44m, and improved visibility/quality 
of earnings. 
Our renewed focus on cost control 
together with the significant increase in 
revenue has also contributed to the return 
to profitability and cash generation. 
FY2015 has therefore been a year 
in which we have re-established the 
fundamentals of the business, delivered 
strong financial performance including 
record revenue levels, and laid the 
foundations for sustainable growth in the 
future. 
Market Development
The emerging back office optimisation 
market continues to develop. Businesses 
are seeking to improve the end customer 
experience across multiple channels, 
optimise their use of resources across 
these channels and maintain compliance 
with regulatory and security requirements. 
With the increase in digital business, 
customer transactions are shifting from 
the traditional and physical to data centric 
methods giving rise to an increase in 
transactions across all channels. At 
the same time customers now expect 
near or real-time responses, regardless 
of how they transact, and a key driver 
for businesses is to significantly reduce 
complex back office processing time and 
achieve real-time insight into the whole 
customer eco-system. 
Investment in the back office has 
traditionally been a low priority but it 
can no longer be ignored. It is a major 
contributor to the success of the 
customer experience and, according to 
Frost & Sullivan’s recent report, can often 
be the engine that drives organisational 
performance from behind the scenes.
“These contracts also led to a 20% increase in 
the user base of our software, to over 100,000 
licences sold in the UK and globally.”
Elizabeth Gooch
Chief Executive Officer

Core functionality within the eg operational 
intelligence
®
 software suite was designed 
to address these requirements:
• Multi-channel transaction capture 
to provide a single view of all work 
regardless of channel.
• Real-time, multi-level, multi-dimensional 
operational intelligence for customer 
operations and customer experience 
management.
• Efficient allocation of work to an 
increasingly disparate, mobile workforce 
wherever it is in the world, together with 
the means to automatically evaluate 
their performance.
We are therefore well placed to support 
both the digital and omni-channel 
requirements of our customers; enabling 
them to deliver consistent service and 
optimise performance across all channels 
regardless of where their workforce is 
and, at the same time, providing true 
insight into the end-to-end customer 
journey. 
Customer Base Growth
As a result of the increased need for 
optimisation tools for complex processing 
areas, demand from new and existing 
customers has been strong. 
During the period a total of ten significant 
contract wins were secured, further 
penetrating our key global market sectors. 
The Group increased its footprint in 
existing market verticals such as financial 
services, but also successfully developed 
business in new verticals. Major new 
contracts announced during the period 
include:
• In February 2014, a contract win with 
an international telecoms provider
• In March 2014, a contract win with 
another new utility customer
• In April 2014, a contract win from 
a global bank (existing client) worth 
approximately $1.06m
• In August 2014, a contract win with a 
major third party outsourcing company 
(existing client) expected to be worth in 
excess of £1.20m
• In January 2015, a contract win within 
Local Government worth at least 
£1.60m over four years.
These contracts also led to a 20% 
increase in the user base of our software, 
to over 100,000 licences sold in the UK 
and globally. 
Product Development
We have continued to invest in our 
market leading software to ensure we can 
continue to meet customer requirements 
“out of the box”. This has always been 
a unique selling point for our product, 
enabling our customers to quickly realise 
benefits and achieve guaranteed return 
on investment. 
The latest version of the eg operational 
intelligence
®
 software suite was launched 
in London on 25 March 2014. This 
version provides further enhancements 
to our core products as well as the 
platform for delivery of eg mobile. Our 
mobile product will allow management 
teams to monitor the operational health 
of their back office operations in real-
time from mobile devices using a rich 
dashboard and alerting app. This will 
provide customer operations teams with 
early visibility into potential service issues 
as well as better engage the workforce in 
achieving the organisations objectives.
We have also developed major 
enhancements to our strategic planning 
and forecasting module during FY2015. 
These include improved modelling 
features enabling planners to model 
resource forecasts based on complex 
business scenarios and continuously 
monitor progress against forecasts or 
contractual obligations, such as Service 
Level Agreements, in real-time. 
eg mobile and our new Strategic Planning 
and Forecasting product will be released 
shortly.
People
In March 2014 Duncan McIntyre agreed 
to join our Board as Non-Executive 
Chairman. His experience of building 
successful international businesses 
quickly made a positive impact on 
the Group. He has built a new Board, 
improved our communications within 
the City, led our financing activities and 
re-established a culture of success 
and support. The eg Board now 
consists of individuals with substantial 
experience of growing listed and private 
companies, as well as providing high 
levels of governance. The Group has 
benefited from their deep understanding 
of technology markets, strong City 
reputations and passion for developing 
effective management teams. 
Our new management structure includes 
a number of senior hires in key areas of 
the business and good progress is being 
made to build a successful team to deliver 
our strategy. Over the coming year we will 
continue to invest further to ensure that 
business momentum is maintained and 
customer satisfaction continues. 
In October 2014 Paul Hoban advised us 
of his intention to resign as Group Chief 
Financial Officer. Paul will leave us in 
April 2015 having built a strong financial 
reporting function within the Group 
and we wish him well with his future 
endeavours. Jonathan Kay joined us in 
December 2014 to replace Paul and work 
alongside me to develop our team to drive 
profitable growth. 
The whole eg team worked extremely 
hard during the year to deliver excellent 
results for our customers throughout the 
world. I would like to thank them for their 
contribution and continuing commitment.

Chief Financial Officer’s Statement
Financial Results
Revenue for the year ended 31 January 
2015 increased 69% to £7.54m (2014: 
£4.46m). Software licences, maintenance 
and software services contributed 68% 
of total revenue (2014: 76%) with the 
balance coming from implementation 
and training services. Revenue included 
one-time licence fees and one-off support 
services revenue totalling £1.06m. 
Particularly pleasing was the fact the 
Group achieved a profit before tax of 
£0.41m (2014: loss £1.48m) and Adjusted 
EBITDA increased to £1.26m (2014: loss 
of £0.50m).
During the period recurring revenues 
increased significantly. eg’s order book 
now stands at £15.44m to be recognised 
over the next 4 years.
Overall gross margin improved 5% to 
70% (2014: 65%) as a result of improved 
utilisation in our Implementation, Training 
and Professional Services teams. 
Administrative expenses increased 
to £4.75m (2014: £4.38m) following 
investment in management and sales.
As at 31 January 2015 net cash was 
£4.30m (2014: net debt £0.31m) following 
investment in research and development 
of £0.85m (2014: £0.80m), and cash 
generated from financing activities of 
£3.76m (2014: £1.24m). 
In April a share placing raised £0.23m 
allowing equity support from the Non-
Executive Directors. A further placing 
was completed in January 2015 raising 
£3.19m (before expenses) to support 
growth with conversion of £0.55m 
convertible loan notes also issued to 
equity. 
Cash generated from operating activities 
was £1.73m for the period (2014: cash 
used in operating activities £0.43m). 
Earnings per share on a basic and 
fully diluted basis was 3.6p and 3.5p 
respectively. In the prior year the basic 
earnings per share was (8.9p) and on a 
fully diluted basis (8.9p). 
The Group has benefited from the 
favourable tax relief given on development 
expenditure. The effective rate on taxation 
credit is 33% (2014: effective rate of tax 
credit 14%). 
The Board has decided not to 
recommend payment of a dividend.

Case Study
Client – BES Utilities
eg were engaged to help BES Utilities develop 
a comprehensive back office workforce 
optimisation solution — building on existing 
software solutions to fill gaps in their 
Management Information and management 
capability by deploying the eg operational 
intelligence
®
 software suite supported by the eg 
principles of operational management
®
.
Objectives
Build on existing software solutions and 
processes to provide a comprehensive back 
office workforce optimisation solution to 
support future growth.
Results
• BES Utilities were able to identify 20% 
additional capacity, which has helped to 
support their future growth plans.
• BES Utilities are able to benefit from 
improved management control and visibility 
in real-time. 
• Understanding of work demand in each function 
now shows where workforce capacity exists on 
an ongoing basis.
Solution 
BES Utilities had been developing their suite of 
systems over a number of years to help manage 
customer interactions and eg operational 
intelligence
®
 has now been deployed alongside 
this core platform. This provides improved 
real-time management information to help BES 
Utilities manage their work and people more 
effectively, across various teams and functions 
such as Debt Collection, Metering, Customer 
Services, Change of Tenancy and Supply 
Administration.
eg work manager
®
 data connector was a key 
component in the solution, used to consume 
data files sent at frequent intervals from the 
BES platform. This solution enabled cases 
to be created and tagged with all of the 
information Team Managers require to prioritise 
and distribute work to the individuals within 
their teams.
This is achieved utilising standard functionality 
and its simplicity from an end user perspective 
meant that the training overhead was minimal.
The Future
Utilising standard process dashboards and 
Management Information available in eg 
operational intelligence
®
, BES Utilities are 
now monitoring and managing end-to-end 
processing to understand where further 
process efficiencies can be achieved to reduce 
processing time and improved customer 
experience.
“eg operational intelligence
®
 is a comprehensive back office workforce 
optimisation application providing real-time, historic and predictive visibility 
of operational performance and pinch points. Our Team Managers now 
have information available in real-time to enable them to manage, monitor 
and improve performance. By deploying the eg operational intelligence
®
 
software suite and benefiting from the eg principles of operational 
management
®
, BES are now able to ensure best practice is followed and 
improved throughout our operation.” BES Utilities

Our Marketplace
Market Definition
The term “back office” has been traditionally used to define staff involved in all business functions that are critical to the efficient delivery 
of goods and services, but which are, for the most part, unseen by the customer. Despite its less strategic image, the back office is 
a major contributor to the success of any business, and has the ability to significantly impact the Customer Experience. Customer 
expectations are met and exceeded when back office work is done efficiently. Errors, on the other hand, can lead to significant increases 
in Front Office volume, higher operational costs, and unsatisfied customers. Source: Frost & Sullivan
The Back Office Problem
eg pioneered the back office 
workforce optimisation 
software market – a rapidly 
emerging market with few 
direct competitors.
The Requirement:
Improve customer service and 
quality, demonstrate compliance 
& reduce cost
The Challenge:
Achieving these “conflicting 
variables” with the same or 
less resources
The Solution:
Enterprise Back Office 
Workforce Optimisation
• Varied, complex and multi-stage processes
• Many input channels
• Variety of new and legacy systems
• High degree of manual interaction despite the investment  
in technology

Our Customers
“Key for me was to drive change that not only took cost out of the 
operation, but also delivered a better and more consistent level of customer 
service, these are rarely achieved at the same time and at such pace, but 
we did it. We are now operating at a service level and cost control not 
previously achieved here.” Director of Production and Operations
When surveyed, 100% of clients said they would recommend our services. 100% of staff agreed  
‘eg is a great place to work.’

Case Study
Client - Major UK Energy Company
The customer needed to optimise workflows 
in the back office to deliver an improvement 
in productivity and reduce their ‘Cost to 
Serve’. Key requirements included the need 
to provide real-time information to all levels of 
management to monitor productivity against 
customer demands and to monitor and 
improve operational efficiency.
Objectives 
• Deploy a back office workforce optimisation 
software solution within a ‘Cloud’ 
environment
• Deliver operational efficiency and provide a 
sustainable platform to improve performance 
of people, customer service, quality and cost
•  Optimise performance to redistribute staff 
across the business to match business need 
(cross skill)
• Provide a foundation for developing a more 
flexible and agile workforce
Solutions
A combination of three core components of the 
eg operational intelligence
®
 software suite were 
delivered:
• Strategic Planning & Forecasting 
• Real-Time Work Management 
• Reporting & Analytics
Results
The result was an overall benefit of 30% 
improvement in productivity (guaranteed at the 
outset) and a substantial reduction in overtime.
“This is the best work position I’ve seen in 5 years. As customers 
make contact with us our agents are able to provide accurate real-time 
information on the status of their enquiry. This manages the expectation 
for the customer of their end to end journey and has improved the overall 
customer experience – including a reduction in demand on chaser calls” –

Risks and Uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks 
and uncertainties which could have a 
material impact on the Group’s long-term 
performance and cause actual results 
to differ materially from expected and 
historical results. Management seeks to 
identify material risks and put in place 
contingency plans to mitigate the Group’s 
potential exposure. 
Competitor Risk
The market for operations management 
improvement is becoming increasingly 
competitive. To mitigate this risk, 
management works to build strong 
customer relationships and develop the 
Group’s product offering. 
Commercial Relationships
Some of the products utilise interfaces 
with proprietary software licensed 
by independent, third party software 
developers. Any absence of key third 
party products could have a material 
impact on the business.
To mitigate this risk, all key commercial 
relationships and developments in 
technology in the marketplace are kept 
under review. The Group also works with 
a diversity of partners to mitigate the risk 
inherent in working with a single partner.
Operations
The Group’s facilities could be disrupted 
by events beyond its control such as fire 
or other issues.
The Group prepares recovery plans for 
most foreseeable situations so that our 
business operations would continue 
should these situations occur.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Employees
eg’s intention is to listen to and involve 
staff — employee feedback is an 
important way of ensuring the continuous 
improvement of the business and can 
help improve staff satisfaction. 
Attracting and retaining talent is key to 
our strategic delivery. Employees are 
encouraged and fully supported by 
the Company should they choose to 
undertake further study and training to 
assist their professional development.
eg held its first “Hackathon”, as part of 
the Company’s initiative to encourage 
innovation throughout the team. This 
year’s event has been an astounding 
success in engagement and team building 
and has uncovered some hidden eg talent 
too.
eg solutions plc is an equal opportunities 
employer. 
Environment
Our offices are energy efficient offices 
and in utilising the latest technology we 
are endeavouring to minimise our impact 
on the environment. It is Company policy 
that all waste materials are recycled. We 
recycle on average 1.2 tonnes of paper 
waste each year.
Wherever possible eg uses FSC certified 
paper products and sustainable suppliers. 
Our UK office is within Dunston Business 
Village which has been awarded with 
various accolades including RICS — Best 
Regeneration Project. 
South Africa
The South African government introduced 
a comprehensive system to help integrate 
black people into society, postapartheid 
and therefore encourage and assist the 
transition of economic empowerment. 
Companies operating in South Africa have 
to achieve Broad Based Black Economic 
Empowerment (BBBEE) accredited status 
in support of these objectives. Businesses 
are classified by their size and measured 
in terms of how successfully they comply 
with a range of seven measures.
eg are accredited with level 4 status (out 
of 10, 1 is the highest score).
Company Charity
Since establishing a subsidiary in 
Johannesburg in 2007, eg has chosen 
the Doornkop Needy Children’s Centre 
(DNCC) as its Company charity. The 
centre provides safety, shelter, clothing, 
education, love and medical care from 
Monday to Friday for orphaned or fostered 
children aged 0 to 5 years old, some 
of whom are HIV positive. eg supports 
fundraising activities with staff and clients, 
as well as making its own financial 
contributions to the charity. The Company 
organises annual educational outings for 
the children and has provided items from 
a “wish list” of educational items using 
some of the funds raised to expand the 
facilities they have available and contribute 
towards the children’s education.
Here are some of the developments 
that have been made possible from the 
donations and fundraising that has taken 
place in the last 12 months:
• Provision of Learning Materials, Books 
and Toys
• Educational outings
• Enhanced crèche facilities with a new 
kitchen and toilets for the children
• Caregivers training to improve knowledge 
and skills in caring for the children
• Regular e-pap supplies – epap 
is essential fortified, nutrient rich 
food formulated to address hunger.
Important Priorities
Child Welfare — providing a safe 
environment for the children who would 
otherwise be left alone and at risk.
Hunger and Malnutrition — providing a safe 
haven and respite for parents, ensuring 
access to food and water to support their 
health.
Education — engaging the children in 
educational activities such as learning the 
alphabet, numbers, the concept of colour 
and providing access to educational toys.
eg is the primary sponsor of DNCC and 
ensures that the crèche gets the right 
support to meet their everyday needs.
eg have donated a minimum of R60k 
(Rand) every year to aid the development 
of the crèche.
“We cannot express all that your help does in words, but please know that 
you are not just changing the lives of individuals but are building a community 
which will produce excellent leaders of tomorrow, and that will lead to a 
better country.”  
Namsi Lesito, Principal at Doornkop Crèche, South Africa

Corporate Governance
Board Structure and Committees
The Board is responsible to shareholders 
for the proper management of the 
Company. A statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the accounts 
is set out on page 22 of the 2015 annual 
report. The Non-Executive Directors have 
a particular responsibility to ensure that 
the strategies proposed by the Executive 
Directors are fully considered. To enable 
the Board to discharge its duties all 
Directors have full and timely access 
to all relevant information. There is a 
procedure for all Directors in furtherance 
of their duties to take independent 
professional advice, if necessary, at the 
expense of the Company. The Board has 
a formal schedule of matters reserved 
to it and meets at least quarterly. It is 
responsible for overall strategy, approval 
of major capital expenditure projects 
and consideration of significant financing 
matters.
The following Committees, which have 
written terms of reference, deal with 
specific aspects of the Company’s affairs:
• the Nomination Committee is chaired by 
the Chairman and comprises the Board. 
The Committee is responsible for 
proposing candidates for appointment 
to the Board, having regard to the 
balance and structure of the Board. 
In appropriate cases recruitment 
consultants are used to assist the 
process. All Directors are subject to re-
election at least every three years;
• the Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for making recommendations to the 
Board on the Company’s framework 
of Executive remuneration and its cost. 
The Committee determines the contract 
terms, remuneration and other benefits 
for each of the Executive Directors and 
senior employees, including performance 
related bonus schemes, share incentive 
plans, pension rights and compensation 
payments. The Board itself determines 
the remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors. The Remuneration Committee 
is chaired by Mark Brady, who was 
appointed to board in May 2014, and is 
attended by Duncan McIntyre and John 
Brougham. Directors’ Remuneration 
is set out on pages 37 and 38 of the 
2015 Annual Report and Accounts. The 
Remuneration Committee met once 
during the year; and
• the Audit Committee is chaired by 
John Brougham and is made up of 
two other Non-Executive Directors; 
Mark Brady and Duncan McIntyre. 
All 3 members of the committee are 
qualified accountants. The meetings 
are also attended, by invitation, by 
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer. Its prime tasks are 
to review the scope of external audit, 
to receive regular reports from Baker 
Tilly, and to review the half-yearly 
and annual accounts before they are 
presented to the Board, focusing in 
particular on accounting policies and 
areas of management, judgement 
and estimation. The Committee is 
responsible for monitoring the controls 
which are in force to ensure the integrity 
of the information reported to the 
shareholders. The Committee acts 
as a forum for discussion of internal 
control issues and contributes to the 
Board’s review of the effectiveness 
of the Company’s internal control 
and risk management systems and 
processes. The Committee also 
considers the need for an internal audit 
function. It advises the Board on the 
appointment of external auditors and 
on their remuneration for both audit 
and non-audit work, and discusses the 
nature and scope of the audit with the 
external auditors. The Committee has 
met 5 times during the year, 2 of these 
meetings included the audit partner.
The Audit Committee also undertakes 
a formal assessment of the auditor 
independence each year which includes:
• a review of the non-audit services 
provided to the Company and related 
fees;
• discussion with the auditors of a written 
report detailing all relationships with 
the Company and any other parties 
that could affect independence or the 
perception of independence;
• a review of the auditor’s own 
procedures for ensuring the 
independence of the audit firm and 
partners and staff involved in the audit, 
including the regular rotation of the 
audit partner; and
• obtaining written confirmation from 
the auditor that, in their professional 
judgement, they are independent.
Internal Control
The Directors are responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and 
reviewing its effectiveness. The Board has 
designed the Group’s system of internal 
control in order to provide the Directors 
with reasonable assurance that its assets 
are safeguarded, that transactions are 
authorised and properly recorded and that 
material errors and irregularities are either 
prevented or would be detected within 
a timely period. However, no system of 
internal control can eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives 
or provide absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of the control system in 
operation are:
• the Board meets regularly with a 
formal schedule of matters reserved 
to it for decision. It has put in place 
an organisational structure with clear 
lines of responsibility defined and with 
appropriate delegation of authority;
• there are established procedures for 
the planning, approval and monitoring 
of capital expenditure and information 
systems for monitoring the Group’s 
financial performance against approved 
budgets and forecasts; and
• the departmental heads are required 
annually to undertake a full assessment 
process to identify and quantify the 
risks that face their businesses and 
functions, and assess the adequacy 
of the prevention, monitoring and 
modification practices in place for those 
risks. In addition, regular reports about 
significant risks and associated control 
and monitoring procedures are reported

The Directors submit their report and the 
financial statements of eg solutions plc for 
the year ended 31 January 2015.
Principal Activities
The principal activity of the Group is that of 
an IT and software support services business 
delivering guaranteed improvements in 
operational management. The Group 
uses proprietary software packages and 
an operations management methodology 
based on production management 
techniques. The Group delivers measurable 
operational improvements in large back office 
environments.
Financial Risk Management Objectives 
and Policies
The main financial risks faced by the 
Group relate to the risk of default to 
financial transactions by customers and 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group manages these risks through 
an effective risk management programme. 
Exposures to financial risks are monitored 
by management and they are required to 
produce a quarterly risk report comprising 
all risks and an indication of the business 
impact of those risks.
The risk reports are provided to the 
Board of Directors in advance of the 
Board meetings and are discussed by the 
Board to ensure that the risk mitigation 
procedures are compliant with the 
Group policy and that any new risks are 
appropriately managed.
Credit Risk
The objective is to reduce the risk of 
loss arising from default to financial 
transactions by customers. The Group 
has focused on selling to a “blue chip” 
customer base thereby minimising the 
risk of incurring bad debts. The Group’s 
position with counterparties and their 
credit ratings are routinely monitored.
Liquidity
At the year end the Group had £4.30m 
in net cash balances and no overdraft 
(2014:(£0.31m)) The objective is to ensure 
that operating profits are turned into cash 
balances during the year. 
The Group finances its operations through 
retained profits. The recent placing has 
provided eg with a strong cash balance to 
support investment in growth and product 
development going forward.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is also exposed to exchange 
fluctuations which affect the value of 
its overseas subsidiary. The Group’s 
objective is to minimise exchange risks 
and the policy is to match cash payments 
and receipts in each currency wherever 
possible. Currency fluctuations are 
regularly monitored but the Group does 
not use any hedging instruments.
Political and Charitable Contributions
During the year the Group made 
charitable donations to UK registered 
charities of £1,645 (2014: £9,000). No 
political donations were made.
Employee Involvement and Disability
The Group’s policy is to consult and 
discuss with employees any matters 
likely to affect their interests. Information 
on matters of concern to employees is 
provided in order to achieve a common 
awareness of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the Group’s performance.
The Group’s policy is to recruit disabled 
workers for those vacancies that they 
are able to fill. All necessary assistance 
with initial training courses is given. Once 
employed, a career plan is developed so 
as to ensure suitable opportunities for 
each disabled person. Arrangements are 
made, wherever possible, for retraining 
employees who become disabled to 
enable them to perform work identified as 
appropriate to their aptitudes.

The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Strategic Report, the 
Directors’ Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and Company financial 
statements for each financial year. The 
Directors are required by the AIM Rules 
of the London Stock Exchange to 
prepare Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)  as adopted 
by the European Union (“EU”) and have 
elected under Company law to prepare 
the Company financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by  
the EU.
The financial statements are required 
by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to 
present fairly the financial position of 
the Group and the Company and the 
financial performance of the Group. 
The Companies Act 2006 provides in 
relation to such financial statements that 
references in the relevant part of that Act 
to financial statements giving a true and 
fair view are references to their achieving 
a fair presentation.
Under Company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Group and the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing the Group and Company 
financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
b. make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
c. state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs adopted by 
the EU;
d. prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
and the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group 
and the Company and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the eg solutions plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

We have audited the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements (“the 
financial statements”) on pages 24–54. 
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and, as regards 
the Parent Company financial statements, 
as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors 
and auditor
As more fully explained in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on 
page 22, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
(APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
A description of the scope of an audit of 
financial statements is provided on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
http://www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion 
• the financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and 
the parent’s affairs as at 31 January 
2015 and of the Group’s profit for the 
year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union
• the parent financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the Parent Company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
• the Parent Company financial 
statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our 
audit.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 January 2015
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
eg solutions plc is a public limited company incorporated in England, registered number 2211062, with its registered office at Barn 1, Dunston 
Business Village, Stafford Road, Dunston, Staffordshire, ST18 9AB.
The principal activities of the Group are the development and sale of software and consultancy in the back office optimisation market.
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed 
by the EU (“IFRS”).
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost and going concern basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are set 
out below.
The Company made a loss after tax of £0.05m (2014: Loss after tax £1.41m) for the financial year. The Directors have taken advantage of the 
exemption available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and have not presented a Statement of Comprehensive Income for the 
Company.
 Going Concern
The Group manages its day-to-day working capital requirements through a combination of cash inflows from sales and tight management of 
expenses.
The Group raised £0.55m in February 2014 through the issue of convertible loan notes with a conversion price of 50p and a further £3.19m 
(before expenses) by way of a placing of 4,905,000 ordinary shares of 1p each in January 2015. The loan notes along with accrued interest 
were converted into ordinary 1p shares in January 2015 at a price of 50p during the placing. The Group is carrying no debt at 31 January 2015.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, for a period of 12 months from the date these financial statements have been approved, which take 
account of both positive and negative variations in trading performance, show that the Group has sufficient headroom to operate. The Directors 
currently have no reason to believe that the Group could not obtain other sources of funding if that was required.
Having assessed current trading, the strength of customer relationships, the current sales pipeline and the growing demand for our product, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.

are in the process of reviewing this standard and will report in due course, the impact on the Group.
 Basis of Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of eg solutions plc and the enterprises controlled by the Group (its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31 January each year. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and have been rounded to the 
nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
 Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent Company and are based on consistent accounting policies. All inter-
company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
 Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write each asset down to its estimated residual value over its 
expected useful life, as follows:
Computer Equipment — 25% straight line
Office Equipment — 15% reducing balance
Fixtures and Fittings — 15% reducing balance 
Motor Vehicles — 25% reducing balance 
Leasehold Improvements — 20% straight line
 Impairment of Non-Current Assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-current assets to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or that 
has not yet been brought into use is tested for impairment annually.
 Intangible Assets
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s software development is recognised only when all of the following conditions 
are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes);
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably;
• the product or process is technically and commercially viable; and
• sufficient resources are available to complete the development and to either sell or use the asset.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which 
it is incurred.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives (6 years). The amortisation is charged to 
administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The change in policy to include in administrative expenses is 
to align eg reporting with similar companies within the sector.
Intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date and amortised over the 
estimated life of the asset. These assets include intellectual property relating to the Nuqleus product set and customer relationships acquired in 
2010 which eg continue to benefit from. These are amortised over their useful economic lives (5 years).
 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
 Retirement Benefits
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an 
independently administered fund. The amount charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of pension costs 
and other post retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments at the 
reporting date.
 Foreign Currencies
Transactions in currencies other than sterling, the presentational and functional currency of the Group, are recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date. 
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as 
equity and transferred to the Group’s foreign exchange reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the 
period in which the operation is disposed of.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
The results of overseas operations have been translated into sterling at the monthly weighted average rate of exchange for the period. Rand 
denominated assets and liabilities have been translated at the relevant rate of exchange at the reporting date of £1 = R17.4986 (2014: £1 = 
R18.6220).
 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which 
affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based 
upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is 
dealt with in equity.
 Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of provision is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank and other short-term deposits held by the Group with maturities of less than 
three months.
For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of the overdraft as these borrowings, which are 
repayable on demand, are an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
 Trade Payables
Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
 Share-Based Payments
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant where the cost reflects the value of employee services or 
performance related services. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Where the cost relates to the cost of raising 
equity finance the cost is recognised directly in equity in the same manner as issues costs. Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes 
model where the value of the service received cannot be measured reliably. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effect of non- transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
 Employee Share Ownership Plans
The Company operates an ESOP trust and has de facto control of the shares held by the trust and bears their benefits and risks. The Group 
records certain assets and liabilities of the trust as its own. Finance costs and administrative expenses are charged as they accrue.
 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The Group has no finance leases.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
 Convertible Debt Instruments
Instruments where the holder has the option to redeem for cash or convert into a pre-determined quantity of equity instruments are classified as 
compound instruments and presented partly as a liability and partly as equity.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a similar non-convertible 
instrument. The difference between the proceeds of issue and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded 
option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to 
the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying value of the convertible loan note.
 Grants Received
All costs associated with the relevant grant project are held on the balance sheet awaiting amortisation. The income received is held within 
deferred income awaiting release against the life of the product. As the project goes live, the costs net of the government grant are amortised 
over the life of the asset. The life of the asset is 6 years unless otherwise stated. These assets are presented within Non-Current Assets in the 
balance sheet.
If for any unforeseen circumstance a grant needs to be repaid, this shall be recognised by reducing the deferred income balance by the 
amount repayable resulting in a higher asset value to amortise. The cumulative additional amortisation that would have been recognised in the 
Statement of Consolidated Income to date shall be recognised immediately.
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of Group financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires the use of accounting 
estimates and judgements in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. These judgements and estimates are based on historical 
experience and management’s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions.
 Impairment of Intangible Assets
The Group takes into account the future contracted cash inflows from repeatable revenues and the risk adjusted cash flows from pipeline sales 
expected over the life of the assets under review to determine whether an impairment needs to be made or not. Expected cash flows from 
pipeline sales are adjusted to take into account the probability that they will be realised over a reasonable period of time based on historical 
experience and negotiations that have been held with management at the reporting date.
 Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognised when revenue and associated costs can be measured reliably and future economic benefits are probable. Revenue is 
measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes. The following 
criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
 Maintenance Contracts
Income in respect of maintenance contracts is invoiced on an annual basis and recognised as earned.
 Software Licences
For perpetual licences revenues are recognised once the software has been fully installed.
For subscription licences annual revenues are recognised on the date of installation and in following years on the anniversary of the installation 
date because this is the date the risk and reward are passed to the customer.
 Bundled Contracts
For any contracts where the Group charges one fee to cover multiple goods/services the contract value is broken down into separate 
components and each component will be recognised separately at its fair value in accordance with the Group revenue recognition policy.
 Implementation of Software Services
Revenues in respect of implementation and software services are recognised on a percentage of completion basis calculated pro-rata on the 
number of man days completed to the estimated total project man days.
 Inter-company Receivable
The Directors assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the intercompany receivable is 
impaired.  Where such evidence exists, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows.

3.  OPERATING SEGMENTS
eg solutions plc provides IT and software support services by operating two distinct companies in the United Kingdom (“EGUK”) and in South 
Africa (“EGSA”). Financial information is reported to the Board for both companies individually with revenue and operating profits split by 
geographic location. Segment revenue comprises of sales to external customers and excludes finance income. Segment profit reported to the 
Board represents the profit before tax earned by each segment.
For the purposes of assessing segment performance and for determining the allocation of resources between segments, the Board reviews the 
non-current assets attributable to each segment as well as the financial resources available. All assets and liabilities are allocated to reportable 
segments. Information is reported to the Board of Directors on a company basis as management believe that each company exposes the 
Group to differing levels of risk and rewards due to local economic conditions. The segment profit or loss, segment assets and segment 
liabilities are measured on the same basis as amounts recognised in the financial statements, as set out in the accounting policies.
Transactions between EGUK and EGSA are accounted for on an “arms length” basis.
During the year the Group had revenues from two (2014: two) customers in the UK amounting to £3,681,000 (2014: £2,100,000) in total that 
individually made up more than 10% of revenues generated.
A current eg client uses our software within a number of separate entities on a variety of discrete client contracts. The software is embedded 
in those contracts and consequently risk is spread across these contracts and not concentrated in the ultimate holding entity. None of these 
contracts are individually over 10%.
Our second largest customer is a partner channel rebilling our software and services to a number of further customers in markets outside of the 
UK, risk is with those customers and not with the partner.

In respect of the current year, the Directors are unable to propose that a dividend will be paid to shareholders (2014: £Nil).
EPS has been calculated using the following methodology:
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the number of weighted average 
ordinary shares during the period. The number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust (see note 28 Share-based 
Payments).
For Diluted earnings per share, the number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. 
These represent share options granted to employees.
When the basic EPS is a negative value, the effect of anti-dilutive potential ordinary shares are ignored in calculating diluted EPS.

date of grant, the options expire. A number of options also contain performance objectives within the vesting criteria.
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before options vest.

The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the risk of default to financial transactions by customers, availability of funds to meet the 
Group’s needs and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These risks are managed as described below.
An explanation of the Group’s financial instrument risk management objectives and policies are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 21.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures. Any proposed changes will be considered by the 
Board prior to such changes being implemented.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows:
 Liquidity Risk
Cashflow is managed on a daily, short-term and longer term basis and management is therefore able to ensure that the Group has sufficient 
cash to meet all its commitments.
Forecast liquidity is reviewed weekly by management.
 Market Risk
Market risk is comprised of Foreign Currency Risk, Interest Rate Risk and Other Price Risk.
 Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is subject to a cross-border transactional currency exposure in respect of trading outside of the Group’s functional currency.
Where possible, currency receivables and payables are matched, creating a natural hedge. All contracts are assessed for the need to hedge 
using appropriate derivative instruments.
 Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures in the profit and loss account arising from the monetary assets and monetary liabilities 
of the Group that are not denominated in Sterling, its functional currency. The sensitivity analysis below is based on a 10% appreciation/
depreciation of USD against GBP , applied to the net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in this currency at the balance sheet date.

 Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and is not considered to be a significant risk for the Group. The only interest bearing 
assets relate to cash and cash equivalents exposed to a floating interest rate. All other assets and liabilities are non-interest bearing.
The Group has not prepared an interest rate sensitivity analysis because interest rate risk is not material to the Group.
 Other Price Risk
The Group is not materially affected by other price risks due to the following reasons:
• No equity instruments are held other than shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust
• No commodities are traded

 Credit Risk
Credit risk arises primarily from trade and other receivables. With eg’s exposure to the Financial Services Sector detailed reporting is provided 
weekly on the debt position and if required the Group will resort to legal action to recover any monies due after a sufficient period of time.
 Capital Risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and operate within current 
available facilities. This is reviewed by the board on a monthly basis.
The Group manages its share capital and reserves as its Group capital.
The following table is a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group’s financial instruments at 31 January 
2015 and 31 January 2014.

Employees are offered membership of the eg solutions Pension Plan, a defined contribution pension arrangement. The cost of contributions 
to the scheme is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period that they arise. The contributions to the scheme for the 
period amounted to £176,000 (2014: £148,000) representing 3%–10% of pensionable salaries. The amounts outstanding at the year end were

A Director’s loan of £Nil (2014: £Nil) was due from EA Gooch at 31 January 2015. The loan was interest free with no specific repayment terms 
and the maximum amount outstanding during the year was £42,000 (2014: £140,000).
In the ordinary course of business, sales and purchases of services take place between EGUK and EGSA. Sales of software, consultancy and 
management services from EGUK to EGSA totalled £90,000 (2014: £177,000). Sales of consultancy services from EGSA to EGUK totalled 
£57,000 (2014: £16,000). All transactions are recorded on an inter-company account.
At 31 January 2015 EGUK had a balance receivable from EGSA of £804,000 (2014: £745,000). This inter-company balance is interest free and 
is repayable on demand. A provision for 100% (2014: 25%) impairment was made against the inter-company loan due to the uncertainty of 
recovery.
There is no ultimate controlling party.
 Placing
Following the General Meeting on 12 January 2015, the Company raised £3.2m (before expenses) by way of a placing of 4,905,000 new 
ordinary shares of 1p each.
 Convertible Loan Notes
The Company raised £0.55m in February 2014 through the issue of convertible loan notes.
The Loan Facility, with principal value of £0.55 million in total, was repayable by the Company, together with accrued interest at an annual rate 
of 10 per cent, no later than the first anniversary of issue.
Following the General Meeting held on 12 January 2015 and the admission to AIM of the 4,905,000 placing shares, the providers of the 
Company’s convertible loan facility arrangement (with a total value of £599,425 including accrued interest to the date of the General Meeting) 
(the “Loan Facility”), agreed to convert the Loan Facility into 1,198,848 new Ordinary Shares. Following the conversion, the Company has no 
outstanding indebtedness.

Resolution 9 – Directors’ power to issue shares for cash

maximum nominal amount of £11,234, representing approximately 5% of the nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as

may be cancelled or held in treasury. The authority will expire at the end of the next annual general meeting of the Company or 15 months from the 
passing of the resolution, whichever is the earlier.  The Directors intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent annual general meetings. 
The minimum price that can be paid for an ordinary share is 1p being the nominal value of an ordinary share.  The maximum price that can be paid is 
5% over the average of the middle market prices for an ordinary share, derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange, for the five 
business days immediately before the day on which the share is contracted to be purchased.

Notes:
1.  Pursuant to Part 13 of the Companies Act 2006 and to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended), only those 
members registered in the register of members of the Company at 6:00 p.m. on 10 May 2015 (or if the AGM is adjourned, 48 hours before the 
time fixed for the adjourned AGM) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM in respect of the number of shares registered in their name 
at that time.  In each case, changes to the register of members after such time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to 
attend or vote at the AGM. 
2.  A member who is entitled to attend, speak and vote at the AGM may appoint a proxy to attend, speak and vote instead of him.  A member may 
appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares (so a member must have more 
than one share to be able to appoint more than one proxy).  A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the AGM in order 
to represent you.  A proxy must vote in accordance with any instructions given by the member by whom the proxy is appointed.  Appointing 
a proxy will not prevent a member from attending in person and voting at the AGM (although voting in person at the AGM will terminate the 
proxy appointment).  A proxy form is enclosed.  The notes to the proxy form include instructions on how to appoint the Chairman of the AGM or 
another person as a proxy.  You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these Notes and in the notes to the proxy form. 
3.  To be valid, a proxy form, and the original or duly certified copy of the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or 
authenticated, should reach the Company’s registrar, Capita Asset Services of The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU, 
by no later than 10:30 a.m. on 10 May 2015.    
4.  In the case of joint holders of shares, the vote of the first named in the register of members who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, 
shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of other joint holders.
5.  A member that is a company or other organisation not having a physical presence cannot attend in person but can appoint someone to 
represent it.  This can be done in one of two ways: Either by the appointment of a proxy (described in Notes 2 to 4 above) or of a corporate 
representative.  Members considering the appointment of a corporate representative should check their own legal position, the Company’s 
articles of association and the relevant provision of the Companies Act 2006. 
6.  Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts with the Company and any of its subsidiary undertakings and letters of appointment of the 
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during the usual business hours on any weekday 
(Saturday, Sunday or public holidays excluded) from the date of this notice to the date of the AGM and from 15 minutes prior to and until the 
conclusion of the AGM.

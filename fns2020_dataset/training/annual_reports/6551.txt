I am delighted to be able to announce yet
another year of further progress and record
ﬁnancial results for George Wimpey Plc.
The past four years have been years of
remarkable growth for George Wimpey, four
years in which we have taken a number of
important management decisions to secure the
long term success of our business.We believe
that these actions have placed George Wimpey
in a stronger position from which to respond to
the changing conditions we have experienced
since the UK housing market started to slow
during the second half of 2004. In the UK our
focus on cost control and careful land buying
will help us sustain the improvement we have
achieved over the past few years in our
operating margins. Our US business, Morrison
Homes, has achieved an excellent growth
performance in recent years and has been
steadily building its position to take advantage
of the strong market conditions in the US.
Our scale and diversity provide us with
opportunities to rebalance our business
interests so we can take advantage of strengths
in different markets.This will ensure we achieve
the Board’s key objective of delivering value 
for our shareholders.
GROUP RESULTS
Despite the slower market conditions
experienced in the UK during the second half
of the year, the Group achieved a further
signiﬁcant improvement in ﬁnancial
performance and indeed delivered proﬁts
which exceeded market expectations at 
the time of our interim results, despite the
subsequent market downturn. Although
Group turnover increased by only 4% to
£3,005.7 million, proﬁt before tax rose by 
19% to £450.7 million.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT the stronger end of our expectations. We are
currently operating from 12% more outlets
than at the same time last year. Pricing has
been broadly stable, with the use of incentives
generally below the levels seen last autumn.
The outlook in the US remains strong. Visitor
levels and selling rates are both ahead of the
same period last year. We have the land in
place to support continuing strong volume
growth in 2005.
Overall, the Group remains well placed
through the actions of recent years to
respond to the needs of its markets in 2005.

shareholders to take advantage of this service
where possible. Full details are set out in the
Form of Proxy.
I was delighted to welcome Peter Redfern to
the Board as an Executive Director in October.
Peter took over responsibility for the total UK
housing business at the beginning of this year
and the Board has been delighted with the
way in which he has established himself in
this demanding role. His operational
knowledge will play a vital part in ensuring
that the Board’s broad spread of knowledge
and experience is used to best effect in
providing support for our businesses.
EMPLOYEES
On behalf of the Board I would like to offer
sincerest thanks to all our employees in the
UK and the US for their continuing hard work.
It is their dedication and enthusiasm that
underpin our future success and I am proud
of their commitment to making sure our
business remains a real leader in our sector.
OUTLOOK
At the time of writing this report, after only
seven weeks of trading, it is premature to
draw ﬁrm conclusions on the market outlook
in the UK, especially with a general election
expected in the spring. However, visitor 
levels and interest in this period have been
encouraging and reservations have been at

www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk
John Robinson
Chairman
EXTERNAL BENCHMARK
In July 2003, the Board stated that it believed
shareholders should beneﬁt more fully from
the improvement that has been achieved in
the Company’s performance and that it
therefore proposed increasing the dividend
ahead of growth in earnings per share for a
period of time. Although the strong market
we have seen in the UK over the past few
years is unlikely to continue in 2005, the Board
believes the underlying strength of the
business gives it the conﬁdence to continue
this policy. It is therefore proposing an increase
of 28% in the ﬁnal dividend to 10.8 pence per
share.This follows a 37% increase in the
interim dividend announced in July. If
approved at our Annual General Meeting 
on 14 April 2005, this would bring the total
dividend for the year to 16 pence per share,
a rise of 31% on 2003, and dividend cover
would remain secure at 5.1 times based on
2004 earnings per share.The Board’s proposal
would mean dividends per share would have
more than doubled in the past four years.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE BOARD 
We continue to strive to act as a responsible
company and achieving the highest levels of
corporate governance remains a priority for
the Board. I am therefore pleased to report
that in a recent survey Deutsche Bank judged
George Wimpey to be in the top 10% of 
the FTSE 350 companies in its Corporate
Governance standards. I am also very pleased
to be able to state that throughout 2004 the
Board operated in full compliance with the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
During the year our Corporate Social
Responsibility Committee has overseen the
CSR activities of our companies to ensure we
respond appropriately to the global challenges
of delivering sustainable development.
I can also report that I led a comprehensive
review of the performance of the Board and
of the Board Committees during the year.
Not only does this process enable me to
ensure each Board member is able to bring 
to our Board any ideas or experiences gained
from other Boards but it also enables me to
ensure each Board member is able to
contribute in full.
In line with best practice, we are introducing a
facility to allow shareholders to register proxy
votes electronically this year. I would like to
take this opportunity to encourage
“GEORGE WIMPEY HAS TOP DECILE CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE ASSESSMENT AND IS NEAR THE TOP
OF ITS SECTOR. IT HAS POSITIVE GOVERNANCE
MOMENTUM, ALSO AT THE TOP END OF ITS SECTOR”
FROM ‘BEYOND THE NUMBERS – CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN THE UK’ DEUTSCHE BANK FEBRUARY 2004 Over the past four years, George Wimpey’s
pre-tax proﬁts have grown more than three
times, with our core UK operating margins up
from 11.4% to 18.5% and those in Morrison
Homes up from 8.6% to 14.6%. Although
helped by strong market conditions in both
the UK and US, this remarkable improvement
has been achieved by clear and effective
management actions that have put us in 
a good position to address the changing
markets we face today.
OUR UK STRATEGY 
In the UK whilst driving short term ﬁnancial
improvement, we also took the actions to
ensure George Wimpey and Laing Homes
were well prepared to enter the more
challenging markets that were bound to
arrive eventually. And, as our markets do 
get harder, we are preparing our plans for
growth so that we can respond quickly 
as conﬁdence returns.
The long period of rapidly rising UK house
prices came to an end during the summer.
Since then the market has been subdued,
with customers slow to commit against a
background of ﬁve interest rate rises and press
speculation about house prices. However, the
longer term outlook remains healthy as long 
as general economic conditions are stable.The
market remains undersupplied and

create not just housing but Sustainable
Communities if the extra housing required 
is to enhance and not damage our society.
We wholeheartedly endorse this view and
have embraced it wherever we have been
able to. In both the Operating and Financial
Review and our separate Corporate Social
Responsibility Report, we report on some 
of the actions we have taken to address 
this agenda and demonstrate some of 
our achievements.
DELIVERING CUSTOMER EXCELLENCE
We are proud that we continue to excel
amongst major housebuilders in our standards
of customer satisfaction.We achieve these
results by investing in our people, equipping
them with the right skills and giving them the
right levels of support and resource. All who
work with us know the priority we place on
health and safety and product quality. Of
course, we still make mistakes. But we use 
them to learn and to improve.
MODERN METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION
Continuous improvement is the focus of our
business and our culture. We have the scale
and experience to employ a wide variety of
traditional and innovative approaches to
construction and aim always to employ that
which is most appropriate, taking into
account our needs for safe working practices,
historically low interest rates ensure affordability
remains satisfactory. In the shorter term,
however, any price increases in the market 
are likely to be modest.
This means our focus must remain on
performance improvement. During 2004, we
prioritised sustaining our operating margins
over volume. We raised our land purchase
hurdle rates and ensured our assumptions
about future selling prices and costs were
cautious. We were particularly selective about
which deals to do during the last quarter.
Business focus continues to be on attacking
costs which have risen in recent years, driven
by increasing regulations and taxes. Plans are
in place to achieve cost savings of £20 million
during 2005. We have made sure the
presentation of our new homes to our
customers is as good as we can make it.
We will keep to the same priorities and
disciplines in 2005.
During 2004 we have seen further changes 
in our business environment, many driven 
by Government. Whilst these will have a
signiﬁcant impact on our business, we are
conﬁdent that we are well placed to respond
to them.
MEETING THE DEMAND CRISIS
During recent years housing output has not
responded to the strong demand we have
seen. In 2003 the Government commissioned
a report from Kate Barker to ﬁnd out why. In
her report published in March 2004 Ms Barker
conﬁrmed that the UK’s sclerotic planning
system was to blame.The Government has
still to resolve how it will implement her
proposals but in the meantime the planning
environment has deteriorated further.
George Wimpey alone could have built 
some additional 2,500 homes in 2004 had
applications recommended for approval 
by planning ofﬁcers not been rejected by
planning committees. If implemented,
Ms Barker’s report offers the potential of
sustained volume growth. However, today 
the whole industry faces the challenge of
sustaining volume in a slower market with
lengthening planning delays.
CREATING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES
Both Ms Barker in her report and the
Government in its various proposals have
stressed the need to improve design and

we have successfully developed a range of
‘townhomes’ , affordable attached products
suitable for higher density developments.
We are introducing these in other regions.
We beneﬁt greatly from having the ability 
to balance investment between our UK and
US businesses and will continue to do so
depending on their ability to sustain long 
term returns in excess of our cost of capital.
MANAGING FOR THE FUTURE
Management succession has proceeded
smoothly and successfully in the UK and 
the US. Both Peter Redfern in the UK and 
Steve Parker in the US have a strong team 
of experienced senior managers to support
them, whilst Stu Cline continues to give Steve
wise leadership.The George Wimpey UK Board
has a total of over 150 years and the Morrison
Homes Leadership Team over 50 years of
company experience between them.
It is that experience mirrored across our 
38 regional companies in the UK and US 
that has created the strong business we have
today. I would like to end by thanking all my
colleagues again for their tireless support 
and the commitment that has delivered the
progress we have made over the past four years.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
customer satisfaction, good design and build
efﬁciency. We share this experience across the
Group and transfer good practice wherever
possible. We are major users of prefabricated
components. However, we do not have the
skills of a building component manufacturer
and do not intend to produce such
components ourselves.
US BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
The US offers us a far more positive business
environment.The outlook in our markets is
good and, whilst development controls are
increasing, the political environment is pro-
development. As housing supply responds
more easily to demand, price inﬂation in the
US has been lower than in the UK. Morrison’s
markets beneﬁt from positive demographic
trends, internal migration and some of the
highest rates of employment growth in 
the US.
OUR US STRATEGY
Because of this, we have maximised Morrison
Homes’ growth. In three years completions
have grown over 30% to 4,422 and proﬁts
have more than doubled. However, we have
scaled back our activities in Atlanta, where
industry returns are below our own targets,
and will exit that market during 2005.
Our detailed plans to achieve growth are set
out in the Operating and Financial Review. We
have broadened our Northern Californian
business with a new Division in the lower
priced Central Valley, south of Sacramento,
and will develop this position further. We
continue to strengthen our powerful position

UK HOUSING MARKET
The UK housing market remained generally
strong during early 2004, though the
weakness in the higher priced market,
identiﬁed during 2003, continued.This affected
Laing Homes and some of the southern
regions of George Wimpey. By late summer 
Despite a more challenging market, especially
in the second half, 2004 has been another
year of excellent progress for our UK housing
business. Management was very focused on
the basics of the business – selective land
acquisition, cost control, sales presentation
and customer satisfaction. As a result,
operating margins improved further in both
George Wimpey and Laing Homes and the
business was strengthened as it entered

the market in general had slowed sharply
across the country and showed no real
improvement during the autumn. Customers
took longer to commit to their purchase and
found it increasingly difﬁcult to achieve their
asking price for second hand properties.
Despite this, most forecasters believe that 
the UK housing market continues to be
signiﬁcantly undersupplied. Ofﬁcial estimates
continue to indicate that Great Britain needs
many more new homes each year to meet
underlying demand than are currently being
built .The Government has, as yet, done little
to implement the recommendations made 
by Kate Barker. Furthermore, the underlying
economic background remains positive.The
cost of borrowing, and hence the burden 
of mortgage service costs, remains low by
historic standards. Unemployment is low 
and wage growth has been steady.
FINANCIAL REVIEW 
In 2004 turnover for the total UK housing
division increased by 1% to £2,301 million
(2003: £2,270 million). With further
improvements in operating margins in 
both George Wimpey and Laing Homes,
operating proﬁts grew 10% to £408.9 million
(2003: £371.8 million). Return on average
capital employed remained a healthy 
25.8% compared to 27.0% in 2003.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW – UK HOUSING CONTINUED
Turnover for the George Wimpey brand
increased 2% to £1,976 million (2003: £1,933
million).Total completions were 6% lower at
11,122, with private development completions
8% lower at 10,345. Operating proﬁt rose 
by 11% to £365.8 million (2003: £330.1 million)
and has doubled in just three years. Operating
margins rose yet again to 18.5% from 17.1% 
in 2003.
Turnover for the Laing Homes brand was
£324.7 million, a reduction of 4% (2003:
£336.8 million).Total completions were up 1%
to 1,110, private development completions
were down 5%. Operating proﬁt was up 
3% to £43.1 million (2003: £41.7 million), with
operating margins making some further
progress to 13.3% from 12.4% in 2003.
OUTLETS AND COMPLETIONS
The average number of outlets open during
the year was 295 (2003: 309) which was
depressed due to continuing delays in
processing new sites through the planning
system. A particular issue has been local
authorities rejecting planning applications
even when they have ofﬁcer recommendation.
However, going into 2005, due to increased
land buying during 2003 and early 2004, we
had 309 outlets open, a 5% increase on the
beginning of 2004. By late February we were
operating from 325 outlets, 12% more than 
in the same week in 2004.

PRICES AND COSTS
For George Wimpey, average selling prices 
for the year were up 8% to £182,000, with the
whole of this price increase gained during 
the ﬁrst half. Average selling prices during the
second half remained broadly ﬂat on the 
ﬁrst half. For Laing Homes, average selling
prices rose 2% to £320,000 as planned
reductions in the sales of higher priced
homes were balanced by reductions in 
the volume of smaller apartments.
The use of incentives increased during the
second half of 2004 to support selling rates in
the slower markets we experienced.These
were focused on speciﬁc plots, which were
more difﬁcult to sell, and on particular
customer groups, such as ﬁrst time buyers.The
use of part exchange was tightly controlled
and accounted for less than 3% of sales.The
book value of part exchange properties owned
at the year end was £25.6 million (2003: £28.4
million).The use of part exchange has been
further reduced in the ﬁrst weeks of 2005.
Cost inﬂation was contained as labour cost
increases slowed, beneﬁting from the supply 
of skilled and good quality labour from the
European Union and Eastern Europe. Costs
were also helped by the continued
development of the use of prefabricated
components wherever these provided an
the East Midlands and Scotland. Satellites 
have proven a cost-effective way of
establishing an additional market presence
both in George Wimpey and in Morrison
Homes in the US.
The Laing Homes regional businesses were
restructured at the beginning of the year to
improve overhead recovery. Each is still below
ideal scale and hence they provide signiﬁcant
potential for future volume growth.The Laing
Homes presence today remains limited to
Southeast England and parts of the Midlands.
We have identiﬁed target markets in the 
East and Southwest of England, as well as in
Scotland, that will be developed as market
conditions allow.
Over the past three years, we have developed
an expertise in inner city developments.
However, in light of very competitive market
conditions in a number of city centres we
have limited our exposure to this market.
At the end of the year we entered into a joint
venture agreement with a subsidiary of
Barclays PLC for the development of The 
Great Northern Tower, our high-rise apartment
building in central Manchester. Sales on this
development are proceeding well.We will
continue to develop such opportunities
through joint ventures when appropriate
opportunities arise.

Visitor levels throughout the year remained
healthy, although average visitor levels in the
second half fell below those achieved in the
very strong market of the previous year.
The total number of completions was 12,232
(2003: 12,909) and the total number of private
development completions was 11,274 (2003:
12,203).The reduction in total completions
came from a lower average number of outlets
open through the year and selling rates in the
second half that were below the exceptionally
strong performance in 2003. In addition, we
rejected a signiﬁcant number of investment
reservations at the year end rather than
renegotiate the terms of sale. In the weaker
market conditions we experienced, our focus
was to maintain our improvement in
operating margins rather than deliver
maximum volumes.
Together, the George Wimpey and Laing
Homes brands give a wide spread across the
UK market and provide the potential for
signiﬁcant organic volume growth as the
market and availability of land permit.

the North (including Scotland), the Midlands

economic solution to our construction needs.
Material costs rose broadly in line with inﬂation,
with increases in steel and other commodity
prices having limited impact. However,
increases in landﬁll tax and aggregates tax,
together with changes to building regulations
and in the rules controlling the disposal of
waste materials from brownﬁeld sites,
continued to impact overall costs, as did the
number of bespoke designs required by local
planning conditions. Our drive to increase 
the efﬁciencies of new house types to meet
current planning requirements gives us 
an opportunity to counteract some of 
these costs in 2005 and beyond.
PRODUCT MIX
The mix of products built across our
businesses continues to be inﬂuenced by the
requirements of PPG3, central Government’s
guidance on Housing Policy. However, we
continue to strive to maintain a product range
that meets the needs and preferences of our
customers and provides good affordability in
the market.
The proportion of sales accounted for by four
and ﬁve bedroom detached houses fell
during the year to 37% (2003: 42%), with the
proportion of apartments rising to 31% (2003:
26%). For 2004 the average size of our
products was 1,033 sq ft (2003: 1,067 sq ft).
We continue to limit our exposure to higher
priced properties, with 36% of our homes
priced at less than £150,000 and more than
85% priced below £250,000.
We pride ourselves on the quality and design
of our new homes and on building
communities which meet our customers’
requirements. In the NHBC Pride in the Job
Awards, 61 of our site managers received
Quality Awards, 17 of these received Top 100
Seals of Excellence, and Tommy Flynn from
George Wimpey West Scotland was the
Regional Award winner for Scotland. For yet
another year we achieved a better overall
performance than any of our competitors.
Increasingly the UK Government has been
pushing to improve both the standards of
design for new housing and also the impact
new housing has on existing communities. Our
extensive experience puts us in an excellent
position to respond to these challenges and
we have been increasingly involved in
designing and building a range of sustainable
communities.These communities are built on
brownﬁeld land and offer residents the
opportunity to live and work in the same area.
They incorporate Home Zone principles where
the emphasis is on people not cars and where
the homes are built to high environmental
standards with low energy consumption.These
developments are planned and designed after

extensive consultation to ensure they meet the
requirements of both new and existing local
residents. Examples of these projects are
highlighted within this report. Our ability to
respond to local authorities’ requirements to
build more sustainable communities places 
us in a good position for the future.
LANDBANK
Improving both the quality and length of our
landbank on the right terms remains one of
our top priorities. However, in a weakening
market we have been careful to secure our
future land needs without overpaying. We
raised our land purchase hurdle rates in the
year and increased the premium we seek on
higher risk developments, such as apartments,
bespoke developments and unconditional
land purchases, to ensure we sustain the
margin improvements we have achieved over
the past few years. During the last quarter of
the year we were particularly selective as the
land market in places was slow to adjust to
the changed market for housing.
During the year the short term owned and
controlled landbank for the total UK business
increased by 5% to 51,119 plots compared to
48,608 plots at the end of 2003 and 50,901
plots at the end of June 2004. Planning
permission was achieved on almost 15,000
plots during the year.

plot cost was £72,400 (2003: £90,400), partially
reﬂecting a changed mix.
We have been able to increase the average
scope of sites acquired during the year. For
George Wimpey the average scope of sites
acquired was 92 units (2003: 80 units) and for
Laing Homes it stayed stable at around 60
units.The average coverage of sites increased
at George Wimpey, rising from around 17,250
sq ft per acre (excluding high-rise, inner city
developments) to 17,902 sq ft per acre. At
Laing Homes it fell from about 27,000 sq ft
per acre to 22,000 sq ft per acre.
The strategic landbank continues to provide a
ﬂow of plots into the short term landbank with
1,079 plots transferred during the year.The
strategic landbank now totals 17,571 acres
and includes around 13,500 plots allocated 
in local plans for future development.
QUALITY AND CUSTOMERS
George Wimpey UK aims to provide levels of
customer satisfaction which set us apart from
the rest of the sector. Ms Barker criticised the
housebuilding industry for the low levels of
customer satisfaction it delivers. She
recommended that the industry should aim to
improve the proportion of its customers who 16
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW – UK HOUSING GEORGE WIMPEY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW – UK HOUSING CONTINUED
would recommend their builder to friends or
family from the average of only 46% recorded
in the 2003 Housing Forum survey to at least
75%. George Wimpey has been reporting its
results on this measure for a number of years,
and can report that during 2004 86% of our 
UK customers said they would recommend 
us to their friends or family.
To make sure we continue to achieve industry
leading levels of customer service, last year
every employee took part in our ‘Growing
Wiser’ training programme, highlighting the
importance of customer service in every
aspect of the business.This programme built
on lessons learnt from the successful
transformation of customer satisfaction levels
in our West Scotland business. Alongside this,
our detailed customer care management
system is aimed at ensuring all customers
receive consistently high levels of service and
provides us with benchmarking data so areas
of improvement can be identiﬁed at a
regional or national level.
A key part of ensuring our customers receive
excellent service is to provide them with a
range of optional extras to help them customise
their new homes. Four regional businesses
now handle the selection and sale of optional
extras for all their homes through central
selection centres. In addition we continue to
review other ways in which we can offer our
customers a wider range of optional extras
from retail centres that best suit the type and
location of the home they are buying.The
total revenue from the sale of optional extras
during 2004 was approximately £60 million, an
average of £5,296 per customer. George
Wimpey customers spend on average £5,535
per plot and Laing Homes customers £2,633
per plot.There remains particular scope within
the Laing Homes brand to grow this further.
GOING FORWARD
In the longer term, the fundamentals
supporting the housing market remain good:
interest rates are likely to stay low by historic
standards, employment is healthy and the
housing market continues to be undersupplied.
Whilst external cost pressures remain, labour
cost increases have moderated signiﬁcantly.The
business focus continues to be on cost
management and plans are in place to achieve
cost savings of £20 million during 2005.

DELIVERING CONSISTENT GROWTH
GREYSTONE, ORLANDO, FLORIDA SECURING LAND FOR THE FUTURE
Morrison Homes has been able to achieve a
rapid rate of organic growth over the past
few years because the strong markets in
which it operates are supported by positive
demographic trends, employment and
economic growth. To ensure this rate of
growth is sustained the business has built
up an excellent landbank, creating a strong
foundation for the future.
In Orlando, by developing the new
townhome product, Morrison is able to build
communities in A+ locations within the city
limits which would not have been suitable
for their traditional single family homes. This
provides the business with a greater range
of land opportunities to consider.
Morrison Homes has built its
ﬁrst townhome development
‘Greystone’ in Orlando, Florida.
EXPANDING THE PRODUCT RANGE 
Morrison Homes aims to be a leading
housebuilder in each of its markets and has
a clear strategy of growth to achieve this.
To continue to increase market share
Morrison has been developing new ranges of
slightly smaller, more efﬁcient products across
all its businesses to complement their existing
ranges of very popular single family homes.
In central Florida the higher density townhome
product was introduced to the market in 2004.
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH 
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
The Morrison Homes brand is recognised for
excellence in customer service. This comes
from providing customers with excellent
levels of service during the purchase
process and also from building high quality
products in good locations.
At Greystone, a gated community,
customers are able to buy a well designed
product with the features they feel are
important. The development has a
swimming pool and ﬁtness area at the
Clubhouse, which also provides a
community space for all residents.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW – US HOUSING CONTINUED
Starts at 1.600 million and New Home Sales 
at 1.186 million.The ﬁrst half of the year was
particularly strong with the second half
returning to a more normal, sustainable
healthy market.The housing market was
supported by continuing low 30 year ﬁxed
rate mortgages which ranged from 5.7% 
to 6.4% during the year.
A major challenge for homebuilders came
from shortages of labour and materials,
particularly in markets with very high housing
demand. Central Florida was signiﬁcantly
affected by the impact of four hurricanes in
the late summer, which resulted in shortages
of both materials and labour throughout the
last quarter.
Morrison Homes markets in Central Florida
and Phoenix remained particularly robust
throughout 2004.The Northern California
markets in Sacramento and the Central Valley
started the year very strongly but moderated
to a more normal level in the second half of
the year. In Denver and Texas, with the
exception of Houston, the economy and
housing markets remained slower than
expected throughout 2004.
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
During the year Morrison Homes turnover
increased 29% to $1,290.2 million (2003:
$997.8 million) on the back of a 21% rise in
the number of completions to 4,422 (2003:
3,661). With operating margins up sharply
from 11.9% to 14.6%, operating proﬁt rose
59% to $188.0 million (2003: $118.6 million).
Signiﬁcant price increases were achieved in
some markets whilst costs were carefully
managed and volume growth led to
improved overhead absorption.
In sterling, these results were adversely
affected by the weakening dollar throughout
the year.They have been translated into
in July and ending the year at 102.3. Job
growth ended the year the highest since
1999. Unemployment and interest rates
remain low. In 2005 job growth is projected 
to be in the range of 2-2.2 million, with 
25% of this growth being in Florida, California 
and Texas.
The US housing market continues to be at
historically high levels, beneﬁting from good
underlying demographic trends. 2004 was

market. Plans are in hand to exit this business
during 2005. During 2004 the Atlanta business
completed 312 homes with a turnover of $79
million, operating proﬁts of $4 million and a
return on average capital employed of 11%.
The value of assets employed as at
31 December 2004 was $26 million.
The numbers for Atlanta are included in 
the Southeast in the regional chart.The 
results for the Phoenix Division have been
included in the Southwest region, reﬂecting 
a more logical allocation and revised
management responsibilities.
OUTLETS AND COMPLETIONS
The ﬁnal number of completions was affected
by extensive construction delays in Florida
following the hurricanes, which caused at
least 150 to be delayed into 2005. Despite 
this, the number of completions grew by 
21% to 4,422.
Average outlets at 100 were slightly below 
the previous year but with very strong 
markets in Northern California, Central Florida
and Phoenix, Arizona some outlets sold out
faster than anticipated.Visitor levels were
particularly high, with the average number 
of visitors per outlet up 25% on 2003.Very
good conversion rates resulted in a 29%
increase in the average sales rate to 0.93 
sales per outlet per week.
Average selling prices rose by 7% to $288,900
during the year (2003: $270,000) with
Northern California, Central Florida and
Phoenix seeing price increases above 10%.
Price increases in Denver, Atlanta and most 
of Texas were comparatively subdued.The
average size of a Morrison home was broadly
unchanged at 2,386 sq ft (2003: 2,430 sq ft).
To support Morrison’s growth within its existing
geographic markets, new ranges of slightly
smaller, more affordable products have been
introduced across all markets during 2004.The
introduction of the new attached, higher density
townhome product has been particularly
successful in the Orlando and Tampa markets
and this product will play an increasing part in
the growth of the Southeast Region.
LANDBANK
Morrison Homes has sustained a rapid rate 
of organic growth because of the strength of
the markets in which it operates and its strong
landbank. During 2004 we continued to add 
to the short term landbank at a rate to support
the growth plans over the coming years.The
number of owned and controlled plots

sterling at an average rate of $1.83/£1
compared with $1.64/£1 used in 2003. In
sterling terms proﬁts increased by 42% to
£102.7 million (2003: £72.3 million).
Over the last three years Morrison has grown
turnover by 60% and has more than doubled
operating proﬁts. Further investment into land
to support plans for continued growth has
resulted in a 21.3% increase in average assets
employed to $556.2 million. Despite this
increased level of investment the business
achieved a return on average capital employed
of 33.8%, well ahead of the cost of capital.
Controlling costs has been a major focus for
Morrison’s management teams during the
year, particularly as material producers have
tried to push through price increases in the
face of strong worldwide demand for
products such as steel and cement whilst
lumber prices also increased signiﬁcantly. A
constant programme of value engineering,
careful management of construction
programmes and the introduction of regional
purchasing councils ensure that Morrison
takes advantage of all opportunities for
procurement savings.
Over the last two years, Morrison has reduced
its investment into the Atlanta business whilst
undertaking a review to establish whether it
could earn adequate long term returns in this

CUSTOMER SERVICE
Morrison Homes continues to focus on
maintaining competitive advantage through
its approach to customer satisfaction. During
the year Morrison’s ‘would you recommend’
customer satisfaction score averaged 86.3%,
with ﬁve of its Divisions achieving their
internal goal of over 90%. Morrison measures
customer satisfaction continuously and has 
its own procedures to ensure lessons learnt
are incorporated into the business. Its Seven
Points of Contact with the customer – from
reservation through to completion of its
comprehensive two year warranty period –
provide the basis of a continuing relationship
between the company and its customers.
The centralised Signature Selection Centers
available across all Divisions continue to add
value for our customers. On average customers
spent $28,000 per sale (2003: $27,400), which
represents approximately 10% of turnover.
During the year we researched further
opportunities to develop the sale of options.
During 2005 new products and packages will
be introduced along with improvements to
our Signature Selection Centers and our own
procedures to increase sales and margins.
The new morrisonhomes.com website has
been launched which has an increased focus
on providing our customers with the
information they need at each stage of buying
a new home. During 2004 43% more people
visited our website than in the previous year.
Morrison Financial Services and Morrison Title
continued to be valuable parts of our
business, with 61% of customers arranging
their mortgages through us and in Texas and
Florida, Morrison Title provided title services
for 90% of customers.
GOING FORWARD
Although short term interest rates are
expected to rise, the US housing market is
forecast to remain strong throughout 2005,
supported by positive demographic trends,
employment and economic growth. Morrison
is well positioned in the markets that will
beneﬁt most from this.
Morrison Homes has achieved a rapid rate of
growth in recent years and is well placed with
a strong landbank, healthy market conditions
and a tight control of costs to ensure this
continues over the coming years.

People take priority over cars, homes are
grouped into clusters of 16-25 properties
with pocket parks and shared areas. All the

CASE STUDY With strong growth in operating proﬁt and
slightly reduced interest costs, proﬁt before
tax rose by 19% to £450.7 million.
The tax charge for the year totalled 
£139.7 million, representing an average 
tax rate of 31% as anticipated.This rate 
is expected to be sustained in 2005.
Earnings per share rose to 80.8 pence, an 
18% increase over 2003. Reﬂecting our stated
policy of reducing our dividend cover over
time, the Board is recommending a ﬁnal
dividend of 10.8 pence per share bringing 
the full year dividend to 16.0 pence per share,
an increase of 31%.
Average net debt for the year was of the order
of £881 million compared to £809 million 
in 2003. However, 2003 beneﬁted from an
average deferred payment outstanding of
£125 million relating to the acquisition of
Laing Homes.
Interest cover stood at 10.1 times, a further
improvement on 2003’s cover of 8.3 times.
Another indication of the Group’s growing
ﬁnancial strength is a reduction in gearing (net
debt to shareholders’ funds) from 45% on 31
December 2003 to 36% on 31 December 2004.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW – GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW
GROUP SUMMARY
Group turnover, proﬁt before tax and earnings
per share all showed progress and yet again
achieved all time records. Proﬁt before tax was
more than three times the level achieved just
four years ago in 2000. Operating margins in
both George Wimpey and Morrison Homes
continued their growth of recent years
reaching new heights.
Group turnover increased by 4% to 
£3,005.7 million exceeding £3 billion for 
the ﬁrst time. With the additional beneﬁt 
of margin improvements on both sides of 
the Atlantic operating proﬁt rose by 16% to
£500.7 million. Despite continued investment
into the landbank, return on average capital
employed was 27.4% and remains substantially
above our cost of capital.
Interest costs totalled £49.7 million, slightly
down on 2003’s expense of £51.6 million,
which included £7.6 million imputed interest
on deferred consideration relating to the
acquisition of Laing Homes. Despite higher
short term market rates and higher average
debt, a competitive banking market together
with a strengthening balance sheet enabled
the Group to moderate the increase in its
effective cost of borrowing.The effective
interest rate of 5.5% was slightly up on the 
rate of 5.4% experienced in 2003.

HAS BEEN ABLE TO REPORT 
A SET OF EXCELLENT RESULTS 
FOR THE YEAR” 26
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW – GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW GEORGE WIMPEY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW – GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
SECOND HALF RESULTS
In the six months ending 31 December 2004
Group turnover at £1,785.8 million was broadly
level with the corresponding period in 2003.
Improved margins gave impetus to operating
proﬁts which grew by 13% to £319.1 million
after absorbing a £7.8 million adverse proﬁt
translation effect of a weaker dollar. Interest
costs at £26.6 million were in line with 2003.
Consequently proﬁt before tax for the second
half rose by 14% to £292.2 million.
In the UK consumer sentiment was affected
by the cumulative effect of ﬁve successive
interest rate increases and uncertainty on 
the future direction of house prices fuelled 
by comment from the Governor of the Bank
of England and media speculation. Sales and
hence completions slowed in stark contrast 
to the last six months of 2003 which had 
seen exceptionally buoyant conditions.
During this period we were careful to focus
on maintaining the improvement in margins
achieved over the past few years rather than
pursuing volume. As a result completions 
fell by 13% compared to the second half 
of 2003 whilst operating proﬁt increased by
3% to £253.1 million.
In the US, market conditions remained
generally strong with the 30 year ﬁxed
mortgage rate continuing below 6% and
employment levels rising. Morrison Homes’
second half completions at 2,708 increased by
26% over the ﬁnal six months of 2003 despite
some disruption due to the hurricanes in
Florida. Average selling prices increased to
$296,000 compared with $273,000 in the
corresponding period in 2003, more than
offsetting cost inﬂation pressures. Consequently
operating proﬁt increased by a substantial
74% to $127.9 million.
FINANCIAL AND TREASURY POLICIES
The Group has ﬁnanced its growth in recent
years through a combination of retained
proﬁts, bank loans and long term loans in the
form of US$ private placements with a group
of US insurance companies. All loans and
banking relationships are managed centrally
through the Group Treasury Department.
We continue to use derivatives to generate
the appropriate balance between ﬁxed,
capped and ﬂoating interest rate proﬁles. It is
not our policy to trade actively in derivatives
or to use more complex derivatives.
The Group’s Treasury Committee is responsible
for developing and recommending policy to
the Board and for monitoring our ﬁnance risks.
The main risks arising from our ﬁnancing
instruments are liquidity, interest rate and
foreign exchange currency risk.

represents a £270.7 million or 23% increase
over the value of shareholders’ funds at the
start of 2004. Expressed on a per share basis,
shareholders’ funds increased by 64 pence to
368 pence.
The increase in net assets employed, which
rose by £262.4 million to £1,960.0 million,
was therefore ﬁnanced by retained earnings
with net debt reducing slightly in the year 
to £520.9 million (2003: £529.2 million).The
increase in net assets employed is, in the
main, due to further investment in our land
position, with the total value of our land assets
rising by £211.9 million to £1,940.5 million.
Land, in accordance with accounting
guidelines, is valued at the lower of historic
cost or realisable value. We continue to make
use of deferred land payment opportunities
when it is economic to do so.The land
creditor balance of £281.5 million represents 
a slight reduction on 2003 and stands at 
15% of land value (2003: 17%).
The Group generated a net cash inﬂow, after
payment of dividends and ﬁnancing costs, of
£8.3 million.The funds generated from our
strong earnings performance have been
principally used to ﬁnance increased
investment in land and work in progress, pay
our tax and interest obligations and raise our
dividends paid to shareholders by 33%. 27

borrowings, interest rate swaps and options.
The most adverse scenario for the Group is 
a signiﬁcant increase in interest rates which
would weaken the housing market at the
same time as increasing borrowing costs.
To mitigate this risk the Group has arranged
that approximately 79% of its year end debt 
is at ﬁxed interest rates.
The advent of International Accounting
Standard 39 has caused considerable 
debate within the accounting, treasury 
and broader business communities in the 
UK and Continental Europe. George Wimpey
has contributed to this debate through its
membership of The Hundred Group of
Finance Directors and the CBI (Confederation
of British Industry). We have also consulted
widely in determining our own policy. Some
of the instruments we currently use do not
meet the highly prescriptive conditions
needed to adopt hedge accounting. We have
decided to continue to use these instruments
and consequently not to adopt hedge
accounting for interest hedging instruments.
Our principal focus is to manage the
underlying economic exposure rather than
our reported accounts. It should be recognised
that this may generate a degree of volatility 
in our reported interest costs.The Board has
decided to keep this matter under review.
Liquidity Risk:The Group maintains adequate
committed borrowing facilities to ensure that
seasonal borrowing can be accommodated
whilst maintaining prudent headroom and a
range of development plans can be ﬁnanced.
As can be seen from note 17 to the accounts
the Group had committed bank facilities of
£945 million at the end of 2004. It also had long
term debt raised in the US private placement
market of £303 million with maturities ranging
up to 14 years.
We took the opportunity presented by
favourable conditions in the UK banking
market to replace some of our established
bank facilities with a new £500 million
syndicated bank facility on better terms. All
other bank arrangements have also been
renegotiated on improved terms.This has
been achieved as a consequence of the
Group’s strengthened credit standing in the
eyes of our debt providers and a record of
delivering against our promises.
The combined effects of these actions has
enabled the Group to maintain the average
maturity of its committed facilities at in excess
of ﬁve years whilst mitigating the impact of
hardening short term interest rates.
Interest Rate Risk:We aim to limit our exposure
to ﬂuctuations in the cash interest cost of
servicing our debt by using ﬁxed interest rate

CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS 2004 (£M)
Currency Risk: Our principal currency risk is
the translation exposure of our investment in
Morrison Homes. Our policy is to match as far
as practicable our dollar denominated assets
with dollar denominated debt.
Consequently movement in the sterling/dollar
exchange rate has had little effect on the
Group’s shareholders’ funds, though it did
affect the sterling value of year end debt as
well as reported turnover and proﬁt before tax.
The Board has also given consideration to the
management of risk related to major inner
city schemes.These schemes are different in
nature to normal housing or to schemes
involving smaller apartment blocks where
both construction and sales can be more
evenly phased. Whilst such developments
represent an attractive and growing market
opportunity, they involve signiﬁcantly higher
ﬁnancial commitment and risk, relating both
to the phasing of sales and construction and
to the inclusion of commercial space within
the programme.
It is therefore the Group’s policy to develop 
a proportion of such schemes with an
appropriate joint venture partner in order 
to reduce the extent of our equity exposure.
In addition to an equity partner, debt facilities
are arranged for these joint ventures on a
project speciﬁc non recourse base. During
2004 two such joint venture companies were
established involving a ﬁnancial partner in
Manchester and a trade partner in London.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND PENSIONS
The 2004 Annual Report has been produced
in accordance with standards issued by the
Accounting Standards Board.There have been
no new standards issued during 2004 which
affect these accounts.The accounts have
been prepared on a basis which is consistent
with the accounting policies adopted for 2003
as modiﬁed in order to comply with the
pronouncement of the Urgent Issues Tax
Force Number 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’ .
The effect of this adoption, which is not
material in the context of the accounts as a
whole, is detailed in note 27 to the accounts.
We are well prepared for the adoption of
international accounting standards in 2005.
As commented on in last year’s Annual Report

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW – GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW GEORGE WIMPEY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW – GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Under the pension scheme rules an actuarial
valuation of the scheme was carried out
based upon data as at April 2002.This showed
a deﬁcit of £74 million below that required to
cover the beneﬁts accrued to members after
allowing for expected future increases in
earnings.This valuation will be updated
during 2005 based upon data as at April 2005.
The Company has taken several major steps
to address the shortfall and risk exposure in
the pension scheme over the last few years.
The balance of the fund in UK and overseas
equities has been reduced and we had just
31% of funds in equities at the end of 2004.
The deﬁned beneﬁt scheme was closed to
new members on 1 January 2002. Employee
contributions have been increased.The
favourable arrangements for early retirement
for employees and deferred members have
also been amended.The normal service cost
to the company has now fallen to 13.2% of
pensionable payroll. In 2004 we invested an
additional £15 million in cash (2003: £10
million) to contribute towards reducing the
deﬁcit. With all these measures in place, we
remain conﬁdent that the pension deﬁcit is
being responsibly addressed.
recognition are unaffected. In particular our
prudent policy of only recognising revenue
and proﬁts once the sale of a house is legally
completed will continue.There will be minor
changes relating to the size and recognition
of the cost of share based incentive schemes
and accounting for long term land acquisition
contracts. Goodwill relating to the acquisitions
of Richardson Homes, Denver and Laing
Homes will no longer be amortised but subject
to an annual impairment test. However,
goodwill paid on these acquisitions was very
modest and was valued at £4.7 million at the
end of 2004. As commented on in the Interest
Rate Risk section on page 27, we will be
focusing on policies which manage the
economic rather than the accounting risk of
interest rate movements. We may therefore
experience some volatility in reported interest
costs under International Accounting
Standard 39.
As expected the new international
accounting pensions standard, IAS 19, has
many aspects which are similar to FRS17,
whilst offering a number of options for
implementation. We are waiting to review
emerging best practice in this area before
deciding which option to implement.
The 2004 accounts have been prepared,
consistent with previous years, by following
the principles laid out in SSAP24. Details of the
accounting effect of SSAP24 and FRS17 are
shown in note 8 to the accounts.
In summary, under FRS17 the UK pension
scheme has assets (at current market value) of
£590 million and liabilities (discounted at the
AA rated corporate bond yield required by the
standard) of £775 million.This results in a gross
deﬁcit of £185 million which is partially offset
by a deferred tax asset of £55 million giving a
net deﬁcit of £130 million.This compares to a
net deﬁcit at the end of 2003 of £130 million.
Whilst the deﬁcit would have been reduced
as a result of the decision made early in the
year to amend the terms on which deferred
pensioners may take early retirement to bring
them in line with the practice adopted for
those retiring from employment, we have
recognised the evidence of increased liability
arising from greater longevity and have
therefore used more conservative
assumptions in this important area.

PROMOTING EFFICIENT USE OF LAND AND RESOURCES
THE METRO,SLOUGH The Metro in Slough, Berkshire is a
landmark, high-density scheme of
integrated mixed tenures.
EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT
134 new homes have been built on the
1.62 hectare site, giving a density of 97 units
per hectare. The Metro provides a range of
new homes; split level live/work units; two
and three bedroom ﬂats and duplexes and
four bedroom townhouses. The homes are
for open market and discounted open
market sale, shared ownership and rent.
Home Zone principles reduce the 
dominance of the car and increase the
level of natural surveillance creating a safe,
crime-free community.
High-density housing using 
environmentally friendly 
designs and materials
INNOVATIVE USE OF MATERIALS
The scheme has been constructed using 
prefabricated timber-framed wall, ﬂoor and
roof components. Timber frames are clad
with maintenance-free external wall
ﬁnishes. Two rooﬁng materials are used 
on site, one is 100% recyclable the other 
is 60% crushed waste slate.
Careful design and better on-site
construction practices led to signiﬁcant
reductions in waste materials. Redundant
buildings and concrete hardstanding were
all reused for road bases and backﬁll.
MINIMISING THE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT 
The development is able to reduce water
consumption by using low-capacity ﬂush
toilets, spray-head taps and rainwater
harvesting. Sustainable urban drainage
systems allow rainwater to soak away 
back into the natural watercourse.
Windows, glazing and insulation all exceed
the U-values set out in current building
regulations. Carbon dioxide intensive
components have been avoided and
aluminium products chosen over uPVC.
The development is designed to 
reduce CO
2
emissions by providing 
good natural daylighting and
maximisation of solar gain.
In addition energy-efﬁcient light ﬁttings,
space heating and some photovoltaic cells
are provided. Recycling facilities are also
provided for residents use.

across the UK in 2005.
Morrison Homes worked with sub-contractors
and suppliers to implement improved fall
protection programmes and, in 2005, we will
introduce a national safety award and annual
safety audit for every Division.
Environment
• 1,453 UK homes built to the Building Research
Establishment’s EcoHomes standards.
• The Sacramento Division of Morrison Homes
won a building industry energy efﬁciency
award for ‘zero-energy’ homes 
in California.
Housebuilders have a signiﬁcant impact upon
the environment, both on the communities in
which we operate and those further aﬁeld
that are affected by the sourcing and
manufacture of the materials we use.
In the UK, we undertook a pilot sustainability
survey of major suppliers and will survey the
remainder of our suppliers in 2005. We are
also working towards ISO14001 certiﬁcation
for our Environmental Management System.
Two Morrison Homes Divisions received US
Government Energy Star Accreditation for
building energy-efﬁcient homes. In 2005, we
will continue to work towards converting all
of our new homes to Freon-free HVAC systems.
Community
• 1,428 UK homes received Considerate
Constructors Scheme accreditation in 2004.
• 68% of UK homes were built on 
brownﬁeld land.
We aim to have a positive impact on the
communities in which we operate. We focus
on building safe, pleasant and sustainable
communities; land regeneration; building with
care; affordable housing; supporting charitable
initiatives and engaging with stakeholders.
In 2004, we developed a Construction Code of
Practice to clarify the standards we expect of
employees and sub-contractors on all of our
UK and US sites. We also analysed the mix of
our charitable activities in order to maximise
the beneﬁts of our charitable contributions.
Employees
• 62% of UK employees rate us above average
or one of the best companies they know or
have worked for.
• 83% of staff think Morrison Homes is 
a great place to work.
We focus on investing in our employees 
and developing their potential. Employees 
are our most valuable resource and they are 
a fundamental part of our continuing
business success. In the UK, we completed our
second bi-annual staff satisfaction survey. We
will increase investment in employee training
and development in 2005.
Morrison Homes launched a virtual university
to improve employee training. We will roll out
the new curriculum for the university in 2005
and will continue to enhance training and
development programmes.
Customer Care
• George Wimpey and Laing Homes won 
61 Quality Awards (more than any other
housebuilder) at the National House Building
Council’s Pride in the Job Awards.
• 86% of US customers would recommend 
us to friends and family.
Our aim is to offer our customers unrivalled and
consistent quality of product and service. We
focus on continuously improving the quality of
our build, ﬁnish and customer communication.

Charter, all of our UK employees took part in
Growing Wiser, a new customer care training
initiative. We will train sub-contractors and
suppliers on Growing Wiser during 2005.
Morrison Homes introduced a new Customer
Communication Management System to
provide enhanced customer care capabilities
as well as comprehensive tracking and
reporting. We will continue to enhance this
system in 2005.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT GEORGE WIMPEY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors submit to the members their Report and Accounts of 
the Company for the year ended 31 December 2004.The report on
Corporate Governance and the Remuneration Report on pages 38 and
41 respectively, form part of this Directors’ Report.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS 
During 2004 the Group’s principal activities were in housing and land
development under the George Wimpey, Laing Homes and Morrison
Homes brand names. A summary of the results of these activities is set
out in note 1 on page 52. Further details of the Company’s activities
and future developments are described on pages 2 to 30.
PROFIT AND DIVIDENDS
The profit for the financial year of £311.0 million is reported in the
profit and loss account on page 48. An interim dividend of 5.2 pence
per share, amounting to £20.1 million, was paid on 22 October 2004
and the Directors recommend a final dividend at the rate of 10.8 pence
per share amounting to £42.3 million.This, when added to the interim
dividend, will make a total of 16 pence per share or £62.4 million in
aggregate attributable to the year.This leaves a surplus of £248.6
million which has been transferred to reserves.
The Company introduced a scrip dividend scheme in 2002 and this will
continue to operate unless and until the Board determines otherwise.
Further information on the scheme is set out on page 73.
DIRECTORS
Biographical details of the Board of Directors are shown on page 35.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, one third of the
Directors who are subject to retirement by rotation are required to
retire at each Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, Peter Johnson,
Andrew Carr-Locke and Christine Cross, being three of the longest
serving members since their last appointment or re-appointment,
will retire and offer themselves for re-election.
Also in accordance with the Articles of Association, Directors who have
been appointed to the Board since the last Annual General Meeting
must be re-appointed at the subsequent Annual General Meeting.
Accordingly, Peter Redfern, who was appointed a Director on 12
October 2004, will retire at the Annual General Meeting and offer
himself for re-appointment.
The beneficial and non-beneficial interests of the Directors in shares 
of the Company, disclosed to the Company, are set out below:
Shares at Shares at 
01/01/2004 31/12/2004
J H Robinson 29,770 29,770
P M Johnson 229,886 296,684

C Cross 3,454 3,454
B Dean 0 1,000
Interests of the Directors in options over the shares of the Company
are shown on page 45. As beneficiaries under the Trust which holds
shares to satisfy awards under the George Wimpey Long Term
Incentive Plan, each of Peter Johnson, Andrew Carr-Locke, Stewart 
Cline and Peter Redfern had an interest as at 31 December 2004 in 
the 2,980,228 shares held by that Trust.
There has been no change in the interests of the Directors between 
31 December 2004 and the date of signing of the accounts, 22 February
2005, except that the interests of Messrs Johnson, Carr-Locke, Redfern 
and Cline in the shares held by the Trust reduced from 2,980,228 to 
zero.This reduction is as a result of the vesting of all of the shares 
held by the Trust to participants in the George Wimpey Long Term
Incentive Plan on 22 February 2005 which included Messrs Johnson,
Carr-Locke and Redfern – see page 46 of the Remuneration Report.
SHARE CAPITAL
At the 2004 Annual General Meeting authority was given to the
Company to purchase up to a maximum of 10% of its own shares.This
authority expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting, at which a special resolution will be proposed to renew the
authority for a further year.
The Board has no present intention of exercising this authority but will,
as is its practice, keep the matter under review. Purchases will only be
made if the Directors consider that they are in the best interests of
shareholders generally and if the purchase(s) could be expected to
result in an increase in earnings per share taking into account other
available investment opportunities. In exercising this authority, the
Board may cancel the shares that have been bought back or hold
them in treasury (or a combination of both). Holding bought back
shares in treasury provides the Company with the ability to sell or
transfer them quickly and cost effectively and also provides flexibility 
in using such shares for employee schemes. If any such shares are 
used, the Company will, so long as required under the guidelines of 
the Association of British Insurers Investment Committee, count them
towards the limits in the schemes as if they were newly issued shares.
Options were outstanding as at 1 February 2005 to subscribe for a 
total number of 8,798,764 ordinary shares, or 2.25% of the issued share
capital. If the authority to purchase shares is ever used in full (and the
purchased shares cancelled), the proportion of issued share capital
represented by this figure would be 2.5%.
An ordinary resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting
to authorise the Directors, in accordance with section 80 of the
Companies Act 1985, to allot shares in the Company up to an aggregate
nominal amount of £32,649,568 for a further period of five years.
A special resolution will be proposed at that Meeting to enable the
Directors to allot shares for cash (by way of rights or scrip dividend or
in an amount equal to but not more than £4,897,435 in aggregate of
the nominal value of the Company’s issued share capital) without
regard to the pre-emption rights of the Companies Act.
EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES
The Company operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme for its
UK employees and an Executive Share Option Scheme for all UK regional
board directors.The limit that may be issued under each Scheme is 
the lower of 20,000,000 and 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of
the Company.
Options were granted during the year to participating employees 
over 1,172,994 shares at 306.4 pence under the Savings Related Share
Option Scheme.
Options were granted during the year to selected executives over
690,561 shares at 407 pence and 685,481 shares at 420.08 pence under
the Executive Share Option Scheme.
The number of options outstanding at 31 December 2004 under the
Savings Related Share Option Scheme was 4,744,532, exercisable
between now and 2010 at between 96 pence and 306.4 pence per
share and, for the Executive Share Option Scheme, 4,321,304 shares
exercisable between now and 2014 at 98 pence to 420.08 pence per
share.The number of options outstanding under both schemes was
9,065,836 shares of which 2.77% are for the account of the Executive
Directors.
The George Wimpey Plc Executive Incentive Scheme up to 2000
required participants to invest part of their annual cash bonus in shares
of the Company to be held in trust for three years and then released to 
the executive with an additional 50% in matching shares. For bonus
payments after 1999 where the executive elected to keep the shares in
Trust for a further two years, the matching award is increased to 75%. It
is intended that the Scheme will now run its course, and close when all
current obligations have been fulfilled. No current Directors participate
in this Scheme.
As at 31 December 2004, the Trust held a total of 3,122,272 shares with
a market value of £12,629,590.24 of which 2,980,228 shares were for
the account of the Long Term Incentive Plan and 142,044 shares were 37

sub-contractors.The number of creditor days as at 31 December 2004
was 30 days (2003: 30 days).
The Company had no trade creditors at 31 December 2004.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
George Wimpey continues to employ a wide variety of traditional and
innovative approaches to construction where appropriate, taking into
account our needs for safe working practices, customer satisfaction,
good design and build efficiency. We have the scale and experience to
exploit modern methods of construction where they can suitably meet
the needs of our customers and employees to the highest standard.
During 2004 George Wimpey strengthened its commitment to
improving and advancing its construction methods through the
establishment of a partnership with the School of the Built Environment
at The University of Nottingham; the number one ranked University in
the UK in the study of Architecture and Building Technology.
The George Wimpey Lectureship in Construction Technology will
enable the School to increase its already formidable research resources
in the areas of sustainable design, renewable energy systems and
innovative building techniques.This will, in turn, give George Wimpey
access to this invaluable resource and enable the Company to take
further steps in advancing its contribution to sustainable communities
and energy-efficient housing.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT AND COMMUNICATION
The Company is committed to ensuring open and regular
communication throughout the Group on both business-related 
issues and issues of general interest.The intranet has once again been
upgraded and continues to be a valuable communications tool and 
an important facility for providing all employees with access to a wide
range of information. We continue to cascade information throughout
the business supported by management presentations.
During the year the Board visited local businesses in both the UK and
US, meeting staff on site and in regional offices.The Board spent time
with staff at all levels and discussed a range of topics related to their
businesses. In addition, Directors carry out regular visits to all parts of
the business and hold informal discussions with employees, helping
them to better understand the Company’s objectives, and listen to
feedback from employees on any issues they may have.
The Company produces an internal quarterly magazine for all employees
called ‘InHouse’ .The magazine, edited independently, receives
contributions from all businesses throughout the Group and aims 
to keep staff informed of new developments and initiatives, employee
and business issues as well as social events and employee achievements.
The Company’s Savings Related Share Option Scheme, open to all staff 
in the UK with over six months’ service, was again made available during
the year and taken up by 1,157 employees. It is intended to make a
further issue in 2005. Under this Scheme, employees may acquire shares,
at a 20% discount to the market price at the time of grant, in three or 
five years’ time.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES 
The Company is committed to equality of opportunity in all its
employment practices, policies and procedures.To this end, within 
the framework of the law, we are committed, wherever practicable, to
achieving and maintaining a workforce which broadly reflects the local
catchment area within which we operate. No employee or potential
employee will therefore receive less favourable treatment due to their
race, creed, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, political or other
opinion, affiliation, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, family
connections, membership or non membership of a trade union, or,
unless justifiable, disability.
EMPLOYMENT OF DISABLED PERSONS 
The Company is committed to ensuring that people with disabilities
are supported and encouraged to apply for employment with the
Company and to achieve progress through the Company.They will be
treated so that they have an equal opportunity, so far as it is justifiable,
to be selected, trained and promoted. Every reasonable effort will be
made to enable disabled persons to be retained in the employment 
of the Company by investigating the possibility of making reasonable
adjustments to the job, workplace or equipment.
CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
Contributions for charitable purposes were made during the year
amounting to £505,905 (2003: £484,591).The Charitable Contributions
Committee, an executive committee under the chairmanship of
Andrew Carr-Locke, considers charitable contributions made by the
Company and also monitors quarterly both UK and US charitable
contributions which have been made by the regional businesses.
Donations are made in accordance with the policy laid down by the
Board and the guidelines adopted by the Committee. Other members
of the Committee throughout the year included Peter Redfern, Anna
Edgeworth (Group HR Director), James Jordan and Terri Wright (Group
Communications Manager).The Secretary to this Committee is Karen
Atterbury, Assistant Company Secretary.

the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GEORGE WIMPEY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
INTRODUCTION
The Board is fully committed to high standards of corporate
governance throughout the Group.The Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority require the Company to include a statement so 
as to allow shareholders to evaluate how it has applied the principles
of good governance as set out in Section 1 of the 2003 Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (‘the Combined Code’).This report,
together with the information set out in the Remuneration Report on
pages 41 to 46, is published pursuant to the Combined Code which
deals with directors, directors’ remuneration, relations with and
accountability to shareholders and the audit of the Company.Together,
these sections explain how the Company has applied the principles 
in Section 1 of the Combined Code.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The Board considers that it has complied with Section 1 of the
Combined Code throughout the year.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
During 2004, the Board consisted of the Chairman (John Robinson), the
Group Chief Executive (Peter Johnson), three other Executive Directors
(including Peter Redfern who was appointed to the Board on 12 October
2004) and four Non Executive Directors.Throughout the year, in line
with the Combined Code, excluding the Chairman, at least half of 
the Board was comprised of independent Non Executive Directors.
A list of Directors with details of their biographies is set out on page 35.
The business and management of the Company is the collective
responsibility of the whole Board. At each meeting the Board reviews
the performance of each of its trading businesses in detail and during
each year it undertakes a strategic review.There is a formal written
schedule of matters reserved for consideration and approval by the
Board and these include the annual budget, major land purchases and
investment proposals, the approval of annual and interim results and 
a review of the overall system of internal control and risk management.
This list was revised and updated by the Board during 2004 as part 
of an overall review of the terms of reference applicable to the Board
and its Committees, which also took into account the requirements 
of the Combined Code.The terms of reference can be found on the
Company’s investor relations website (www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk).
There are four standing Board Committees: Audit, Remuneration,
Nomination and Corporate Social Responsibility. Each of these
Committees operates within clearly deﬁned terms of reference 
and reports back to the Board. Additional information on each 
of these Committees is set out later in this section and, also, in the
Remuneration Report in respect of the Remuneration Committee.
During 2004 the Board met formally, as a whole, 10 times.Twice yearly
the Board spends time with a business unit in the UK and the US
which includes site visits, presentations from local management and
the opportunity to meet employees.
During the year, there were no absences from any Board meetings
except that David Williams was unable to attend the February meeting.
During the year, each of the Non Executive Directors has at all times
acted independently of management and has had no relationships
which would materially interfere with the exercise of their
independent judgement and decision making.The Board is of the view
that the Non Executive Directors play an important role in upholding
corporate governance and in ensuring that no individual or group
dominates the Board’s decision making process.
The roles of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive are
separately held and there is a clear division of responsibilities between
each position which was documented during 2004.
Michael Blackburn is the Senior Independent Non Executive Director
and served throughout the year in this recognised position.
One third of the Directors must submit themselves for re-election each
year at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the Articles of
Association. In addition each Director seeks re-election every three
years in accordance with the Combined Code. Accordingly, Peter
Johnson, Andrew Carr-Locke and Christine Cross will retire and offer
themselves for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Any new Directors appointed during the year must seek re-appointment
at the next Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, Peter Redfern will
seek re-appointment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
An induction programme is provided for new Directors which includes
the provision of a comprehensive set of background information on
the Group and the corporate governance policies and procedures in
operation. New Non Executive Directors are also provided with the
opportunity of attending a training course on the role and
responsibilities of holding such a position.
Formal agendas and reports for Board and Committee meetings are
provided to Directors one week prior to the meeting, thus allowing
sufﬁcient time for detailed review and consideration of the documents
beforehand.The Chairman and Group Chief Executive maintain regular
contact with all Directors. James Jordan is the Group Company
Secretary and he attends all Board and Board Committee meetings.
All Directors have direct access to the Group Company Secretary for
advice and services.The Group Company Secretary is responsible for
ensuring that the correct procedures are followed at all Board and
Committee meetings. He reports directly to the Chairman and the
Group Chief Executive.
The Board has adopted a procedure whereby any Director may seek,
through the ofﬁce of the Group Company Secretary, independent
professional advice, at the Company’s expense, in furtherance of his 
or her duties.
During 2004 the Board carried out a self appraisal.The Chairman 
led the process which included meeting separately with each Director
and also with the Group Company Secretary to discuss and appraise
his or her performance, the performance of the Board and each of its
Committees.The Senior Non Executive Director carried out a formal
appraisal of the Chairman and, as part of this process, also liaised with
each Director and the Group Company Secretary .

Committee.The Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director and senior management attend Committee meetings for
speciﬁc items at the invitation of the Committee Chair.

major accounting issues.The Committee supports the Board in
reviewing information which is sent to shareholders to ensure that 
it presents a balanced assessment of the Company’s position. In

risks and opportunities for the attention of the Board.The 2004 CSR
report entitled ‘Securing our future’ has been sent to all shareholders
and many of our stakeholders, and can also be found on the
Company’s website www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk.The Company’s
approach to CSR is also summarised on pages 31 to 33 of this 
Annual Report.
During the year the Committee met on four occasions and there were
no absences.
Remuneration Committee
Current Members: Michael Blackburn (Committee Chair), David Williams
and Christine Cross who were members throughout the year.
The Committee consists of three independent Non Executive Directors.
Details of the Remuneration Committee and its policies are set out in
the Remuneration Report on pages 41 to 46.The Committee has
formal terms of reference.
During the year the Committee met on nine occasions and there 
were no absences.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND INVESTORS
During the year, the Company has continued to maintain an active
investor relations programme, encouraging constructive two-way
communication with investors, fund managers and analysts.
Presentations are given at the time of both preliminary and interim
results and at the Annual General Meeting when investors are invited
to attend. Webcasts of both results presentations, along with the
question and answer sessions, are made available on the Company’s
website. During 2004, Non Executive Directors attended both the
Company’s preliminary and interim results presentations where they
were available to meet with shareholders.
The Company makes full use of its website (www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk.)
to provide information for shareholders and others interested in
George Wimpey as an investment opportunity.
Peter Johnson, Andrew Carr-Locke and Terri Wright (Group
Communications Manager) carried out an extensive programme of
meetings with institutional shareholders and investors throughout 
the year within guidance issued by the Financial Services Authority.
Meetings were held in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, Paris,
Frankfurt, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco.The Company
will consider other visits as appropriate or required.
Andrew Carr-Locke and David Rallison (Group Treasurer) held meetings
across the US with investors in the Company’s US Private Placement
programme. Presentations are made twice a year to the Company’s UK
bankers following the announcement of the Company’s preliminary
and interim results.The Company also hosted a number of analyst
events in the UK and US.
The Company’s joint brokers, Cazenove & Co and ABN Amro Hoare
Govett, attend two Board meetings a year to provide feedback on 
the shareholder surveys that they each carry out following the
publication of the Company’s results and subsequent meetings 
with shareholders.
The Company is pleased to welcome private and institutional
shareholders to its Annual General Meeting.The Board will 
be present at the Meeting to answer questions and will be 
available both prior to and after the Meeting for discussions 
with shareholders.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
The Board believes that the ﬁnancial statements and reviews
contained within this document present a balanced and
understandable assessment of the Company’s performance 
and prospects.The sound system of internal control within the
Company enables the Board to make this statement.
The Audit Committee has a policy of not using the Company’s 
auditor for non-audit work if this could jeopardise the ability of 
the auditor to provide an independent and objective audit opinion.
Following a competitive tender process, PwC currently carries out
routine tax compliance work. PwC also assisted the Company in its
review of new International Accounting Standards.The Committee
takes the view that carrying out this non-audit work does not affect
PwC’s objectivity or independence due to its routine nature.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal
control and for reviewing its effectiveness.The implementation and
maintenance of the risk management and internal control systems are
the responsibility of the Executive Directors and senior management.
It is recognised that the system is designed to manage, rather than
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
Consequently, it can only provide reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance against material mis-statement or loss.The system has 
been in place throughout the period and is regularly reviewed within
the Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control.
The Board has reviewed in detail the areas of major risk that the 
Group faces in its operations as documented in the Group Risk
Schedule.This Schedule comprises the key risks and is regularly
monitored for ongoing relevance. Speciﬁc key operational risks include
land purchase, health and safety, the environment and product quality.
The Board, following its review, is satisﬁed with the process in place for
risk identiﬁcation and management. It is satisﬁed with current control
mechanisms and reporting lines that have been in place throughout
the year and the programme of continuous improvement initiatives
that has been implemented.
The Group seeks to maintain high standards of business conduct and
operates under an established internal control framework which can
be described as follows:
Organisational Structure
The Group operates through a number of operating businesses, each
with its own management board. Clear reporting lines and delegated
authorities are in place.The management and monitoring of risk and
performance occurs at multiple levels throughout the Group and the
use of interactive review processes provides successive assurance
through the levels of management up to the Board.
Land Purchase and Investment Appraisal 
There are clearly deﬁned policies and procedures for the purchase of
land and for capital expenditure.These include detailed appraisal and
review requirements and due diligence procedures which incorporate
a detailed environmental appraisal of land prior to acquisition. These
procedures are subject to rigorous review and authorisation. 40
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GEORGE WIMPEY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2005
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
Development Activity 
There is an established framework for managing and controlling all site
related activity.This includes extensive health and safety procedures,
regular performance monitoring and clear accountability on 
customer satisfaction.
Financial and Operating Reporting 
There is a developed budgeting system with an annual budget
approved by the Board. Proﬁt and cash forecasts are prepared and
reviewed on a monthly basis.The performance of each business is
reviewed monthly by Divisional and Group management and
subsequently reported to the Board against both budget and forecast.
Particular emphasis is placed on cash ﬂow, as well as proﬁt and loss
and balance sheet reporting, and on key operating issues including
health and safety and environmental matters.
Control Self Assessment
During 2004, improved procedures were put in place which required
each business to report on a regular basis, through a formal Control
Self Assessment process, its compliance with the core policies and key
controls governing the Group.This process has also been extended 
to key non-operational areas.
Treasury
The principal treasury related risks, decisions and control processes 
are documented.The Treasury Committee, consisting of Andrew 
Carr-Locke (Chair), Peter Johnson, Michael Blackburn, David Rallison
(Group Treasurer) and Rod Ashford (Group Tax and Insurance Manager),
meets quarterly to consider treasury related issues, decisions and
control processes.
All of the above internal controls are subject to ongoing Internal 
Audit review.The Internal Audit Department supports the Audit
Committee and senior management by independently and objectively
reviewing the effectiveness of risk management and the control
environment.The Internal Audit methodology is aligned to the 
key elements of the Group’s internal control framework. All reviews 
are formally followed-up to ensure agreed actions have been
implemented.The results of all Internal Audit reviews are presented
and discussed in detail at the Audit Committee. In addition to Audit
Committee reporting, Internal Audit ﬁndings and conclusions are
discussed at both the Group Executive Committee (which meets at
least monthly) and consisted during the year of Peter Johnson (Chair),
Andrew Carr-Locke, Stewart Cline, Peter Redfern (who joined the
Committee with effect from 1 January 2004), Steve Parker (Executive
Vice President, Morrison Homes and President from 1 January 2005,
who joined the Committee with effect from 1 November 2004) and
James Jordan (Group Company Secretary) and at Divisional executive
meetings of George Wimpey UK and Morrison Homes.
Going Concern
The Directors are required under the Combined Code to have satisﬁed
themselves as to the Group’s ability to continue in existence for the
foreseeable future. A review has been carried out and the Directors
have concluded that the Group has adequate resources and is justiﬁed
in using the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements. 41
REMUNERATION REPORT www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk
REMUNERATION REPORT
INTRODUCTION AND COMPLIANCE
In preparing this Remuneration Report to shareholders, the Board has
followed the requirements of Section 1 of the 2003 Combined Code
on Corporate Governance (the ‘Combined Code’) and the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’) contained 
in schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985. Pursuant to the Regulations,
this Report is being put to shareholders for approval at the Annual General
Meeting to be held on 14 April 2005.The vote will have advisory status
in respect of the remuneration policy and overall remuneration packages
and will not, therefore, be speciﬁc to individual levels of remuneration.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Current members: Michael Blackburn (Committee Chair), David Williams
and Christine Cross.The Committee, consisting of three independent
Non Executive Directors, met on nine occasions during the year and
there were no absences.
CONSULTANTS
External advice is sought where appropriate and the Remuneration
Committee has appointed the consulting ﬁrm Towers Perrin as its
advisor and to provide it with market data and assistance on executive
compensation, including the Company’s share schemes.Towers Perrin
do not provide any other services to the Company outside
remuneration matters. External legal advice is also sought, where
appropriate, from Slaughter and May.
The following people provided material advice, services or assistance to
the Committee, except in relation to their own speciﬁc remuneration:
John Robinson – Chairman
Peter Johnson – Group Chief Executive
Anna Edgeworth – Group HR Director
James Jordan – Group Company Secretary
POLICY
The Company is committed to fostering a performance culture to
increase shareholder value and to establish George Wimpey as a
leading housebuilder in its competitive markets. In line with these
aims, the Remuneration Committee sets the remuneration packages 
of the Executive Directors at a level designed to attract, motivate and
retain high calibre executives, and to deliver high rewards only on
attainment of demonstrably sustained superior corporate
performance.This is achieved through a combination of salary, an
annual performance bonus, share-based long term incentives and
pension provision.The Committee also sets the remuneration for the
Group Company Secretary. In addition, and in compliance with the
Combined Code, the Committee monitors and makes recommendations
on remuneration matters in relation to designated senior management
in the UK and US at the tier below Board level.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that a signiﬁcant
proportion of each Executive Director’s total compensation is delivered
through performance related pay. In ﬁxing base salary it is also the
policy of the Remuneration Committee to reward its Executive
Directors at a level set around the median, having regard to levels of
remuneration within other housebuilders and for other FTSE 100/FTSE
250 companies with a similar turnover and/or market capitalisation.
The chart above shows the proportion of ﬁxed to performance based
remuneration. Fixed remuneration comprises annual salary.
Performance based remuneration comprises an annual cash bonus
and a long term incentive plan.The chart illustrates the mix of
remuneration assuming target levels of annual performance and the
annualised expected value of long term incentive provision.
The Company encourages and facilitates its Executive Directors to take
on Non Executive positions with other listed public limited companies,
provided that such positions are held within the requirements of the
Combined Code. Executive Directors are permitted by the Company 
to retain their earnings from such positions. Peter Johnson is an
independent Non Executive Director of DS Smith Plc where he also
chaired the Audit Committee until December 2004; he received fees
amounting to £43,359 during 2004. Andrew Carr-Locke is an
independent Non Executive Director of AWG Plc and received fees
amounting to £32,083 during 2004.
BASE SALARY
The salaries of Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the
Remuneration Committee which takes into account the
responsibilities, experience, market competitiveness and performance
in each position.To ascertain market competitive levels, Towers Perrin
carried out a comprehensive benchmarking exercise which included
other housebuilders (in the UK and US as appropriate) and other 
FTSE 100/FTSE 250 companies with a similar turnover and/or market
capitalisation, and advised the Committee on market salary levels in
respect of each position. Peter Johnson and Andrew Carr-Locke were
awarded pay increases of 5% and 3.5% respectively with effect from 
1 January 2005. Having regard to uncertainties in the housing market
at the time of the award and those anticipated going into 2005, Messrs
Johnson and Carr-Locke each formally elected to waive their salary
increases for the time being. Should market conditions or performance
make it appropriate during 2005, then following liaison with the
Chairman of the Board and the Chair of the Remuneration Committee,
each may elect to accept the increase and this will be reported on in
next year’s Remuneration Report. All other aspects of their remuneration,
including pension, have continued as though the pay increases were
implemented with effect from 1 January 2005.
BONUS SCHEMES
UK
The UK based Executive Directors participate in an annual cash based
short term incentive scheme.This rewards current performance on the
achievement of stretching ﬁnancial performance targets which are set
annually by the Remuneration Committee, having regard to prior year
performance and the annual budget approved by the Board.The bonus
scheme for Peter Johnson and Andrew Carr-Locke is based on achieving
Group proﬁt before tax targets. Peter Redfern participates in a similar
scheme except that it is based on the achievement by George Wimpey
UK of targets relating to proﬁt before interest and tax (90%) and customer
satisfaction (10%). Following the review of peer group practices carried
out by the Committee in conjunction with Towers Perrin in 2002, each
Director’s target annual bonus for 2005 will remain, as it was for 2004,
at 40% of salary, with a maximum bonus payable of 100%.
US
Stewart Cline is a member of an annual cash bonus scheme which 
is speciﬁcally tailored and linked to the performance and growth of
Morrison Homes. In line with the outcome of the independent review
conducted by the Remuneration Committee in 2002 on the structure
and levels of bonus to be applied in the US, the maximum bonus that
can be paid under the scheme to Stewart Cline for 2005, is the same as
it was for 2004, namely, 200% of his base salary.The scheme is based on 
a number of targets which are set by the Remuneration Committee on
an annual basis relating to return on capital (47.5%), operating margin
(47.5%), customer satisfaction (5%) and growth in operating proﬁt.
2004 bonuses were calculated on a percentage of full year's base salary
as at 1 January 2004. For Peter Redfern this percentage was 64% and
for Peter Johnson and Andrew Carr-Locke it was 90.7%. Stewart Cline's
bonus was based on a calculation of 200% of his US dollar base salary.
Bonus payments are not pensionable for any of the Executive Directors.

LONG TERM INCENTIVES 
The George Wimpey Long Term Incentive Plan
The Company believes that the George Wimpey Long Term Incentive
Plan (George Wimpey LTIP), approved by shareholders at the 2002
Annual General Meeting, effectively aligns both the Company’s
business strategy and the long term interest of management with
those of shareholders.The George Wimpey LTIP is designed to lock-in
key executives and motivate them through the opportunity to earn
signiﬁcant ﬁnancial rewards, on the achievement of demanding and
stretching performance targets, compared to its comparator group (set
out below). Awards under the George Wimpey LTIP are made by the
Remuneration Committee to a limited number of key executives in the
UK and the US, including Executive Directors. Neither the Chairman nor
any Non Executive Director participates in the George Wimpey LTIP .
The maximum value of any award under the George Wimpey LTIP is
two times basic salary, except that for 2002 when conditional awards
equivalent to three times basic salary were made.These were set
against more stretching and demanding performance targets as
described below.The Committee will review the size of awards to be
made on an annual basis to ensure that they are appropriate. Awards
will not vest unless the pre-determined performance conditions are
satisﬁed over a three year period (the performance period).
The performance condition measures the Company’s total shareholder
return (‘TSR’) over the three year performance period against a speciﬁc
comparator group of public limited companies made up of 23
housebuilding and building materials related companies.The
Remuneration Committee believes that TSR is the most appropriate
performance measure because it ensures that executives do not receive
rewards under the George Wimpey LTIP unless the Company has
outperformed relative to the designated comparator group companies.
The comparator group for the George Wimpey LTIP is as set out 
below (and will be reviewed by the Committee from time to time):
Baggeridge Brick Gleeson (MJ) Redrow
Barratt Heywood WilliamsSIG
Bellway John Laing Taylor Woodrow
Berkeley Kier Travis Perkins
Bovis Marshalls Westbury
BPB McCarthy & Stone Wilson Bowden
Crest Nicholson Persimmon Wolseley
Galliford Try Pilkington
For awards to vest in full, the Company’s TSR performance over the
relevant performance period must equal or exceed the 75th percentile
performance as against the comparator group except that, for awards
made in 2002, the TSR performance had to be equal to or exceed the
85th percentile so as to reﬂect the higher awards made in that year 
(three times base salary as opposed to two times). No portion of the
award will vest if the Company’s TSR performance is less than the 50th
percentile, but there will be partial vesting if the Company’s TSR
performance is at least equal to the 50th percentile. At that level of
performance, awards made in 2002 would have vested at a 20% level
and awards made subsequently based on two times salary will vest at 
a 25% level.There is straight line vesting for levels of performance
between the 50th and 75th percentiles (85th percentile in the case 
of awards made in 2002). In addition to this performance condition,
there is a requirement that the Company’s underlying performance,
as determined by the Remuneration Committee, should be satisfactory.
Awards under the George Wimpey LTIP are not pensionable. Details 
of awards to Executive Directors are set out in the table on page 46.
The performance period in respect of the 2002 George Wimpey LTIP
expired on 31 December 2004. Against the comparator group, the
Company ﬁnished in second place as veriﬁed by an independent third
party – see page 46. As a result of this performance, maximum awards of
shares vested in participants in the 2002 George Wimpey LTIP – see the
notes to the table on page 46 for details of the amount of shares that
vested. Due to the requirements of the Model Code, shares were not
received by participating Executive Directors and senior employees until
after the Company came out of its close period on 22 February 2005.
Following the introduction of the George Wimpey LTIP in 2002, it 
is Company policy that Executive Directors are no longer granted
options under the Executive Share Option Scheme. Details of past
awards to Executive Directors under this Scheme are disclosed in the
table on page 45.
Morrison Homes Long Term Incentive Plan
The Morrison Homes Long Term Incentive Plan (Morrison Homes LTIP)
was approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
Key executives in Morrison Homes, including Stewart Cline, participate
in the Morrison Homes LTIP which is a cash based scheme pursuant 
to which ‘units’ are awarded to each participant following the end of a
ﬁnancial year.The value of each unit, and therefore the amount of cash
that an individual receives, will depend on growth in proﬁt before
interest and tax (‘PBIT’) of Morrison Homes over that ﬁnancial year. The
maximum value is achieved if PBIT grows by more than 30%.The
amount payable is, however, reduced progressively if Morrison Homes’
Return on Assets (‘RoA’) is less than 20%, so that no amount is payable
if RoA is less than 15%.The size of awards is determined by the
Remuneration Committee which recognises the need to link awards
and the rewarding of ongoing performance with the creation of
additional shareholder value.
The value of the cash award is paid out over a four year period
commencing one year after the end of the relevant ﬁnancial year, with
20% of the cash award being paid in each of the ﬁrst three years of that
period and the remaining 40% in the ﬁnal year of that period, thus
making each award back-end loaded. Interest is accrued on the unpaid
part of the award at a current rate of 6%. Certain executives of Morrison
Homes, including Stewart Cline, also participate in the George Wimpey
LTIP and have received conditional awards of shares under that scheme.
Ongoing participation in the George Wimpey LTIP by Morrison Homes
executives will be reviewed during 2005 as part of an overall review of
the Morrison Homes Bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan arrangements.
The review will be designed to ensure that appropriate incentives are in
place to attract, motivate and retain senior executives in the US coupled
with the need to link any awards with performance that ultimately
creates additional shareholder value.
Awards under the Morrison Homes LTIP are usually scaled back 
for those executives also participating in the George Wimpey LTIP .
However, for 2005, in recognition of the need to retain and motivate
key Morrison Homes senior management during a year of anticipated
growth in the US, the Committee felt that it was entirely appropriate to
award Stewart Cline and designated senior management an additional
award under the Morrison Homes LTIP equivalent to the size of the
scale back made in 2003 and 2004 under the George Wimpey LTIP to
reﬂect membership of both LTIPs. Accordingly, for 2005, Stewart Cline’s
award under the Morrison LTIP for 2005 was increased by 1.5x to 3.5x
his base salary as at 1 January 2005.
SHARESAVE SCHEME
The Company operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
which all UK staff (including UK based Executive Directors) with over 
six months’ service are eligible to join. Under this scheme, employees
may acquire shares at a 20% discount to the market price at the time
of grant, in three or ﬁve years’ time.
NEW POLICIES – SHARE RETENTION AND TARGET DIRECTOR SHAREHOLDINGS
During 2004, the Remuneration Committee implemented a share
retention policy with regard to shares awarded under the George
Wimpey LTIP , which took into account the requirements of the
Association of British Insurers – Principles and Guidelines on
Remuneration.The policy requires Executive Directors to retain,
for at least 12 months from the date of receipt of shares under the 
George Wimpey LTIP , not less than 50% of the after tax/NI amount 
of shares received in any year. Senior employee participants in the
George Wimpey LTIP are expected to retain at least 25% of the shares
received on the same basis. With regard to the 2002 George Wimpey
LTIP , the 25% retention expectation will also apply to Peter Redfern,
who was appointed to the Board on 12 October 2004 but, in future
years, the 50% retention requirement will apply in respect of any 
shares received by him under the George Wimpey LTIP .
The Committee also introduced, during the year, a policy which
requires Executive Directors to accumulate, within a ﬁve year period 43
REMUNERATION REPORT www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk
from the date that each joined the Board, a shareholding in the
Company broadly equal to their base salary. For Peter Johnson, the
Committee set a personal target shareholding broadly equal to 
three times his base salary.
The above policies are intended to promote as close an alignment as
possible of Executive Directors and senior management with the risks
and rewards faced by shareholders. Having clear policies in place
provides a framework within which Executive Directors may sell shares
received under the George Wimpey LTIP and also in the achieving of
target shareholdings and futher sales of shares once such targets have
been met.
A policy was also introduced in 2004 pursuant to which the Chairman
and the Non Executive Directors are required to accumulate within 
a ﬁve year period from the date that each joined the Board, a
shareholding in the Company broadly equal to 50% of each Director’s
annual fees.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH
Set out below is a graph which shows the total shareholder return 
of the Company during the period December 1999 to December 2004
as against the FTSE 250 (excluding investment companies), based on 
30 trading day average values.The Group believes that the FTSE 250 
is the appropriate comparator index against which to plot its total
shareholder return performance as the Company is a member of 
the index together with its key competitors and a broad cross section 
of leading companies.The graph also shows the performance of the
Company as against the George Wimpey LTIP comparator group 
(see opposite).The graph shows the theoretical growth in the value of
a £100 shareholding over the speciﬁed period, assuming that dividends 
are re-invested to purchase additional units of equity.
PENSIONS 
Some UK based Executive Directors and other designated managers 
are members of the Executive section of the George Wimpey Staff
Pension Scheme (‘the Scheme’).The Scheme is a funded, Inland
Revenue approved, ﬁnal salary occupational pension scheme and all
members contribute 5% or 8% of salary. Executive members cease 
to contribute once they have achieved 30 years’ pensionable service.
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase in line with the Retail
Price Index to a maximum of 5% per annum.
The Scheme provides Executive members with a pension of up to 
two-thirds of pensionable salary on retirement at age 62, subject 
to the member having completed 30 years’ pensionable service.
The Company provides Peter Johnson with a pension allowance by
additional payments to him, amounting to 40% (£214,200) of his basic
salary. Andrew Carr-Locke similarly receives a pension allowance
amounting to 35% (£105,000) of his basic salary. A payment of £22,320
was paid into a US cash plan for Stewart Cline.
In addition, life assurance of four times basic salary and a pension 
of two-thirds of the member’s entitlement for spouses on their 
death in service, or in retirement, are provided, together with a 
children’s allowance of up to 100% of the dependant’s pension 
for three or more children.
Pensionable salary excludes all bonuses, beneﬁts in kind and incentive
related remuneration. For early retirement, after age 50 but prior to age
62, pensions will be reduced by an appropriate actuarial factor.
The Directors’ accrued pensions in 2004 are shown on page 44.
SERVICE CONTRACTS – EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
It is the Company’s policy that all Executive Directors should have rolling
service contracts which can be terminated by either party by giving not
less than 12 months’ notice.The UK based Directors, like all employees, are
employed by George Wimpey UK Limited. Stewart Cline is employed by
Morrison Homes Inc.The Company’s normal retirement age for Executive
Directors is 60 and the service contracts terminate automatically when
this age is attained, unless extended by mutual consent.
The dates of each service contract are as follows:
Peter Johnson – 26 March 2002
Andrew Carr-Locke – 27 March 2002
Stewart Cline – 10 April 2003
Peter Redfern – 12 October 2004
For each Director, the Company may, at its discretion, make a payment 
in lieu of notice equal to basic salary and the cost of providing other
beneﬁts under the contract for the period for which the contract 
would have continued. In the event of a change of control of the
Company, the Director may, within six months of such change, elect 
to terminate the service contract on three months’ notice and be 
paid a termination payment of the value of his annual remuneration 
and beneﬁts package.The purpose of this change of control provision 
is to ensure that the Director is not disincentivised should such 
a situation so arise.
THE CHAIRMAN/NON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Remuneration Committee has the responsibility of setting 
the remuneration of the Chairman, any alteration to which is then
submitted to the Board for approval in the absence of the Chairman.
Towers Perrin provide independent advice on appropriate levels of
remuneration for the Chairman and provide data on remuneration
paid to Chairmen of FTSE 100 and 250 companies with similar 
turnover and/or market capitalisation.
The Remuneration of the Non Executive Directors is determined by 
the Board.Towers Perrin provide independent advice on appropriate
levels of remuneration which includes data on the same basis as for
the Chairman. Remuneration is paid in the form of ﬁxed fees, which 
are reviewed annually. Non Executive Directors are invited, but not
obliged, to use any increase in their remuneration to purchase shares
in the Company.
Neither the Chairman nor the Non Executive Directors participate 
in any incentive or share schemes.
Neither the Chairman nor the Non Executive Directors have service
contracts.The services of John Robinson, Michael Blackburn and
Christine Cross are contracted to the Company under consultancy
agreements dated 5 April 2001, 1 April 2000 and 11 January 2004
respectively.The agreements provide that each Director will continue
to serve the Company unless terminated by not less than six months’
notice given by either party. However, in the event that a Director is 
not re-elected as a Director by the Company’s shareholders, or is
removed from ofﬁce by them in accordance with the Company’s
Articles of Association, then the relevant agreement will terminate 
with no provision for compensation.
David Williams and Brenda Dean have letters of appointment dated 
1 May 2001 and 7 October 2003 respectively.These engagements 
also continue until terminated by not less than six months’ notice
given by either party or otherwise in accordance with the Company’s
Articles of Association.

1 Other beneﬁts include the provision of a Company car (or car allowance in lieu of a car), private health insurance and in the case of Peter Johnson and Andrew Carr-Locke 
an annual pension allowance of £214,200 and £105,000 respectively based on 40% and 35% of their base salaries. A payment of £22,320 was paid into a US Cash Plan 
in respect of Stewart Cline.
2 The deferred bonus was paid under the Morrison Homes Long Term Compensation Plan, which was replaced during 2003 by the Morrison Homes Long Term Incentive Plan
which was approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting and also through the participation by Stewart Cline in the George Wimpey LTIP (subject to the
scaling back of awards as explained on page 42). Under the Morrison Homes Long Term Compensation Plan, units were granted annually at the beginning of the year and then
valued at the end of that ﬁrst year. Payments to participants commence one year after the valuation of the units and conclude four years after the ﬁrst year payment. Stewart
Cline’s current interest in the scheme amounts to $2,561,572. No equity is involved in the Plan. As reported in the 2003 Report, upon winding up of this plan, units previously
awarded under the Plan have vested but will not become payable any earlier as a result of such vesting except in accordance with the rules of the Plan. Details of awards made
under the Morrison Homes Long Term Incentive Plan are set out on page 46.
3 The bonus ﬁgure of £169,600 is calculated by reference to Peter Redfern’s salary as at 1 January 2004 and has not been pro-rated to take into account his date of appointment
to the Board. Further details of the bonus scheme are set out on page 41.

NOTES:
Awards made pursuant to the George Wimpey LTIP do not vest in whole or in part unless pre-determined performance conditions are satisﬁed over a three year period.The
awards are therefore conditional awards and the table above sets out the maximum number of shares that can be awarded.The performance conditions are explained in detail
on page 42.The 2003 conditional awards were made on 1 May 2003 with a performance period of 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2005 and during the year, conditional awards
were made on 26 May 2004 with a performance period of 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006.The number of awards made to each participant was calculated by reference to
a formula based on two times salary as at 1 January 2004 using a price of 403.91p, being the value calculated in accordance with the scheme rules. For the 2002 award, for Peter
Johnson, Andrew Carr-Locke and Peter Redfern, the formula was based on three times salary as at 1 January 2002 using a share price of 220p, being the value calculated in
accordance with the scheme rules. For Stewart Cline, the awards were calculated by reference to a formula based on one and half times his salary as at 1 January 2003 and 
1 January 2004.The 2003 George Wimpey LTIP awarded to Stewart Cline was made on 9 May when the market value on award was 250.5p.
As reported on page 42, shares conditionally awarded under the 2002 George Wimpey LTIP vested on 22 February 2005. Based on veriﬁcation from MM& K (an independent
consultancy), the Company’s TSR performance during the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004 placed the Company second as against its comparator group, therefore
triggering maximum vesting of the shares conditionally awarded.These shares were distributed by the employee trust after the Company’s close period ended on 22 February
2005. Peter Johnson, Andrew Carr-Locke and Peter Redfern received 616,636 shares, 361,364 shares and 156,818 shares respectively and the price on vesting was 449.0p per share.
In last year’s Report it was conﬁrmed that Keith Cushen, who retired as a Director on 31 December 2003, would receive a further distribution of shares under the George Wimpey
LTIP up to a maximum of 136,364 shares, representing one third of his 2002 conditional allocation of shares subject to the the Company’s TSR performance for the period 
1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004. As mentioned above, the TSR performance during this period placed the Company in second place which therefore resulted in maximum
vesting of all of the shares conditionally awarded to Keith Cushen.The shares vested on 25 January 2005 and the price on vesting was 403.5p per share.
DIRECTORS’ INTEREST IN THE MORRISON HOMES LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (MORRISON HOMES LTIP) AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2004
Stewart Cline is the only Director participating in the Morrison Homes LTIP . More detailed information on the Morrison Homes LTIP is set out on
page 42.The Morrison Homes LTIP is a cash based scheme introduced in 2003, pursuant to which units are awarded to each participant.The value
of each unit, and therefore the amount of cash received, will depend upon the growth in the proﬁt before interest and tax of Morrison Homes
during the year of the award.The value of the cash award is then paid out over a four year period commencing one year after the end of the
relevant ﬁnancial year, with 20% being paid out over the ﬁrst three years and 40% in the ﬁnal year. No equity is involved in the Morrison Homes
LTIP . Stewart Cline’s current interest in the Morrison Homes LTIP amounts to $2,021,000 which includes the 2004 award of $1,054,935.

AUDITORS’ REPORT www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk
AUDITORS’ REPORT
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GEORGE WIMPEY PLC
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements which comprise the Group
proﬁt and loss account, the balance sheets, the Group cash ﬂow
statement, the statement of Group total recognised gains and losses,
the reconciliation of movement in Group shareholders’ funds, accounting
policies and the related notes.We have also audited the disclosures
required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained
in the Remuneration Report (‘the auditable part’).
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of Directors’
responsibilities on page 37.The Directors are also responsible for
preparing the Remuneration Report.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable
part of the Remuneration Report in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board.This report, including the
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members
as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985
and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the
auditable part of the Remuneration Report have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.We also report 
to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the
ﬁnancial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding
Directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial
statements.The other information comprises only the Chairman’s
Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, the Operating and Financial
Review, Board of Directors, Corporate Social Responsibility, Directors’
Report, Corporate Governance and the Remuneration Report.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board’s statements on control cover
all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s or Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on 
a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in 
the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration
Report. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates 
and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the
ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the ﬁnancial statements and the auditable part of the
Remuneration Report are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion 
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the ﬁnancial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion:
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group at 31 December 2004 and 
of the proﬁt and cash ﬂows of the Group for the year then ended;
• the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
• those parts of the Remuneration Report required by Part 3 of
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES www.georgewimpeyplc.co.uk
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Group Accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis 
of accounting.They have been drawn up in accordance with applicable
accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
The Group has adopted UITF 38 (‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’) during the
year. Details of the impact on reserves brought forward are set out in note
27.The Balance Sheet at 31 December 2003 has been restated to comply
with the requirements of UITF 38.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Group Accounts consolidate the accounts of George Wimpey Plc 
and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
JOINT VENTURES
The results of undertakings in which the Group holds an interest and 
jointly controls with other parties are accounted for using the gross 
equity method of accounting.
TURNOVER
Housing turnover comprises the value of new houses and land sales legally
completed during the year. Other turnover is based on the invoiced value
of goods and services supplied during the year.Turnover excludes value
added tax and intra-group turnover.
PROFIT
Operating profit comprises new houses and land sales. Housing profit is
taken only when legal completion has taken place.
DEPRECIATION
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated 
to write off the cost or valuation of each asset to its residual value evenly
over its expected useful life as follows:
Offices occupied by the Group:
• Freehold buildings and long leaseholds in excess of 50 years
– over 50 years
• Short leaseholds
– over the period of the lease.
Plant and equipment:
• – over the expected useful life of the assets ranging mainly 
from 3 to 5 years.
GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair 
value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable 
net assets acquired. Historical goodwill has been written off to reserves 
in the year in which it arose. Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1998 
is capitalised, and amortised through the profit and loss account over 
its useful economic life.
DEFERRED TAXATION 
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that 
have originated but not been reversed by the balance sheet date, where
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the
future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance
sheet date. Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that they
are regarded as recoverable and have not been discounted. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet dates.
STOCK
Land held for development and construction work in progress are valued 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Other stock comprises
materials, equipment and goods for resale valued at the lower of cost and
net realisable value. Cost includes appropriate overheads.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the
cost of pensions at a substantially level percentage of payroll costs over the
expected lives of members.
OPERATING LEASES
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account in equal
amounts over the lease term.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at closing rates of exchange or the relevant
forward rate where applicable. All differences are taken to the profit and
loss account. On consolidation, the trading results of overseas subsidiary
undertakings are translated at the average rate for the year and the balance
sheets at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation
of opening balance sheets, together with the difference between profit and
loss accounts translated at average rates and closing rates, are dealt with
through reserves.
Translation differences on intra-group currency loans and foreign currency
borrowings, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge
against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, are taken directly
to reserves together with the exchange difference on the carrying amount
of the related investments. All other translation differences are taken to the
profit and loss account.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative foreign exchange instruments that are deemed hedges 
of specific foreign currency assets/liabilities are matched against the
underlying asset or liability. Derivative interest rate instruments are matched
within interest payable or receivable over the life of the instrument or
relevant interest period. Interest rate instruments are not recognised in the
balance sheet. Changes in fair value of financial instruments are not
recognised in the profit and loss account or balance sheet. 52

6 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE
Basic earnings per ordinary share is 80.8 pence (2003: 68.5 pence).The calculation of the basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the proﬁt
attributable to ordinary shareholders of £311.0 million (2003: £260.9 million) divided by the average number of shares in issue during the year of 384.8
million (2003: 380.6 million).
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is 79.7 pence (2003: 67.1 pence).The calculation is based on the proﬁt attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by
the average number of shares in issue plus the dilutive potential ordinary shares amounting to 5.6 million (2003: 8.4 million) shares.The dilutive potential
ordinary shares relate to shares allotted under employee share schemes where the fair value price exceeds the option price.
The calculation of shareholders’ funds per ordinary share is based on shareholders’ funds for the Group at the end of the year divided by the number 
of shares in issue at the end of the year of 391.5 million (2003: 384.1 million). 54

8 PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
The Group operates one deﬁned beneﬁt UK pension scheme and two overseas schemes.The assets of the schemes are held in separate Trustee
administered funds.The largest, which is in the UK, is the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme (the Scheme), and is of the funded, deﬁned beneﬁt type
and is closed to new entrants (for new employees in the UK, George Wimpey pays contributions into stakeholder pension arrangements). The Trustees 
are George Wimpey Pension Trustees Limited and the Law Debenture Trust Corporation Plc.The Scheme is subject to triennial valuation by independent
actuaries, the last such valuation being carried out as at 5 April 2002, using the projected unit method. Details of this valuation are described below.
The actuarial assumptions which have the most signiﬁcant effect are those relating to return on investment, the rate of increase in salaries and the assumed
rate of pension increases. In the 5 April 2002 valuation it was assumed that the investment return prior to retirement would exceed price inﬂation by 4.5%
per annum, and post retirement by 3.5% per annum. Salary increases were assumed to exceed price inﬂation by 2.0% per annum. Pension increases were
assumed to be in line with price inﬂation.The market value of assets was £523 million, and this ﬁgure was 8% below the amount required to cover the
beneﬁts that had accrued to the members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.The shortfall under the SSAP 24 assumption is allocated 
to operating proﬁt over the average remaining service life of current employees.
The Group has paid contributions of £22.5 million to the Scheme in 2004. Employee contributions for Laing Homes Scheme members are being phased 
in up to 1 January 2006. As part of the terms of their transfer these members paid reduced employee contributions equal to 2% in 2004.
No signiﬁcant improvements in beneﬁts were made in 2004. Contributions in respect of non-Laing Homes employees were paid at a rate of 31.8% of
scheme salary during 2003 (21.2% of scheme salary from 1 November 2003 for former Laing Homes employees). Contributions to the Scheme in respect 
of non-Laing Homes employees have been made equivalent to 13.2% of scheme salary plus £15 million in 2004. In respect of former Laing Homes
employees, contributions were paid at a rate of 20.2% of scheme salary throughout 2004:
The total pension costs for the Group were £13.8 million (2003: £13.5 million) of which £0.6 million (2003: £0.8 million) related to overseas schemes.
The prepayment in the balance sheet resulting from the difference in the amounts charged to the proﬁt and loss account and the amounts paid to 
the Scheme was £26.9 million (2003: £15.4 million) and the deferred tax liability in respect of the prepayment was £8.1 million (2003: £4.6 million).
On a Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17 basis, the valuation position of the Scheme was updated from the most recent actuarial valuation to 
31 December 2004 by a qualiﬁed independent actuary.The valuation at 31 December 2004 showed no overall change in the deﬁcit from £130 million 
at 31 December 2003 after the related deferred tax asset. FRS 17 on Retirement Beneﬁts requires the following disclosures in 2004:

21 INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY HEDGES
As explained in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 28, the Group’s policy is to hedge part of the interest rate risk and transactional currency exposure.
Gains and losses on interest rate and currency hedges are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recorded. Unrecognised and
deferred gains and losses on interest and currency instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows:
Unrecognised Deferred
Gains Losses Net Gains Losses Net

22 CURRENCY EXPOSURE AND ANALYSIS OF NET ASSETS
The Group’s principal subsidiaries have little transactional currency exposure as they neither export goods nor import any material amount of products 
nor have any signiﬁcant level of intra-group trading or provision of services. Consequently, none of the principal subsidiaries has any material net foreign
currency monetary assets/liabilities by reference to their local currencies and hence the amount of foreign exchange differences included in the Group
proﬁt and loss account for 2003 and 2004 was not material.
The table below provides a currency analysis of the net assets of the Group:

23 FAIR VALUES
The fair value is deﬁned as the amount at which a ﬁnancial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing
parties, excluding accrued interest, and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value. Where market values are not available, fair
values have been calculated by discounting cash ﬂows at prevailing interest and exchange rates. All debt and ﬁnancial instruments used to manage the
interest rate and currency of borrowings with a maturity of less than three months after the balance sheet date are assumed to have a fair value equal 
to the book value.The book values are the amounts recorded in the balance sheet. Financial liability provisions relate to rental guarantees as set out in 
note 25. Under the Group’s accounting policy, foreign currency assets and liabilities that are hedged using currency swaps are translated at the forward 
rate inherent in the contracts. Consequently, the book value of the relevant asset or liability effectively includes the fair value of the hedging instrument.
For the purpose of the table below, the book value of the relevant asset or liability is shown gross of the effect of the hedging instrument.

years. Parent company provisions of £3.1 million (2003: £3.2 million) relate to remedial work.
Rental guarantees – The provision covers shortfalls anticipated under leasehold commitments. An estimate has been made of the level of income and
expenditure anticipated for each property, and the timing of the utilisation of the provision chieﬂy covers the next two years. Net outgoings have been
discounted on a pre-tax basis using the short term cost of borrowing. 62

Resolution 7: To Re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers as Auditors
This resolution proposes that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Resolutions 8/9: To Allot Shares and Disapply Pre-emption Rights
Under section 80 of the Companies Act 1985, the Directors cannot
generally allot shares in the Company unless they are authorised to 
do so by the Company in general meeting. Resolution 8 will authorise
the Directors to issue new shares up to the lower of one third of 
the amount of the nominal value of the issued share capital of the
Company as at the date of this Notice – i.e. up to a value of £32,649,568
or the amount of the nominal value of the authorised but unissued
share capital of the Company.The authority will expire ﬁve years after 
the date of passing of this resolution.The Directors have no present
intention of issuing shares, except as needed to satisfy the exercise 
of options under the Company’s Employee Share Scheme and the
allotment of shares pursuant to such elections made by shareholders
of the Company.
Under Resolution 9, the Directors will remain subject to constraints 
on the issue of shares for cash.They will be able to issue such shares 
for cash only:
• in connection with a rights issue, open offer or other pre-emptive
offer or a scrip dividend alternative, or
• up to 5% of the nominal value of the Company’s issued share capital
as at the date of the Notice, i.e. £4,897,435.
Resolution 10: To Empower the Company to Make Market Purchases 
of its Shares
This resolution is intended to renew the authority of the Directors to
make market purchases of shares within a 10% limit, and in accordance
with Article 53 of the Company’s Articles of Association.The Board has
no present intention of exercising this authority. Moreover, purchases
will only be made if they would result in an expected increase in
earnings per share, taking into account other available investment
opportunities, and will be in the best interests of shareholders
generally. Any shares purchased in accordance with this authority 
will subsequently be cancelled or they may be held in treasury
pursuant to the Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury
Shares) Regulations 2003.These regulations allow the Company to 
hold its own shares in treasury following a buy back as an alternative 
to cancelling them. Holding bought back shares in treasury provides
the Company with the ability to sell or transfer them quickly and
effectively and also provides ﬂexibility in using such shares for
employees’ schemes. If any such shares are used, the Company will,
so long as required under the guidelines of the Association of British
Insurers Investment Committee, count them towards the limits in the
schemes as if they were newly issued shares.
All rights attaching to the shares, including voting rights and the right
to receive dividends, are suspended whilst they are held in treasury.
Options were outstanding as at 1 February 2005 to subscribe for a total
number of 8,798,764 ordinary shares, or 2.25% of the Company’s issued
share capital.
If the authority to purchase shares is ever used in full (and the
purchased shares cancelled), the proportion of issued share capital
represented by this ﬁgure would be 2.5%.
Resolution 11: To Approve the Remuneration Report of the Company
In accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations
2002 the Board is required to present the Remuneration Report to
shareholders for approval at the Meeting.The Remuneration Report is
set out on pages 41 to 46 of the Annual Report and Accounts for
the year ended 31 December 2004.The Board considers that
appropriate executive remuneration plays a vital part in helping to
achieve the Company’s overall objectives.The vote will have advisory
status in respect of the remuneration policy and overall remuneration
packages and is not speciﬁc to individual levels of remuneration.

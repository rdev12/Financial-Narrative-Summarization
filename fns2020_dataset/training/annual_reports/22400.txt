Four key platforms are 
now established and 
provide a well balanced 
business which is 
focused on lending  
to the SME market.
City of London Group plc (COLG) is an 
investment company with a wide range of 
national and international investments. A 
public company since 1986, the Company 
has had a full London Stock Exchange listing 
since August 1996.
The Company’s strategy is to build a quality 
ﬁnancial services group centred on specialist 
ﬁnancing and alternative fund management. 
The Company believes there are particular 
opportunities in the SME and professional 
services sectors as major national and foreign 
banks limit new lending.

Chairman’s statement
The transformation 
into a ﬁnancial 
services investment 
group is now 
virtually complete. 
The transformation into a ﬁnancial services 
investment group is now virtually complete. 
Four key platforms are now established and 
provide a well balanced business which is 
focused on lending to the SME market. The 
legacy mining and energy equity investment 
portfolio will continue to be steadily 
unwound to fund the development of these 
new platforms. Our target is to apply our 
investment policy to this equity portfolio so 
that it represents no more than 20% of gross 
assets of the Company.
































This industry background is 
important to the repositioned 
City of London Group because 
our strategy is to invest in 
platforms targeted at providing 
alternative sources of ﬁnance 
including asset based ﬁnance 
to the SME market. City of London Group plc

platforms gain traction in 
each of their markets. 4

Investment platforms




























Investment report
















Our strategy, which remains 
unchanged, is to invest 
in alternative investment 
platforms where we see 
opportunities for creating 
shareholder value and co-invest 
with experienced management 
teams, provide them with seed 
funding to get started and then 
seek third party funding to 
facilitate their growth. 6

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
1 General information
City of London Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of its 
registered ofﬁce is 30 Cannon Street, London, EC4M 6XH. The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
City of London Group plc is a closed-ended investment company with a number of operating investments in the ﬁnancial 
services sector and a portfolio of ‘available for sale’ investments. Details of the activities of the Group are given in the 
directors’ report.
These consolidated and separate ﬁnancial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of directors on 25 June 2012.
2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated and separate ﬁnancial statements of City of London Group plc have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The consolidated and separate ﬁnancial 
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁed by the revaluation of ‘available-for-sale’ 
ﬁnancial assets (including operating investments, investment in legal funds) and derivatives. These ﬁnancial instruments are 
carried at fair value. 
The directors are satisﬁed that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, 
a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. The Group’s going concern position is further discussed in the 
directors’ report on page 16.
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been 
applied in these ﬁnancial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
 IAS 1 – (Amendments) Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income
 IAS 12 – (Amendments) Deferred tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets (amended)
 IAS 19 – Employee Beneﬁts - Revised
 IAS 27 – Separate Financial Statements 
 IAS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
 IFRS 1 –  (Amendments) - Severe Hyperinﬂation and Removal of ﬁxed date for ﬁrst time adopters. (Amendments) -  
Government loans
 IFRS 7 –  (Amendments) Disclosures: Transfers of Financial Assets. (Amendments) Disclosures: Offsetting Financial Assets 
and Financial Liabilities
 IFRS 10 – Consolidated Financial Statements
 IFRS 11 – Joint Arrangements
 IFRS 12 – Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
 IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement
 IFRIC 20 – Stripping costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine
The Group considers that of these amendments and revised standards only IAS 1, IFRS’s 7 and 12 will have a material impact 
on the disclosures and presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements.
2.2 Consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries 
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that 
control ceases. 38 
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Financial statements
City of London Group plc
2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies  
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identiﬁed separately from the Group’s equity therein. 
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the 
minority’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. In accordance with IAS 27, the Group recognises any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
net assets on a transaction by transaction basis.
2.3 Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence. Signiﬁcant inﬂuence is the power 
to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results of associates are incorporated in these ﬁnancial statements using the equity method of accounting. Investments 
in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the book values of the identiﬁed net assets of the associate at  
the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest 
in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the 
asset transferred.
2.4 Business combinations
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The cost of the acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquire. Acquisition related expenses are expensed as incurred. 
The acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of 
the business combination over the Group’s interests in the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised.
On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value 
or at the non-controlling interests proportion share of the acquiree’s net assets. The Group treats transactions with the non-
controlling interest as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests the difference 
between the consideration paid and the relevant share of net assets acquired is recorded in equity.
2.5 Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost at acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of 
the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an 
asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as 
an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently when there is an indication it may be impaired. For the 
purposes of assessing impairment, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of 
the combination. Any impairment is recognised immediately in proﬁt and loss and is not subsequently reversed. 
Other intangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is 
provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of intangible assets by equal annual instalments over their 
estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Website development 3 years straight-line
Systems development 3 years straight-line
The other intangible assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.

Financial statements
2.6 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation 
is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments 
over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Fixtures, ﬁttings & equipment 3 years straight-line
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
2.7 Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
The carrying value of the non-current assets is reviewed on an on-going basis to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised for the 
amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of property, plant and 
equipment is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The recoverable amount of goodwill is its value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset. For an asset that does not generate 
largely independent cash inﬂows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
2.8 Financial assets
The Group and the Company classify ﬁnancial assets in the following categories: loans and receivables, ‘available-for-sale’ 
ﬁnancial assets, operating investments and investment in legal funds. The classiﬁcation depends on the purpose for which the 
ﬁnancial assets were acquired. Management determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets at initial recognition and re-
evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
(a) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date. These 
are classiﬁed as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are classiﬁed as ‘trade and other receivables’ in the balance sheet. 
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established 
when there is objective evidence that the Group or Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of receivables. Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or 
ﬁnancial reorganisation, and default or delinquency on payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash ﬂows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement within 
‘administrative expenses’.
In accordance with IAS 17, costs which are incremental to the initiation of new business (Initial Direct Costs or “IDC”) are 
capitalised and amortised over the expected life of the leases to which they relate. The IDC is included in lease receivables. 
The capitalisation of IDC relates to personnel and other operating expenses. The IDC amortisation is netted off against interest 
income and similar income in the income statement.
(b) vailable or sale nancial asse s
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classiﬁed in any of the 
other categories speciﬁed by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date – the date on which the Group or Company commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value, including directly attributable transaction costs. 
‘Available-for-sale’ ﬁnancial assets are subsequently carried at fair value and gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value are recognised directly in equity. They are derecognised when the rights to receive cash ﬂows from the investments have 
expired or have been transferred and the Group or Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
When securities classiﬁed as available-for-sale are sold or permanently impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments 
recognised in equity are included in the income statement as ‘proﬁt on sale of investments’ and ‘provision for impairment of 
investments’ respectively. Interest accrued on available-for-sale securities carrying a ﬁxed interest rate is recognised in the 
income statement. Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement when the Group 
and Company’s right to receive payments is established. 40 
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Financial statements
City of London Group plc
2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
The fair values of quoted investments are based on bid prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. If the market for a ﬁnancial 
asset is not active (and for unlisted securities), the Group and Company establish fair value by using valuation techniques. These 
include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted 
cash ﬂow analysis and option pricing models, making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-
speciﬁc inputs.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a ﬁnancial asset or a Group of 
ﬁnancial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classiﬁed as available for sale, a signiﬁcant or prolonged decline in 
the fair value of the security below its cost is considered an indicator that the security is impaired. If any such evidence exists 
for available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the 
current fair value, less any impairment loss on that ﬁnancial asset previously recognised in proﬁt or loss – is removed from equity 
and recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not 
subsequently reversed in the income statement unless the underlying instrument is derecognised.
(c) era in inves en s
Operating investments are substantial investments (typically below 20% of the equity of the investee company) that the 
Group intends to hold for the foreseeable future. Operating investments are initially recorded and subsequently measured in 
accordance with the principles laid out above for available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets but are separately disclosed on the face of 
the balance sheet, as the associated ﬁnancial risks differ from the portfolio of available-for-sale ﬁnancial instruments. 
(d) nves en s in le al nds
Seed funding is made into funds which are used to fund legal cases. Initial recognition of an investment is made when payment 
to the fund is made. The investments are subsequently carried at fair value and gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value of each fund are recognised directly in equity in accordance with the principle outlined above for available-for-sale ﬁnancial 
instruments. De-recognition occurs when funds are returned and any proﬁts or losses are taken to the proﬁt and loss account at 
this time. 
(e) nves en in s bsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Cost also includes directly attributable costs of investment.
2.9 Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost or net realisable value whichever is the lower. 
2.10 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, call deposits with maturity of less than three months and bank overdrafts. 
Funds held by brokers are classed as cash if held in an account in a group company name. If held in the brokers’ name, they are 
included in other debtors. Bank overdrafts are included in borrowings under current liabilities.
2.11 Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed according to the substance of the contractual obligations entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
2.12 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown 
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
When the Group purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable issues costs is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or 
reissued. When such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. 
2.13 Dividends
Dividends declared on the Company’s equity share capital are recognised as a liability when an irrevocable obligation to pay the 
dividends is established. In the case of interim dividends this arises when the dividend is paid. In the case of ﬁnal dividends this 
is the date at which the dividends are approved at a shareholders’ general meeting.
2.14 Preference shares
Preference shares held by non-controlling interests in subsidiary companies are included as borrowings in non-current liabilities. 
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense. 
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued 41
City of London Group plc
Financial statements
2.15 Trade payables
Liabilities are recognised as trade payables when an invoice is received. Expenses incurred for which an invoice has not as 
yet been received are included in accruals and deferred income. Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
2.16 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are 
recognised at transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable the some or all of the facility will be drawn down.
2.17 Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and beneﬁts of ownership of the asset are classiﬁed as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
2.18 Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Are initially recognised at fair value on the date of the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
2.19 Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identiﬁed as the full Board of the Company.
2.20 Revenue
Revenue comprises dividend and interest income and investment management fees, arrangement fees, trade ﬁnance fees and 
stock sales. Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Interest income is recognised 
on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method. Fee income is recognised in the period in which the underlying 
services are provided. Inventory sales are recognised on the date the title to the goods transfers.
2.21 Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries and associates is determined by the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates. The functional and presentational currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is pound sterling 
(£). Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at the actual rates of exchange ruling 
at the date of the transaction or valuation when items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. 
Translation differences on non-monetary ﬁnancial assets, such as equities classiﬁed as ‘available-for-sale’, are included in other 
comprehensive income, to the extent that they are not considered permanently impaired where the impairment is charged 
through the proﬁt and loss.
2.22 Employee beneﬁts
 are based a en The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment compensation plans under which the entity receives 
services from employees as consideration for equity instruments of the Group. 
The fair value of the employee services received by the Group is recognised as an expense. The total value of the expense is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the equity award granted including any market performance conditions, but excluding 
non-market conditions such as continued employee service periods. Non-market conditions are included in the assumptions 
about the number of equity awards that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the 
period over which all the speciﬁed vesting conditions are to be satisﬁed. Where the employee services are received in advance of 
the formal grant date of the equity award, as is the case with the deferred element of the Group’s long term incentive plan, the fair 
value of the award is estimated at each reporting date preceding the grant date and the cumulative recognised charge is adjusted 
as appropriate when the fair value is ultimately calculated on grant. At each reporting date the Group updates its estimate of the 
number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to 
original estimates, if any, in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where relevant the social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of equity awards is considered an integral 
part of the grant itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash settled transaction. 42

2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
 nn al and de erred incen ive sc e e
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and proﬁt sharing based on the increase in the higher of total 
shareholder return or increase in net assets per share against a benchmark of 8% per annum. The liability is recognised where 
there is either a contractual obligation or past practice has established a constructive obligation. Deferred incentive scheme 
bonuses are treated as equity-settled share-based payments in accordance with the policy outlined above. 
2.23 Income tax
Income tax on the result for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at 
the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount 
of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is possible that future taxable proﬁt will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
 
3 Judgements and estimates
The preparation of ﬁnancial information in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgements about carrying values of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
 air en o available or sale nancial asse s
The Group and the Company follow the guidance from IAS 39 when determining whether an investment is other than 
temporarily impaired. This determination requires signiﬁcant judgement. In making this judgement, the Group and company 
evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; and the 
ﬁnancial health and near–far business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, 
changes in technology and operational and ﬁnancing cash ﬂows.
If the impairments that were considered temporary had been considered permanent, retained earnings would be reduced and 
the revaluation reserve increased by £460,056 (2011: £274,311). There would be no overall effect on the net assets of the Group 
or Company.
 ssessin air val e o nlis ed available or sale nancial asse s
Fair values of unlisted ‘available-for-sale’ ﬁnancial assets are determined using valuation techniques. The Group and the 
Company use their judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions 
existing at each balance sheet date. The Group’s most signiﬁcant unlisted investments are those in ‘available-for-sale’ ﬁnancial 
assets and ‘investments in legal funds’, both of which are separately disclosed on the balance sheet. 
Operating investments are valued using valuation techniques as described in note 2. Based on their knowledge of the underlying 
investee companies, management has concluded that no write down of value is appropriate in respect of these investments as 
the underlying performance is in line with expectations inherent in the Group’s initial investment. 
The fair value of investment in legal funds is inherently based on the potential value of the underlying legal claims for which the 
funds have provided ﬁnancing. While advice is taken on an on-going basis from legal counsel and extensive due diligence is 
carried out by the funds prior to providing ﬁnance for speciﬁc cases, there is an unavoidable risk that the ultimate outcome of 
the underlying cases will differ from expectations which could adversely affect the fair value of the overall investment. Cases are 
assessed on a case by case basis and impaired if considered necessary.

 c isi ion acco n in 
Goodwill arose during the year on the acquisition of further stakes in City of London Conﬁrming House Limited, Fundamental 
Tracker Investment Management Limited and the buy back of shares in Therium which were the subject of a dilution clause. The 
ﬁgures are based on the calculation of the fair values of identiﬁable assets and liabilities existing in the acquiree. As goodwill is not 
amortised but is instead subject to annual impairment review, any overstatement of goodwill may lead to increased volatility in the 
Group’s operating results arising from impairment charges. Further details of the fair values of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of 
Therium, City of London Conﬁrming House Limited and FTIM Limited and the resulting goodwill may be found in note 14.
Li i ed Liabili ar ners i s
Therium Capital Management Limited has raised three separate Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP’s) in order to supplement 
monies directly invested in cases. The funds are not controlled or advised by City of London Group plc and the capital 
concerned has the litigation risk of the cases where the funds are invested. Accordingly these funds are therefore not 
consolidated as ‘Investments in legal cases’, except to the extent the Company has invested its money in the partnerships, nor 
are the monies managed from third parties accounted for as liabilities.
 air en o ood ill
Judgement as to the impairment of goodwill is based on the forecast proﬁtability of the underlying investments in the 
foreseeable future. As actual results may deviate from these expectations, and as noted above, there is a risk of increased 
volatility arising in the Group’s operating results from goodwill impairment if results are lower than anticipated. The goodwill 
associated with Fundamental Tracker Investment Management Limited was impaired in the previous year and the investment 
is now carried at book value. The performance of Therium Capital management Limited is still in accordance with expectations 
and no impairment was considered necessary. Trade Finance Partners Limited and SHF Legal Funding Limited are recent 
investments and as performance in the short time since the dates of the acquisition have been in line with expectations no 
impairment was considered necessary.

13 Earnings per share
Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the proﬁt attributable to equity holders of the Group by the weighted average 
number of ordinary share in issue during the year less those held in treasury and in the Employee Beneﬁt Trust (see note 25).

Loss attributable to equity holders (1,433) 13 
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 17,401 10,510 
Basic earnings per share (8.24p) 0.12p
Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Dilutive potential ordinary shares relate to share options and shares that may 
be granted under the incentive award. For share options, a calculation is made to determine the number of shares that could 
have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on 
the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options. Adjustment is made for the full number of 
shares that could be granted under the incentive awards, the Company being due no consideration for the shares to be issued. 
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the 
exercise of the share options and all incentive awards granted.

31 Financial instruments
The Company’s and the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise ‘available-for-sale’ ﬁnancial assets, trade debtors and other 
receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables.
Financial risk management
The ﬁnancial risks faced by the Company include market risk (including price risk, foreign exchange (or currency) risk and fair 
value interest risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash ﬂow interest rate risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing 
each of these risks. Neither the Company nor the Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments for trading purposes.
The Company’s main objectives in the management of ﬁnancial risk relate to price risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk.
Price risk
The Group is subject to price risk on its ‘available-for-sale’ ﬁnancial assets, including its operating investments and investments 
in legal funds as well as its portfolio of ﬁnancial assets. The Group spreads its market risk in respect of the portfolio through 
diversiﬁcation. The Group holds ﬁxed income, preference shares and stocks of micro, small, mid and large capitalisation 
companies diversiﬁed over different countries, sectors and currencies. At 31 March 2012 29.6% of the Group’s portfolio was 
invested in unlisted equity securities. Top value holdings are set out in the Group’s annual and half-yearly reports. Price risk in 
respect of investments in unlisted operating investments and legal funds is managed by the Group having an overall investment 
portfolio which limits its exposure to unlisted investments individually and collectively.  60

31 Financial instruments continued
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s earnings and liquidity are affected by ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates principally in respect of the 
foreign currency denominated bank accounts. There is also some exposure in respect of ‘available-for-sale’ and legal fund 
ﬁnancial assets denominated in overseas currencies. The carrying amounts of the Company’s ‘available-for-sale’ ﬁnancial assets 
denominated in foreign currencies are shown in note 16.

Total 2,194  –  2,194  1,768  487  2,255
Credit risk
All cash deposits (as shown above) are made with major ﬁnancial institutions and the directors are of the opinion that credit 
risk in relation to cash and cash equivalents is minimal. However, as the Group holds no collateral against the balances, some 
risk remains. 
Liquidity risk 
The Company has sufﬁcient cash to meet its current requirements. At 31 March 2012 the Company had a £1,600,000 bank 
overdraft facility. The total amount drawn on these facilities at the 31 March 2012 was £1,068,000. The overdraft facility expires 
this month (June) and is in the process of being renewed. Since the year end the Company has made a share placing details of 
which are given in the post balance sheet event note. 
Cash ﬂow and fair value interest rate risk
The Company has interest-bearing assets at ﬂoating or ﬁxed-for-one-month interest rates. At 31 March 2012 Company’s only 
substantial interest- bearing borrowings were its £1,000,000 loan and the £1,068,000 drawn on its bank overdraft. Interest 
on the loan was ﬁxed at 10% and is payable quarterly. The overdraft facility carries ﬂoating rate interest. These facilities are 
expected to be renewed.

Fair value estimation 
The fair value of listed ﬁnancial assets is established by relevance to current bid market prices.
The fair value of unlisted investments is determined using valuation techniques as described in note 3.
The fair value of investments in legal funds is based on the opinion of legal counsel on the prospects of cases ﬁnanced by the funds.
Due to their short maturity proﬁles, management is of the opinion that there is no material difference between the fair value  
and carrying value of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and trade and other payables. 
The directors therefore consider that carrying value of ﬁnancial instruments equates to fair value.
The following table presents the Group’s assets that are measured at fair value at 31 March 2012.

Capital risk management
The Group is mainly funded from equity share capital which comprises a single class of share (see note 25). At 31 March 2012 
the Company had drawn down £1,068,000 on its overdraft and had a short term bank loan of £1,000,000.
 
32 Post balance sheet events 
Therium Capital Management Limited (“Therium”) has been awarded mandates to be managed on behalf of an institutional 
investor account for an initial amount of £5m, to be invested in a portfolio of third party litigation and arbitration claims. It is the 
parties’ stated intention in due course, to increase the size of this account to up to £15m. Therium has also announced that 
investors in its ﬁrst LLP fund have received interim distributions equivalent to their capital investment after 22 months. 
Trade Finance Partners Limited (“TFPL ”) has agreed the provision of a three year trade ﬁnance facility with Macquarie Bank 
Limited (“Macquarie”). The initial amount will be £15m with the option to increase by mutual agreement up to £25m within the 
period. Under the arrangements, Macquarie has invested £263,150 in new equity in TFPL representing a 5% shareholding. It 
has also invested £736,850 in unsecured convertible loan notes in TFPL, where the capital and accrued interest are convertible 
after three years. If converted in full, this would increase Macquarie’s shareholding in TFPL, on a fully diluted basis, to 20%. If not 
converted the convertible loan notes and interest become repayable in 2017. 62

consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity, the

notes. The ﬁnancial framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company ﬁnancial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters which are 
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for this report, or the 
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statements, the directors are responsible for the preparation of ﬁnancial 
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and 
the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practice Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards  
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the parent’s company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
 the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2012 
and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
 the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion: 
 the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the  
Companies Act 2006; and
 the information given in the directors’ report for the ﬁnancial period for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Remuneration Report and the ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations. company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for 
each ﬁnancial year. Under that law, the directors are required to prepare ﬁnancial statements for the Group in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and have also elected to prepare 
ﬁnancial statements for the Company in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’). company law requires 
the directors to prepare such ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. Under company law the directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that ﬁnancial statements present fairly for each ﬁnancial year the Company’s 
ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 
other events and conditions in accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and Presentation of 
Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable 
International Financial Reporting Standards. Directors are also required to:
 properly select and apply accounting policies and then apply then consistently; 
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 make judgements and accounting estimates which are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the EU have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed  
and explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with speciﬁc requirements in IFRS is insufﬁcient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s

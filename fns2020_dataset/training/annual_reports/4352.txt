Euromoney Institutional Investor benefited
from buoyant financial markets. An

recent acquisition of Metal Bulletin is the
largest external acquisition that the 
DMGT Group has ever made. We expect

Australia both had a difficult year, affected
by downturns in consumer advertising.
Both had bright spots, with strongly
growing exhibitions in the Middle East and
in the recently created technology sector .
The latest Nova stations in Adelaide and
particularly Brisbane have performed 
well since launch. Both divisions should
increase their return on our investments 
in the next year .
Associated Newspapers had to cope with
the competitive national newspaper market,
as well as with an advertising downturn.
The circulation performances have
improved as the year progressed and we
have once more significantly outperformed
the rest of Fleet Street. Advertising, too,
has seen some improvement recently,
doubtless partly as a result of the papers’
circulation strength. While Metro continues
to thrive, the Evening Standard has faced
two new free competitors, one of them our
own London Lite. The Standard is London’s
quality newspaper and this makes it
remarkably resilient.
Northcliffe has had a year of upheaval. 
We reviewed the business early in 2006 
and concluded that shareholders would do
better if we retained the business, rather
than sell it. Since then, we have been
implementing our plan to increase
shareholder value, including regionalising
the management structure and developing
digital operations linked to the newspapers.
We sold our Aberdeen titles for an excellent
price. I have recently visited many of the
centres and have been most impressed by
the positive attitude in Northcliffe, despite
all this change. 
I had the pleasure in May of opening our
new building in Szeged, in southern
Hungary. We are developing a solid
business there, in Slovakia and in
neighbouring countries.
I make no apology for talking again this year
about the internet. It is having a fundamental
effect on all media businesses and we must
continue to invest in it. We have created
Associated Northcliffe Digital to take
advantage of the outstanding opportunities
that the internet offers, both to expand our
print titles and in its own right. We have
invested more than £150 million to create
one of the UK’s largest online consumer
networks covering jobs, property, personal
finance, travel, motors and dating. This
investment is already giving us a good return
and we shall continue to invest in this area.
The Board will lose the wise counsel of
Frank Lowy from the end of the AGM.
Frank’s is a remarkable success story and
he has been an excellent adviser both to my
father and to me. With the approval of
shareholders,we will welcome Nicholas
Berry, whose broad experience of media and
investment will be valuable to the Board.
I have already complimented the employees
of Northcliffe. I extend this to all our
employees who have produced such a
resilient trading performance this year . 
We are well positioned for developments 
in the media landscape and our titles and
people will enable us to continue to prosper .

before tax, calculated in accordance with
International Accounting Standards for the
first time, rose by 9% to £260 million.
Revenues were up 2% to £2,176 million.
The best part of this rise was due to another

Now in its third year, the NHS Jobs 
e-recruitment service has helped NHS
organisations in England save money and
improve their recruitment processes.
Savings have been identified in advertising,
administration and temporary staffing 
with reductions in the time to fill posts.
NHS Jobs is provided by Jobsite as a 
service to the NHS, working with Methods
Consulting and NHS Employers. It was
developed by Jobsite from its own highly
rated job-board technology, in what 
has been described as one of the most
successful IT projects in the NHS, 
delivered on time and within budget.
The service enables job advertising on 
one of the most visited recruitment
websites in the UK, with over one million 
visits each month. Online applications,
application sifting and management,
recruiter-applicant messaging, reference
collection, shortlisting and powerful
reporting are all included in the easy to 
use web-based service.
A spokesman from one of the NHS Trusts 
said “ As a result of the implementation 
of NHS Jobs, the recruitment function of
the trust has been reviewed, and processes
have been put in place to narrow the risk 
of poor recruitment. The monies saved have
been used as part of the trust’s financial
savings plan to assist in working towards a
break-even financial position at year end. ”

Genscape was founded in 1999 to serve the
energy market’s need for better information.
Genscape introduced its power monitoring
technology in 2001, with the company’s
network developing rapidly since then to
cover more than 400 power plants and
power transmission pathways across the
US and continental Europe. 
While continuing to grow the power
monitoring networks, the company’s 
recent expansion plans have included the
development of monitoring technologies 
for additional energy markets such as
natural gas and oil, and the creation of 
a publications division which provides
important fundamental information for
energy-related markets such as coal,
emissions and natural gas. 
In addition to extending its reach into 
new energy commodities and products,
Genscape is also aggressively approaching
new market opportunities in Japan,
Australia and South America.

A little more than two-and-a-half years ago,
DMGT had no footprint in Slovakia. Now, 
it is one of the top two publishers, based on
circulation. £22 million has been invested
since 2004.
The remarkable rise of the Slovakian
operation began on 1st January, 2004, 
with the acquisition of 60% of Avizo, the
leading daily classified newspaper in
Slovakia. A staff of just 22 generate revenue
of £1.5 million. Five months later, the
remaining 40% share was bought.
On 1st January, 2005, City Express was
acquired, including two fortnightly titles.
Auto Burza (a motors classified product)
and Burza Nehnutel’nosti (property 
paper). Employees numbered 20, and 
the three titles were producing revenue 
of £0.6 million.
By last year, the combined Slovakian staff
had risen to almost 100, with revenue of 
£3 million, and more acquisitions were on
the way. In November 2005, profesia.sk, 
a job website, was acquired. The founder –
Dalibor Jakus – remains, heading a fast
growing business. The website has 89%
brand recognition and a 26% market share
of all Slovakia’s digital resources: indeed,
half of all money spent on jobs advertising
in the market, regardless of media, goes 
to profesia. The business model for
profesia.sk is being exported to Hungary.
And in August 2006, Pravda, Slovakia’s
leading quality daily newspaper, and the
second best selling title in the country, 
was acquired. Its daily circulation is 
78,000 copies.

Introduction
This Business Review is addressed to the
members of the Company. It is framed,
having in mind the principles and
guidelines for Operating and Financial
Reviews published by the UK Accounting
Standards Board in January 2006. It
describes the main operational and
financial factors underpinning the
development, performance and position
of the Group as well as those likely to 
affect performance over the coming year .
This Chief Executive’s Review sets out the
nature, objectives and strategy of the
Group, together with the principal risks
and uncertainties we face. It is followed 
on pages 16 to 27 by a business review of
the development and performance of each
of our operating divisions. A Financial and
Treasury Review is given on pages 28 to 31.
DMGT’s philosophy
DMGT’s practice over many years has 
been to take advantage of its shareholding
structure to invest for the long term in order
to generate value for its shareholders.
Control by a founding family is a model
which has been demonstrated to serve 
the media industry well over time. We 
are prepared to have a long timeframe 
to investment maturity and realisation,
provided the business in question is
progressing well, meeting milestones 
and creating value.
Nature of the business
DMGT is a multiple media business, as
illustrated at the front of this Annual Report,
operating in different markets, each within
its particular competitive and regulatory
environments. Operational responsibility is
devolved to our six divisions, whose boards
the executive Directors chair . We operate
with a light touch from the centre, relieving
line management of overhead activities 
that do not contribute at the operating level.
DMGT’s objectives are embedded into 
the thinking of each of our divisional
management teams.
Strategy
The Group’s objective is to be the owner of
high quality sustainable media properties,
reflected in premium commercial 
positions, thereby generating a premium
return for shareholders. Over the past
decade the strategy has been to extend the
Group’s media activities so as to reduce its
dependence on UK newspapers, which 
are heavily dependent on advertising and,
due to their strong market positions, 
much regulated. 
The Group’s newspapers remain highly
profitable and we have continued to invest in

them in order to maintain their market-
leading positions. The stability of these
businesses has underpinned the manner 
in which we have built a re-balanced Group:
by deployment of capital most successfully
in DMG Information, recently in Euromoney
Institutional Investor through its acquisition
of Metal Bulletin and in dmg world media
and DMG Radio. As a consequence, an
increased percentage of the Group’s
revenues is generated from streams other
than advertising, principally subscriptions
and events. A significant part of the asset
base is now outside the UK; the Group’s
exposure to regulation has been greatly
reduced; and it is close to passing a
significant milestone of a half of operating
profits* being derived other than 
from newspapers.
Over the last few years, it has become clear
that the Group needs to be run faster as 
the pace of change in business has grown,
particularly the threat to traditional media
forms from new technologies. This has
been evidenced by the loss of classified
advertising at the Evening Standard and 
by the decline of profits at T eletext due to
structural changes in its market.
Last year we undertook a review of
Northcliffe Newspapers which identified
the potential for further restructuring of 
its UK business in addition to that already
being undertaken as part of its Aim Higher
programme. The powerful market position
occupied by Northcliffe’s businesses in
their regional locations meant that they
were unlikely to grow faster than their local
economies. Since we saw the prospect 
of limited long-term revenue growth, a
choice lay between retaining and running
Northcliffe harder for profit and selling it.
Hence the strategic review was announced
in November 2005 when we invited third
party offers for the business, while
continuing to develop our own plans for 
it, in order to establish whether greater
shareholder value could be achieved from 
a sale than from a transformation of the
business within DMGT . 
Our view of the future for Northcliffe
improved during the review, while a number
of factors, not least trading at the time,
conspired against obtaining a full sale price.
In February the Board committed itself to
retaining the business since we believe that
Northcliffe has an excellent future as an
integrated provider of local media services.
It is positioned to provide its local and
national customers with the information
and advertising they seek through a 
range of media channels and brands. In
particular, the combination of print and
online will provide a differentiated product
range that will be unequalled in its local
markets. Northcliffe has been restructured
into six regional divisions, each headed 
by a regional managing director, with local
managing directors focused on raising
revenues in local markets. The size of 
the central support functions has been
reduced. A joint digital division, Associated
Northcliffe Digital (AND), has been
established to drive digital revenue. 
Management of the printing operations 
of Associated and Northcliffe has been
integrated and other shared services
including accounting, procurement,
marketing, fleet and human resources 
are being investigated. We do not intend 
to combine the editorial, sales or 
circulation functions.
Northcliffe has demonstrated its ability 
to reduce costs and is well placed to 
achieve an annual cost reduction target 
of £45 million by the end of September 2007.
Over the next year, it will concentrate on
revenue growth and defending its
newspaper circulations.
The continuing underlying value of our
regional newspapers was demonstrated 
in April with the sale of Aberdeen Journals
at a multiple significantly higher than that
implied by offers received for the whole 
of Northcliffe. 
At Associated Newspapers, we have
continued to invest in editorial quality and
the graph on page 17 demonstrates the
extent to which the Mail titles maintained
their circulations and continued to increase
their market share, aided by successful
promotions. In Ireland, we are now 
focused on extending the circulation for
both Mail titles.
A strategic challenge to be addressed is
Associated’s relatively low margins which
have a material impact on the Group’s
overall margins. Costs are being reduced
through the creation of shared services with
Northcliffe and, over time, the cost base 
of our national newspapers is adjusting 
to a lower level of revenue growth due to 
the likely migration online of display and
classified revenues at varying speeds. 
Our objective is to meet this challenge
without losing the powerful advertising
response from an engaged readership,
given that the Mail titles have a most 
envied position in the UK market and that
Associated are efficient producers of high

In London, the objective is to restore the
Evening Standard to profitability in the
medium term and we have launched a new
free newspaper, London Lite, aimed at a
different consumer market, as explained 
on page 16. Associated’s track record of
thinking freshly about its titles, and creating
new titles, as with Metro some years ago, 
or adapting old ones in response to market
developments, remains undiminished. 
We intend to defend the Group’s advertising
base and to extend it, regardless of format.
Accordingly our strategy at Associated
Northcliffe Digital (AND) has involved
making investments to increase its
exposure to areas of the online advertising
market pertinent to Associated
Newspapers, being jobs, property, personal
finance, motors and dating. Building a
presence in the online travel advertising
market is being addressed by T eletext. In
total, Associated has invested £155 million
in pure play digital businesses since 2004
with the objective of being the number one
or two player in each chosen market. AND
now has annualised revenues approaching
£90 million and we look forward to strong
profit growth from this new division. Its
initial development is now largely complete
and further acquisitions are likely to be of a
smaller in-fill nature.
Our other divisions, built over the years,
have also undergone an internal review. 
At DMG Information we have invested
approximately £420 million since 1996 (net
of disposals). This year the business made 
a record £68 million operating profit* and
the growth in its profits from a standing
start in 1998, illustrated on page 23, is a
credit to its tried and tested management
team in the US. They intend to grow the
business further both by increasing revenue
expenditure on product development over
the coming year and by re-investment of 
its cash flow in acquisitions over the next
few years. 
Euromoney Institutional Investor’s
acquisitionofMetalBulletininOctober2006
willstepupitsperformancewhichisalready
being driven by the motivating impact 
of its Capital Appreciation Plan on senior
management. We expect above average
growth over the immediate future, provided
financial markets remain benign. The
acquisition was funded partly by the issue 
of new shares by Euromoney such that
DMGT’s interest has been diluted from 69%
to 61%. We regard Euromoney as a core
business and do not intend our holding to 
be reduced further .
We have invested approximately £400
million in dmg world media since 1995. 
It has suffered this year from a decline in
revenues from its consumer shows in the
UK, US and Australasia, which comprise
just over a third of the business. As a
consequence, our strategy is to grow the
business through aggregating acquisitions
and launches in the stronger business 
to business sectors and faster growing
markets. Recent acquisitions have been
concentrated on the higher growth oil and
gas portfolio and technology sectors. 
Net investment in DMG Radio Australia
since its creation in 1996 has totalled 
£200 million. The business was established
with a plan to build a national metropolitan
FM broadcasting network through the
Australian government’s licence auction
process with the intention of delivering 
an above average return on investment.
This last year has been difficult due to the
simultaneous launch – and subsequent
relaunch – of the new Vega stations 
and completion of the Nova network.
Nevertheless, our Australian radio
management remain highly concentrated
on the task before them. 
Having acquired Metal Bulletin the Group’s
net debt has risen since the year end to
around £900 million. This will preclude
major acquisitions in the short term until
that acquisition has been successfully
integrated, and our prudent debt ratios 
fully re-established. 
Resources
The Group’s main resources are its brands,
its people, its reputation and the market-
leading position of its major businesses. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties the
Group faces vary across the different
businesses and are the focus of the Risk
Committee which I chair . These risks are
identified in a Group Risk Register . The
materiality of each risk is assessed against
a framework to determine its significance
and likelihood of occurrence. The Risk
Register is used to determine the agenda
and activity of the Risk Committee. The
most material risks identified in the Risk
Register, together with the steps taken 
to mitigate them, are described below. 
The operation of the Risk Committee 
is described on page 39.
The geographic spread and diverse portfolio
of businesses within the Group helps to
reduce the impact of many of the risks
identified below. Certain of these risks 
are interdependent and should not be
considered in isolation.

The impact of technological and market
changes on our competitive advantage
Our businesses operate in highly
competitive environments that can be
subject to rapid change. Our products and
services, and their means of delivery, are
affected by technological innovations,
changing legislation, competitor activity or
changing customer behaviour . A structural
change in the advertising market, resulting
in significant advertising moving away from
our traditional products to the internet,
could significantly affect our results. 
We have developed an internet strategy 
for each of our main segments of
advertising revenue. We have a
decentralised autonomous culture that
encourages an entrepreneurial approach 
to the development of new opportunities 
in response to these threats and we must
continue to invest and adapt to remain
competitive. Our strategy of diversification
and willingness to take a long-term view
helps us to react to these challenges 
and opportunities. 
Pension scheme shortfalls
We operate defined benefit schemes for 
our newspaper divisions and certain senior
executives. Reported earnings may be
adversely affected by changes in our
pension costs and funding requirements
due to lower than expected investment
returns, changes in demographics and
higher life expectancy. These risks are
being worked on with the scheme trustees
to agree an appropriate funding approach
and an asset allocation strategy designed to
reduce and diversify the risk inherent in the
investment portfolios. These measures are
in addition to the introduction last year of 
a two-tier benefit structure in the defined
benefit schemes, providing greater
employee choice with increased member
contributions in the top tier . These actions,
together with the operation of defined
contribution pension plans in all other
divisions and overseas, have helped
to reduce pension liabilities and control 
the pension costs incurred by the Group. 
Currency risk
Currency exchange rate fluctuations have
an impact on the Group’s reported earnings.
Over 40% of the Group’s operating profits
are generated from revenues invoiced in 
US dollars. The impact of currency rate
fluctuations is partly offset by the levels of
US dollar debt incurred. The policies and
procedures in place to manage these risks
are discussed in the Financial and Treasury
Review on page 30. 
Impact of a major disaster or outbreak 
of disease
Any disaster, such as a geopolitical event 
or a pandemic, such as avian flu, which
significantly affects the wider environment
or infrastructure in a sector where the
Group has material operations could
adversely affect the Group. Although plans
and procedures are in place to manage 
the impact of such risks, the event might
affect our ability to produce and deliver 
our products, or reduce the demand for
them. The importance of travel to many 
of our event businesses increases the
sensitivity of our results to such incidents
that may affect confidence in travel to
specific destinations.
Acquisition risk 
As well as launching and building new
businesses, an integral part of our success
has, and will continue to be, the acquisition
of businesses that complement our existing
products or expand the scope of our
expertise into new markets. A number of
risks are inherent within any strategy to
acquire. The Group generally acquires
businesses with a high potential for growth
in related markets. This results in the
majority of acquisitions considered being
smaller add-on acquisitions, which reduces
the size of the risk of each acquisition to the
Group. The Metal Bulletin acquisition is the
Group’s first acquisition over £100 million
since 1988. 
Exposure to changes in the economy 
and customer spending patterns
General economic conditions and the
financial health of our customers affect 
the performance of all of our businesses 
to some degree. A significant proportion 
of our revenue is derived from advertising
spending which has historically been
cyclical, with companies spending less on
advertising in times of economic slowdown.
Our commitment to investment in our core
brands and products helps us to reduce 
the effect of these fluctuations by
maintaining the strength of our products 
in their markets. 
Dependence on information technology
and the integrity of data
All of our businesses are dependent on
technology to some degree. Disruption to
our information technology infrastructure
or breaches in our data security systems
could adversely affect our businesses and
damage our reputation. This could arise
from loss of service from third parties,
operational failures, or sabotage (including
virus and hacker attacks). The information
security and business continuity risks and
mitigating controls vary for our different
businesses and so responsibility rests with
LIKE THE DAIL Y MAIL, THE MAIL ON SUNDAY
HAS MAINT AINED ITS CIRCULA TION THROUGH 
ITS HIGH QUALITY . Daily Mail and General Trust plc
14
each of the divisional management 
teams. Both of these risks were a focus 
of the Risk Committee during the year .
Assessments were completed to
understand the effectiveness of the
mitigating controls in each area and to
highlight any areas for improvement. 
Price volatility of newsprint
Newsprint represents a significant
proportionofourcostswithintheNewspaper
divisions. Newsprint prices are subject to
volatility arising from variations in supply
and demand. Whilst generally these
variations are not large and therefore not
significant to the Group, there have been
periods historically where the impact to the
Group was material and a repeat of such
events cannot be ruled out. 
Reliance on key management and staff
In order to pursue our strategy, we are
reliant on key management and staff
across all our businesses. We cannot
predict with certainty that we will enjoy
continued success in our recruitment
and retention of high quality management
and creative talent.
Share price performance
Over time our strong historic operating
performance has been recognised by the
market, as can be seen from the graphs on
pages 15 and 48. The price of our widely
traded ‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares is
now higher than five years ago, during
which period it has experienced a turbulent
time due largely to the weakness of UK
advertising markets. We still appear to be
valued mainly as a UK newspaper stock,
despite only half of our profits coming 
from that source. Over the last year, the
share price received a temporary hike on
market expectations of the sale of
Northcliffe at a premium price and it fell
over the summer as the market fled from
“traditional media”. As a result DMGT came
out of the FTSE 100 share index. In recent
months it has risen on market perceptions
of an improvement in UK advertising
conditions. Share performance remains
important to us as a measure that our
strategy and balance are understood and
recognised by the market.
Capital structure
The Company has not made a capital call 
on its shareholders for over seventy years.
Capital growth is provided by long-term
debt and by retained earnings. DMGT’s
policy is to seek to increase the dividend
each year by 5% to 7% in real terms, within
reason regardless of the results, as long as
we continue to have confidence in the
strength of our businesses. As shown on
page 15, the compound dividend growth
over the last ten years is 10% in 
nominal terms. 
In March, we announced our intention,
following the disposal of Aberdeen
Journals, an expected reduction in capital
expenditure and the significant cost
reductions being achieved at Northcliffe, 
to start a share buy-back programme of 
‘ A ’ shares under the general authority
approved at the AGM in February 2006. 
In the first twelve months, the Board’s
intention is to return approximately 
£50 million to shareholders. So far we have
acquired 3.5 million shares for a total of
£21.5 million which are held as Treasury
shares. DMGT is effectively giving a 4% 
yield to its shareholders by a combination 
of this buy-back and its annual dividend.
Relationships with stakeholders, 
other than shareholders
Environmental, employee, social and
community issues are taken seriously by
the Company, as set out in the Corporate
Responsibility Report on pages 32 to 34.
DMGT also has a dedicated Corporate
Responsibility section on its website
which is updated regularly. The Board has
policies on the environment and on equal
opportunities for employees, as well as on
whistleblowing and health and safety. All of
these policies are established and set out
on the DMGT extranet.
DMGT and the environment
We recognise that our businesses have 
an impact on the environment through 
our printing operations, offices, transport
and other business activities. We are
committed to ensuring that where practical
any adverse impact on the environment
from our activities will be minimised. 
The major environmental impacts arise 
in our printing operations where we focus
on newsprint, energy, CO
2
, water and ink
efficiencies. We have gathered the data 
over each of the last five years in order to
monitor each of these impacts, and graphs
illustrating them are set out on our website.
The overall trend is positive. For example,
as shown in the graph (left), CO
2
efficiency
improved again this year due in part to the
closure of a number of less efficient print
centres, but also to our continued 
efforts to reduce energy consumption
through measures implemented at a
number of sites. 
DMGT and our employees
Our record on retention of staff remains
good, aided by our autonomous culture and
by our provision of the appropriate form of
pension provision to all our employees. In
this regard, DMGT has kept open its final
salary pension schemes in the UK

newspaper divisions where people tend to
stay with us for a long time and where the
average age is higher . In the other divisions,
which are more international and where
employees are generally younger, we
believe defined contribution pension plans
are more appropriate. 
The number of employees has fallen from
18,214 at the beginning of the year to 16,033
at the end, a reduction of 12%. Of this
reduction, 2,050 was due to the sale of
Study Group and of Aberdeen Journals.
The number of employees within Northcliffe
fell by a further 900 (14%) as a consequence
of its reorganisation programme.
Trends and factors likely to affect 
the outlook
The new financial year has started well 
with signs of a gentle recovery in some
sectors of the national advertising market,
with our national titles producing strong
circulation results in an ever competitive
market. Whilst Northcliffe is not yet 
seeing much improvement in advertising
conditions, continued falls in revenues are
being offset by cost reductions. We expect
DMG Information to maintain its strong
underlying revenue growth, albeit with profit
growth possibly tempered a little this year
by investment in new products, and for AND
to have another growth year . Pre-tax profits
should also benefit from Euromoney’s
continuing organic growth and from its
acquisition of Metal Bulletin.
Overall the Board is cautiously optimistic 
of achieving another year of progress.

This excludes T eletext which became part 
of the division at the start of the year . This
robust result was particularly satisfying 
as it was achieved despite a further sharp
decline in the print advertising market, a
newsprint price increase again well ahead 
of inflation and the launch costs of a new
free title, London Lite. It resulted from 
close attention to costs, particularly at 
the Evening Standard, and from growth
in profits from digital activities. T otal 
costs were £11 million lower than last 
year, despite spending £7 million more
on newsprint.
The Daily Mail average daily circulation 
of 2,376,000 was down by only 0.4%, despite
a 5p Monday to Friday cover price increase
in April. This compared favourably to 
an overall decline in the national daily
newspaper market of 2.8%, resulting in 
the Daily Mail increasing its market share 
to 19.7%, a rise of 0.5% and the highest
market share growth of any national
newspaper . During February a new 
Irish edition was successfully launched,
resulting in a sixfold increase in sales 
in the Republic of Ireland.
The Mail on Sunday circulation averaged
2,312,000, just 1.7% down year on year in 
an overall market which fell by 4.5%. 
This small year on year decline was as a
result of the first six months, as circulation
increased year on year from April to
September by 16,000 copies to 2,320,000.
Market share grew strongly once again, 
by 0.5% to a record 17.2%. Live, a lifestyle
magazine aimed at men, replaced 
Night & Day in October and a significant
investment was made in the paper quality 
of YOU magazine. The UK cover price was
increased by 10p in September, with 
no immediate impact on circulation. 
A new Irish edition was launched on 
24th September, incorporating Ireland 
on Sunday, and circulation figures have 
so far been very encouraging. Prior to this
change Ireland on Sunday once again
improved its trading performance and
circulation finished the year strongly, 
up 6,000 copies on last year . 
Within the context of a much larger 
and more complex London afternoon
newspaper market, the Evening Standard
ceased publishing its free edition, Standard
Lite, on 23rd August. It also increased its
cover price by 10p to 50p on 29th August,
thus differentiating its quality editorial
content from the London Lite and the other
free afternoon newspaper whose editorial
products are targeted at a more populous
market. The average circulation for the
year, excluding Standard Lite, was 321,000,
representing a decline year on year of 
7.8%. Substantial cost reductions were
again realised during the year .
Thisislondon.co.uk was successfully
relaunched in August and has subsequently
enjoyed a significant increase in the number
of unique UK users. 
Metro continued to expand its activities
during the year, both at home and abroad.
In the UK, distribution grew by 5.7%, to an
average of over 1,060,000 copies daily and
profits* were up 10%. In Ireland, Metro
Dublin was launched in a joint venture with
the Irish Times and Metro International 
and is currently distributing 55,000 copies
per day. In Dubai, Metro acquired 60% of
Catchpole Communications FZ LLC, 
which provides sales, circulation and
management services to 7DAYS, an 
English language free newspaper similar 
to Metro. In August, London Lite was
launched, adding to Associated’s
substantial presence in the free daily
newspaper market. Distributed by
merchandisers, rather than via public
transport outlets, trading performance 
has so far been ahead of expectation and 
an audited circulation of nearly 360,000 
was recorded in September .
Loot had another challenging year, with
advertising down 20% and circulation
revenue down 21%. Although disappointing,
this was to a great extent in line with the

market. The website, Loot.com achieved
15% revenue growth and operating costs
were reduced year on year by 12%. The
company has undertaken a reorganisation
and restructure in order to position the
business better in a competitive and
challenging marketplace. It is expected to
return to profit* growth next year .
T eletext saw a 19% decline in overall
revenues compared to last year, which 
was in line with expectations. This reflects
the ongoing impact of the structural shift
taking place in the television market with
the rising household penetration of digital
television and the consequent changes in
consumer usage in advance of analogue
switch-off. The cost base had been reduced
in anticipation and, as a result, T eletext
remained modestly in profit. Against this
background the company has continued 
to pursue its strategy of developing services
across the different distribution platforms
of digital television, the internet and mobile
devices as part of maintaining market
position in key sectors such as Holidays
advertising and establishing a basis for
developing new business streams.
Therefore, whilst analogue-based revenues
have reduced by 30% during the course of
the year, those from the developing digital
activities have increased by 60%. Teletext
is already the leading text service on
Freeview, ahead of both the BBC and Sky
and digital television audiences now account
for nearly a third of Teletext’s total weekly
audience. During the year Teletext took full
responsibility for the development of
Associated’s online travel properties, which
currently include the teletextholidays.co.uk
and thisistravel.co.uk websites. As part of its
strategy to develop the business base
beyond its current association with the late
package market, the division acquired
Villarenters, an internet company
specialising in villa accommodation.
Across Associated, print advertising
revenues were down 6% to £436 million,
with display advertising down 4% and
classified down 9%. Metro bucked the trend
by achieving an increase of 8.5%, year on
year, and the Mail titles outperformed the
wider newspaper advertising market.

The Daily Mail was down 4.3%, with the 
Mail on Sunday down 6.0%, the Evening
Standard down 15% and Loot was down
20%. Both Ireland on Sunday and Buy and
Sell were up – by 4.5% and 15% respectively.
By sector, retail advertising across the titles
was up 7%, but there were falls in most
other categories. T eletext, which became
part of the Associated division at the start of
the year, saw its television revenues fall by
22%, as the switch of advertisers from
analogue to digital TV continued.
During the year Harmsworth Printing was
created by merging Harmsworth Quays, 
the printing arm of Associated with 
The Northcliffe Press, which controlled the
print centres of Northcliffe Newspapers.
Going forward this new structure will
optimise value for the Group by integrating
production management, planning and
utilisation of the printing plants nationwide.
The construction of the new site at Didcot
and the enhancements at Surrey Quays are
proceeding well and are on schedule to
provide the newspaper titles with increased
pagination and full colour by early 2008.

2006 TO LEVERAGE GROUP ASSETS AND EXPAND ITS NETWORK 
OF SITES, AUDIENCES AND ADVERTISERS.
Expanding the digital operations of our
newspaper titles is a high priority for the
Group. Associated’s digital operations grew
significantly during the last year, both
organically and by acquisition. In total,
revenues doubled to £55 million; excluding
acquisitions, growth was still a healthy 29%.
The sites contributed an operating profit* 
of £13 million. Associated Northcliffe 
Digital (AND), which consists of the digital
operations of Associated Newspapers and
Northcliffe Newspapers, was set up in the
spring of 2006 to leverage Group assets and
expand its network of sites, audiences and
advertisers. By the year-end the total AND
network of sites (including acquisitions)
reached an estimated 26% of the UK
internet population. The respective digital
results of Associated and Northcliffe are
included within each of these divisions for
the year under review.
The merged entity has extended its digital
presence in recruitment and property, as
well as entering into new sectors including
dating, price comparison and motors. 
Run-rate annualised revenues for AND 
as a whole approached £90 million as 
the new financial year began with a current
profit* margin of around 20%.
Recruitment: Jobsite, acquired in March
2004, continued to show strong growth,
trading ahead of expectations. In line 
with its strategy, Jobsite acquired two
recruitment advertising businesses that
lead their field. The Appointment was
acquired in July. The business incorporates
the recruitment websites InRetail and
RetailCareers, as well as the print
recruitment magazine, The Appointment.
ProductionBase, the market-leading
subscription-based recruitment website
focused on the UK entertainment
production market, was acquired in May.
The Jobsite network now serves ten niche
sectors in addition to the national portal; 
in total reaching over 1.5 million unique
users each month.
Property: AND’s position in this market 
was substantially strengthened in January
through the acquisition of Fastcrop plc, the
owner of Primelocation, one of the UK’s
leading internet property advertising

agents in the UK and overseas, the business 
has traded well since acquisition. Its 
high-profile TV advertising campaigns have
been successful in recruiting new agents
and driving users to the site. The AND
property portfolio already includes
Findaproperty, which is also trading ahead
of expectations and successfully executing
against its growth plan to build a customer
base beyond its current heartland of
London and South East England, where 
it is the market leader . 
Utility Switching: August saw the
acquisition of SimplySwitch, which allows
consumers to compare available products
in energy, home phone, mobile, broadband
and credit cards, and then switch – online 
or on the phone – to services that best meet
their needs or save them money. The
business is rapidly building on its success 
in the energy and credit card markets by
developing a wider set of categories for
comparison, including personal loans 
and insurance.
Dating: In March, AND acquired Allegran,
the leading online dating operator in the UK.
Allegran operates two of the country’s three
most popular dating websites and four of
the top 10, according to Hitwise. Through
the brands Loopylove, Girlsdateforfree,
Pocado, Datingforparents and
Dreamsdiscovered, Allegran provides a
suite of dating services tailored for single
people of different age groups and from
varying walks of life. Allegran is trading in
line with expectations.
Motors: Data Media and Retail, the operator
of online car classified sites including
Carsource and an email marketing services
division, was acquired in February and is
growing well. This was followed in June by
the acquisition of Autoexposure, a business
providing motor dealers with publishing
tools and advertising packages to enable
them to market themselves on the web. The
business is trading in line with expectations
and further expansion is planned.
Newspaper companion sites and digital
magazines: The group’s news, information
and entertainment-led sites, which operate
at national, regional and local levels, 
have performed strongly. The Mail online
delivered good growth in audiences and
revenues and now reaches 6.5 million
unique users each month, driven by a
renewed focus on content and user
interactivity. A redesign and strong cross-
promotion by the Evening Standard helped
secure a dramatic increase in audience 
size for ThisisLondon. The new Metro.co.uk
site was also well received by its growing
audience and advertisers. 
Development of cross-media sales, offering
advertisers combined print and online
packages is moving forward with promising
results at both national and local level.
AND finished the year with almost a
hundred websites and positioned as one 
of the leading players in many digital
advertising sectors. Its strength and
success were recognised by the Association
of Online Publishers, which voted it,
Consumer Digital Publisher of the Year .
Outlook
The new financial year has started well,
with some signs of a gentle recovery in 
the advertising market and our national
newspapers producing strong circulation
results in an ever competitive market. The
London evening market will remain a real
challenge in the coming year but, with its
experience of the London market and free
newspapers, Associated is confident it can
maximise the potential of its two titles. As
the digital division is expected to continue
its strong profit growth, the outlook for the
next twelve months is cautiously optimistic.

OPERATING MARGIN*
2006 has been characterised by four major
events: DMGT’s invitation of third party
offers for Northcliffe; the disposal in March
of Aberdeen Journals for £132 million; 
a significant downturn in advertising, 
the worst since the advertising recession 
of the early 1990s; and, lastly, better than
expected progress on the cost reduction
programme. The first two matters are
covered in the Chief Executive’s Review
on page 11 of this report. This review will
focus on operational matters. 
Excluding the results of Aberdeen Journals,
Northcliffe Newspapers achieved operating
profits* of £87 million, which were
£5 million or 6% below last year . On a
similar basis, revenues were down 5% to
£460 million and UK advertising income 
fell by almost 8% or £24 million. Those
categories most affected were recruitment,
motors and retail, recording decreases of
16%, 17% and 6% respectively. The only
bright spot was property advertising, which
continued its strong run with growth of just
over 6%. Other regional newspapers groups
have reported similar trends during 2006.
As well as a cyclical downturn in
advertising, which has hit the wider media
industry, there have been a number of
structural factors which have contributed to
the 2006 shortfall. These include reduced
public sector expenditure on recruitment
following the pre-2005 general election
boom; high numbers of overseas workers
joining the UK workforce, making it easier
for employers to fill vacancies; structural
changes in motor dealerships and the high
street; and migration of mainly motors and
recruitment advertising to online websites.
The financial impact of cyclical versus
structural cannot be quantified.
Despite like-for-like UK publishing
revenues falling by £31 million, profits* 
on this basis were only down £7 million due
to a substantial reduction in Northcliffe’s
cost base. Throughout 2006, there was
continued focus on improving Northcliffe’s
UK operating efficiency. This programme
commenced in the summer of 2005 and, 
by September 2006, savings of £35 million
had been realised, mainly from a reduction
in headcount of over 1,000 people. Two
printing plants were closed in Hull and
Lincoln taking the total to four over a fifteen
month period. Operationally, Northcliffe
was regrouped into six regional divisions,
each headed by a regional managing
director . So far, the main benefit from this
change has been further cost savings. 
In the coming financial year, we will focus
on improved revenue generation through
offering clients value added regional
advertising packages.
The trend of fewer people buying our
newspapers continued in 2006. However,
based on extensive triennial research,
Northcliffe’s share in its markets has not
diminished and the reach across a week
from its portfolio of products has remained
largely constant since 2003. This is of
particular importance given the continuing
media fragmentation.
Audited circulation of daily titles fell by 
3.8% in the July to December 2005 ABC
period and by 4.9% in the January to June
2006 ABC period. These figures, although
disappointing, were ahead of the industry
results. Further analysis shows that the
decline is more pronounced on the larger
metropolitan daily titles, a common feature
across the industry. Northcliffe’s portfolio 
of twenty four paid-for weekly titles
underperformed against the rest of the
regional press. Audited circulation fell by 
3.1% and 4.5% respectively in the July to
December 2005 and January to June 2006
ABC periods. Worst affected were our
weeklies in Cornwall, despite continued
investment in the presentation, content 
and promotion of the titles.
LIKE THE REST OF THE REGIONAL NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY,
NORTHCLIFFE EXPERIENCED TOUGH TRADING CONDITIONS 
IN 2006. THERE WAS A CONTINUED FOCUS ON IMPROVING 
OUR UK OPERATING EFFICIENCY .

UK HEADCOUNT (EXCLUDING ABERDEEN)
In 2006, we completed one of the largest
pieces of market research within the
industry, involving more than 25,000 
face-to-face interviews, giving a 360 degree
view of each local market, including our
products, customers and competition. 
This research has shown that, overall, 
daily newspaper readership (including
national titles) in Northcliffe’s circulation
areas has fallen; over the last three years
the proportion of all adults reading on an
average day has dropped from 68% to 
59%. However, although Average Issue
Readership has declined for all national 
and local titles, the Northcliffe share of the
daily newspaper market has increased. The
research also highlighted that weekly reach
of the paid-for titles declined more slowly
than average daily readership. Readers
continue to be more selective, primarily
because of the interest in days containing
recruitment, motors and property
advertising. Importantly, the combined
weekly reach of all products both in print
and online has been consistent over the
past three years in most regions, which
confirms that some readers are switching
to other products in the portfolio, mainly the
digital sites. 
The research has given all our publishing
businesses a dynamic overview of their
local marketplaces. Work is now in
progress to act upon the research findings
locally and to guide local publishing plans. 
2006 heralded an even greater focus on
digital publishing through the creation 
of AND. Northcliffe’s portfolio of Thisis
websites now have access to the resources
of DMGT’s pure play digital businesses
which will improve Northcliffe’s digital
services to its readers and advertisers.
Already, its local jobs and motors digital
platforms are being provided by Jobsite 
and Carsource. 
A culture change and empowerment
programme is underway in all editorial
departments, enabling journalists to take
full responsibility for website content.

publishing cycle entirely and breaking
stories online before in-print.
Fully integrated multi-media newsrooms
for all Northcliffe’s titles will be in operation
by the spring of 2007, many incorporating
industry-leading video journalism.
Over the past twelve months, Northcliffe’s
digital activities have grown substantially
with the number of unique users of its sites
climbing 32% to just over two million per
month. Page views are also up by 39% to 
32 million. Digital revenues in 2006
exceeded £7.7 million and we are confident
of further significant progress in 2007.
The international division continues to
make encouraging progress. Operating
profits* were up 19% to £5.1 million helped
byafullyear’scontributionfromacquisitions
in Slovakia. The market leading Slovakian
jobs board, profesia.sk, acquired in
November 2005, performed much better
than expected and has now expanded into
Hungary through a newly created website,
workania.hu. In July, our Szeged based
publisher relocated to new office facilities.
The project will continue into 2007 with the
planned installation of a new press. This will
help position the business to take advantage
of regional economic development. During
the latter part of the 2006 financial year,
further acquisitions were made including
Pravda, Slovakia’s leading quality national
newspaper, and 50% of Hungary’s leading
motors website, hasznaltauto.hu.
Outlook
Northcliffe remains cautious about the
outlook for advertising. Whilst recent
recruitment advertising trends since the
year end have been more encouraging,
with year on year declines down to below
5%, as yet the trend for all other major print
categories, except property, shows little
sign of improvement. Digital revenues
continue to expand encouragingly. Achieved
annualised cost savings have now risen to
£40 million which are currently offsetting
revenue declines in full. It is still too early
to predict when the downturn in the
advertising cycle will bottom out.

Operating profit* from DMGI’s financial and
insurance division rose by £14 million or
70% to £33 million on revenue up 27% to
£100 million. Risk Management Solutions
(RMS) continued its record of strong growth,
based on the increasing demand for
sophisticated modelling of catastrophes
and of other perils by the insurance sector .
During the year RMS successfully released
its most comprehensive product upgrade to
date, including new versions of its core US
earthquake and hurricane models, with
the latter incorporating the latest science
and data from the highly active 2005 US
hurricane season. New advisory and
analytical services were also successfully
introduced. RMSI, our Indian-based
geographic information services company,
achieved record revenues, and during the
year was transferred back under RMS
management, in order to play a key role
in RMS’s plan to grow its data services
business for the insurance industry.
Our financial information companies, 
Trepp and Lewtan, had excellent years. 
The level of new issuance in the commercial
mortgage-backed securities market,
served by Trepp, reached record levels
which assisted Trepp in continuing its
excellent growth record whilst Lewtan’s
growth included expansion of its European
offerings for the whole asset-backed
securities market and in its products
serving issuers.
Operating profit* from the property division
rose by £5 million or 22% to £27 million on
revenue up 19% to £92 million. Landmark
Information Group enjoyed an excellent 
year . A resurgent UK home property market
saw transaction volumes increase by
approximately 20% and was coupled with

EDR was still able to grow satisfactorily
by further expanding its products to
commercial property lenders and made
progress into establishing a market for
home environmental reports.

Property & Portfolio Research had a 
good year, increasing the number of US
cities covered by its property research
services and launching coverage of major
European cities.
Operating profit* from our other 
business-to-business companies rose 
by £3.5 million or 80% to £8 million on
revenue up 36% to £64 million. This
included Genscape, the market leading
provider of real-time energy generation
and transmission information to North
American and European markets.
Genscape has met all expectations since
its acquisition in May, and continues to
expand its product offering.
For the second year revenues at Sanborn
grew sharply with a number of large state
and Federal contracts being won. Dolphin
continued to make reasonable progress in
developing hazardous chemical inventory
management products, setting the stage
for higher growth in 2007.
Hobsons had another excellent year
delivering a substantially increased profit.
The driver of growth was primarily the 
US business which offers publishing 
and technology recruitment solutions to
US colleges but the Australian business
also grew strongly and there was a
pleasing upturn in Germany after several
difficult years.
Study Group traded substantially up on 
last year and was successfully sold in
September for £75 million. 
Outlook
The prospects for DMGI remain
encouraging. The businesses are
identifying opportunities to expand
organically and, while this may result 
in some additional short-term revenue
investment, it augurs well for their 
longer-term growth prospects.

Euromoney achieved a record operating
profit* , despite an increase of £3 million in
the charge for its management incentive
scheme, the CAP . Excluding this charge,
operating profit* rose 11%, although this
itself includes the impact of some
detrimental timing differences arising 
from the timing of conferences. Allowing 
for these, underlying growth in operating
profit* was 20%.
Consistent with management’s strategy,
most of the growth in operating profit* 
has been generated organically. The
performance of the print subscription 
titles has been particularly pleasing, with
subscriber numbers, subscription rates
and renewal rates all ahead of the previous
year . Each of the group’s divisions 
increased profits. 
Financial publishing grew most in absolute
terms, with operating profits* up by 17%, as
a result of strong growth in both advertising
and subscription revenues. Nearly all titles
increased profits: Euromoney magazine had
an impressive year, achieving 17% growth 
in advertising revenues and publishing its
biggest IMF issue for ten years. 
Business Publishing had a good year with
operating profits* increasing by 25%.
Encouragingly, this was a broad-based
improvement: the US energy publications
delivered record profits; the legal titles
benefited from strong growth in
subscription and advertising revenues; and
the transport and telecoms titles sharply
increased profits by diversifying away from
advertising into new revenue streams.
Operating profits* from Conferences and
Seminars increased by 23% on an
underlying basis, continuing the excellent
growth record achieved over the past five
years. The continued interest in alternative
assets has supported revenue and profit
growth, and most of the businesses
achieved an increase in both the number of
events held and the average revenue per
event. II Memberships had an excellent
year . IMN continued to grow through the
launch of successful new events for the
securitisation and real estate markets.
The Training businesses delivered a 13%
increase in operating profits* , due mainly 
to the volume of courses offered and an
increase in the average yield. 
Operating profits* from Databases and
Information Services improved by 38%.
CEIC, consolidated from April, is proving 
an excellent addition to ISI, the emerging
markets information provider where
revenue growth maintained its momentum,
with a client retention rate in excess of 90%.
The number of ISI customers, products and
data providers all increased during the year .
Outlook
Euromoney has benefited from a healthy
financial environment in 2006, and any
marked reversal in the performance of
financial markets in 2007 will present
challenges. However, its strategy has been
to diversify its revenues while investing in
the quality of its products and services to
ensure competitive advantage irrespective
of the trading environment. The new year
has started well, although the first quarter
is Euromoney’s least significant in profit
terms. The focus will be on the integration
of the Metal Bulletin businesses.

OPERATING MARGIN*
Dmg world media’s revenue rose by 7%, 
but its operating profit* was up by only 1%.
Whilst its business-to-business shows
thrived, its two largest business sectors
(Consumer and Gift) had a tough year . This
was despite 2006 being a high year in its
cycle of events with the biennial Global
Petroleum Show taking place in Calgary
and the reporting of an Index show in Dubai
with none the previous year . 
Consumer shows, which comprise just over
a third of our business, struggled with
profits* falling by 20% due to slower high
street spending and weakening consumer
confidence. This was a trend across the UK,
North America and Australia, although
inevitably the impact on the London Ideal
Home Show was most significant. 
Once again our business in Dubai grew
strongly; in particular its two newer shows
in the region – Hotel and Office – both
produced strong results. The Big 5
construction show and Index, a commercial
interior design show, continue to be two of
the largest three shows staged in the
Middle East. Both have also been launched
in India this year . 
The Technology sector overall grew
impressively, fuelled by the substantial
growth of ad:tech, dmg world media’s
interactive advertising and technology
series of conferences and exhibitions. 
In addition, we resumed ownership of the
ad:tech shows in London and Shanghai
(previously organised under licence) and
launched shows in Hamburg, Singapore
and Sydney for 2007. In 2006, we also
acquired Evanta, a US-based business
producing twelve Chief Information Officer
Executive Summits in the major North
American markets.
The Oil and Gas sector remains a steady
performer for dmg world media as the 2006
Global Petroleum Show reported strong
sales and attendance. We strengthened our
business with the acquisition of the Abu
Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition
and Conference (ADIPEC). Already the
largest Oil & Gas show in the Middle East,
ADIPEC will have the potential to grow with
the completion of the Abu Dhabi
International Exhibition Centre in 2008. 
Outlook
2007 should see a stronger performance
from dmg world media’s North American
consumer show sector and its Australasian
business as they capitalise upon the
benefits of restructuring which took place 
in the year . The market for our UK
consumer shows continues to look tough.
The T echnology and Oil and Gas sectors will
report continued growth as the financial

OPERATING MARGIN*
2006 marked ten years of operation for DMG
Radio Australia, a company which started
with the purchase of an Adelaide talk radio
station and a handful of regional stations
and over this period transformed into a
metropolitan radio company boasting the
leading national network in the attractive
Under 40 market. Whilst losses were
expected on the newly launched Vega
stations, this was a disappointing year in 
the context of the company’s growth plan.
The key Nova Sydney station had a tough
year, partly due to weakness in the 
Sydney advertising market. However, the
completed Nova network was again the
leading national network in its target
audience of Under 40 in every survey this
year, a position it has won in each survey
held since the network’s completion in 
April 2005. The network increased its profits
over last year .
Nova Brisbane followed its spectacular
2005 launch by being the leading station 
for Listeners Under 40 in every survey since.
After only six months on air, Nova Brisbane
became the leading station in the market
overall, and has subsequently been the
leading station in the Brisbane market in
every survey since April 2006. It moved into
profit in this, its first full year of operations.
The new Vega FM stations in Sydney 
and Melbourne were relaunched in the 
year after the initial launches in August
2005 were unsuccessful. Recent survey 
results are more encouraging. Vega 
targets listeners aged 40-54, an 
audience complementary to that targeted
by Nova, and provides the company with
valuable access to advertisers outside of 
the Nova demographic in Australia’s two
largest markets.
While Vega’s first year contribution had a
larger negative impact on the result than
expected, 2007 revenues from Vega are
expected to grow and its losses to fall.
DMG Radio Australia’s Adelaide talk station,
Five AA, continued upon its 2005 success
and has been the Number One station in the
all important breakfast shift in every survey
of this year .
Outlook
For the first time in DMG Radio’s history,
there are no acquisitions or station launches
on the horizon, and senior executives can
focus solely on the execution of the stations’
strategic plans. The first target is a return to
profitability in the coming year .

Business Review
FINANCIAL AND TREASURY REVIEW
Accounts
As a listed company, we have been required
for the first time to prepare the Group
Accounts under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). This has led to
considerable changes in the format of our
primary statements, to increased volatility
of the numbers within the Income
Statement and to a far longer and more
complex set of Accounts. IFRS seems 
to favour the use of fair values over the
traditional measure of historical cost
and increasingly appears to be driven by
academic theory, at the expense of
commercial reality. Whilst many IFRS
standards follow the UK principles-based
approach, enabling the exercise of
professional judgement, several of its
newer US-influenced standards have
introduced complex rules and this trend
seems set to continue. 
IFRS lacks the prescriptive profit headings
of FRS 3: in particular there is no concept 
or definition of operating profit, nor of
exceptional items. DMGT has chosen to
present its Income Statement as closely as
permitted to UK GAAP . We have also sought
to align our published figures to the way 
we manage our businesses. In particular,
under IAS 19, the total pension charge is
made up of two components, the current
service cost and a finance credit. This
finance credit is the difference between 
the return on the assets and the interest
charge, due to the increase in the year 
of the present value of the defined benefit
obligations. We have included both
elements within operating profits. 
The divisions operating defined benefit
schemes (principally the newspaper
divisions) are charged the cash funding
rate, with the difference between this 
and the total IAS 19 charge included in
unallocated central costs.
Whilst the Group’s Accounts are likely 
to be more difficult for shareholders to
understand, this Financial Review focuses
on the adjusted numbers, in addition to 
the statutory figures, because we believe
the alternative measures give a more
comparable indication of the Group’s
underlying business performance. 
We have continued to prepare the Company
accounts under UK law and UK accounting
standards so as not to lose the exemptions
available under the Companies Act and UK
financial reporting standards.
Revenue
The Group’s revenue in the year of £2,176
million was 2% higher than the previous
year . There was revenue growth from all 
of our divisions, with the exception of our
newspapers which experienced difficult
trading conditions. Excluding the impact 
of acquisitions and disposals, we estimate
underlying revenue growth was 2%.
The analysis of revenue by activity,
illustrated in Graph 1, shows that there has
been little overall change in the shape of 
the Group in terms of revenues. However, 
if their digital activities are excluded from
our newspaper divisions, the percentage 
of revenue from newspapers has fallen to
60% from 67% in 2002. Graph 2 shows the
geographic split of revenue. This shows that
75% of revenue by source was generated by
UK businesses, compared with 80% in 2002,
but we estimate that 40% of overall Group
revenues is now invoiced in US dollars. 
Operating profit
The Group’s operating profit* amounted 
to £300 million, an increase of 6% on the
equivalent figure for last year . This figure 
is stated before charging £41 million as
exceptional operating costs. This charge
comprised principally the costs of 
the second phase of Northcliffe’s
reorganisation programme, together 
with the professional costs of its strategic
review, reorganisation costs within
Associated and a restructuring charge
within dmg world media. The charge for
amortisation of intangible assets 
rose by £22 million to £51 million due to

acquisitions made during the current 
and prior year . The Group also made an
impairment charge of £59 million,
principally in respect of its Vega radio
licences, Associated’s Loot business and 
a number of consumer and gift shows. 
After deducting these charges, the Group’s
reported operating profit fell by 37% to 
£150 million.
The analysis of operating profit* by activity
is shown in Graph 3. This shows strong
growth again from our business-to-
business information division, smaller 
rises from our national newspaper division,
Euromoney Institutional Investor, despite 
a £3 million increase in the charge for its
capital appreciation plan, and dmg world
media. These increases totalling 
£30 million were offset by falls of £9 million
in our regional newspaper division, partly
due to the sale of Aberdeen Journals, and by
increased losses within radio of £4 million.
Central costs were £5 million lower .
Associated’s performance was boosted by
strong growth from its digital operations,
both organically and from acquisitions,
although the newspapers proved resilient in
the face of a further decline in print
advertising income. 
Generally strong growth by the Group’s
business-facing divisions and the rapid
expansion of the digital operations of our
newspaper divisions means that 47% of this
year’s operating profit* has been generated
other than by the Group’s print newspaper
titles, up from 40% last year . 
Joint ventures and associates
The Group’s share of the results** of its
joint ventures and associates rose by 
£2.0 million to £7.1 million due mainly to
lower losses from Northcliffe’s digital
associates and to a larger contribution from
Euromoney’s associates. These were 
partly offset by the absence of a
contribution from GWR Group plc (which
merged into GCap Media plc in May 2005
with the Group’s interestnowaccounted
forasaninvestment). Also included are 
start-up losses from Metro Ireland and
lower profits from GLM, the North
American gift exhibition organiser .
Net financing costs
Investment revenue, excluding interest on
deposits, rose by 23% to £3.2 million. This
included a first full year’s dividends from
GCap Media, which outweighed a fall in
dividends from Reuters Group plc, resulting
from the Group selling its remaining
interest. Net interest payable (excluding
dividend income and deemed finance
charges) fell by £4.4 million to £48.3 million.
Other income statement items
The Group recorded other exceptional gains
and losses of £189 million. Of these, profits
on disposal of businesses of £175 million
arose from the sale of Aberdeen Journals
and Study Group and profits of £17 million
arose on the sale of investments, mainly
from the sale of the remaining shares in
Reuters. Profits of £9 million arose on the
sale of properties and other fixed assets.
These profits were offset partly by write
downs resulting from a review of the
carrying values of the Group’s investments.
Profit before tax
The statutory profit before tax of 
£311 million was 59% higher than last
year’s figure. Excluding amortisation 
and impairment and exceptional items, 
the adjusted profit* before tax figure was 
£260 million, up 9% on last year . 
Taxation
The tax charge of £60 million represents
19.3% of profit before tax and 14.2% of profit
before amortisation and impairment. The
adjusted tax on adjusted profits* amounted
to £62 million and the resulting rate is
23.9%, up from 22.1% last year due to a
higher proportion of profits coming from 
the United States, albeit partly offset by 
the accounting benefit of the last of the
Group’s unrecognised US tax losses. This is
still well below the UK corporate tax rate,
where the Group currently makes most of
its profit. The Group’s effective tax rate in
the UK is higher than this due to
expenditure disallowed for tax purposes.
The Group is still benefiting in the amount of
tax paid from carried forward losses in the
US, but this will reduce over the next two
years as US Federal tax becomes payable.
Over the next few years the adjusted tax rate
is expected to increase from 24% to
around 30%.

Cash flow and net debt
IAS 7 does not permit a reconciliation to net
debt to be given adjoining the Cash Flow
Statement; this is shown instead as 
note 13 to the Accounts. Net debt fell during
the year from £767 million to £738 million, a
reduction of £29 million. The fall in debt was
due to the strong trading cash flows and
proceeds of disposals which exceeded 
the high level of capital expenditure and
acquisitions, together with the outflow 
from taxation, interest and dividends. 
Graph 4 summarises the Group’s sources 
of free cash flows and use of those funds
during the year . The net cash inflow from
operations, joint ventures and investment
was £382 million, which represented 98% 
of operating profit and income from joint
ventures and investment after adjusting 
for non cash charges (depreciation,
amortisation and impairment and similar).
In general, the Group’s profits are converted
rapidly into cash. 
Capital expenditure of £118 million was
higher than last year’s level, reflecting the
construction of Associated’s new plant in
Didcot, Oxfordshire. Acquisitions and
investments cost £343 million, the largest
items being the purchase of Genscape 
for £73 million and £110 million spent on
Associated’s digital division. Disposal
proceeds amounted to £241 million,
principally from the sale of Aberdeen
Journals and Study Group.
The Group’s interest cover, calculated as
the ratio of adjusted profits before interest
and depreciation (EBITDA) to net interest
payable, was 7.8 times this year, up from 
7.2 in 2005 (see Graph 5) and above the
Group’s current target of six times. The
Group’s ratio of year end net debt to EBITDA
was 1.9 times. The Group’s Standard &
Poor’s credit rating remains at BBB, as
does our rating from Fitch.
At the year end, the Group had £654 million
of Bonds due for repayment in 2013, 2018
and 2021. It also had £260 million of
committed banking available to it until
March 2008 and £300 million until
September 2009. It is intended to refinance
the 2008 bank facilities with longer-term
finance within the next year . The Group has
sufficient committed debt facilities to meet
its foreseeable requirements. It had surplus
committed facilities of £377 million at the
year end.
Since the year end, Euromoney has
completed the acquisition of Metal Bulletin,
including a cash and loan note component
of £175 million. 
Treasury policies
The following paragraphs are a summary 
of the Group’s treasury policies. DMGT 
aims to have sufficient liquidity to meet both
operational and capital cash flows and to
impose the minimum cash constraints on
the management and operation of the
Group. Financial instruments, including
derivatives, are used by the Group in order
to manage the principal financial risks that
arise in the course of business. These risks
are liquidity or funding risk, foreign
exchange risk, interest rate risk and
counterparty risk. The instruments are
used within the parameters set by the
Finance Committee of the Board, and are
not traded for a profit. The Group’s priority is
to address the economic impact of financial
risks using the most efficient or appropriate
approach. This may result in IFRS
accounting volatility.
Overview
The Group has adequate committed 
debt finance to meet current trading
requirements. Foreign exchange risk on
transactions is not a large issue for the
Group as the majority of its businesses are
domestic. In principle, the underlying
currency of net debt after taking account of
derivatives is managed in proportion to the
EBITDA in each currency. A growing
proportion of the Group’s profits are earned
in foreign currencies. As the Group is only
partially hedged by its foreign currency
debt, economically it is exposed to declines
in value of the US dollar in particular . The
Group has a prudent level of fixed interest
rate debt to reduce the impact of interest
rate fluctuations.
(a) Liquidity risk
It is the Group’s policy to have sufficient
surplus borrowing headroom such that its
development is not constrained. The Group
is funded by a mixture of equity, debt and
retained profits. Debt consists mainly of
committed bank facilities and bonds. 
The bank facilities provide the Group with
flexibility for operational requirements and
acquisitions. Uncommitted and overdraft
facilities are also utilised. The bonds
currently in issue consist of three sterling
Eurobonds. Maturities of debt are
maximised and spread in order to avoid the
requirement for significant repayments at
any point in time, as shown in Graph 6.
Surplus funds are generally used to pay
down debt. If temporary surpluses arise,
they are generally deposited in money
market accounts with banks that provide
bilateral credit lines. 
Covenants on debt instruments are 
kept to a minimum, even if this results 
in marginally higher interest costs. 
External finance is unsecured and is 
usually an obligation of the company or its
immediate subsidiary, rather than of
trading subsidiaries. This gives operating
management maximum flexibility to run the
business without the distraction of meeting
short-term financing requirements.
(b) Foreign exchange risk
(i) Transaction risk
Most of the Group’s businesses do not
transact cross-border: hence multi-
currency transaction risk is not substantial.
The main exception is Euromoney which
has net receipts in US dollars and net
payments in sterling. Euromoney has a
series of US dollar forward sale contracts in
place up to three years forward to meet its
sterling outgoings. Other than Euromoney
there were no significant foreign currency
forward contracts in existence that hedge
revenues or costs. The sterling value of

capital expenditure in foreign currency is
fixed using forward currency purchases.
T ax on non-trading exchange rate
movements is hedged, using cross
currency swaps and forward currency
contracts. The Group’s acquisition financing
structures may give rise to foreign exchange
gain or losses in the UK which are either
taxable or tax deductible. The Group enters
into market derivatives to hedge this
exposure in economic terms. However, IAS
39 prohibits such items from being shown
net in the tax line and as a result increased
volatility is introduced in the income
statement. This year’s profit before taxation
has been increased by £17 million (2005
£Nil) in relation to the structure and tax
payable has been increased by a similar
amount. Both have been removed in
arriving at adjusted profits. 
(ii) Translation exposure
Borrowings are principally incurred in
sterling, with lesser amounts in US dollars
and Australian dollars. Generally, the
proportion of foreign currency debt (after
allowing for any hedging instrument) 
to total net debt is managed to be
approximately equal to the proportion of
foreign EBITDA, compared to total Group
EBITDA. This is expected to continue. 
A substantial proportion of US dollar and
Australian dollar debt liabilities are created
through the use of foreign exchange
derivatives and treated as net investment
hedges. The consequence of this policy is
that the Group’s significant foreign earnings
are not hedged back to sterling.
(iii) Economic exposure
A substantial proportion of the Group’s
value relates to foreign subsidiaries, in the
US in particular . The foreign currency debt
described above is only a partial hedge of
this economic exposure.
(iv) Netting
The Group may offset currency risks on
trading, capital expenditure, tax and
borrowings and only hedge the net
exposure. This may result in not obtaining
IFRS hedge accounting.
(c) Interest rate risk
The Group aims to have approximately 70%
of forecast net debt to 80% of target net debt
as fixed interest rate liabilities. It aims to
achieve this ratio over the medium term 
and it is applied to each of the Group’s main
currencies. The predictability of interest
costs is deemed to be more important than
the possible opportunity cost foregone of
achieving lower interest rates. Borrowings
are made in either fixed or floating rates.
Interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps,
and options are used to help attain the
Group’s target level of fixed interest rate
debt. The maturity dates are spread in order
to avoid interest rate basis risk and also to
negate short-term changes in interest
rates. At the year end, fixed interest rate
debt represented approximately 90% of
total net debt. Options are not treated as
effective hedges under IFRS.
(d) Counterparty risk
Counterparties and their credit ratings are
regularly reviewed by Group Treasury. The
Group has counterparty limits for banks
with long-term credit ratings of ‘ AA ’ or
better, and a lower limit for single ‘ A ’ rated
banks. Typically this is banks that extend
credit facilities to the Group. The Group
does not expect any counterparties to be
unable to meet their obligations. 
(e) Debt levels
The Group currently aims to have a 6:1 ratio
of EBITDA to net interest costs and seeks to
ensure that the ratio of net debt to EBITDA
does not normally exceed 2.5:1. It is
believed that this achieves close to the
optimum level of gearing for the Group, but
leaves it with sufficient headroom should it
desire to increase its debt levels without
reducing the Group’s quoted debt below
investment grade. As such the ratio will 
not be met consistently, but will define the
medium-term target level of net debt.
Going concern
The Directors have continued to adopt the
going concern basis for the preparation of
the Accounts. This has been done since,
after considering relevant information, 
they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future.

DMGT IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A HIGH STANDARD OF
CORPORATE BEHAVIOUR AND ENSURING THAT CORPORATE
RESPONSIBILITY IS A PRIORITY THROUGHOUT THE BUSINESS.
DMGT AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
How DMGT manages Corporate
Responsibility (CR)
DMGT’s activities are diverse, with each 
of its businesses providing important
channels of communication and media
focus to different sections of society
throughout the world.
The Board reviews its performance in this
area through the Risk Committee, which is
the forum at which CR risks are discussed.
Overall responsibility for CR at Board
level lies with the Finance Director . The
Board has adopted policies on equal
opportunities, whistleblowing, health and
safety and the environment. 
DMGT owes much of its success to the
entrepreneurial ability of the management
teams leading its six divisions. These
businesses have thrived by allowing local
management to take local decisions in a
local context, whilst benefiting from the
global outlook and financial resources of
the wider Group.
This approach has delivered benefits to a
wide range of stakeholders. The success 
of many of the Group’s businesses is
inextricably linked to understanding and
engaging with the communities that they
serve, and this allows them to identify
needs and to campaign effectively on the
issues relevant to their customer base. 
The following report provides more detail 
of divisional activities focused around the
following key impact areas:
• the environment;
• our readers, viewers and listeners;
• the community;
• our employees.
Reported here is a summary of our
disclosure in this area. DMGT produced a
separate Corporate Responsibility Report 
in 2005 and it has a dedicated section on its
website with further information available
at www.dmgt.co.uk which is updated
regularly. We welcome your feedback.
Please send any comments to:

DMGT and the environment
The direct environmental impacts from
most of our divisions are relatively low. 
They arise mainly in our printing division. 
In the FTSE4Good index of which DMGT 
is a constituent, media is ranked as low
impact; printing and newspaper publishing
is ranked as medium impact. In the 
Morley sustainability index, media is a ‘C’ 
defined as business that is broadly neutral
to sustainability. 
Since our non-printing operations are
primarily office-based, their environmental
impact is considered relatively low. Our
offices around the world practise paper
recycling and more than half of office 
paper waste at DMGT headquarters is
recycled. There are also some schemes 
in place for the recycling of plastic cups,
toner cartridges, mobile phones and 
IT equipment. 
Our report therefore focuses on how we
manage the impacts in the printing
businesses. In addition, we acknowledge
our responsibility in ensuring that our paper
supplies come from paper manufacturers
that manage their environmental impacts,
including the sustainable sourcing of virgin
fibres. These two elements are the focus of
our environmental reporting.
In our printing operations, the key
environmental impacts are waste
generation, particularly waste newsprint;
energy use; ink use and paper purchasing.
DMGT’s UK printing operations are now run
by Harmsworth Printing, created in the year
through the merger of the Group’s largest
printing works, Harmsworth Quays, with
The Northcliffe Press’s seven printing
centres around the UK. A new site at Didcot
is being constructed which will be fully
operational by early 2008. In addition

newsprint, ink and plates and waste
disposal have cost implications for the
businesses and are, therefore, managed for
reasons of good business sense as well as
to reduce our environmental impacts.
Waste newsprint and ink use is measured
and reported to divisional board meetings
on a monthly basis. Seventy per cent of the
presses on which we print the Group’s titles
are Computer to Plate processes which
result in less waste being produced in the
printing process. Digital photography is
used in an increasing number of the
publishing centres. Absolute energy
consumption remained relatively consistent
with last year . Overall efficiency has
improved, reflecting the good practices in
energy reduction efforts at a number of
printing centres. Absolute CO
2
emissions
fell again this year due to the closure of a
number of less efficient print centres. 
CO
2
efficiency also improved, due also to 
the continued efforts to reduce energy
consumption through measures
implemented at a number of sites across
the Group.
T argets for waste paper are set for each
product printed. This percentage varies
according to certain criteria such as the
numbers of copies required and edition
changes. Actual waste volumes are
compared against budgeted levels, with 
the results provided for monthly review at
the appropriate Board level. Newsprint
production waste efficiency remained
relatively consistent in relation to last year .
The trend to increase numbers of colour
pages printed resulted in more waste
production as a result of greater numbers
of checks required to achieve the
appropriate print quality. This makes overall
gains in newsprint waste reductions
difficult to achieve. One hundred per cent 
of the production paper waste is recycled.
Good improvements were made in water
efficiency during the year with Harmsworth
Printing making further strides to cut water
use in its printing operations, following a
study undertaken in 2004. 
Newsprint supply and the environment
DMGT is aware of the responsibility it has
along the supply chain, in particular for one
of its largest purchases, newsprint. The
Group has a central Newsprint Committee
and paper is purchased for all the Group’s
newspaper operations, allowing co-
ordinated review of the environmental
credentials of paper suppliers and the
sourcing of their products. Where virgin
fibres are used in the paper manufacture,
DMGT requires that the forests are certified
either by the Forest Stewardship Council, or
the Pan European Forestry Commission,
both of which run schemes that provide
credible guarantees that the product comes
from well managed forests. DMGT sources
its paper from European mills, most of
which hold the environmental management
standard ISO14001. Ninety-eight per cent 
of virgin fibre products are sourced from
managed forests.
Our readers and listeners
Editorial standards
There are a number of standard setting
bodies that have established codes to which
DMGT’s divisions adhere. Compliance with
these codes ensures that our published 
and broadcast material reaches the
editorial standards expected, as agreed by
the industry and by other stakeholders. The
main code for the Group’s UK newspapers
is established and monitored by the Press
Complaints Commission. Teletext works 
to the standards set by OfCom, the
Broadcasting Standards Commission 
and Channel 4’s own codes. DMG Radio
complies with the Australian
Communications and Media Authority
Codes of Conduct.
Responding to reader and listener needs
Within the established editorial framework,
editors and journalists have the freedom to
operate as appropriate. The media industry
is highly competitive; therefore remaining in

DMGT and the community
Community involvement is integral to 
our business as well as to the personal
motivation of our employees. We donate
money, time and in-kind donations such as
radio air time and T eletext pages, as well as
staff actively giving time to areas such as
fundraising and trusteeships. The use of
our media channels and activities for fund
raising is driven through participation in 
the communities we serve and the
concerns and contributions of our readers
and listeners. Charitable donations are

A few examples of our involvement during
the year are shown here. 
DMGT and our employees
DMGT Group is an equal opportunities
employer . In addition to a Group policy, each
division has its own policies and practices
across a range of employee issues. Training
is taken seriously across the Group. 
Staff communication 
A variety of approaches to staff
communications exist within the Group,
including the use of the intranet, the Group
extranet, regular communication events,
face-to-face communications with
management and programmes related to
specific key events, such as major changes
in operations or equipment. 
Health and safety 
The Group’s health and safety policy
applies across DMGT. It sets out to
ensure the health, safety and welfare of 
its employees and all others who could 
be affected by the activities of the Group.
Whilst the Chief Executive has overall
responsibility at Board level for health 
and safety matters throughout the Group,
day to day responsibility is devolved to the
managing directors of each division. The
Group has had no fines or prosecutions 
for health and safety failures over the last
year . There are many examples of good
practice across the Group, in terms of
health and safety management systems,
the use of independent consultants and
initiatives focused on business-specific
health and safety risk areas. Health and
safety is particularly critical in all 
printing press facilities, which have
appropriate policies and management 
and monitoring programmes.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SECRETARY DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their Report and Accounts for the year
ended 1st October, 2006.
Activities
The principal activities of the Group are set out in the ‘Group at 
a Glance’ section at the front of the Annual Report.
The analysis of turnover and operating profit for the years ended
1st October, 2006 and 2nd October, 2005 are included as Notes 
1 and 2 to the income statement. 
Business Review
The information that fulfils the Companies Act requirements of
the business review is included in the Business Review on pages 
10 to 31. This includes a review of the development of the business
of the Group during the year, of its position at the end of the year
and of likely future developments in its business. Details of the
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out on
pages 12 to 14.
This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking statements
with respect to the principal risks and uncertainties facing the
Group. By their nature, these statements and forecasts involve
risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on
circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. There are a
number of factors that could cause actual results or developments
to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these
forward-looking statements and forecasts. No assurances can be
given that the forward-looking statements are reasonable as they
can be affected by a wide range of variables. The forward-looking
statements reflect the knowledge and information available at the
date of preparation of this Annual Report, and will not be updated
during the year . Nothing in this Annual Report should be
construed as a profit forecast.
Results and dividends
The profit after taxation of the Group amounted to £251.5 million.
After charging minority interests of £11.7 million, the Group profit
for the year amounted to £239.8 million.
An interim dividend of 4.05 pence per share was paid on the
Ordinary and ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares and the Directors
recommend that a final dividend of 9.00 pence per share be paid
on 9th February, 2007 making 13.05 pence per share for the year
(2005 12.0 pence).
Directors
Biographical details of the Directors of the Company at 
22nd November, 2006 are set out on page 35. The Directors
remained unchanged throughout the year .
The number of shares of the Company and of securities of other
Group companies, in which the Directors or their families had an
interest at the year end, are stated in the Remuneration Report 
on page 51.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Messrs Lowy,
Dutton, Gillespie and Verey retire by rotation at the Annual General
Meeting on 7th February, 2007. Each of Messrs Dutton, Gillespie
and Verey, being eligible, offers himself for re-election. Mr Lowy,
an independent non-executive Director since 1994, has decided
not to stand for re-election. The Directors would like to thank him
for his invaluable contribution to the Board’s deliberations.
Post balance sheet events
On 19th October, 2006, Euromoney Institutional Investor plc
completed its acquisition of Metal Bulletin plc for a consideration
of £225 million.
Share capital
Details of allotments in share capital during the year, which arose
solely from the exercise of options, are given in Note 34.
At the Annual General Meeting on 8th February, 2006, the
Company was granted the authority to purchase up to 10% of its
own shares. 
During the year, 4,775,736 ‘A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares
were purchased, having a nominal value of £596,967 , to match
obligations under various incentive plans and as part of a
share buy back programme. The consideration paid for these
shares was £31.0 million. Shares repurchased during the year
represented 1.25% of the called up ‘A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting
share capital at 1st October, 2006. 
The Company disposed of 1,364,471 of these shares, representing
0.36% of called up ‘A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting share capital for a cash
consideration of £8.4 million, in order to satisfy obligations under
incentive schemes.
Employees
Under the Group’s general policy of decentralised management, 
it is the responsibility of the management in each subsidiary to
encourage the involvement and participation of employees in their
company. The methods used vary company by company, but the
linking to performance targets of a significant portion of
remuneration is one widely used means.
The Group gives full and fair consideration to suitable applications
from disabled persons for employment. If existing employees
become disabled they will continue to be employed, wherever
practicable, in the same job or, if this is not practicable, every
effort will be made to find suitable alternative employment and
to provide appropriate training.
Policy on payment of suppliers
The Group’s policy on supplier payments varies across its
subsidiaries. These companies have no formal code or standard
which deals specifically with the payment of suppliers. However,
their policy is to ensure that the terms of payment, as specified
by, and agreed with the supplier at the outset, are not exceeded.
The Company had no trade creditors at the year end date.
The Group’s average payment period, calculated on the basis of
year end trade creditors, is 61 days (2005 56 days), although this is
dependent on the year end date and cannot therefore be regarded
as meaningful.
Donations
Charitable donations made by the Group in the year amounted 
to £809,000 (2005 £880,000). This excludes the cost of publicity,
often provided free of charge by the Group’s titles, and funds
raised by them, further details on which are given in the
Corporate Responsibility Report on page 33 of this Annual Report.
No political donations were made by the Group.

  DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Continued
Substantial shareholdings
As set out in Note 34, the Company has two classes of share
capital – Ordinary shares and ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares. On
22nd November, 2006 the following were interested in more than
3% of the issued Ordinary shares:
Rothermere Continuation Limited
(and other parties to an agreement which comes 
within section 204 of the Companies Act 1985) 62.8%
Codan Trust Company Ltd and Codan Trustees (BVI) Ltd 
(trustees of the Esmond Harmsworth 1998 Family 
Settlement) 29.3%
Statement of Directors’ responsibility for 
the preparation of accounts
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements. The Directors are required to
prepare accounts for the Group in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and have elected to
continue to prepare those for the Company in accordance with
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
In the case of UK GAAP accounts, the Directors are required to
prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the
profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
– make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
– state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
In the case of IFRS accounts, International Accounting Standard 1
requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial
year the Company’s financial position, financial performance and
cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects
of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with
the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities,
income and expenses set out in the International Accounting
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and
Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all
circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance
with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards.
Directors are also required to:
– select and apply accounting policies properly;
– present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information;
– provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific
requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards is
insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial
position and financial performance; and
– prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless, having
assessed the ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern, management either intends to liquidate the entity or to
cease trading, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities and for the preparation of a directors’
report and directors’ remuneration report which comply with the
requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Auditors
T o the best of the Directors’ knowledge and belief and having
made appropriate enquiries of other officers of the Company, all
information relevant to enable the auditors to provide their opinion
on the Accounts has been provided. Each of the Directors has
taken all reasonable steps in order to ensure their awareness of
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s
auditors are aware of that information.
The Company’s auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have indicated
their willingness to continue in office and, in accordance with
section 385 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution proposing
their reappointment will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held on 
7th February, 2007 at 9.00 am at the Kensington Roof Gardens, 
99 Kensington High Street, London W8. Details of all resolutions,
including those to be put as special business, are set out in the
enclosed circular to shareholders.
By Order of the Board

Secretary
22nd November, 2006
Daily Mail and General Trust plc
37 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate
governance. The paragraphs below and in the Remuneration
Report on pages 41 to 54 describe how the Board has applied
the principles set out in the Combined Code (‘the Code’) issued by
the Financial Services Authority in July 2003. The Code is part of
the listing rules and applied to the Company throughout the year .
The Company has substantially complied with the provisions of 
the Code, except where the Board has determined that they are
inappropriate to the particular circumstances of the Company,
as explained below and in the Remuneration Report.
The Board
The Company is headed by a Board which comprises a balance of
seven executive Directors, including the Chairman and Chief
Executive, and eight non-executive Directors. Biographical details
of each of the Directors are set out on page 35. The Board has been
progressively refreshed in recent years with several appointments,
including three new independent Directors.
The Board meets regularly four times a year and at such other
times as are necessary. It approves the Group’s strategy which is
proposed and executed by the executive Directors. Its specific
responsibilities are set out in a schedule of matters reserved to
the Board which is published on the Company’s website at
www.dmgt.co.uk/corporate governance.
The Board met seven times during the 2005/06 financial year, four
of which were regular meetings, attended by all Directors, except
that Mr Lowy was unable to attend three of them and Mr Dunstone
was unable to attend one of them. The other three meetings were
all special meetings, held at short notice, some of which several
non-executive Directors were unable to attend. Individual
attendance by Directors is set out below:
Number of Number of
meetings meetings attended
The Viscount Rothermere 7 7
C J F Sinclair 7 7
J P Williams 7 7
D M M Dutton 7 7
P M Dacre 7 7
P M Fallon 7 7
K J Beatty 77
J G Hemingway 7 7
S M Gray 7 7
I G Park 7 4
F P Lowy 7 1
C W Dunstone 74
F P Balsemão 7 4
T S Gillespie 7 5
D J Verey 7 6
The Board has not, as required by the Code, identified a senior
independent non-executive Director since it believes that to
identify such an individual is potentially divisive to a unitary body,
as this Board is, and disruptive to the role of the Chairman. 
The division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman 
and the Chief Executive is understood and works well, given the
individuals’ long-standing appointments, as set out on page 35.
Hence it has not needed to be set out in writing, nor agreed by 
the Board.
The Board believes that four non-executive Directors may be
considered to be independent under the Code, namely Messrs
Lowy, Dunstone, Balsemão and Verey. This represents less
than the half of the Board recommended by the Code. Although
Mr Lowy has been a non-executive Director for longer than nine
years, he has continued to demonstrate his independence in
terms of character and judgement. Being based in Sydney,
Australia, Mr Lowy finds it difficult to attend Board meetings.
However, he provides his views on Board papers for each meeting
and meets with executive Directors when he is in London or when
they are in Sydney.
Messrs Hemingway, Gray and Gillespie are not regarded by the
Board as independent under the Code because they have advised
the Company over many years; nor is Mr Park due to his having
been chairman of Northcliffe Newspapers within the last five
years. Nevertheless the Board believes that these non-executive
Directors make an important contribution to its deliberations
and have invaluable experience of the Company, its business
and its staff. 
Information and professional development
Procedures have been established to ensure that the Board
receives timely and appropriate information both for its meetings
and regularly between meetings. All Directors are offered such
training as is considered necessary, both on appointment and at
any subsequent time. There is an agreed procedure for Directors 
to take independent professional advice at the Company’s
expense, if necessary.
Election and re-election
The Company’s Articles of Association require that a Director
appointed by the Board must stand for election at the next 
Annual General Meeting. Thereafter all Directors are subject to 
re-election every three years. Under the Companies Act, a Director
is also required to stand for re-election when he first reaches the
age of 70. The Board has determined to discontinue its policy not
to seek the re-election of Directors over the age of 75 years. The
Board has chosen not to adopt the additional provision in the Code
that non-executive Directors, who have served for more than nine
years, should be subject to annual re-election since the existing
practice, which complies with Company law and with the Articles,
works well.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive
Directors are available for inspection at the Registered Office of
the Company during usual business hours.
Board evaluation
The Board has undertaken a formal and rigorous evaluation of its
own performance and that of its individual Directors. It reviewed
its performance by reference to the schedule of matters reserved
for it. The evaluation process took the form of a questionnaire
sent to each Director, seeking their views on such matters as
involvement in strategy, the structure of Board meetings, the
quality of communications, confidence in fellow Directors and
balance of skills, and consideration of views. The Chairman
reported the consensus view on performance to the Board at its
meeting in October 2006, enabling it to conclude that it had been
effective in the year under review. No substantive changes to
procedures were judged necessary.
Daily Mail and General Trust plc
38 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Continued
The non-executive Directors did not meet as a group without 
the Chairman since his performance was assessed by the
Remuneration Committee (without the Chairman being present). 
Board Committees
The Board has established Nominations, Remuneration, Audit
and Risk Committees with mandates to deal with specific aspects
of its business. The remits of these committees are published on
the Company’s website. Details of the membership of these
committees are given on page 35. Each committee reports to the
Board at every regular meeting. In October 2006, the Board carried 
out a review of the performance of its committees and concluded
that they had been effective in the year . 
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary, Mr Jennings, is responsible for advising
the Board through the Chairman on all governance issues. All
Directors have access to the advice and services of the Secretary. 
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee, which was established as a
separate committee in 2003, comprises three Directors: the
Viscount Rothermere (its chairman), Mr Hemingway and
Mr Balsemão. Only Mr Balsemão is an independent non-executive
Director, whereas the Code recommends that a majority of
members of the Committee should be independent. Nevertheless
the Board believes that the Committee operates well. The Deputy
Finance Director, Mr Perry, is secretary to the Committee.
The Chief Executive attends most meetings at the invitation of
the Committee.
The Committee met three times during the year and all meetings
were attended by all serving members.
The Committee reviews the structure, size and composition of the
Board and makes recommendations to the Board on any changes.
During the year it nominated Mr Berry as an independent 
non-executive Director . Neither external advice nor advertising
was required in this instance.
The Committee continued to review succession planning for both
executive and non-executive Directors. It has also assessed the
most appropriate method of evaluating Directors’ performance. 
Relations with shareholders
The Company maintains a regular programme of contact with
its institutional shareholders. In the past year, this has included
meetings in London, France, Scotland, and the US.
Non-executive Directors are kept informed of the views of
institutional shareholders by the regular distribution of analysts’
reports and feedback is provided from institutional meetings.
All shareholders are welcome to attend the Annual General
Meeting, of which twenty working days’ notice is given, where they
have the opportunity to speak to Directors. 
In the interests of transparency and to assist private shareholders,
the Company posts all announcements and general presentations
given to analysts and institutions on its corporate website.
Shareholders and others interested in the Group are encouraged
to use the site and to email questions which they might have to
investor .relations@ dmgt.co.uk. Questions to particular Directors
should be addressed through the Secretary.
Internal controls and management of risk
The Group adopts a prudent risk strategy, weighing opportunities
for potential gain against threats to overall business objectives
and profitability. Senior management addresses the opportunities
and uncertainties relating to the business activities of the Group.
The risk management process consists of the identification,
evaluation and control of risks, which could threaten the
achievement of the Group’s strategic, operational and financial
objectives, as well as the active management of opportunities.
The Group operates on a divisional basis with each of the divisions
described at the front of the Annual Report having considerable
autonomy as regards its operation and establishment of control
systems. Overseeing the divisional structure is a central
management responsible to the Board. Certain functions are
undertaken centrally, notably newsprint buying, insurance,
treasury, tax, pensions, and risk and assurance (including 
internal audit).
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of
internal control. This system is designed to provide reasonable
assurance of the safeguarding of assets and shareholders’
investment and the reliability of financial information. Any such
system can, however, provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance of these matters. The Directors confirm that they have
reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal
control for the period up to the date of the approval of the Accounts.
The Board has delegated responsibility for the evaluation of the
benefits and risks of investment opportunities and financing
proposals to an executive committee, the Finance Committee.
Above certain defined levels, however, the Board must approve
programmes relating to acquisition and divestment proposals and
capital expenditure. 
Whilst the ultimate responsibility for the system of internal
control and the review of its effectiveness resides with the Board,
the Risk Committee assists the Board by giving assurance on risk
management issues and processes. The process for the
management of significant risks is undertaken by the Risk
Committee and it accords with the Turnbull Guidance on internal
control, appended to the Code.
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee, which was established in 2000, comprises
Mr Sinclair, the Chief Executive (its chairman), the Viscount
Rothermere, Messrs Williams, Gray and Dutton and Mr Kass, the
legal director of the Group’s largest subsidiary. Mr Gray provides
a non-executive perspective to the review of risk management
processes within the Group, as well as providing a direct link to
the Audit Committee. The Committee met four times during the
year . During the year the Risk and Internal Audit functions were
combined into Risk and Assurance, the head of which, Mr Page,
is Secretary to the Committee.
The Risk Committee considers reports prepared by central
management, by each of the divisions of the Group and by central
functions, on a rotational basis, reviewing a division and central
function at each meeting. These reports identify business risks
for the Group as a whole and within the divisions and assess the
controls in place to manage those risks. The Committee operates
a rotational programme of presentations by the divisions on
specific risk management issues, as well as identifying topics
for consideration across the Group. This year the Committee has
focused on the following risks: IT security and the integrity of data;
fraud risk; risk from acquisitions made by the Group; treasury
risk; risk from any circulation misstatement; succession planning

Continued
to mitigate the risk from any loss of key management; and again
on business continuity and disaster recovery planning. The
Committee also monitors developments in relevant legislation
and regulations to consider the impact these might have on the
Group and on its system of internal control.
Members of the Risk Committee also maintain direct links with
each of the main divisions through attendance at divisional board
meetings as directors of these boards. The Committee reports to
the Board at each of its meetings on the results of these processes
to enable the Board to determine the overall effectiveness of the
system of internal control and risk management more widely.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, which has been in existence since 1989,
comprises four non-executive directors: Messrs Gray (its
chairman), Hemingway, Park and Verey. The Code recommends
that an audit committee should comprise at least three members,
all of whom should be independent non-executive Directors.
Only Mr Verey is considered to be independent under the Code.
Nevertheless the Board believes that the Committee operates
independently. Members’ qualifications are set out in their
biographies on page 35. The Board is satisfied that Mr Gray,
formerly senior partner of a firm of chartered accountants, has
recent and relevant financial experience. The Secretary, Mr Jennings,
a Chartered Accountant, is secretary to the Committee. 
The Audit Committee met four times during the year and all
meetings were attended by all serving members.
The Committee has implemented the procedures set out in the
Smith Guidance to the Code which are within its control. It reviews
the Group’s policy on whistle blowing. Procedures exist to monitor
the independence of the external auditors and include a policy
on employment of former audit principals. There is also a policy
on the provision of non-audit services with which the Group’s
head office and each division complies. The choice of firm is
normally determined on the basis of professional expertise and
competitiveness. The Group may engage the external auditors to
perform audit-related work, accountancy advice and corporate tax
services. Non-audit services in other areas are decided on their
merits and are put out to tender where the amounts in question
are significant. The external auditors are excluded from the
following areas: where they are auditing their own work; where
a mutuality of interest is created; or where the external auditor
would be put in the role of advocate for the Company. 
Non-audit fees payable to Deloitte & Touche LLP (‘Deloitte’) in
2006 amounted to £7.6 million, compared to £2.0 million the
previous year, reflecting the continuing extent of corporate tax
advice given and the appointment of Deloitte as lead consultant on
Northcliffe Newspapers’ cost reduction project and to undertake
vendor due diligence as part of the strategic review of that
business. 
In September, the Audit Committee carried out an annual review
of its terms of reference and of its effectiveness and concluded
that it did not need to recommend to the Board any changes to
its remit or operations. In October 2006, the Board conducted its
own review of the Committee’s performance and agreed that the
Committee had been effective in the year under review.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has responsibility for
the review of financial risk management and of internal financial
controls during the year, as these directly relate to the quality of
financial reporting. In addition, the Committee reviews a summary
of letters to management prepared by the Group’s external
auditors following their audit procedures, considers significant
financial reporting issues and approves any changes to Group
accounting policies, which are set centrally. During the year, the
Committee received reports on the implementation of international
financial reporting standards and on the requirements of the
Business Review regulations. Apart from these specific
responsibilities, the Committee is mandated to review all
announcements of results issued by the Group and to consider the
appointment of external auditors and to review their remuneration.
The central risk and assurance function carries out internal audit
activities across the Group. There is an internal audit charter
which covers the purposes and objectives of the Group’s internal
audit function, its authority and scope; independence issues;
standards of professional practice and performance monitoring;
planning and reporting; and the expectations of divisional
management. Following each review, a formal report is issued
to divisional management with the audit findings and, where
appropriate, management’s response. At each Audit Committee
meeting, the Head of Risk and Assurance reports on the internal
audit activity completed, including an overview of the work done,
a summary of the control assessments and any major issues or
findings. In September, the Committee monitored and reviewed
the resources and performance of the internal audit function,
together with its plan for the forthcoming year . It approved the plan
and confirmed that the internal audit function had been effective
in the year under review.
The Group does not maintain common detailed accounting or
operations manuals because of the diverse operations carried out
by its divisions. Where applicable, divisions maintain their own
manuals. A number of the divisions also undertake regular control
review work as part of their control process.
As a consequence of the Group’s risk management process, the
Board has taken the view that control processes in place remain
adequate.
One of the Group’s subsidiaries, Euromoney Institutional Investor
plc, is subject to the requirements of the Code in its own right. As
disclosed in its latest annual report, it has in place its own system
of internal control and risk management processes which forms
part of the Group’s overall framework of control. The joint ventures
and associates of the Group are not included in the Group’s system
of internal control described above.

40 REMUNERATION REPORT
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve
the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the
Company at which the approval will be sought for the adoption of
the Accounts. 
The Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee, which was established in 1992, 
is responsible inter alia for overall Group remuneration policy 
and for setting the remuneration, benefits and terms and
conditions of employment of the Company’s executive Directors.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the
Company’s website.
The members of the Committee are the Viscount Rothermere, its
chairman, Mr Gray and Mr Park. The Combined Code (‘the Code’)
recommends that a remuneration committee should be composed
entirely of independent non-executive directors. The Board
considers it wholly appropriate that the Viscount Rothermere, as
Chairman of the Board and as the Company’s largest shareholder,
is a member of the Committee. He does not participate in
discussions regarding his own remuneration. While Mr Gray and
Mr Park are not considered by the Board to be independent under
the Code, the Board does consider them to act independently as
regards remuneration issues. The Committee met five times
during the year and all meetings were attended by all serving
members, except Mr Gray who attended four of the five meetings.
The Finance Director, Mr Williams, is secretary to the Committee.
The Committee seeks the recommendations of the Chief
Executive, who usually attends meetings of the Committee by
invitation other than when his own remuneration is being
discussed, as regards the remuneration of the other executive
Directors and of the divisional managing directors. It also seeks
input from the Finance Director regarding financial performance
and other issues and from the Company Secretary.
The Committee makes reference, where appropriate, to pay and
employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially when
determining annual salary increases, and to external evidence
of remuneration levels in other companies, particularly in the
media field. It also makes reference to advice sought from
external advisors. During the year such advice was received
from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (‘Freshfields’) and
Independent Remuneration Solutions (‘IRS’). Freshfields,
which also provided other legal services, advised on contracts
and on age discrimination legislation. IRS provided market
data and gave advice on best practice. Freshfields and IRS
were appointed by the Committee.
In September, the Committee conducted a formal review of the
Committee’s effectiveness and concluded that it had fulfilled its
remit and been effective in the year .
Remuneration policy
The Committee seeks to structure remuneration packages on
an individual basis appropriate to the level of responsibility, but
generally designed to retain and motivate the individual. 
The Chairman is also the largest shareholder in the Company.
He has been and will continue to be a long-term shareholder . His
shareholding provides an alignment with long-term shareholders
that is not always the case in other companies. In setting his
remuneration the Committee has adopted the same policy as
for other executive Directors. In the case of Mr Fallon, the 
Committee considers that his remuneration as executive
chairman of Euromoney Institutional Investor plc (‘Euromoney’), 
a separately listed company, should be set by the remuneration
committee of that company. The report on this is set out in
Euromoney’s Annual Report.
The Committee also sets the remuneration packages for the
managing directors of the Company’s operating divisions,
other than Euromoney, and oversees the bonus arrangements
established in each division, including long-term incentive
arrangements. These are designed individually to reflect the
targets and objectives of each division. 
The Committee considers that a successful remuneration policy
needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of commercial
demands, changing market practice and shareholder expectations.
Investors will be consulted about any key issues that arise and
Ordinary shareholders will be provided with the opportunity to
endorse the Company’s remuneration policy on a regular basis
through the annual vote on the Remuneration Report. Any new
long-term incentive schemes for the executive Directors would
be submitted to shareholders.
Remuneration components
A significant proportion of the remuneration is performance-
related. Following a review of competitiveness of rewards and
business needs, the Committee decided to change the design 
of the performance-related elements for 2005/06 onwards. 
The new incentive schemes were approved by Ordinary
shareholders in February 2006.
In 2006, excluding pension entitlements, the target composition
of each executive Director’s remuneration is shown in the table
below. In preparing this table the target figure shown for bonus 
is 50% of salary; the LTIP maximum award of 50% salary p.a. and
the maximum option award of 100% salary p.a. Neither Mr Dutton
nor Mr Dacre is currently a member of a bonus plan.
Proportion of fixed versus variable pay
The main components of the remuneration package for executive
Directors are:
Variable
Fixed Bonus/ Long-term
salary profit share incentives

The Viscount Rothermere 51% 26% 23%
C J F Sinclair 61% 30% 9%
J P Williams 51% 26% 23%

P M Dacre 87% 0% 13%
P M Fallon 8% 81% 11%
(i) basic salary, reviewed annually;
(ii) where appropriate, annual performance-related bonus. 
The Viscount Rothermere, Mr Sinclair and Mr Williams are
members of the DMGT Executive Bonus Scheme (‘the Scheme’).
The Scheme was introduced in 1993 and revised in February 2006.
For 2005/06 the bonus maximum was 100% of salary with 60%
based on growth in earnings per share (EPS) by the Group and 40%
on individual performance measures. For the Chairman, 100% of
his bonus is based on EPS. A bonus was paid in respect of EPS
achievement for 2005/06. The individual performance measures 
for 2006 related to the increase in shareholder value to be

generated from the potential divestment of Northcliffe
Newspapers UK. As only Aberdeen Journals was sold, only 20%
of the maximum for this element of bonus was earned. The bonus
is paid, net of the amount required to meet the related PAYE and
employee national insurance liability, in a combination of cash and
‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares of DMGT, which must be retained
for three years. Participants are asked to specify the proportion
of the after-tax bonus which is to be applied in the form of shares
which must be at least 50%. For other executive Directors, bonuses
are paid at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee to
reward individual performance – none was awarded for 2005/06; 
(iii) share options, designed to provide a long-term incentive which
aligns their interests to those of shareholders. A new option
scheme (the 2006 Scheme) was adopted at the 2006 AGM and
subsequent awards are made under this scheme. Each award of
options has a maximum life of ten years. The maximum award limit
is 100% of salary in any year in normal circumstances and 200% of
salary in exceptional circumstances. Awards will not normally vest
until three years after the award and the performance conditions
have been met. The first condition is that the total shareholder
return (‘TSR’) of the Company must exceed that of the 250 largest
companies in the FTSE index. No part of the award will vest for
below median TSR: 12.5% of the Option vests at Median TSR; 50%
vests at upper quartile TSR and pro-rata between these points. The
second condition is growth in earnings per share (‘EPS’) – 12.5% of
the Option will vest at EPS growth of RPI +3% p.a. (nil below this);
50% will vest at RPI +5% p.a.; and pro rata between these points.
These performance conditions were chosen by the Remuneration
Committee in the light of institutional guidelines in order to
incentivise the executives to increase shareholder value. Under
the 2006 Scheme, should the performance conditions not be met,
re-testing is not permitted; and
(iv) where appropriate, a long-term incentive plan, whereby
executives are invited to commit shares in the Company at a
market price and receive a matching award. The Daily Mail and
General Trust Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was amended at
the 2006 AGM so that the maximum limit is now not more than
250% of salary over a five year period, i.e. the normal maximum
award limit is now 50% of salary annually, although in exceptional
circumstances the limit for awards to any individual is 100% of
their basic annual salary. If a participant holds the committed
shares for five years, he will be eligible to receive matching shares
on a sliding scale dependent on the total shareholder return of the
Company compared with a peer group. This new peer group was
chosen to reflect a range of listed companies in the businesses
and locations principally occupied by DMGT. Details of awards
made to executive directors and their performance conditions
are given on pages 45 and 46.
Share ownership guidelines
The Company encourages Directors to own shares in the
Company.
Executive Directors have a target shareholding of 1.5 times their
salary, to be built up over a suitable period. This target has been
exceeded by all except Mr Beatty who has only recently been
appointed to the Board. The design of the L TIP encourages executive
Directors to achieve this goal which aligns their interests with those
of shareholders. The shares held and valued at 1st October, 2006
as a multiple of salary were:

P M Dacre 1.5 1.5
K J Beatty 0.2 0.3
* in the case of Mr Fallon, shares in Euromoney are included of
which he is an executive Director .
Pensions
The Group operates a two-tier defined benefit pension scheme 
for senior employees (including most of the Company’s executive
Directors), details of which are given on page 50. It is the Company’s
policy that annual bonuses, payments under the Executive Bonus
Scheme and benefits in kind are not pensionable. Two of the
Company’s executive Directors were subject to HM Revenue &
Customs’ pensionable earnings’ cap and a funded unapproved
retirement benefits scheme was put in place for them on the
same terms as for other capped senior executives. The assets
of this scheme are held independently from the Group’s finances
and are administered by Trustees.
The Committee has reviewed in detail the impact of the pensions
tax regime operating from 6th April, 2006. It developed a new
policy, designed to be neutral in terms of cost compared to
existing expenditure on pensions. This new policy incorporates
the removal of the pensionable earnings cap for pension accruing
after 6th April, 2006.
Individual executive Directors are affected very differently by
these changes and for some it has not been tax-efficient to accrue
further pension for service from 6th April, 2006. However, it is for
individual Directors to decide when to opt out of the scheme, in
which case a cash allowance is paid. On this basis, three executive
Directors, Mr Sinclair, Mr Williams and Mr Dacre, decided to opt
out of the Group’s pension scheme with effect from 6th April, 2006.
Under the prescribed transitional arrangements, their accrued
pension at that date will remain linked to future increases in
pensionable earnings and they will continue to be eligible for
death in service benefits.
Non-executive directorships
The Company allows its executive Directors to take a very limited
number of outside directorships. Individuals retain the payments
received from such services since these appointments are not
expected to impinge on their principal employment. This does not
apply where a Group executive serves as a non-executive director
of a company because the Group has a significant interest, as in
the case of GCap Media plc. In this case, all fees are paid to the
Company. Following Mr Sinclair’s decision to step down from the
board of Reuters Group plc in December 2005, no executives hold
a non-executive directorship in a FTSE 100 company.

42 REMUNERATION REPORT
Continued
Service contracts
Contracts of service are negotiated on an individual basis as part
of the overall remuneration package and their length is inevitably
conditioned by external competitive pressures. For this reason,
the contracts of some of the executive Directors exceed the one
year recommended in the Code. The Committee believes that the
length of contract should be appropriate to the individual. Thus
where DMGT employs individuals with unique talents within the
areas of business within which it operates, the Committee
believes that they should have longer contracts. 
The Chairman and Messrs Dutton, Fallon and Beatty have
contracts of up to one year in duration. Mr Sinclair and Mr Williams
have agreed to reduce their contract length from two years to one
year over a four-year period. Mr Dacre has a rolling two-year
contract which the Committee considers wholly appropriate for
his particular responsibilities and for the industry in which he
works. The Committee differentiates between what might be
termed “corporate executives” and “media executives” whom
it wishes to tie in to the Group and to prevent from working for
competitors. Mr Dacre is a media executive, whereas Messrs
Sinclair and Williams are corporate executives, operating in
a market where one-year contracts are increasingly the norm. 
Details of these service contracts are set out below:

P M Fallon 2 June, 86 1 year Euromoney 
K J Beatty 19 May, 02 1 year Associated
* The notice periods of Messrs Sinclair and Williams reduced from
one year and six months on 26th November, 2005 and will reduce
to one year as of 26th November, 2006.
In the event of earlier termination of their contracts, each 
Director is entitled to compensation equal to their basic salary,
benefits, pension entitlement and, as appropriate, bonus or 
profit share for their notice period. In the case of Mr Sinclair, the
pension entitlement is for a two-year period, regardless of his
notice period.
The contracts of Mr Sinclair and Mr Williams are subject to
mitigation and in the event of the Director obtaining alternative
employment during the notice period do not provide for further
payment after such event. This mitigation does not apply to their
pension benefit. Share options would be treated as for any
member of the scheme, depending on the reason for termination
of the contract. Mr Sinclair is entitled, on a change of control of the
Company, to give notice under his contract within sixty days of the
change of control, and to receive compensation for basic salary
and benefits for his notice period.
Mr Fallon has a second service contract with Euromoney
Publications (Jersey) Limited (‘EP J’), a subsidiary of Euromoney
dated 4th May, 1993. This contract has the same terms as his first
contract, except that termination does not include a car allowance
as Mr Fallon does not receive this benefit from EP J. 
Non-executive Directors are appointed for specified terms and are
subject to re-election by the Ordinary shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting following appointment, and thereafter at least
every three years. Each appointment can be terminated before the
end of the three-year period, with no notice or fees due. The dates
of the appointment or subsequent re-appointment of the non-
executive Directors are set out below:

Directors retiring by rotation and standing for re-election at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting are shown in the Directors’
Report on page 36.
Non-executive Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration of non-executive Directors is determined by
the Board. Fees payable are reviewed annually, including a
comparison with the level of fees paid by other companies of
similar size and complexity; these fees are shown in the table
below. A recommendation to the Board on this subject is then
made. The basic fee as a Director was raised to £27,500 per
annum on 1st October, 2005 and an increase to £30,000 per
annum has been made with effect from 1st October, 2006.
In addition, fees are paid for membership of Board committees.
Committee fees range from £4,000 per annum to £12,500 per
annum, except that the Audit Committee chairman receives a fee
of £20,000 per annum. No increases were made for the year to
1st October, 2006; nor are they being made for the year to
30th September, 2007.

(v) Group adjusted earnings per share for the year ended
1st October, 2006 (before amortisation and impairment of
intangible assets, restructuring costs and non-recurring items)
have shown an increase in the year of 7.4% which, under the
Scheme, results in a bonus of 33.8% being earned by Lord
Rothermere and of 20.3% by the other Scheme members.
Messrs Sinclair and Williams earned a further bonus due to the
amount of shareholder value created from the strategic review
of Northcliffe, including the disposal of Aberdeen Journals.
A one-off performance bonus of £60,000 was awarded to 
Mr Dutton in the prior year .
Mr Fallon is entitled to 6.49% of the pre-tax profit earned by
Euromoney, which has a comprehensive profit sharing scheme that
links the pay of its executive directors to the profits of that group.
Mr Beatty earned a bonus, based on meeting performance
targets at Associated Newspapers.
(vi) Pension contributions are those made to money purchase
schemes as set out on page 50. 
(vii) The Viscount Rothermere, Mr Sinclair, Mr Williams and 
Mr Fallon retained fees of £18,000 (2005 £18,000), £44,000 
(2005 £71,250), £8,800 (2005 £Nil) and £36,000 (2005 £44,000)
respectively from their outside non-executive directorships.
Daily Mail and General Trust Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP, established in 2001 and revised in 2006, is designed to
align the interests of participants and shareholders by requiring
participants to make a substantial investment in the Company
as a condition to participating in the LTIP . Further, the LTIP will 
only provide rewards for participants if the Company achieves
exceptional returns for shareholders; this is achieved by
calibrating participants’ rewards by reference to the Company’s
performance against a peer group of comparable media
companies. This peer group was chosen to reflect a range of
listed companies in the businesses and locations principally
occupied by DMGT. The LTIP is supervised by the Committee and REMUNERATION REPORT
Continued
is operated in conjunction with an employee discretionary trust
(the ‘Trust’). The Trust will acquire ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting
Shares in the Company (‘shares’) to satisfy awards under the
LTIP . The Committee intends to operate the LTIP annually.
Prospective participants are invited by the Committee to agree
to commit shares in the Company to the LTIP at a market price.
Initially invitations were made in tranches over a period of two
to four years.
Individuals are given six months to make commitments in order
to allow for them to make purchases of shares, where
appropriate. Once an individual has agreed to commit shares
which are owned by him or by his close family, the Trustee of the
Trust (‘the Trustee’) decides whether to make an award of an
equal number of shares to those committed.
Awards under the LTIP have been made to six executive directors.
In 2006, each eligible Director was invited to commit shares up to
50% of his salary. Having received agreements to commit shares,
the Trustee made the awards set out in the table below.

(iii) On 1st January, 2006, the awards made in 2001 vested as
to 50%. Each participant elected to realise his award (net of
a deduction of 41% for income tax and employee national
insurance contributions), which was made on 31st March at
the prevailing share price of £6.98, and each of them retained
all of the shares awarded. This gave rise to respective gains of
£309,900, £114,100 and £323,900 by Messrs Sinclair, Williams
and Dacre which are included within amounts receivable under
long-term incentive schemes in the table of Directors’
Emoluments on page 43.
Awards under the LTIP are subject to performance conditions,
which will determine whether, and to what extent, shares under
awards will vest. The performance conditions relate to the TSR of
the Company initially over a five-year period against a peer group
of UK and overseas companies determined by the Committee.
TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid
(assuming that such dividends are reinvested in shares during
the five-year period), and is commonly adopted as a measure of
comparative performance. These performance conditions were
chosen by the Committee in order to incentivise the executives
to increase long-term shareholder value.
This comparator peer group is as follows (for awards made from 2001 to 2005)

At the end of the five-year performance period, participants
may elect either to realise their awards at that time or to extend
the performance period to seven years. If they elect to extend
the performance period, the level of committed shares must
be maintained throughout the extended period. At the end
of the seven-year performance period, the Company’s TSR
performance will be measured. The awards will be realisable

DMGT’s TSR ranking for the awards made in 2001, for which the

2005, was seventh place.
Graphs
Graphs of DMGT’s performance against each of its comparators
for each of these periods are set out on pages 49 and 50. These
graphs have been plotted using the relative rankings of each
comparator at the end of each month. As such, they are
approximations to the actual rankings under the rules, which
are calculated using a two month average for the starting point
and for each subsequent month. This may give a different result
between the graphs and the table above.
The graphs on page 48 compare the DMGT total shareholder
return with that of the FTSE 100 index and of the media index
over a period of five years, as required by the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. As a constituent of the
FTSE 100 from February 1999 to June 2006 and as a constituent
of the media index throughout the period, the Directors regard
both indices as the most appropriate indices for purposes of
comparison of the Group’s performance. Additional graphs on
page 48 illustrate performance over a twenty-year period for
which data is available.
The graphs on pages 48 to 50 are unaudited.

Notes to Directors’ pension entitlements
(i) The DMGT Senior Executives Pension Fund, of which five
executive Directors are members, has since 1st April, 2005 required
a contribution from its members. The normal retirement age under
the Fund for this group is sixty. For each Director, the accrued
entitlement at 1st October, 2006 represents the annual pension
that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, given the
length of service and salary of each Director at this date.
A spouse’s/dependant’s pension equal to two thirds of the
Director’s pension is incorporated and the Director can currently
elect to receive the pension from age fifty, subject to a discount if
retirement takes place before sixty. The pension, when in payment,
will receive annual increases in line with inflation, which may be
limited when inflation exceeds 3% per annum.
(ii) All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial
advice in accordance with ‘Retirement Benefit Schemes – Transfer
Values (GN11)’ published by the Institute of Actuaries and the
Faculty of Actuaries. The transfer values of the accrued entitlement
represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need
to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the
scheme’s liability in respect of the Directors’ pension benefits. 
(iii) The Viscount Rothermere and Mr Beatty were subject to
HM Revenue & Customs’ pensionable earnings cap. To mitigate the
impact of this pension restriction, the Company formulated a policy
under which assets are held under trust and invested in a funded
unapproved retirement benefits scheme. During the year, £52,926
(2005 £99,750) was paid into a trust on behalf of the Viscount
Rothermere and £48,798 (2005 £82,741) on behalf of Mr Beatty.
In the case of Mr Beatty, the payment made this year covered the
period to 5th April, 2006 and that in the prior year the period after
his appointment to the Board on 1st December, 2004.
(iv) Mr Fallon waived profit share in respect of the current year and
of future years of £700,000 (2005 £138,800). Mr Fallon’s pension
benefit in the above table relates to a deferred pension in the Mail
Newspapers Pension Scheme for pensionable service between
1st April, 1978 and 1st April, 1986. Neither the Group nor Mr Fallon
continues to make any contributions to this scheme.
(v) The Company does not make any pension contributions on
behalf of Mr Dutton.

54 REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Daily Mail 
and General Trust plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of Daily Mail
and General Trust plc for the year ended 1st October, 2006 which
comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated
balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, the
consolidated statement of recognised income and expenses and 
the related notes 1 to 42. These Group financial statements have
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We
have also audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration
report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the individual Company financial
statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc for the year ended 
1st October, 2006. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the
Directors’ remuneration report and the Group financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use in the European
Union are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been
audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and
regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial
statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with the relevant
financial reporting framework, and whether the Group financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report
described as having been audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation. We report to you whether in our opinion the information
given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the Group financial
statements. We also report to you if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Director’s transactions with
the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not
complied with any of the four directors’ remuneration disclosure
requirements specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority. These comprise the amount of each
element in the remuneration package and information on share
options, details of long-term incentive schemes, and money
purchase and defined benefit schemes. We give a statement, 
to the extent possible, of details of any non-compliance.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board’s statement on internal
control covers all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its
risk and control procedures.
We read the Directors’ report and the other information contained 
in the annual report for the above year as described in the contents
section including the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration
report and we consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the Group financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as
having been audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Group financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited
are free from material misstatement whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union, 
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 1st October, 2006 and of its
profit for the year then ended; 
the Group financial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
Group financial statements. 
Separate opinion in relation to IFRS
As explained in Note 1 of the Group financial statements, the Group,
in addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with
IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union, has also complied
with the IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board. Accordingly, in our opinion the financial statements give a
true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 1st October, 2006 and of its profit for the year
then ended.

1 Basis of preparation
DMGT plc has historically prepared its audited annual financial
statements in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting
practice (UK GAAP). Following European regulation issued in 2002,
the Group now presents its report and consolidated accounts in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union and therefore 
in compliance with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation).
The significant accounting policies used in preparing this
information are set out in note 2. 
First time adoption of IFRS
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to
take some exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS and also
to make certain elections in the transition period. The exemptions
and elections adopted by the Group are as follows:
Business combinations IFRS 3
The Group has elected not to adopt IFRS 3 retrospectively to
business combinations. As a result, in the opening balance sheet,
goodwill from past business combinations amounting to £621.2
million remains as stated under UK GAAP as at 3rd October, 2004.
Cumulative translation differences 
The Group has elected not to recalculate the movement arising 
on the retranslation of the overseas operations at the date of
transition. The gain or loss on the subsequent disposal of an
overseas operation will only take account of translation gains or
losses that arose subsequent to the date of transition.
Employee benefits IAS 19 
The Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains
and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes at the date of
transition.
Share-based payments IFRS 2 
The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 to all relevant share based
payment transactions granted after 7th November, 2002 but not
fully vested as at 1st January, 2005.
Joint ventures 
The Group has elected to continue to equity account for its
investments in joint ventures and not adopt a proportional
consolidation approach.
Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation IAS 32 and
Financial instruments: recognition and measurement IAS 39 
IAS 32 and IAS 39 have been adopted as of 3rd October, 2005
and thus, as permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has not restated
comparatives to comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39. Commencing 
on this date, the Group applies hedge accounting where the
requirements of IAS 39 are met.
Impact of new IFRS 
Financial instruments: disclosures IFRS 7 
IFRS 7, which comes into effect from 1st January, 2007 introduces
new disclosures of qualitative and quantitative information about
exposure to risks arising from financial instruments, including
specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and
market risk. IFRS 7 also makes consequential amendment to IAS 1
in respect of capital disclosure. The Group will be adopting the
standard for the period beginning on 2nd October, 2006.
Summary of differences between UK GAAP and IFRS 
Summary of differences between UK GAAP and IFRS for the
transition period, 3rd October, 2004 and prior year are provided
in note 42.
2 Significant accounting policies 
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries together 
with the Group’s share of all of its interests in joint ventures and
associates. The financial statements have been prepared on the
historical basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties
and financial instruments.
Accounting for subsidiaries 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control is achieved
where the Group has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its
activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year
are included in the income statement from the effective date of
acquisition or up to the date of disposal, as appropriate. Where
necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of
subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those
used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are
eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests 
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries 
are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Minority
interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the
original business combination and the minority’s share of changes
in equity since the date of the combination. Losses attributable to
the minority in excess of the minority’s share in equity are allocated
against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the
minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional
investment to cover such losses. When the subsidiary subsequently
reports profits, the minority does not participate until the Group
has recovered all of the losses of the minority it previously reported.
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase
method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the aggregate
of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group
in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly
attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are
recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is recognised as an asset and
initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
recognised.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially
measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of the
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.

2 Significant accounting policies continued
Interests in joint ventures and associates
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group
and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject 
to joint control, that is when the strategic financial and operating
policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous
consent of the parties sharing control.
As associate is an entity over which the Group has significant
influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint
venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is 
not control or joint control over those policies.
The post tax results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures and
associates are incorporated in the Group’s results using the equity
method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in
joint ventures and associates are carried in the consolidated
balance sheet at a cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture and
associates, less any impairment in the value of investment. Losses
of joint ventures and associates in excess of the Group’s interest in
that joint venture or associate are not recognised. Additional losses
are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that
the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made
payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities of the joint venture or associate recognised at the date 
of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included
within the carrying amount of the investment.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the
excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses.
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested annually for
impairment.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in
the income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of
the profit or loss recognised in the income statement on disposal.
Goodwill arising before the date of transition to IFRS, on 
4th October, 2004, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP
amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 
has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Licences
Radio licences are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line
basis over the estimated useful lives from the commencement of
service of the network, estimated by management to be 20 years.
Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the
costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives, being
three to five years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable
and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that
are expected to generate economic benefits exceeding costs and
directly attributable overheads are capitalised as intangibles.
Computer software which is integral to a related item of hardware
equipment is accounted for as property, plant and equipment.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software
programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate
cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite
useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there 
is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in
the period in which it is incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s
development activity is recognised only if all of the following
conditions are met:
– an asset created can be separately identified;
– it is probable that the asset created will generate future 
economic benefits; and 
– the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Where 
no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised,
development expenditure is charged to the income statement 
in the period in which it incurred.
Marketing costs
Marketing and promotional costs are charged to the income
statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets with finite lives are stated at cost less
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the intangible assets from the date they
become available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Publishing rights, titles and exhibitions 20 years
Radio licences 20 years
Brands 20 years
Market and customer related data bases 3 – 20 years
Computer software 3 – 5 years

2 Significant accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings held for use are stated in the balance sheet
at their cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses, adjusted for
revaluations of certain properties as at 30th September, 1994.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less 
any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation of these assets
commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
No interest is capitalised into assets in the course of construction.
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their
expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or,
where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item
of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset
and is recognised in the income statement.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation 
of assets, other than property, plant and equipment under
construction using the straight-line method, over their estimated
useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 50 years
Short leasehold premises the term of the lease
Plant and equipment 3 – 25 years
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses. Impairment is reviewed either annually or more frequently
if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible decline in
the carrying value.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows,
known as cash-generating units. If the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit,
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets
of the unit, pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
asset in the unit but subject to not reducing any asset below its
recoverable amount. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill
is not reversed in a subsequent period.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-
generating unit.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct
labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in
bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Pre-publication costs
Pre-publication costs represent direct costs incurred in the
developmentoftitlespriortotheirpublication.Thesecostsarecarried
forward in work in progress where the title will generate probable
future economic benefits and costs that can be measured reliably .
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash, short-term deposits 
and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the Group cash
flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above,
net of bank overdrafts.
Revenue
Group revenue comprises revenue of the Company and its
subsidiary undertakings. Revenue is stated net of value added 
tax, trade discounts and commission where applicable and is
recognised using several methods. Subscriptions revenue is
recognised over the period of the subscription or contract.
Publishing and circulation revenue is recognised on issue of 
the publication or report. Advertising is recognised on issue of
publication, over the period of the on line campaign or date of
broadcast. Contract printing is recognised on completion of the
print contract. Exhibitions, Training and Events revenues are
recognised over the period of the event. Education revenue is
recognised over the period of the course. Information services
revenue is recognised over the period of the subscription contract. 
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
of the asset to the lessee. All other leases are classified as
operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the
Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at
the present value of the minimum lease payments as determined
at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor
is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction
of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are
recognised in the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income
statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant
lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into
an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the
lease term.
Dividends
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Dividends are recognised as a distribution in the period in which
they are approved by the shareholders. Interim dividends are
recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements,
the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other
than sterling are expressed in sterling using exchange rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items
and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates for the
period and exchange differences arising are recognised directly in
equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount
recognised in equity relating to that operation is recognised in the
income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Daily Mail and General Trust plc
62 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT
Continued
2 Significant accounting policies continued
The Group records foreign exchange differences arising on
retranslation of foreign operations within the translation reserve
in equity.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities,
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional
currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date
of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary items
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing on the
date when fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items,
and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the
income statement for the period. 
Goodwill, intangible assets and fair value adjustments arising on
the acquisition of foreign operations are treated as part of the
assets and liabilities of the foreign operation except for those
arising pre-transition to IFRS and translated at the closing rate.
In respect of all foreign operations, any cumulative exchange
differences that have arisen before 4th October, 2004, the date of
transition to IFRS, are reset to nil and will be excluded from the
determination of any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the
period in which they are incurred. Debt issue costs are amortised
over the lives of the debts. Finance charges including premiums
paid on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs and
discounts related to borrowings are accounted for on an accruals
basis to the income statement using the effective interest method.
Retirement benefits
As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has elected to recognise
all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in the pension schemes
operated by the Group at the date of transition to IFRSs. Actuarial
gains and losses arising following the date of transition are
recognised in the period in which they arise in the statement of
recognised income and expense (SORIE). Pension scheme assets
are measured at market value at the balance sheet date. Scheme
liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit method 
and discounted at a rate reflecting current yields on high quality
corporate bonds having regard to the duration of the liability
profiles of the schemes.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the
fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan
liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the balance sheet.
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are taken to the
statement of recognised income and expense. For this purpose,
actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes 
in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising
because of differences between the previous actuarial
assumptions and what has actually occurred. For defined benefit
schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the
projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being
carried out at each balance sheet date.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in 
the income statement, including the current service cost, any past
service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements. The
interest cost less the expected return on assets is also charged 
to the income statement. The amount charged to the income
statement in respect of these plans is included within operating
costs or in the Group’s share of the results of equity accounted
operations as appropriate.
The values attributed to the plan liabilities are assessed in
accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
Since the assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit plans
cannot be allocated to individual entities on a fair and reasonable
basis, the scheme’s assets and liabilities are not attributed to
reporting segments and the pension charge in each segment
represents the contributions payable for the period.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans
are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable
and deferred tax for the year .
The current tax payable or recoverable is based on the taxable profit
for the year . Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the
income statement because some items of income or expense are
taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using
the UK and foreign tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the
future arising from temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable
profit. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary
differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the
initial recognition other than in a business combination of other
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the
taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary
differences arising in investments in subsidiaries and associates,
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to
controlthereversalofthetemporarydifferenceanditisprobablethat
thetemporarydifferencewillnotreverseintheforeseeablefuture.
Goodwill arising on business combinations also includes amounts
corresponding to deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of
acquired intangible assets. A deferred tax liability is recognised to
the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes
exceeds the value of those assets for tax purposes and will form
part of the associated goodwill on acquisition.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all
or part of the asset to be recovered.
Daily Mail and General Trust plc
63 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT
Continued
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised,
based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the balance sheet date, and is not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by
the same taxation authority or on the same taxable entity or on
different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
T ax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case
the tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial
instruments, are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when
the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.
Under IFRS 1, the Group has taken the option to defer the
implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39 to the year ended 1st October,
2006. Therefore financial instruments for the year ended
2nd October, 2005 have not been restated and are accounted for
and presented in accordance with previous UK GAAP .
UK GAAP – Accounting policies for financial instruments
Under UK GAAP, the Group used various derivative financial
instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and
interest rate risks. These included currency swaps, forward foreign
currency contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and
interest rate floors. The Group considered its derivative financial
instruments to be hedges and matches them with the relevant
hedged item. Cash flows relating to these derivative financial
transactions were netted against hedged transactions in the cash
flow statement within net cash inflow from operating activities,
or returns on investment and servicing of finance, or disclosed
within financing, as appropriate.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts or cross currency
swaps are used to hedge borrowings, the borrowings hedged are
translated at the year end at the exchange rate implicit within the
respective derivative. Any exchange differences arising are taken 
to the profit and loss account to match the accounting treatment 
of exchange gains or losses on the borrowings.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge
future revenues or costs, the gain or loss is not recognised until
the revenues arise or the costs are incurred.
Payments or receipts on interest rate swaps, caps or floors were
accrued within net finance costs. Arrangement fees on bonds were
amortised over the estimated life of the bonds.
IFRS – Accounting policies for financial instruments
The following accounting policies were applied by the Group from
implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39 at 3rd October, 2005.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their
nominal value.
The Group has no significant long-term trade receivables or trade
payables. 
Available for sale investments
Investments and financial assets are recognised and 
de-recognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an
investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of 
the investment within the time frame established by the market
concerned, and are measured at fair value, including 
transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either held-for-trading or available-
for-sale. Where securities are held-for-trading purposes, gains
and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net
profit or loss for the period. For available-for-sale investments,
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised
directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined
to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously
recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the
period. The fair value of listed securities is determined based on
quoted market prices, and of unlisted securities on management’s
estimate of fair value determined by discounting future cash flows
to net present value using market interest rates prevailing at the
year end.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, short-term
deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments

Capital market and bank borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at 
fair value (which is equal to net proceeds at inception), and are
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective
interest rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged
item in a fair value hedge. Any difference between the proceeds,
net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of
borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes
in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies,
which are set out on pages 30 and 31 of the Financial and Treasury
Review and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide
written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with
the Group’s risk management strategy. The Group does not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
Daily Mail and General Trust plc
64 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT
Continued
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value
and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting
date. The fair value is determined by using market data and the use
of established estimation techniques such as discounted cashflow
and option valuation models. The Group designates certain
derivatives as:
(i) Hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and
liabilities (“fair value hedges”); or
(ii) Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (“cash flow
hedges”); or
(iii) Hedges of net investment in foreign operations (“net investment
hedges”)
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and
qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement,
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or
liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The effective
portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are
designated and qualify as net investment hedges or cash flow
hedges are recognised in equity. T o qualify for hedge accounting,
the hedging relationship must be expected to be effective, be
designated and documented at its inception and throughout 
the life of the hedge relationship.
When the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, hedge
accounting is discontinued. The net cumulative gain or loss
recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the 
period when the net investment is sold or when the hedged cash
flow is no longer expected to occur .
Fair value hedges
The Group’s policy is to use derivative instruments (primarily
interest rate swaps) to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to
floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk with changes
in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation
as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the
Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present
value where the effect is material.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting
conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the
grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the
Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and
adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a binomial pricing model which is
calibrated using a Black-Scholes framework. The expected life
used in the models has been adjusted, based on management’s
best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise
restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based
Payments to all equity instruments granted but not fully vested at
4th October, 2004 the date of transition to IFRS. In accordance with
the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of
equity instruments after 7th November, 2002.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
In addition to the judgement taken by management in selecting 
and applying the accounting policies set out above, management
has made the following judgements that have the effect on the
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
Acquisitions
The Group’s accounting policy on the acquisition of subsidiaries 
is to allocate purchase consideration over the net fair value of
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired
with any excess consideration representing goodwill. In
determining the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities acquired the use of significant estimates and
assumptions, including assumptions with respect to cash flows
and unprovided liabilities and commitments, particularly 
in respect to tax, is often involved.
Acquisition option commitments 
The Group is party to a number of put and call options over the
remaining minority interests in some of its subsidiaries. IAS 39
requires the discounted present value of these acquisition option
commitments to be recognised as a liability on the balance sheet
with a corresponding decrease in reserves. The discounts are
unwound as a notional interest charge to the income statement.
Key areas of judgement in calculating the discounted present value
of the options are the expected future cash flows and earnings of
the business, the period remaining until the option is exercised and
the discount rate. At 1st October, 2006 the discounted present
value of these acquisition option commitments is £32.7 million.

2 Significant accounting policies continued
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units 
to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise
from the cash generating unit and compare the net present value of these cash flows using a suitable discount rate to determine if any
impairment has occurred. A key area of judgement is deciding the long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and the discount
rate applied to those cash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets at the balance sheet date was £1,124.9 million
after an impairment loss of £59.1 million recognised during the year .
Operating profit 
The Group discloses as operating profit, profit before investment revenue, other gains and losses and finance costs.
Adjusted profits and exceptional items 
The Group presents adjusted earnings by making adjustments for costs and revenues which management believe to be exceptional in
nature by virtue of their size or incidence and by adding back amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
Share-based payments 
The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date
of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. The key assumptions used in
calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Group’s share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and
expected option lives; these are set out in note 38. Management regularly perform a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that
are expected to vest, this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
Taxation
Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a highly complex tax structure which makes
the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and is
often dependent on the efficiency of legal processes. Such issues can take several years to resolve. The Group however takes a prudent
view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that the eventual resolution could differ
significantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Group’s results and future cash flows. 
3 Segmental information

Operating profit before exceptional operating costs and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets within the national
newspapers division comprised £83.6 million from newspapers, £13.2 million from digital and £0.2 million from television.
Operating profit before exceptional operating costs and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets within the business
to business information and careers division comprised £68.0 million from business to business information and £4.1 million from Study
Group offset by unallocated central costs of £4.1 million.
Included within unallocated central costs is a credit of £1.8 million which adjusts the pensions charge recorded in each operating segment
from a cash rate to actuarial accrual rate in accordance with IAS 19.
The Group’s exceptional operating costs comprised regional newspapers and related activities restructuring and strategic review costs
totalling £31.9 million, together with reorganisation costs of £5.8 million within national newspapers and related activities, £0.6 million in
business to business information and careers and £2.8 million within exhibitions and related activities.
If all acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, contribution to Group revenues for the year would have been
£73.0 million and contribution to Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £10.3 million. This information
takes into account the amortisation of acquired intangible assets for a full year, together with related income tax effects but excludes any
pre-acquisition finance costs and should not be viewed as indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if the
acquisitions had actually been completed on the first day of the financial year .

T ax equalisation swap income includes £27.0 million (2005 £8.7 million) of income from hedges of tax on intra-group financing, of which
£17.1 million (2005 loss £2.2 million) is in relation to foreign exchange gains. This foreign exchange element is equal to tax payable on the
gains on the intra-group financing (see note 9). Exchange losses on intra-group financing are £1.5 million (2005 £Nil).
The finance charge on the discounting of deferred consideration arose from the requirement under IFRS 3 Business Combinations to
discount deferred consideration back to current values.

Current tax of £0.3 million (2005 credit £4.8 million) was charged directly to equity.
The tax charge for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% (2005 30%). The differences are
explained below:

Profit on ordinary activities before tax 311.5 195.3

Prior year tax charge 14.3 9.1 
Other – 1.5 
Total tax charge on the profit for the year (60.0) (39.9)
The underlying tax on profits before amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and non recurring items amounted 
to £62.0 million (2005 £52.4 million) and the resulting rate is 23.9% (2005 22.1%). There was a tax credit of £2.0 million (2005 £12.5 million)
relating to exceptional and non recurring items in the current and prior years. This included a credit of £14.0 million (2005 £2.3 million)
following the agreement of certain prior year open issues with the UK HM Revenue and Customs, a credit of £Nil (2005 £1.5 million) in
respect of reduced provisions for certain prior year open issues and a charge of £20.9 million (2005 £2.2 million) in respect of tax on foreign
exchange gains, a credit of £8.4 million on amortisation (2005 £6.1 million), a credit of £1.2 million (2005 £Nil) on fixed asset write downs,
a credit of £7.4 million (2005 £4.2 million) on operating costs and a charge of £8.1 million (2005 £Nil) on the sale of subsidiaries.
The net prior year credit of £14.3 million (2005 £9.1 million) arose largely from the agreement of certain prior year open issues with the UK
HM Revenue and Customs and a reassessment of the level of tax provisions required.
A charge of £17.1 million (2005 credit £2.2 million) relating to tax on foreign exchange gains has been treated as exceptional as it is hedged
by foreign exchange gains of £17.1 million (2005 loss £2.2 million) on tax equalisation swaps included within finance costs (see note 8).

£35.3 million of shareholders’ funds which has not been recognised in these financial statements. It will be paid on 9th February, 2007 
to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 1st December, 2006.
11 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share of 60.8p (2005 35.9p) are calculated, in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share, on Group profit for the financial
year of £239.8 million (2005 £142.1 million) and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, as set out below.
As in previous years, adjusted earnings per share have also been disclosed since the Directors consider that this alternative measure 
gives a more comparable indication of the Group’s underlying trading performance. Adjusted earnings per share of 46.4p (2005 43.2p) 
are calculated on profit before exceptional operating costs, amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, after charging
the taxation and minority interests associated with those profits, of £182.9 million (2005 £171.0 million), as set out in Note 12 below, and on

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill might be impaired. 
The impairment recognised for the year was £35.1 million (2005 £2.7 million). Of the impairment for the year, £15.4 million relates 
to the exhibition division following a downturn in the consumer and gift markets it serves and £19.2 million relating to the national 
newspapers division.
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amounts for all the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) are measured at their value
in use by discounting future expected cash flows. These calculations use cash flow projections based on management approved
budgets and forecasts in the case of businesses acquired in the year, the cash flow projections are consistent with the business
acquisition plans. Cash flows beyond the initial five-year period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate. The cash flows are
discounted at the Group’s weighted current cost of capital adjusted for the particular risks associated with each CGU. 
These assumptions have been used for all CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability relating to the distribution of the Group’s products
in new and existing markets and anticipated operating synergies from the business combinations.

Intangible assets all have a finite life and are being amortised over their useful lives. Each year, the Group reviews the
appropriateness of its intangible assets. The Group tests intangible fixed assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if 
there are indicators that intangible fixed assets might be impaired. The impairment recognised for the year was £24.1 million 
(2005 £2.6 million). Of the impairment for the year, £22.4 million relates to write down of radio licences following a softening of the
markets they serve, £1.0 million relating to the national newspapers division and £0.8 million relating to the exhibitions division
following a downturn in the consumer and gift markets they serve. The Group is satisfied that the carrying value at 1st October, 2006
remains recoverable in full.
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amounts for all the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) are measured at their value
in use by discounting future expected cash flows. These calculations use cash flow projections based on management approved
budgets and forecasts in the case of businesses acquired in the year, the cash flow projections are consistent with the business
acquisition plans. Cash flows beyond the initial five-year period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate. The cash flows are
discounted at the Group’s weighted current cost of capital adjusted for the particular risks associated with each CGU.

assets unless they are expected to be sold within one year, in which case they are recorded as current assets. The investments in
listed securities have no fixed maturity or coupon rate and the fair value of these investments is based on quoted market prices. 
Since there is no active market upon which they are traded, unlisted equity securities are recorded at cost, as their fair values cannot
be reliably measured.

The Group is party to a number of put options over the remaining minority and majority interests in its subsidiaries, joint ventures,
associates and investments. IAS 39 Financial Instruments requires the recognition of acquisition liabilities. The Group has taken
advantage of the transitional rules available under IAS 39 and hence the adoption of IAS 39 has no impact on accounting for financial
derivatives for 2005. The effective date of adoption of IAS 39 is 3rd October 2005, the discounted present value of these options is £32.7
million (2005 £20.1 million). From 3rd October, 2005 onwards these discounts are unwound as a notional interest charge to the
income statement.

Leases over five years are repaid by instalments. The interest rate on finance leases was approximately 8% (2005 8%).
The Group has issued loan notes which attract interest at rates of approximately LIBID to LIBID minus 1%. The loan notes are
repayable at the option of the loan note holder .
The Group’s bonds have been adjusted from their nominal values to offset the premia paid on settlement or redemption, direct issue
costs and discounts. The issue costs are being amortised over the expected lives of the bonds. The unamortised issue costs amount to
£3.2 million (2005 £3.5 million).
A proportion of the Group’s bonds are hedged using fixed to floating swaps. The element of the bonds which have been swapped have
been marked to market with changes in mark to market valuation being included within the income statement, offset by changes in
the mark to market valuation of the associated derivative.
The Group’s bank loans are denominated in US dollars, Australian dollars and sterling. The interest rates on these borrowings

Market risk
The Group’s primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements. Derivatives are used to hedge or
reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist. Derivatives used by
the Group for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate options and forward foreign exchange contracts set out below represent the
replacement costs calculated using market rates of interest and exchange at 1st October, 2006. The fair value of long-term
borrowings has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at market rates.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the consolidated businesses to changes
in interest rates.
The following sensitivity analysis of borrowings and derivative financial instruments to interest rate movements assumes an
immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates for all currencies and maturities from their levels at 1st October, 2006, with all
other variables held constant. The range of changes represents the Group’s view of the changes that are reasonably possible over 
a one-year period based on these assumptions.
At 1st October, 2006, the majority of net borrowings are either fixed rate or have been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps 
and options. A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net interest expense of £1.2 million,
based on the composition of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and other long-term borrowings 
at 1st October, 2006. A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net interest expense of £1.2
million. The sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments at 1st October, 2006 to changes in interest rates is set out in the 
table below.

Short-term borrowings comprise bank loans, overdrafts, finance lease and deferred consideration. Long-term borrowings comprise
bank loans, bonds, finance lease and deferred consideration.
Foreign exchange rate risk
Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in countries with currencies other than those of
each of the parent companies, most particularly in respect of the US businesses. These exposures are hedged, to a significant extent,
by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars.
The following sensitivity analysis of net borrowings and derivative financial instruments to foreign exchange rate movements
assumes an immediate 10% change in all foreign exchange rates against sterling as appropriate from their levels at 1st October,
2006, with all other variables held constant. A +10% change indicates a strengthening of the currency against sterling and a -10%
change indicates a weakening of the currency against sterling. The range of changes represents the Group’s view of the changes 
that are reasonably possible over a one-year period based on these assumptions.

Credit risk
The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a 
result has a credit risk from the potential non performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are
unsecured. The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being
hedged. The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents. Credit
risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment
banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and of the amounts outstanding with each of them.
The Group has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow
significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AAA by Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s or Fitch.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be as follows:
2006 2005

Hedge accounting
The hedging relationships that are designated under IAS 39 Financial Instruments, effective from 3rd October, 2005 are described
below:
Fair value hedges
The Group’s policy is to use derivative instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to
floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income
statement for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge
is effective.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings due to
interest rate movements which could affect the income statement.
Interest rate derivatives with a principal amount of £75.0 million were in place at 1st October, 2006 swapping fixed rate term sterling
debt issues to floating rate sterling. All fair value hedges were effective throughout the year ended 1st October, 2006.
The gains and losses on the borrowings and related derivatives designated as fair value hedges included in the income statement for
the year ended 1st October, 2006 were:

2005 gain/(loss) gain/(loss) 2006
£m £m £m £m
Sterling interest rate swaps – (2.3) – (2.3)
Sterling debt – 2.3 – 2.3
Total ––– –
Cash flow hedges
The group enters into two types of cash flow hedge: fixed to fixed cross currency interest rate swaps and forward currency
sales/purchases which hedge tax payable/receivable when long-term intercompany non-trading balances are revalued and foreign
exchange derivatives which fix the exchange rate on a portion of future currency expenditure.
All cash flow hedges were effective throughout the year ended 1st October, 2006.
The deferred gain on cash flow hedges at 1st October, 2006 amounted to £0.1 million and is expected to be recognised in the income
statement in the year ending 30th September, 2007.
Net investment hedges
The Group enters into net investment hedge to hedge the Group’s investment in foreign operations.
All cash flow hedges were effective throughout the year ended 1st October, 2006.

31 Post-employment benefits
The Group operates a number of pension schemes covering most major UK group companies under which contributions are paid by
the employer and employees. 
The schemes for most employees are funded defined benefit pension arrangements, providing service-related benefits, based on
final pensionable salary. In addition, a number of defined contribution pension plans are operated by certain divisions of the Group
where this type of pension provision aligns with the business model. The assets of all the schemes are held independently from the
Group’s finances and in the UK are administered by trustees or trustee companies. 
Since the last year-end, and in the light of very recent case law, legal advice received is that the DMGT AVC Plan, a plan established to
enable members of the main defined benefit schemes of the Group to make additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) to enhance their
pension benefits, should be categorised as a defined benefit arrangement. It has therefore been included in the pension disclosures
for the first time. The inclusion of this Plan has increased the defined benefit obligation to the Group by £62.1 million as at 1st October,
2006 (2005 £63.2 million). The assets of the Plan as at 1st October, 2006 were £65.7 million, producing a surplus of £3.6 million (2005
deficit £0.1million). 
However, as indicated in the disclosures below, an adjustment has been made for 2006 to cap the value of assets in the Plan since the
surplus is not recoverable by the Group. Thus, the net value of the Plan in the Group balance sheet is zero. These adjustments are
reflected in the reconciliation of the Group’s overall pension assets and liabilities, and in the statement of recognised income and
expense (SORIE). The inclusion of the Plan has had no impact on the pension cost reported in these financial statements.
The total net pension costs of the Group for the year ended 1st October, 2006 were £34.4 million (2005 £41.8 million).
Aberdeen Journals
The sale by the Group of Aberdeen Journals Limited on 2nd April, 2006 crystallised from a pensions viewpoint on 30th September, 
2006 following a period of continued participation by employees of that company in the Group’s pension scheme. The pension
implications of this sale whereby an option has been given to employees to transfer their benefits to the purchaser’s pension
arrangements has been taken into account in the figures below. The sale triggers a payment to the defined benefit schemes to deal
with the debt arising under Section 75 of the Pensions Act 2004. The actual amount to be paid has yet to be finalised, but is expected
to be in the region of £25.9 million.
Defined benefit schemes
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially by the actuary using the projected unit credit method. The figures in this note are
based on the calculations in connection with the valuation of the main schemes as at 31st March, 2004, and updated to 1st October,
2006 by the actuary.
The company cash contribution rate to the main schemes during the year was 18% of pensionable salaries (2005 18%).
The main schemes have a two-tiered benefit structure represented by a “Standard” section and a “Pension +” section. In the
“Standard” section, employees pay contributions of 5% of pensionable salaries and have benefits based on a normal retirement age 
of 65. Under the “Pension +” section, employees currently pay contributions of 7%, rising to 7.5% on 1st July, 2007 and enjoy a higher
benefit accrual rate and lower normal retirement age than in the “Standard” section. The schemes remain open to eligible new
employees who, after one year’s service, can join the “Standard” section with an option to join the “Pension +” section after a further
four years’ service.

The assumption for the expected overall rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected returns for each asset class
based on the proportion of assets held in each class at the beginning of the year . The expected return on bonds has been selected
having regard to gross redemption yields at the start of the year . The expected returns on equities and property are based on a
combination of estimated risk premiums over Government bond yields, the gross redemption yields on bonds, and consensus
economic forecasts for future returns.
The actual return on plan assets was £185.1 million (2005 £255.2 million) representing the expected return plus the associated
actuarial gain or loss during the year .
The size of the pension deficit is sensitive to the assumptions adopted. The main financial assumptions are shown in the 
following table:
2006 2005
% %
Price inflation 2.90 2.75
Salary increases 4.40 4.30
Pension increases 2.90 2.75
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.00 5.00
Expected overall rate of return on assets 6.90 7.20
The discount rate for scheme liabilities reflects yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds. All assumptions
were selected after taking actuarial advice. Based on the reported liabilities at 1st October, 2006, a movement of 0.1% in the discount
rate would represent a change in the value of those liabilities of approximately £30.3 million (before associated deferred tax).
The mortality assumptions adopted reflect the mortality experience of the schemes and a best estimate of future average life
expectancies and are shown in the following table:
2006
Future life expectancy from age 60 (years)
For a current 60 year old male member of the scheme 23
For a current 60 year old female member of the scheme 26.5
For a current 50 year old male member of the scheme 24.5
For a current 50 year old female member of the scheme 28
The above mortality assumptions will be reviewed again as part of the next formal valuation of the principal schemes as at 31st March,
2007. At the same time an adjustment to reflect the extent to which retiring employees commute part of their pension for cash will be
considered. As no allowance is currently made for commutation, such adjustment would serve to offset to some extent any increase in
liabilities next year if it is agreed that stronger mortality assumptions are justified.
The amounts charged to the income statement based on the above assumptions are shown in the following table:
2006 2005
£m £m
Service cost 50.0 48.6
Interest cost 85.9 81.5

31 Post-employment benefits continued
The Group expects to contribute approximately £52.8 million to the schemes during the 2007 financial year, including £25.9 million
which relates to the section 75 debt arising from the sale of Aberdeen Journals Limited.
Included in scheme assets is an advance payment into the Group’s pension schemes amounting to £23.6 million in respect of the 2007 
contributions (2005 £32.3 million). A special funding payment of £2.5 million was made prior to the year-end relating to a commitment
given by the Group when agreeing the terms of merger of two of its schemes with effect from 30th September, 2005.
UK Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans. These are principally trust-based arrangements currently, 
with an aggregate value of £26.0 million at the year end. Recent acquisitions of businesses outside the newspaper divisions mean
that a higher portion of the Group’s employees will be offered defined contribution arrangements in future.
The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounted to £5.2 million (2005 £6.0 million).
Overseas pension plans
Overseas subsidiaries of certain Group divisions operate defined contribution retirement benefit plans, primarily in North America
and Australia. The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounts to £2.4 million (2005 £1.8 million).
Pension arrangements for executives
The Group operates a two-tier, defined benefit pension scheme for senior executives (including executive Directors), details of which
are incorporated in the above disclosures. On 1st April, 2005, this became a contributory scheme. It is the Group’s policy that annual
bonuses, payments under the Executive Bonus Scheme and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Included in UK Defined Contribution Plans above are investments in a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for certain
executives of the Group including two executive Directors who were subject to the pensionable earnings cap imposed by HM Revenue
and Customs under the previous tax regime. The assets of this scheme are held under individual trusts independently from the
Group’s finances; investment during the year totalled £0.2 million (2005 £1.1 million). The Group has terminated its investment in
this scheme with effect from 5th April, 2006, to coincide with the tax changes introduced from that date.
Stakeholder pension
DMGT provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for the other pension schemes
operated by the Group.

The deferred tax assets disclosed in the balance sheet in respect of overseas tax losses, relate primarily to trading losses incurred in
the US and have been recognised on the basis that the Directors are of the opinion based on recent and forecast trading, that sufficient
suitable taxable profits will be generated in the relevant territories in future accounting periods, such that it is considered probable
that these assets will be recovered. £14.4 million of these assets will expire between 2017 and 2025. The remaining assets have no
expiry date. 
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £19.5 million (2005 £16.4 million) which relates primarily to overseas tax losses where
there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future. There is an additional unprovided deferred tax
asset relating to capital losses carried forward of £26.1 million (2005 £49.2 million).
There is a potential taxable temporary difference in respect of the Group’s investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint
ventures, principally in relation to as yet unremitted earnings from overseas subsidiaries. The Group has estimated the potential
taxable temporary difference to be approximately £615.6 million (2005 £599.9 million).

(i)These options were granted at market value at the date of the grant and none required any payment. They are not normally
exercisable before the third anniversary of the grant and in all circumstances will lapse if not exercised within ten years.
(ii) In the case of the 1997 Executive Share Option Scheme, they are normally exercisable only when the relevant performance
conditions have been met. The first condition is that, in respect of four out of six consecutive monthly calculation dates (which start in
the thirtieth month following the date of grant of a particular option), the total shareholder return (‘TSR’) of the Company must exceed
that of the FTSE 100 index. Secondly, there must be real growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years. 
(iii) The TSR condition has not been met so far in respect of the options granted in December 1999, June 2000 or December 2002. As a
consequence, these options have not vested yet. The respective eps conditions were met in previous years. 
(iv) For the options granted in December 2003 at £6.075, the eps condition was met in the year, since real growth in adjusted earnings
per share was achieved, compared to the year ended 28th September, 2003. The TSR condition has not yet been met.
(v) In the case of the 2006 Executive Share Option Scheme, performance conditions apply only to the 465,000 options granted to

37 Contingent liabilities
The Group is exposed to libel claims in the ordinary course of business and makes provision for the estimated costs to defend 
such claims.
Four writs claiming damages for the libel have been issued in Malaysia against Euromoney Institutional Investor and three of its
employees in respect of an article published in one of Euromoney’s magazines, International Commercial Litigation, in November
1995. The writs were served on Euromoney on 22nd October, 1996. The total amount claimed is 280 million Malaysian ringgits, 
£40.2 million (2005 £42.0 million). No provision has been made in these accounts since the Directors do not believe that Euromoney
has any material liability in respect of these writs.
38 Share-based payments
The Group offers a number of share-based remuneration schemes to Directors and certain employees. The principal schemes

The Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan (CAP)
The CAP was introduced in 2005. Each of the CAP awards comprises an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the
company for an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share. The awards become exercisable on satisfaction of certain performance
conditions and lapse to the extent unexercised on 30th September, 2014. In the event that the performance conditions are achieved,
the option pool (of a maximum of 7.5 million shares) will be allocated between the holders of outstanding awards. One third of the
awards will vest immediately, with the other two thirds vesting in equal tranches in the following two years, but only if the specified
profit target is maintained. Otherwise vesting is deferred until the profits achieved in 2008 are achieved again, but no later than by
reference to the year ending 30th September, 2013. The CAP expense recognised in the year was £4.3 million (2005: £1.3 million).
RMS options plan
RMS Options were granted at market value. The options become exercisable after 4 years vesting period and lapse 10 years from the
grant date. The stock issued under the plan must be held for 9 months and they are subject to put or call options where DMGT plc and
DMGI have the right to settle in DMGT shares. The options plan classification changed from cash settled plan in June 2005 to equity
settled plan following a change of settlement feature of stock issued under the plan. 
Genscape options plan
Genscape Options were granted at market value. The options become exercisable after 3 years vesting period and lapse after 10 years
from the grant date. The stock issued under the plan is subject to put or call options where DMGT plc and DMGI have the right to settle
in DMGT shares.

41 Post balance sheet events
On 4th August, 2006, Euromoney announced the terms of a recommended cash offer by Euromoney Institutional Investor (Ventures)
Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, to acquire the entire ordinary share capital of Metal Bulletin plc. The offer document setting
out the full terms of the offer was posted to Metal Bulletin plc shareholders on 31st August, 2006.
All of the conditions of the offer have been satisfied and the offer was declared unconditional on 5th October, 2006.
Under the terms of the offer, Metal Bulletin plc shareholders received 400 pence in cash for every Metal Bulletin plc share held.
The offer valued the issued ordinary share capital of Metal Bulletin plc at approximately £224.8 million.
A partial share alternative was made available which allowed Metal Bulletin plc shareholders to elect to receive any proportion 
of the consideration in new Euromoney shares subject to not more than 14 million new Euromoney shares being issued. For the
purposes of the partial share alternative, each consideration share had an assumed value of 394.75 pence which was Euromoney’s
closing share price on 25th July, 2006, the last business day before the announcement made by Euromoney of the final proposed
recommended offer for Metal Bulletin plc. The partial share alternative was oversubscribed and the maximum number of Euromoney
shares were issued on 6th October, 2006 bringing the total issued share capital to 102.4 million shares.
A loan note alternative was also made available. Shareholders were entitled to elect to receive, for every £1 of cash consideration, £1
nominal value of loan notes. The loan notes will bear interest from the date of issue payable every six months in arrears on 30th June
and 31st December in each year, at 0.75% below LIBOR per year . The loan notes are redeemable at par on interest payment dates
commencing on 30th June, 2007. Any loan notes outstanding on 31st December, 2016 will be redeemed at par on that date.
At 24th October, 2006 Euromoney was the beneficial owner of 97.2% of the issued ordinary share capital of Metal Bulletin plc. Metal
Bulletin plc shareholders opting for the loan note alternative represent 5.2% of Metal Bulletin plc’s share capital. Accordingly it is
estimated that the cash component of the offer will be approximately £157.0 million.

42 Summary of differences between UK GAAP and IFRS
The following summarises the areas of reconciliation relevant to
the Group between UK GAAP and IFRS for the transition period 
3rd October, 2004 and prior year .
Share-based payments
Under UK GAAP no cost is incurred for share options under the
Group’s incentive schemes. In accordance with IFRS 2 the Group
recognises a charge to the income statement which represents
the fair value of outstanding share-based payments granted to
employees. The basis of calculation for deferred taxation is the
difference between the market price at the balance sheet date
and the exercise price of the share-based payment reflecting
expected levels of vesting.
Employment benefits
Under UK GAAP, a prepayment or accrual is shown in the balance
sheet representing timing differences between the surplus of
pension fund assets over projected accrued benefit obligations
and the cash payments made to the pension fund scheme.
Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the regular service cost of
providing retirement benefits to employees during the period,
together with the cost of any benefits relating to past service is
charged to operating profit in the period. The difference between
the market value of the assets and the present value of the
accrued pension liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability in
the balance sheet together with related deferred tax. Differences
between the actual and expected returns on assets during the
period are recognised in the statement of recognised income 
and expense, together with differences arising from changes 
in assumptions.
Leases
Under UK GAAP lease incentives are taken to profit and loss over
the term of the lease remaining to the next rental review. IAS 17
Leases requires incentives to be taken to the profit and loss over
the lease term rather than to the next review.
Dividends
Under UK GAAP dividends are provided for in the period in respect
of which they are declared or proposed. IAS 10 Events After the
Balance Sheet Date requires that dividends are given effect only
in the period in which they are approved by shareholders or paid.
The effect of this change for the Group is that the final dividends
in relation to the financial years 2003/04 and 2004/05 which were
accrued at the balance sheet dates were reversed and, instead,
accounted for in 2004/05 and 2005/06 respectively. 
Business combinations and intangible assets
Under UK GAAP, goodwill on acquisitions made by the Group since
28th September, 1998 has been capitalised and amortised over its
estimated life where such a life has been determined to be finite.
Prior to 28th September, 1998, goodwill arising on acquisitions
was eliminated against reserves in the consolidated balance
sheet in the year in which the acquisition was made. IFRS 3
prohibits the amortisation of goodwill. This standard requires
goodwill to be carried at cost with impairment reviews carried
out annually and at other times if there are indications that the
carrying amount may not be supportable. The Group has adopted
the transitional provisions set out in IFRS 1, to apply IFRS 3
prospectively from the transition date. Goodwill arising on
acquisitions made prior to this is frozen as at the transition date
and any goodwill amortisation occurring in the financial year
2004/05 is therefore reversed for IFRS reporting purposes.
IAS 38 Intangible Assets requires other intangible assets to be
separately identified and amortised over their useful economic
lives. These lives will typically not be indefinite and as a result,
upon acquisition of a company, intangible assets such as brands
and customer lists are now separately valued and amortised over
their useful economic lives. Additionally, UK GAAP requires that
on subsequent disposal or closure of a previously acquired
subsidiary, any goodwill previously taken directly to shareholders’
funds is then charged to the profit and loss account as part of profit
or loss on disposal or closure. Under IFRS the appropriate balance
to be written off on the disposal of the business is the remaining
unamortised balance for goodwill. This change has no effect on
the Group’s opening balance sheet. 
Marketing costs
Under UK GAAP the Group matches its marketing and
promotional spend with income generated from an event. IAS 38
Intangible Assets requires that deferred marketing and
promotional costs be expensed when incurred.
Taxation
Under UK GAAP recognition of deferred tax in respect of rolled
over capital gains is not required and is not permitted in respect
of revaluation gains. Under IFRS a deferred tax provision is
required in both cases.
Under UK GAAP deferred tax does not arise in respect of
capitalised intangible fixed assets unless they are deductible for
tax purposes. IFRS requires provision where the asset is acquired
as part of a business combination.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to the
introduction of FRS10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, gave rise to a
potential deferred tax liability under UK GAAP, however, the reverse
is true under IFRS, where a potential deferred tax asset arises.
Under UK GAAP the Group was permitted to discount deferred
tax assets and liabilities, whereas IFRS does not permit
discounting.
As amortisation of goodwill will not be permitted under IFRS, the
potential deferred tax in respect of capitalised tax deductible
goodwill will be more significant under IFRS.
Reclassification changes 
The following changes reflect presentational changes to the
balance sheet at the transition date and have no effect on either
net assets or profits:
Under UK GAAP the Group recorded foreign exchange differences
arising on retranslation of foreign operations as a component of
retained earnings and has elected to record them from the
transition date in a separate translation reserve;
Under UK GAAP, share of interest and taxation of joint ventures
and associates is included within Group net interest and taxation
charges. Under IAS 1 these items are disclosed within share of
profits/(losses) from joint ventures and associates;

42 Summary of differences between UK GAAP and IFRS continued
Under UK GAAP, capitalised computer software is included within tangible fixed assets on the balance sheet. Under IFRS, only
computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware is included as property, plant and equipment. All other computer
software is included as an intangible asset. As a result, certain software previously shown as fixed assets has been reclassified as
intangible assets; 
Under UK GAAP, specific definitions exist for cash at bank and in hand and short-term investments. Under IFRS, a new category,
described as cash and cash equivalents, replaces the UK GAAP equivalent of cash at bank and in hand. The definition of cash and cash
equivalents results in a reclassification of certain amounts from short-term investments into cash and cash equivalents;
Under UK GAAP, provisions for liabilities and charges are not required to be split formally between current and non-current. IFRS
requires this distinction to be made; 
Under UK GAAP, deferred tax assets are split between amounts falling due within one year and amounts falling due after more than
one year . IFRS requires all deferred tax asset balances to be shown as non-current; and
Under UK GAAP, minority interests were disclosed separately on the face of the Group balance sheet. Under IFRS, since the minority
interests represents amounts owed to the Group, these balances have been included within Group revenue reserves.

MEMBERS OF DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC
We have audited the individual company financial statements of
Daily Mail and General Trust plc for the year ended 1st October,
2006 which comprise the balance sheet and the related notes 1
to 14. These individual company financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
The corporate governance statement and the Directors’
remuneration report are included in the Group annual
report of Daily Mail and General Trust plc for the year ended
1st October, 2006. We have reported separately on the Group
financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc for the
year ended 1st October, 2006 and on the information in the Directors ’
remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose.T o the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and
the individual company financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the
statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the individual company financial
statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and
regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the individual company
financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with
the relevant financial reporting framework, and whether the
individual company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.We report to
you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’
report is consistent with the individual company financial statements.
We also report to you if the Company has not kept proper accounting

of the individual company financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the individual company financial statements are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the individual
company financial statements.

129 NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET – UK GAAP
1 Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are prepared
under the historical cost convention, modified to include the
revaluation to fair value of certain financial instruments as
described below, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). The
following paragraphs describe the main accounting policies
under UK GAAP, which have been applied consistently.
Profit for the financial year
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a 
separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been
included in these accounts. The Company’s loss after tax for the
year, calculated on a UK GAAP basis, was £62.1 million (2005 profit
£93.8 million).
2 Accounting policies
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Impairment reviews of intangible assets are carried out at the end
of the first financial year after acquisition and where there is any
indication of impairment.
Purchased intangible assets relating to newspaper publishing
rights, titles, radio licences and certain other intangible assets 
are capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account
over the lower of their useful economic lives, if any, and a period of
20 years.
Tangible fixed assets
T angible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of
tangible fixed assets by equal annual instalments over their
estimated useful lives as follows:
Plant and equipment 3 to 25 years
Foreign exchange
Exchange differences arising on foreign currency borrowings and
derivative financial instruments which are used to provide a hedge
against foreign currency investments are also taken to reserves
to the extent that they match exchange differences on the
investments to which they relate. Other transactions in foreign
currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the
transaction, or at the contracted rate where a related hedging
contract exists. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date. All such exchange differences
are taken to the profit and loss account.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provision
for impairment, where appropriate.
Other investments which are classified as either held for trading 
or available-for-sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting
dates at fair value. Where securities are held for trading purposes,
gain and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net
profit or loss for the period. For available-for-sale investments, gains
and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly
in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be
impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously
recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is
provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is provided in full on timing
differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date
to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates
expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates
and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items
of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods
different from those in which they are included in financial
statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences
arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no
commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of
subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to
remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be
recovered. Timing differences arising on tax deductible goodwill
written off to reserves are recognised. Due to the indefinite nature
of these timing differences the Group believes it is appropriate to
discount the resultant deferred tax assets and liabilities as they
arise on businesses expected to be held for the long term. As a
consequence, all other deferred tax assets and liabilities are also
discounted.
Financial instruments
The Company uses various derivative financial instruments to
manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
These have included currency swaps, forward foreign currency
contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and interest rate
floors. The Company considers its derivative financial instruments
to be hedges and matches them with the relevant hedged item.
When forward foreign exchange contracts or cross currency swaps
are used to hedge borrowings, the borrowings hedged are
translated at the year end at the exchange rate implicit within the
respective derivative. Any exchange differences arising are taken
to the profit and loss account to match the accounting treatment
of exchange gains or losses on the borrowings.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge
future revenues or costs, the gain or loss is not recognised until
the revenues arise or the costs are incurred.
Payments or receipts on interest rate swaps, caps or floors are
accrued with interest payable. The derivatives are not revalued.
Arrangement fees on bonds are amortised over the estimated life
of the bonds.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company
are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability
and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after
deducting all of its liabilities.
Capital market and bank borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair
value (which is equal to cost at inception), and are subsequently
measured at amortised costs, using the effective interest rate
method, except where they are identified as a hedged item in a 
fair value hedge. Any difference between the proceeds, net of
transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings
is recognised over the term of the borrowing. Daily Mail and General Trust plc

2 Accounting policies continued
New accounting standards
The Company has adopted the following accounting standards in
the year .
FRS 20 Share-based payments
Under FRS 20, the Company is required to reflect share-based
payments in the profit and loss account. In the Company’s case,
share-based payments comprise primarily share options through
the L TIP . The post-tax impact of the standard on the results for the
year ended 2nd October, 2005 was a charge of £1.9 million and a
decrease of £0.4 million in net assets.
FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date
The major effect of FRS 21 is to change the approach to dividends
declared after the balance sheet date in respect of the year under
review such that these dividends are no longer accrued in the
balance sheet. As a result, the net assets at 2nd October, 2005 
had increased by £32.6 million.
FRS 23 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates
FRS 23 sets out additional guidance on the translation method 
for transactions in foreign currencies and on determining the
functional and presentation currencies. The adoption of FRS 23 
had no effect on the Company’s profit or net assets.
The following accounting standards had been deferred until 2nd
October, 2005. Commencing on that date, the Company applied
hedge accounting where the requirements of FRS 26 were met.
FRS 25 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation
FRS 25 sets out the requirements for the presentation of, and
disclosures relating to, financial instruments. The disclosures
complying with the requirements of FRS 25 are included in the
Group Financial Statements.
The adoption of this standard increased opening derivative financial
assets by £18.9 million, increased derivative financial liabilities by
£4.2 million and decreased the carrying value of the Company’s
bonds by £1.7 million. These revaluations increased the Company’s
retained earnings by £16.4 million.
FRS 26 Financial instruments: measurement
FRS 26 sets out requirements for measurement, recognition and
derecognition of financial instruments. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial
instruments, are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when
the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument.
The following accounting policies were applied by the Company
from implementation of FRS 26 from 2nd October, 2005.
– Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts.
– Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their
nominal value.
The Company has no significant long-term trade receivables or
trade payables. 
– Available-for-sale investments
Investments and financial assets are recognised and de-recognised
on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under
a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within
the time frame established by the market concerned, and are
measured at fair value, including transaction costs.

– Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, short-term
deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to
an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company
are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability
and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after
deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for
specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below:
– Capital market and bank borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at 
fair value (which is equal to net proceeds at inception), and are
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective
interest rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged
item in a fair value hedge. Any difference between the proceeds, 
net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of
borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.
– Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
– Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes
in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies,
which are set out on pages 30 and 31 of the Financial and Treasury
Review and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide
written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with
the Company’s risk management strategy. The Company does not
use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value
and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting
date. The fair value is determined by using market data and the use
of established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow
and option valuation models. The Company designates certain
derivatives as: Daily Mail and General Trust plc
131 NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET – UK GAAP
Continued
2 Accounting policies continued
(i) Hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (“fair value hedges”); or
(ii) Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (“cash flow hedges”); or
(iii) Hedges of net investment in foreign operations (“net investment hedges”)
FRS 26 Financial instruments: measurement
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss account,
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The effective portion of
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges or cash flow hedges are recognised in
equity. T o qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must be expected to be effective, be designated and documented at its
inception and throughout the life of the hedge relationship.
When the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is
discontinued. The net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period when the net investment
is sold or when the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to occur .
Fair value hedges
The Company’s policy is to use derivative instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating
rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the profit and loss account
for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item, to the extent the hedge is effective. The ineffective portion is
recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account. The Company’s policy with respect to
hedging the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment is to designate it as a cash flow hedge. If a hedged firm commitment or forecast
transaction results in the recognition of a non financial asset or liability, then, at the time that the asset or liability is recognised, the
associated gains and losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the
asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the
profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged item affects the profit and loss account.

Sharegift
In the UK, DMGT supports ShareGift, which is administered
by the Orr Mackintosh Foundation (registered charity number
1052686) and which operates a charity share donation scheme for
shareholders wishing to give small holdings of shares to benefit
charitable causes. It may be especially useful for those who wish
to dispose of a small parcel of shares which would cost more to
sell than they are worth. There are no capital gains tax implications
(i.e. no gain or loss) on gifts of shares to charity and it is also possible
to obtain income tax relief. If you would like to use ShareGift or
receive more information about the scheme, they can be contacted
by visiting their website at www.sharegift.org or by writing to The
OrrMackintoshFoundation,46GrosvenorStreet,LondonW1K3HN.
Warning to shareholders
Over the last year many companies have become aware that 
their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or
correspondence concerning investment matters. These are
typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK
shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be
worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. They can
be very persistent and extremely persuasive and a 2006 survey 
by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has reported that the
average amount lost by investors is around £20,000. It is not just
the novice investor that has been duped in this way; many of the
victims had been successfully investing for several years.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports.
The Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators has
published guidance to shareholders who receive any unsolicited
investment advice to:
– Make sure shareholders obtain the correct name of the person
and organisation.
– Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before
getting involved. You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/register .
– The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised
overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK investors
and any approach from such organisations should be reported
to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date and any other
appropriate action can be considered. If you deal with an
unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive payment
under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
The FSA can be contacted by completing an online form at
www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml
– Inform Lloyds TSB Registrars on 0870 600 3970.They are not able
to investigate such incidents themselves but will record the details
and pass them on to Daily Mail and General Trust plc and liaise
with the FSA.
Details of any sharedealing facilities that the Company endorses
will be included in company mailings.

Our website
We launched our new website 
in December 2010 and the images 
in this Annual Report are taken 
from the website.
The website is the place to get up 
to date information on Whitbread.  
 
The Annual Report remains an 
important reference document, 
but if you want to hear Whitbread 
news as soon as it happens go to 
www.whitbread.co.uk. 
 
We have not produced an Annual 
Report microsite this year, but 
have integrated the information 
into the main corporate website.  
 
Shareholders who provide us with 
email addresses (at www.whitbread.
co.uk/whitbread/investors/
shareholdercentre/signupecomms.
html) will receive a message 
whenever important news is made 
available on the Company’s website.  
  Financial highlights
These results demonstrate the strength of 
Whitbread, with an 11.5% growth in revenue, 
a 20.1% increase in underlying profit before tax 
and a 17.1% increase in full year dividend.

1 I am pleased to report another year 
of successful results for Whitbread. 
We have achieved strong revenue, 
profit and EPS growth against 
the backdrop of an uncertain 
economic environment, with the 
consumer coming under increasing 
pressure. Our determined focus to 
give customers value for money, 
win market share and keep tight 
control of costs is serving us well.
During 2010/11 Premier Inn’s drive 
to attract the leisure market has 
reaped rewards with weekend 
occupancy at record levels as 
customers take advantage of 
our Premier Offers. While in our 
restaurant brands the meal deals 
have proven popular with one third 
of all customers selecting them 
from the menus. Costa has had 
another stellar year as it continues 
to expand at pace, reaching a 
milestone of £50 million profit.
Over the past year we opened 
22 new hotels and eight new 
restaurants in the UK and over 300 
coffee shops across the world. In 
the UK alone our outlet expansion 
has created some 1,500 additional 
jobs. I am pleased to report that 
our employees have now achieved 
around 2,500 qualifications through 
the apprenticeship and skills for 
life programmes.
We conducted an orderly Chief 
Executive succession process, as 
a result of which Andy Harrison 
joined us in September. He took 
over as Chief Executive when Alan 
Parker retired in November. Andy 
settled quickly into the role. His 
relevant experience and approach 
of rigorous evolution are serving 
us well as he seeks to build on 
the strengths and success of the 
Company by further developing 
and accelerating the growth of our 
strong brands.
While we believe the economic 
outlook will remain challenging, 
our good return on capital and 
continued positive performance 
give the Board confidence to invest 
in long term growth. Over the next 
twelve months the focus will be 
on strengthening our customer 
propositions to deliver even 
greater value, controlling costs and 
accelerating the expansion of our 
network to win market share and 
increase profits. Longer term, we 
have new growth targets in place 
for Premier Inn and Costa.
Dividend
The Board recommends a final 
dividend of 33.25p per share, 
making a total dividend for the year 
of 44.50p per share, up by 17.1%. 
The final dividend will be paid on 
13 July 2011 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business 
on 13 May 2011. Once again, a scrip 
dividend alternative will be offered 
and further information on how 
shareholders can elect to participate 
in the scrip dividend scheme are 
available from the registrars or on 
the Company’s website.
Board
We announced last March that 
Alan Parker would retire as Chief 
Executive in November 2010 
and would hand over to Andy 
Harrison. I would like to thank 
Alan for his commitment to 
Whitbread and for his achievements 
as Chief Executive over more than 
six years. As I said last year, under 
his leadership Whitbread grew to 
become the UK’s leading hospitality 
company with a strong focus on 
value for money brands. 
There have been two other changes 
to the Board since I wrote to you 
this time last year. Philip Clarke 
stepped down from our Board on 
1 March 2011 when he took over as 
the new Chief Executive of Tesco. 
I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank Philip for his important 
contribution to the Board and to 
the development of our business. In 
particular his emphasis on customer 
focus and competitiveness has been 
a great influence on the Company. 
He leaves with our very best wishes 
for the future.
Chairman’s statement
Over the next twelve months the 
focus will be on strengthening our 
value propositions, controlling costs 
and accelerating our expansion.
2 On 1 February 2011 Ian Cheshire 
was appointed as an independent 
non-executive director. Ian has 
been Chief Executive of Kingfisher 
plc since 2008. He has held a 
number of other roles at that 
company including Chief Executive 
of B&Q and CEO International and 
Development since joining in 1998. 
We are delighted to welcome Ian 
to our Board. As a serving Chief 
Executive of a large successful 
international consumer-facing 
business, Ian is already giving us 
valuable advice and support as 
we continue to grow both in the 
UK and internationally. Ian is also 
Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, a role previously held 
by Philip Clarke.
Governance
Later in this report, on pages 26 
to 30, you will find the annual 
corporate governance report and 
I hope you will agree that it is laid 
out in a helpful and user-friendly 
style. Clearly though governance 
is about a good deal more than 
ticking the right boxes to show 
compliance with the Code and 
I’m pleased to say that here at 
Whitbread we are determined 
to manage the Company in a 
transparent and ethical manner. 
I take personal responsibility for 
the smooth running of the Board 
and I am pleased to report that it 
is functioning well. I believe that 
we have an appropriate mix of 
knowledge and skills around the 
Board table and the results of the 
Board review we carried out during 
the year were positive.
People
On page 8, you will see the 
‘customer heartbeat’ model that 
Andy Harrison has introduced 
since his arrival. A vital ingredient 
in that model is the quality, 
enthusiasm and commitment of 
Whitbread’s employees throughout 
the organisation. The Company’s 
performance is entirely dependent 
upon the ability of team members 
to provide customers with high 
quality service and I would like 
to thank them all on behalf of 
the Board for their invaluable 
contribution to another good year 
for the Company.
Anthony Habgood
Chairman
27 April 2011
Our increasingly focused strategy and 
drive to meet the needs of our customers 
enabled us to deliver another excellent 
set of results, with a 17% higher dividend, 
and position us well for the future.
3 Whitbread is a hugely people 
intensive, consumer-facing 
business, with a growing 
network of hotels, restaurants 
and coffee shops across the UK 
serving millions of customers every 
month. We also have exciting 
opportunities in our international 
business. Our strategy is to create 
substantial shareholder value 
through investing in the continued 
growth of our strong brands, with 
an ever sharper focus on improving 
our returns on incremental capital. 
The scale of this opportunity is 
demonstrated by our new five year 
growth milestones. Our customers 
will always remain at the heart of 
our business and we aim to win 
market share by offering better 
value and a great experience, 
especially by having a well trained 
and highly engaged team of 
Whitbread people. Our business 
philosophy is summarised by our 
‘customer heartbeat’ schematic 
on page 8.
Whitbread delivered good sales 
and profit growth in 2010/11 
despite the challenging economic 
environment and tougher 
comparatives in the second half 
of the year. Group total sales grew 
strongly by 11.5% to £1,599.6 million 
with Premier Inn up 10.9% to 
£698.6 million, Costa up 24.7% 
to £425.0 million and Restaurants 
up 2.7% to £478.7 million.
Group underlying profit before tax 
increased by 20.1% to £287.1 million 
(2009/10: £239.1 million), with 
underlying diluted EPS increasing 
by 20.1% to 116.1p. 
Like for like sales increased 
across all businesses. At Group 
level, like for like sales grew by 
6.6%, Premier Inn increased by 
8.6% and Restaurants by 3.3%. 
Costa delivered a like for like sales 
increase of 7.8%. 
At the year end, net debt was 
£487.9 million compared to 
£513.4 million last year. 
A successful year
Whitbread is the UK’s largest 
hotel and restaurant group with 
brand leadership in hotels and 
coffee shops. In the UK our 35,000 
employees serve over ten million 
customers each month, in some 
2,000 outlets. I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank all our 
employees for their hard work and 
contribution to our success.
Premier Inn’s strategy to drive 
occupancy by targeting leisure 
customers has proven successful 
with our like for like occupancy 
improving 6.6 percentage points to 
76.2%, leading to a revpar increase 
of 8.2%. The strategy focuses on 
four key levers: increased advertising 
and promotion, dynamic pricing, 
widened reservation distribution 
and increased sales activity. We are 
on track to achieve our occupancy 
target of 80% and have driven an 
increase in like for like occupancy 
both midweek, by 4.5 percentage 
points, and at the weekend, by 
9.7 percentage points. The drive 
to improve leisure performance 
has resulted in a mix change with 
increased like for like occupancy at 
the weekend (now 69.4%) which has 
slightly reduced our average room 
rate by 1.2% to £54.19.
Our restaurants have delivered like 
for like sales growth of 3.3% in the 
year, driven by like for like covers 
growth of 5.1%. We have continued 
to focus on value for money offers, 
including 2 for £10 in Brewers Fayre, 
2 for £11 in Table Table and meal deals 
at Beefeater. Last year these value 
offers saw a growth of 10.9% and 
accounted for over 30% of all covers. 
We completed the refurbishment of 
130 restaurants last year. Return on 
capital

 in our Hotels and Restaurants 
business in 2010/11 stands at 12.3%, 
up from 10.9% in 2009/10.
Costa has continued its outstanding 
performance, with pre exceptional 
operating profits up 38.4% to 
£50.1 million, worldwide system 
sales up 27.8% at £659.0 million and 
an increase in like for like sales of

for Whitbread, building on our 
good returns on capital and the 
availability of quality sites.

 has 
risen from 36.7% to 42.2%.
In March 2011, we announced 
the acquisition of Coffee Nation 
for £59.5 million and our plan to 
launch a new brand, Costa Express, 
targeting the self-serve coffee bar 
sector. Consumer research has 
identified that the number one driver 
of purchase is convenience and 
Costa Express will directly target 
those customers who want great 
tasting coffee ‘on the go’. It provides 
Costa with access to new types 
of location and creates a growth 
opportunity in the UK’s emerging 
self-serve coffee bar sector. This 
sector currently comprises around 
2,000 units, of which Coffee Nation 
operates approximately 900. We 
have set a target of 3,000 Costa 
Express units across the UK over 
the next five years.
During 2010/11, we continued to 
invest in disciplined growth. We 
opened 22 hotels, 2,138 rooms and 
eight new restaurants. As announced 
in September 2010, 633 rooms left 
the estate following our decision 
to exit our ten year agreement on 
14 hotels run by Roadchef plus one 
run by Moto. Our total UK portfolio 
at the year end was 590 hotels and 
43,219 rooms. Our international 
business now has five hotels (1,076 
rooms) with 816 rooms in Dubai, 
105 in Bangalore, and 155 in Dublin. 
Occupancy in the three Dubai hotels 
has risen from 38% in 2009/10 to 
55% in 2010/11. We have a further 
committed pipeline of four hotels 
with two in Abu Dhabi, one in Qatar 
and one in India. 
In Costa we expanded significantly 
in the UK and internationally. In the 
last year, Costa opened a total of 
347 stores taking the total number 
of stores to 1,217 in the UK and 654 
internationally. In the UK we opened 
148 (net) new stores in the year, of 
which 79 are Costa operated and 
69 are franchise stores. Overseas, 
we opened 123 (net) new stores 
of which 47 are equity and 76 
are franchise. The integration of 
Coffeeheaven, the Central European 
business we acquired last year, has 
gone well and the performance in 
the key Polish market is ahead of 
our expectations with like for like 
sales up by 6.1%. We now have 73 
stores in Poland and expect to have 
approximately 100 stores in 2012/13.
Building on success
We will continue to build and grow 
our strong brands as we seek to 
strengthen our customer proposition 
and accelerate the expansion of our 
network to win market share and 
increase profits. In 2011/12 we are 
increasing our rate of expansion with 
around 4,000 new room openings, 
14 restaurants and 300 Costa stores 
worldwide. Total capital expenditure 
in 2011/12 will be around £350 million, 
up from £202 million in 2009/10.
Looking ahead, key areas of activity 
include: 
•  improving our insight to deliver 
a better customer experience;
•  stronger value-led offers; 
•  innovating across our brand 
propositions; and
•  making our brands more 
accessible through increased 
distribution channels.
We continue to build brand 
preference amongst consumers 
with both Premier Inn and Costa 
ranked number one in their sector 
by YouGov. Better customer insight 
is fundamental to our strategy 
to build strong brands and we 
use a number of mechanisms to 
determine and analyse customer 
needs and satisfaction.
A key tool within our hotels and 
restaurants is the ‘Guest Recommend 
Survey’ that captures feedback from 
over 800,000 customers annually. 
Costa’s loyalty programme, the 
Coffee Club card, provides rich data 
on over 1.2 million active cardholders 
offering valuable demographic 
information and promotional 
opportunities. The card is now 
used in 41% of all transactions, with 
cardholders’ average spend 6% 
above non cardholders.
1.
  Return on capital is the return on invested 
capital that is calculated by taking 
underlying profit before interest and tax 
for the year divided by net assets excluding 
debt, taxation liabilities and the pension 
deficit at the balance sheet date. For 
Costa, the £59.5 million of capital invested 
in March 2011 on the acquisition of Coffee 
Nation is excluded from the calculation.
5 Our value-led offers have helped 
drive market outperformance 
during challenging economic times. 
Targeted at the leisure customer, 
Premier Inn’s ‘Premier Offers’, with 
rates from £29, sold over one million 
room nights in 2010/11 which is 
more than double 2009/10. We 
have also successfully trialled a 
£19 price point to drive occupancy 
and secure incremental revenue in 
periods of low demand.
We continue to enhance our 
dynamic pricing system to improve 
our capability to manage rates 
to maximise market demand. 
We will be using this increasingly 
sophisticated tool to achieve more 
efficient pricing across the estate, 
enabling us to improve midweek 
revpar and extend Premier Offers.
The increased occupancy in our 
hotels has also had a positive 
impact on restaurant sales, 
enhanced by our Premier Inn 
£22 Meal Deal, which accounted 
for over £10 million of sales in 
our hotels and restaurants.
We have had good success in 
value for money food promotions 
in our restaurant brands. We will 
apply the same strategy to drink 
and continue innovating our food 
and drink offers to attract more 
customers and encourage greater 
spend. We believe our restaurants 
have the potential to be ‘best in 
class’. To achieve this objective 
we have appointed a Managing 
Director of Restaurants, within 
Whitbread Hotels and Restaurants, 
to drive strategic focus and 
operational excellence.
Innovation is critical to building 
strong brands and we have a 
number of new concepts which 
are being rolled out in 2011/12. 
Premier Inn’s automated check-in 
kiosks are proving a success. They 
are currently in 33 hotels and will 
be installed in all new build solus 
hotels. We are also developing a 
new ‘mini solus’ format, which is 
typically between 60-80 rooms 
with smaller public area space 
giving us access to a broader 
range of locations.
Costa continues to revamp its 
store format. Its ‘Metro’ design is 
achieving strong results across six 
stores in central London. The first 
Metro store outside London will 
open in Leeds in Summer 2011 and 
a further seven stores are planned 
to open in the UK in 2011/12. Costa 
has also opened a new ‘Provincial’ 
format in Nottingham and Oxford, 
with plans to roll out elements of 
the design across the estate.
Improving our distribution channels 
is a key focus as we work to make 
our brands easily accessible to both 
existing and potential customers. 
In Premier Inn, the Business Account 
Card enables us to increase our 
brand footprint and build a higher 
quality customer base. It has 
attracted major corporate accounts 
such as RWE npower and Balfour 
Beatty. We currently have over 
16,600 accounts and since 2006/07, 
revenue from Business Accounts 
has grown from £75 million to 
£180 million (ex VAT).
We continue to increase the 
number of bookings via automated 
channels (including Premierinn.com), 
which now account for over 70% 
of all reservations. In January 
2011, we launched the Premier Inn 
App which has generated over 
£1.3 million of revenue in its first 
four months.
We have a broad distribution 
system in Costa with a balanced 
portfolio across high streets, retail 
parks, concessions, airports, rail 
and other travel hubs as well as 
an increasing number of stores in 
new locations such as universities 
and hospitals. In addition to the 
traditional full store format, we are 
also developing more innovative 
distribution channels, such as 
Costa Express and Drive Thru, 
which will enable us to extend 
the brand’s reach and increase 
accessibility for the customer.
Chief Executive’s review
6 New growth milestones
We have conducted a thorough 
assessment of the growth potential 
for Premier Inn and Costa. As 
a result we believe there is 
opportunity to grow faster and 
further and we have set new 
milestones for the next five years 
of at least 65,000 Premier Inn UK 
rooms and 3,500 Costa stores 
worldwide. We have a committed 
pipeline of 10,500 Premier Inn UK 
rooms including 4,000 scheduled 
to be built in 2011/12. We anticipate 
that around 40% of our growth will 
come from new catchment areas 
where Premier Inn is not currently 
present. A significant proportion of 
rooms growth will be via the joint 
site model and therefore we expect 
to open between 80-100 new 
restaurants over the next five years.
There is a medium-term growth 
opportunity for Premier Inn 
internationally and, building on our 
current five hotels in India and the 
Middle East, our newly appointed 
Managing Director of Premier 
Inn International is developing a 
more detailed strategy for growth. 
This strategy will comprise a new 
capital ‘lite’ approach to improve 
our return on capital and better 
manage our risk. 
Costa is the nation’s favourite 
coffee shop brand and has grown 
to become the sector leader within 
the UK and the second largest 
international coffee shop operator. 
We have set a new target to double 
the size of the business in the 
next five years, with system sales 
growth to around £1.3 billion and 
3,500 stores worldwide. We expect 
continuing rapid growth in our 
UK store network with even faster 
international growth. Our equity 
business model will grow somewhat 
faster than our franchise business.
The Group’s planned capital 
expenditure of around £350 million 
in 2011/12 is indicative of the level 
of investment in subsequent years, 
which will be funded from existing 
operating cash flow and facilities.
Good Together corporate 
responsibility programme
Our corporate responsibility 
programme, which we call Good 
Together, encompasses a range 
of objectives to ensure that 
Whitbread is a force for good in our 
communities. In November 2010 we 
opened our second ‘green’ hotel and 
our first low carbon restaurant, a 
220 cover Beefeater Grill in Burgess 
Hill, Sussex. Costa opened its first 
energy efficient store in Basingstoke 
in October which we anticipate 
will reduce energy consumption by 
30%. In March this year we were 
awarded the ‘Best Initiative’ for a 
large business at the Climate Week 
Awards for our innovative landfill 
diversion initiative. 
Whitbread employees have 
achieved around 2,500 
qualifications through the 
apprenticeship and skills for life 
programmes. As we grow our outlet 
numbers, we continue to offer jobs 
and training opportunities and in 
2011/12 we will create approximately 
2,500 new jobs in the UK.
Current trading and outlook
Growth in our like for like sales 
remains firmly positive, although 
at a lower level than that achieved 
in the fourth quarter of 2010/11. 
Despite a more challenging 
consumer economy, we are 
confident that we will continue to 
outperform, based on the strength 
of our brands and our customer 
propositions. Our emphasis is on 
giving customers value for money, 
winning market share and keeping 
a tight control of costs.
We see a significant opportunity 
for Whitbread, building on our 
good returns on capital and the 
availability of quality sites. We are 
already growing faster and will 
add around 4,000 new Premier Inn 
UK rooms and around 300 Costa 
stores this year and we have set 
new five year milestones. These 
milestones will increase the number 
of Premier Inn UK rooms by 50% 
to 65,000 and double the size of 
Costa to 3,500 stores worldwide 
over the next five years, in addition 
to our existing goal of expanding 
Costa Express to 3,000 units. This 
is an exciting and profitable plan to 
build on Whitbread’s success and 
to create substantial value for our 
shareholders.
Whitbread’s people
Since I’ve joined the Company 
I’ve met many of the people who 
work for Whitbread up and down 
the country and overseas. They 
are on the front line in the delivery 
of an excellent level of service to 
our customers. I’ve been really 
impressed by the commitment of 
Whitbread’s people, both in our 
many outlets and in the support 
centre. Again, I would like to thank 
them for their efforts over the last 
year and look forward to building 
an even more successful future 
alongside them.
Andy Harrison
Chief Executive
27 April 2011
Our emphasis is on giving customers 
value for money, winning market share 
and keeping a tight control of costs.
7 Our aim continues to be to build 
the best large-scale hospitality 
brands in the world by becoming 
the most customer-focused 
organisation there is and we’ve 
made good progress towards 
that ambitious goal during the 
last year. We now understand our 
customers better than ever before. 
We have completed a customer 
segmentation project for all of our 
key brands and the insight we get 
from our customers and potential 
customers is now at the heart of 
our decision-making.
The customer heartbeat
On the right is a schematic, which 
illustrates our philosophy that if 
we take care of our people, they 
will take care of the customers 
and that, in turn, will drive results 
for the shareholders.
On the left of the diagram are our 
people. We have more than 35,000 
team members serving over ten 
million customers every month. 
They are at the heart of delivering a 
great customer experience and it is 
vital that we keep them motivated 
and engaged if we are to achieve 
our goals. We are working hard 
at team engagement and we are 
proud of the latest YOUR SAY 
results, which show an excellent 
team engagement score of 71%. 
However, whilst these scores are 
very good, we want to be truly 
world class and we have some great 
role models right here at Whitbread. 
Over 25% of Whitbread’s teams 
achieved team engagement scores 
in excess of 80%. We will look to 
these role models and learn from 
them as we strive for an average 
team engagement score in excess 
of 80% across the Company.
If we achieve this, we will be in 
an even better position to provide 
an excellent customer experience. 
We will continue to work to 
understand what our customers 
want today and to predict what 
they will want in the future. The 
insight gained will be used to 
provide our customers with the 
products and services they expect, 
in the places they want them 
and served by truly engaged 
team members.
Investing in growth
We need to ensure that we locate 
our businesses in the places that our 
customers, and potential customers, 
want. Growing our leading brands 
and improving their competitive 
position is a key element in our 
future success. As explained earlier 
in this report, following a thorough 
assessment of the growth potential 
for Premier Inn and Costa, we now 
believe there is an opportunity to 
grow faster and further. We have 
therefore set new milestones for the 
next five years of at least 65,000

Good Together
Our strategy is underpinned by 
our Good Together programme. 
Good Together is about protecting 
the long-term sustainability of the 
Company. There are immediate 
cost savings to be made by cutting 
energy usage and reducing the 
amount of waste going to landfill, 
but there are also longer-term 
issues to consider. We are taking 
action to protect our supply chain, 
so that we can continue to give 
our customers what they want. 
We invest in training for our people 
so that we have enough high 
quality team members to serve 
our customers. We aim to meet 
customers’ expectations by acting 
with integrity and by developing 
healthier food ranges. Good 
Together is central to the future 
success of the Company and will 
continue to be integrated into the 
way the Company operates until 
it becomes the way Whitbread 
does things.
Our customers
The customer heartbeat is central 
to our success and it is vital that 
we understand what our customers 
need and then ensure that we provide 
them with it.

8 Customer segmentation
During 2010/11 we updated the 
customer segmentation model for 
our Restaurant brands following the 
similar work carried out in Premier 
Inn and Costa. This work allows 
us to focus our marketing activity 
more effectively and to develop 
new products and services. We 
have also been developing a more 
sophisticated CRM strategy including 
the Costa Coffee Club and Premier 
Inn Business Account cards.
In Premier Inn we will give greater 
focus to specific parts of the leisure 
and business markets. For example 
the recent Weekend Rewards offer 
has been aimed specifically at 
business guests. In Costa we will  
be looking for ways to meet the 
needs of the different customer 
groups identified – from the ‘grab 
and go commuters’ to those looking 
to spend more time relaxing with 
a coffee. 
Hotels and Restaurants guest 
satisfaction programme
It is important that we accurately and 
robustly measure customer feedback 
and always focus on what’s important 
to the customer. The Premier Inn 
guest satisfaction programme 
e-mails approximately two million 
customers within 24 hours of their 
stay to ask them for their feedback. 
We receive 700,000 responses every 
year, making it one of the biggest 
and most robust programmes in 
Europe. During 2010 we conducted a 
number of exit interviews at Premier 
Inn, which validated the results of 
the programme, and will conduct 
further exit interviews in the year 
ahead. The insight gained from the 
programme led to the introduction 
of the successful ‘Premier Offers’ 
deals, which have led to significant 
increases in weekend occupancy and 
customer value for money scores.
Last year over 120,000 people 
completed our Restaurants 
guest survey giving us a real 
understanding on how we deliver 
against our key guest measures 
including food quality, service, 
environment and value for money.  
Guest measures dashboard
The Hotels and Restaurants 
business utilises a guest measures 
dashboard, which measures 
performance against key elements 
of the guest promise. This is a good 
night’s sleep and great value food 
and drink, served by people who 
really care in a clean, comfortable 
and well looked after environment. 
Customer scores are monitored 
continuously on the constituent 
elements of the promise. For 
example, the measures of a good 
night’s sleep include the comfort 
of the bed, the comfort of pillows 
and noise. When customer feedback 
would suggest that performance 
in a particular area is below 
expectations, action plans are 
developed to address any problems.
Costa – customer insight
Costa measures and monitors the 
consumer hierarchy of needs, and 
using this, is able to focus initiatives 
on what is really important to 
customers: convenience; coffee; 
environment; service; value for 
money; and food. Improvements 
in customer satisfaction in these 
areas have been achieved during 
the year, by targeting activity to 
better meet customers’ needs. 
For example, Costa has opened 
165 new stores during the year to 
make the brand more convenient 
to more people and has adapted 
the service style in stores leading 
to an improvement both in the 
speed and friendliness of service.
Insight isn’t just about understanding 
what our customers do but also 
why they do it and why some 
people choose not to be our 
customers. Costa, in association 
with independent research agency 
YouGov, undertakes three key 
tracking studies covering customer 
satisfaction, usage and attitudes 
and BrandIndex. This generates 
key indicators on a daily, monthly 
and quarterly basis, including 
satisfaction, recommendation and 
loyalty with demographic and other 
detailed analysis helping to channel 
insight into the heart of business.

the YouGov on-line consumer panel and 2,000 
on-line interviews are conducted every day in 
the UK for the BrandIndex measure.

11 YOUR SAY
We are now in our third year of 
YOUR SAY, Whitbread’s employee 
opinion survey. The feedback we 
have gathered has enabled our 
business to understand in more 
depth what matters to our team 
members and how they feel about 
working for Whitbread.
With this valuable insight we have 
been able to work closely with our 
employees to discuss common 
themes across the Whitbread 
Group whilst also encouraging 
focus on the key priorities within 
individual teams. From a Group 
perspective we have introduced 
measures to understand and react 
to engagement priorities that 
feature across all our brands, and 
from an individual team perspective 
we have implemented team 
action plans. This has enabled our 
managers to take ownership for 
the engagement and motivation of 
their teams, demonstrating to our 
employees that we are listening and 
responding to their feedback.
We continue to see encouraging 
progression in our employee 
response rates. In 2010 Whitbread’s 
employee response rate stood 
at 77%. Our employee survey 
has now become embedded 
into the way we do business and 
we are seeing real change, with 
employee engagement levels rising 
significantly over the last two years. 
We believe these improvements 
have been driven by a strong drive 
internally for robust action planning 
by all teams. 
We will continue to invest in our 
employee survey so that we can 
learn more about how we can 
provide a great place to work 
for our employees.
Development
At Whitbread, we believe we have 
a responsibility to provide quality 
induction and training programmes, 
whilst doing what we can to help 
meet the government target of 
ensuring 95% of the adult working 
population achieve functional 
literacy and numeracy skills. This is 
a key element of our commitment 
to the Skills Pledge and enables our 
talented individuals to progress with 
Whitbread. We have four key parts 
to our core team member learning 
and development:
•  The Whitbread Apprenticeship 
Programme;
•  Skills for Life – literacy and 
numeracy;
•  specialist technical skills 
development; and
•  management skills and 
development.
We have achieved around 2,500 
externally nationally recognised 
qualifications to date since the 
programme was launched in 
2009. General managers recognise 
the benefits to investing in their 
people and bringing to life future 
career prospects including further 
management development.
The success of our internal 
management development 
programme, named ‘Shooting 
Stars’, has continued to grow. 
We have recently launched the 
new Kitchen Manager and Head 
Chef Development programmes 
and continue to evolve our 
management programmes to 
meet our future business strategy.
Our development strategy and 
framework has been endorsed 
with the ‘Skills in the Workplace’ 
Business in the Community 2010 
‘Big Tick’ Award. The quality of 
our training was also recognised 
with a National Training Award in 
2010 which is sponsored by the 
Department for Business Innovation 
and Skills in association with 
Investors in People. 
Leadership
2010 saw us launch a new 
performance and progression 
review framework. We believe that 
effective performance and talent 
management practices encourage 
engagement and realise potential, 
leading to tangible business 
benefits. This approach gives us 
great insight to anticipate our future 
people development and resourcing 
needs and helps us continue to 
embed an effective succession 
culture into the business. We aim to 
appoint 80% of our management 
roles internally.
Our Whitbread employer brand
We are now attracting and 
hiring talented individuals to 
be managers for the future via 
our Whitbread careers website 
www.eatsleepdrinkwork.co.uk. 
Our Whitbread employer brand 
is growing in popularity and 
desirability.
We have also launched our ‘Get 
On’ communications programme 
designed to inform those starting 
out on their careers about the 
opportunities to progress with 
Whitbread. Information on ‘The 
Whitbread Journey’ can be found at 
www.thewhitbreadjourney.co.uk.
Our people
Achieving high levels of employee 
engagement is key to the Company’s 
future success.
12 Whitbread in numbers
The WINcard is our balanced 
scorecard. It has driven our high 
performance and maps our 
progress. Every leader in the 
business from the management 
teams in our Costa stores, 
restaurants and Premier Inns, to 
the Chief Executive has a WINcard 
which is relevant to their role and 
level of contribution. All team 
members in Whitbread can see 
their achievements and progress 
on a monthly basis wherever they 
work. The WINcard measures 
our performance around our key 
stakeholders: our customers, our 
people, our shareholders and our 
community which is better known 
as our ‘Good Together’ strategy. 
The WINcard aligns our day-to-day 
activities to the overall vision and 
strategy of the Company and helps 
us to measure our progress.
The WINcard has enabled a 
performance culture to thrive 
across all levels of the organisation 
and mobilises our people to 
act around shared goals. The 
WINcard measures are used as key 
indicators in personal development 
planning, for recognising excellent 
performance, in coaching and 
performance management, 
supporting talent management 
and succession planning. It is a 
core component of our incentive 
framework at all levels.
The WINcard educates, motivates 
and engages our leaders and 
teams across the business to 
focus, prioritise and deliver what is 
required to achieve success.
WINcard results in 2010/11
The measures on the WINcard 
were updated in 2010/11 to include 
Premier Inn market performance 
and electricity/carbon reduction. 
2010/11 WINcard results
During the year, Whitbread 
achieved seven greens and two reds 
at Group level. The achievement 
of a green rating for seven Group 
measures was an excellent result 
as in each case, except for where 
the measures were new, the targets 
were made tougher to achieve. The 
reds were for team turnover and 
guest recommend. In both cases 
the scores were actually better 
than in 2008/09, but didn’t quite 
match the excellent performance 
in 2009/10. The targets for 2010/11 
were set in such a way that a further 
improvement would have been 
necessary to achieve green, and 
these extremely onerous targets 
were not quite achieved.
Changes for the year ahead
For 2011/12 a number of changes 
have been made to the WINcard 
measures. The guest recommend 
measures for Premier Inn and 
Restaurants will be based on a net 
scoring system, which is widely 
considered to be a more robust 
measurement. Costa’s brand 
preference score will be based on 
the YouGov quarterly usage and 
attitude survey. There will also be 
new targets for brand expansion 
for Premier Inn and Costa. The cash 
flow hurdle for incentive payouts 
in 2010/11 has been replaced by a 
return on capital hurdle, while the 
health and safety hurdle has been 
made tougher, with a number of 
‘autofail’ questions being identified 
in the health and safety audit.
Key performance indicators
We use a balanced scorecard, 
called the WINcard to measure our 
performance against key indicators.

13 We launched Good Together in 
2009 in response to market and 
stakeholder research telling us that 
it was what our customers and our 
team members want, and that it is 
simply good business.
Good Together is an overarching 
strategy and programme of 
initiatives to drive sustainable 
performance and to help 
Whitbread’s people, customers and 
supply chain partners make changes 
to how they work and how they ‘eat, 
sleep and drink’ Whitbread.
During 2010/11, we have made 
good progress in embedding Good 
Together in our businesses and the 
way we work. Highlights for 2010/11 
include:
•  launching a purpose built 
green hotel and restaurant in 
Burgess Hill;
•  achieving 100% RFA certification 
for Costa Coffee in our UK sites;
•  launching Costa’s recyclable cup;
•  diverting 67% of our waste from 
landfill;
•  communicating our responsible 
sourcing policy to all suppliers;
•  launching our Good Together 
Ambassador programme – a 
CR training programme for over 
50 key team members across 
our business; and
•  achieving Gold Status in the 
2011 Business in the Community 
Corporate Responsibility Index. 
Progress and targets
The tables to the right summarise 
our progress so far against our 
Good Together public targets. We 
will build on this overview in future 
reporting, including more targets as 
we develop and release them and 
showing year-on-year progress.
For more information please refer to 
the website – www.whitbread.co.uk/
whitbread/responsibility.html
Good Together target:
Reduce our relative operational 
(scope 1 and 2) carbon emissions 
by 26% vs. a 2009/10 baseline 
by 2020.
2010/11 Update:
To achieve our target we need 
to reduce our relative emissions 
by a minimum average amount 
of 2.6% every year.
In 2010/11, despite a growth in 
revenue of 11.15% the Company’s 
absolute carbon emissions 
decreased by 1.95%. Relative 
to sales, carbon emission 
efficiency has improved by 
11.78%. This puts us well on 
track to meeting our target.  
Progress: 
Target:
Achieve 80% of waste diverted 
from landfill from Whitbread 
Hotels and Restaurants sites by 
February 2012.
Update:
At the end of the 2010/11 
financial year, we were diverting 
67% of our hotel and restaurant 
waste from landfill sites. 
This represents significant 
improvement over a two year 
period from March 2009 when 
the figure was 42%.
An action plan is being worked 
on to achieve 80% diversion 
of waste from landfill by 
February 2012.
Progress: 
Corporate responsibility
We are now in the second year 
of our Good Together corporate 
responsibility programme.
We used to buy our milk on the 
open market. Now we buy our 
milk from seven farms which 
produce milk just for Whitbread, 
via a company called Farmright, 
and they can guarantee that 
the milk is pasteurised within 
24 hours of the cow being milked. 
All cows are fed and looked after 
in a traditional way which ensures 
that the milk proteins don’t break 
down. That is what you need to 
get a good froth on a cup of 
Costa coffee.
14 Target:
Achieve a relative 20% reduction 
in water consumption in our Hotels 
and Restaurants portfolio against 
a 2009/10 baseline by 2020.
Update:
To achieve our target we need 
to reduce our relative water 
consumption by a minimum 
average amount of 2% every year.
In 2010/11 we achieved a 5.74% 
reduction in water use relative 
to sales across the sites in our 
business. This puts us on track 
to meet our target. 
Progress: 
Target:
100% of all UK Costa coffee 
production to be Rainforest 
Alliance Certified™ by June 2010.
Update:
All Costa coffee sold in the 
UK has been 100% Rainforest 
Alliance Certified™ coffee since 
May 2010.
In addition, all Costa coffee 
sold in our international Costa 
stores is 100% Rainforest Alliance 
Certified™ coffee, with the 
exception of India, where we 
have achieved 30% certified and 
are on target to achieve 100% by 
March 2012. 
Progress:  
Target:
Launch a purpose-built 
‘green hotel and restaurant’ 
at Burgess Hill, West Sussex.
Update:
Burgess Hill opened in 
November 2010. This site 
features numerous energy and 
water saving features. For more 
information see the CR section 
of our corporate website.
Progress:  
Target:
Achieve 3,000 qualifications 
from Whitbread Hotels and 
Restaurants Apprenticeship 
scheme. 400 Costa learners 
trained by the end of 2011.
Update:
Since the programme started 
in 2009 we have achieved nearly 
2,500 qualifications against our 
target of 3,000 qualifications 
by 2011/12. 
In June we celebrated our 
1,000th Skills for Life qualification 
and we currently have over 450 
team members in learning.
Progress: 
Target:
Raise £1 million for WaterAid.
Update:
Since June 2009 when we 
launched our partnership 
with WaterAid, we have raised 
a total of over £800,000 for 
WaterAid, over 80% towards 
achieving our target.
Progress: 
Target:
To raise funds for and build 
Costa Foundation schools 
sufficient to educate 15,000 
children in coffee-growing 
communities by 2012.
Update:
In the four years since the launch 
of the Costa Foundation, we 
have built 17 schools in Colombia, 
Guatemala, Costa Rica, Ethiopia 
and Uganda. That’s a total of 82 
classrooms that are now being 
used by 8,900 children.
To meet our target, we need to 
build a minimum of four schools 
per year in our target countries. 
In 2010/11 we raised over £448,000 
for the Costa Foundation. This puts 
us ahead of our interim target for 
this year.

acquisition of Coffeeheaven at the 
end of 2009/10, which had revenues 
in the year of £29.1 million (2009/10: 
£1.0 million). Within Hotels and 
Restaurants, Premier Inn opened 
2,138 new rooms and 22 new hotels 
and like for like sales grew by 8.6%. 
The like for like sales growth was as 
a result of our strategy to improve 
occupancy which increased by 6.6 
percentage points year on year to 
76.2% on a like for like basis. Within 
restaurants eight new units were 
opened in the year and like for like 
sales growth was 3.3%. At Costa, 
148 net new units were opened 
in the UK and 123 net new units 
overseas. Costa’s UK equity retail 
like for like sales grew by 7.8%.
Results
Underlying profit before tax 
for the year is £287.1 million, 
up 20.1% on last year and 
underlying diluted earnings per 
share is 116.1p compared to 96.7p 
last year, up 20.1%. 
Total profit for the year is 
£222.1 million which compared to 
£160.0 million last year, up 38.8%.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are analysed 
in more detail in note 6 with a 
resulting credit of £27.0 million. 
This is made up of £31.4 million of 
exceptional tax credits, £9.0 million 
of exceptional charges and a 
£4.6 million exceptional VAT receipt 
relating to gaming machines. 
Included within the exceptional 
tax credits is £7.6 million arising 
from a reassessment of the Group’s 
prior capital allowance claims, 
£16.7 million due to a reduction in 
deferred tax on capital gains rolled 
over into the acquisition cost of new 
assets and £8.4 million arising from 
the reduction in corporation tax 
rates from 28% to 27% contained 
within Finance (No. 2) Act 2010. 
Offsetting the above items is a 
£1.3 million charge for corporation 
tax on the exceptional VAT receipt 
of £4.6 million.
The exceptional charges of 
£9.0 million include impairment 
charges of £5.3 million and losses 
of £2.4 million arising from the 
disposals of the loss making Czech 
and Bulgarian Coffeeheaven 
businesses.
The £4.6 million refund of VAT on 
gaming machine income follows the 
ruling that the application of VAT 
to certain types of gaming machine 
income contravened the European 
Union’s principle of fiscal neutrality. 
As HM Revenue and Customs have 
appealed against this ruling there is 
a contingent liability for the amount 
of the refund plus interest. 
Interest
The underlying interest charge is 
£24.3 million reflecting the reduced 
levels of average debt in the period 
compared to last year which fell 
by 20.6% to £451.8 million. The 
total pre exceptional interest 
cost amounted to £35.8 million. 
Included within this figure is an 
IAS 19 pension charge of £11.5 million 
(2009/10: £15.5 million). This charge 
represents the difference between 
the expected return on scheme 
assets and the interest cost of the 
scheme liabilities.
Tax 
An underlying tax expense of 
£83.7 million represents an effective 
tax rate of 29.2% on the underlying 
profits, which compares with 
29.8% last year. The excess over 
the statutory tax rate of 28% is 
predominantly driven in both years 
by the impact of losses arising 
in overseas subsidiaries and the 
impact of share-based payments. 
In 2011/12 the effective tax rate is 
expected to be around 27%.
Earnings per share
Underlying diluted EPS increased by 
20.1% to 116.1p. 
EPS 2010/11 2009/10
Underlying (diluted) 116.1p 96.7p
Pension finance cost (4.7)p (6.4)p
Exceptional items 15.3p 1.9p
Total operations 
(diluted)
126.7p 92.2p
Further details can be found in 
note 11.
Dividend
A recommended final dividend of 
33.25p, an increase on last year of 
17.3%, will be paid on 13 July 2011 to 
all shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 13 May 2011. 
The total dividend for the year at 
44.50p is up 17.1%. A scrip dividend 
alternative will again be offered. 
We have taken the decision to 
rebalance the interim and final 
dividend payments to better 
reflect the earnings profile through 
the year. As from 2011/12, we will 
seek to make the interim dividend 
around 35% of the overall payment, 
up from around 25%.
Finance Director’s review
The growth in revenues has come 
from improved sales from our like 
for like units, new openings and 
the acquisition of Coffeeheaven.

* this agrees to cash generated from 
operations in the accounts excluding 
the pension payments.
The Group has generated strong 
cash flows from operations in 
the year which are up on last 
year by £39.4 million (10.5%) to 
£415.2 million. During the year the 
Group has increased its investment 
in new units by increasing capital 
expenditure to £202.2 million, up 
53.5%. On 2 March 2011, Costa 
Limited acquired the entire share 
capital of Coffee Nation Holdings 
Limited for a cash consideration 
of £59.5 million. Coffee Nation 
operates approximately 900 self 
serve coffee bars. 
The total cash outflow for interest, 
tax and dividends benefited from a 
£34.0 million cash tax reduction due 
to the pension arrangements which 
are set out below in more detail.
Taken together for the year 
there was a net cash inflow 
of £25.5 million with net debt 
reduced from £513.4 million to 
£487.9 million by the year end. The 
weighted average net debt in the 
year was £451.8 million compared 
to £569.2 million last year, a 
£117.4 million reduction partially 
offset by the acquisition of Coffee 
Nation at the year end. 
During the first half of the year, the 
Group issued private placement loan 
notes in both US$ and £ sterling. 
These loan notes were issued in 
three series with maturities of 7 and 
10 years and coupons from 4.55% 
to 5.23%. The US$ component was 
swapped to £ sterling with the 
total transaction giving a value of 
£101.8 million and £ sterling interest 
rates fixed ranging from 5.19% to 
5.23% and variable rates with a 
spread over LIBOR of between 
1.715% and 1.755%. The proceeds 
were used to repay drawings under 
the shorter maturity bank debt. 
More details of this transaction are 
set out in note 22. This issue is the 
first step the Group has taken to 
diversify the tenure and sources of 
funding and there will be further 
action taken in 2011/12.
In addition to the loan notes set out 
above, the Group had committed 
revolving credit facilities of 
£930 million as at 3 March 2011. 
The revolving credit facilities reduce 
to £855 million in December 2011 
and £455 million in December 2012 
with the remaining facility maturing 
in March 2013.
The policy of the Board continues 
to be to manage its financial 
position and capital structure 
in a manner that is consistent 
with Whitbread maintaining its 
investment grade status. 
Capital expenditure 
Total Group cash capital 
expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets 
during the year was £202.2 million 
with Hotels and Restaurants 
spend amounting to £169.2 million 
and Costa £33.0 million. Capital 
expenditure is split between 
development expenditure, 
which includes the acquisition 
and development of properties 
(£131 million) and maintenance 
expenditure (£71 million). 
In 2011/12 capital expenditure 
is expected to rise to around 
£350 million which will be 
financed from existing cash flow 
and facilities. The incremental 
contribution in 2011/12 from new 
space opened by Hotels and 
Restaurants and Costa in 2010/11 
and 2011/12 is expected to be 
around £20 million.
Pensions
As at 3 March 2011, there was 
an IAS 19 pension deficit of 
£488.0 million, which compares to 
£434.0 million as at 4 March 2010. 
The main movement in the deficit 
from year to year is the actuarial 
losses in the year on the scheme’s 
assets and liabilities. 
Following on from the £102 million 
contribution to the Pension Scheme 
made by the Group in the year 
ended 4 March 2010, an additional 
contribution was made in the year 
of £39 million on the same basis. 
The total contribution of £141 million 
does not meet the definition of 
a plan asset under IAS 19 and 
therefore is not reflected in the 
pension deficit of £488 million.
The additional contribution by the 
Group to the Pension Scheme of 
£39 million will reduce the Group’s 
cash tax payments by £10.9 million 
in total, split equally over the two 
years ending March 2012. Further 
details of this transaction are set 
out in note 32.
Christopher Rogers 
Finance Director
27 April 2011
During the first half of the year the 
Group undertook an issue of private 
placement loan notes in both US$ 
and £ sterling. 
17 The Board, as well as the 
Whitbread Hotels and Restaurants 
and Costa management boards, 
regularly review key risks and the 
status of mitigation plans. The 
Audit Committee, on behalf of the 
Board, reviews this process on an 
annual basis with the internal and 
external auditors. This risk analysis 
is used to plan the operational 
audit’s activity and to highlight 
new areas for focus. 
The risks are categorised into the 
following areas:
Health, safety and security
With more than ten million 
customers per month and 35,000 
employees it is vital that the 
Company focuses on their well-
being and safety. With this as a 
priority we have a well established 
Safety and Security team that 
works with our businesses to 
implement a rigorous health and 
safety programme. We commission 
CMi, an independent company, to 
carry out audits of all our outlets 
every year to measure their 
performance against set critical 
standards. Health and safety is a 
hurdle on the WINcard and this 
influences the level of any bonus 
received by employees in the 
year. Regular updates are given to 
the management boards and the 
Whitbread PLC Board.
Last year we reported that we 
had developed plans to cope with 
a potential swine flu pandemic. 
Although this threat would now 
appear to have reduced, these 
plans remain in place in the event 
of any new threat of this kind. 
We are aware of the potential for 
heightened levels of terrorist threat 
in 2012 for the Olympic Games and 
are currently working with security 
experts to further strengthen our 
security procedures.
Strategic business risks
All our businesses operate in a 
highly competitive environment 
which is significantly influenced 
by the UK economy.
Whitbread performed well through 
the recession, having taken a 
number of actions to protect its 
performance and to provide value 
for customers. The Company has 
continued to review significant 
economic indicators as part of 
the business plan and budgeting 
process and to reflect them as 
appropriate. 
In terms of competitive activity, 
each of the businesses measures 
its performance against the closest 
competitors and the market as a 
whole. Actions to outperform the 
competition are developed on a 
strategic and tactical basis with 
success being monitored regularly. 
Significant customer research is 
carried out with the Premier Inn 
guest feedback form eliciting 
700,000 responses in the year. 
Each of the businesses carries out 
market research and analysis of 
consumer trends in the UK and 
overseas. This market information 
is reviewed by the Board and the 
management boards.
Plans have been developed to 
combat the more challenging 
consumer economy at the 
beginning of 2011/12. Our emphasis 
is on giving customers value for 
money, winning market share and 
keeping tight control of costs.
Financial loss
In a group the size of Whitbread 
there are a number of areas where 
there could be a significant financial 
loss if appropriate controls were 
not in place. Millions of pounds in 
cash are collected and transferred 
between bank accounts. The 
treasury policy sets the level of 
authority and segregation of duties 
which protect against such losses 
and PwC as operational auditor 
reviews these controls regularly. 
The overseas businesses also have 
clear rules and policies over the 
operation of bank accounts and 
the transfer of funds.
Group risks and uncertainties
We have a clear method of managing 
key risks to the Company.
18 Funding
The availability of funds from the 
Company’s banking facilities is 
important for the day to day running 
of the businesses as well as its 
growth. There are regular reviews 
of the level of funds available to the 
Group. Such reviews also check that 
the terms of the loan agreements 
are being complied with. The Board 
approves a funding policy by which 
the level and service of borrowings 
for the Group is set.
A private placement was concluded 
in August 2010 as part of the 
Group’s strategy of diversifying its 
sources of funding and lengthening 
the Group’s debt maturities. 
Market expectations
It is important that the market 
receives regular and accurate 
information concerning the Company 
and that the external expectations 
for the year are accurate.
There are a number of management 
processes designed to keep track 
of progress against internal targets 
and market expectations. Each part 
of the Group has an agreed budget. 
Monthly management reports are 
produced which are reviewed by 
the management boards and the 
main Board.
The market is kept informed through 
quarterly trading updates and 
the interim and full year financial 
statements.
Business continuity
It is crucial that we can continue 
to serve our customers with high 
quality products every day of the 
week. Our supply chain for food 
and drink along with key systems 
underlying the businesses are critical 
to that process.
To guard against the risk of failure 
in any of those suppliers or services 
we have developed contingency 
plans including sources of alternative 
supply and back up of information. 
Auditing and monitoring of suppliers 
also protects against this risk. There 
is a robust audit programme for our 
suppliers who have to pass exacting 
food safety and provenance pre-
qualification. Training programmes 
for our employees endeavour to 
ensure that the food and drink 
served is of the appropriate quality.
Counterparty and third party 
contracts
The Group is party to a number of 
contracts which are important to 
the businesses. There is a continued 
risk that a counterparty fails to be 
able to fulfil its part of a contract. A 
current risk is the failure of a tenant 
of a lease to which a group company 
was originally a party. This could 
mean that the Group becomes liable 
once more to meet the obligations 
under the lease. This risk is carried 
by all companies selling leasehold 
interests, but is heightened in times 
of economic downturn.
Credit control checks are carried out 
on parties to significant contracts 
along with continued auditing 
and monitoring of such contracts. 
Regular reviews are carried out on 
the potential for privity of contract 
claims and, when they are received, 
all efforts are made to lessen the 
financial liability through negotiation 
with the landlord or sale of the lease.
Customers/key relationships
None of the Group’s businesses 
are over-reliant on any particular 
customer or supplier. Key suppliers 
have been identified and mitigation 
plans have been put in place for the 
potential failure of those suppliers. 
Other key relationships include those 
with joint venture partners, franchise 
partners and the operators of 
restaurants on co-located sites.
Pensions
The Company has obligations in 
relation to the Whitbread defined 
benefit pension scheme and 
any valuation deficit that arises. 
There is a risk that the deficit will 
increase and therefore involve 
the Company in having to make 
further contributions as part of 
the funding plan required by the 
Pensions Regulator. The scheme is 
now closed to new members and for 
future service to existing members. 
The Board receives regular reports 
from the pension trustee on its 
asset allocation and is consulted on 
changes to investment policy. The 
advisers to the Company work with 
those of the trustee to mitigate 
the risk.
International
As Costa operates in 24 overseas 
territories and Premier Inn is now 
establishing a presence in the Middle 
East and India, there is a risk of a 
loss arising from a lack of controls. 
To counter this risk, a rigorous 
approval process and controls 
environment has been established 
and is reviewed by the operational 
audit team. Monthly updates are 
given to the management boards.
Reputational risk
A strong corporate reputation 
amongst our stakeholders is 
vital to the long-term strength 
and resilience of our brands, our 
ability to attract and retain talent 
and investment, and our license 
to operate in new locations and 
markets. Effective risk management 
contributes to a positive reputation. 
However, we believe that this alone 
is not enough. It is important to 
understand and respond to the 
opportunities and risks presented 
by corporate responsibility and 
to engage our investors, our 
people and our customers on key 
sustainability issues. For this reason 
we launched our Good Together 
programme in 2009. To learn more 
about this initiative please visit our 
website at www.whitbread.co.uk.
Corporate governance is taken 
seriously at Whitbread, with 
the intention being to operate 
with integrity and transparency. 
Secretariat reports to the Board 
provide updates on legislation and 
a Code of Ethics is in place for all 
employees. The Code of Ethics will 
be replaced in 2011 by a new Global 
Code of Conduct, partly in order to 
align the Company’s policies with 
the new UK Bribery Act.

Share capital
Details of the issued share capital can 
be found in note 28 to the accounts. 
Holders of ordinary shares are 
entitled to attend and speak at 
general meetings of the Company, 
to appoint one or more proxies and, 
if they are corporations, corporate 
representatives to attend general 
meetings and to exercise voting 
rights. Holders of ordinary shares 
may receive a dividend and on 
a liquidation may share in the 
assets of the Company. Holders 
of ordinary shares are entitled 
to receive the Company’s annual 
report and accounts. Subject to 
meeting certain thresholds, holders 
of ordinary shares may requisition 
a general meeting of the Company 
or the proposal of resolutions at 
annual general meetings. 
Voting rights 
On a show of hands at a general 
meeting of the Company, every 
holder of ordinary shares present, 
in person or by proxy and entitled 
to vote, has one vote (unless the 
proxy is appointed by more than 
one member in which case the 
proxy has one vote for and one 
vote against if the proxy has been 
instructed by one or more members 
to vote for the resolution and by 
one or more members to vote 
against the resolution) and on a poll 
every member present in person 
or by proxy and entitled to vote 
has one vote for every ordinary 
share held. Voting rights for any 
ordinary shares held in treasury are 
suspended. None of the ordinary 
shares carry any special rights 
with regard to control of the 
Company. Electronic and paper 
proxy appointments and voting 
instructions must be received by 
the Company’s Registrars not later 
than (i) 48 hours before a meeting 
or adjourned meeting (excluding 
non-working days), or (ii) 24 hours 
before a poll is taken, if the poll is 
not taken on the same day as the 
meeting or adjourned meeting.
Unless the directors decide 
otherwise, a shareholder cannot 
attend or vote shares at any general 
meeting of the Company or at any 
separate general meeting of the 
holders of any class of shares in 
the Company or upon a poll or 
exercise any other right conferred 
by membership in relation to 
general meetings or polls if he has 
22 not paid all amounts relating to 
those shares which are due at the 
time of the meeting.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
There are the following restrictions 
on the transfer of shares in the 
Company:
•  certain restrictions which may 
from time to time be imposed by 
laws and regulations (for example, 
insider trading laws);
•  pursuant to the Company’s share 
dealing code, the directors and 
senior executives of the Company 
require approval to deal in the 
Company’s shares;
•  where a person with at least a 
0.25% interest in a class of shares 
has been served with a disclosure 
notice and has failed to provide 
the Company with information 
concerning interests in those

Any director who retires at an 
annual general meeting may 
offer himself for reappointment 
by the shareholders.
In accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2010

financial year and beyond), it has 
been decided that all directors 
will stand for re-election at the 
forthcoming AGM.
The Company may by special 
resolution remove any director 
before the expiration of his term 
of office.

of resignation, (ii) he gives the 
Company a written notice in which 
he offers to resign and the directors 
decide to accept this offer, (iii) all 
of the other directors (who must

resign, (iv) he is or has been 
suffering from mental or physical 
ill health and the directors pass a 
resolution removing the director 
from office, (v) he has missed

for a continuous period of six 
months without permission from 
the directors and the directors pass 
a resolution removing the director 
from office, (vi) a bankruptcy order 
is made against him or he makes 
any arrangement or composition 
with his creditors generally, (vii) he 
is prohibited from being a director 
under any applicable legislation,

under any applicable legislation or 
he is removed from office under the

Amendment of the Company’s 
Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Articles of 
Association of the Company may 
be made in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 
by way of special resolution.
Powers of the directors
The business of the Company is 
managed by the directors who 
may exercise all the powers of 
the Company, subject to the 
Company’s Memorandum and 
Articles of Association, any relevant 
legislation and any directions 
given by the Company by passing 
a special resolution at a general 
meeting. In particular, the directors 
may exercise all the powers of 
the Company to borrow money, 
issue shares, appoint and remove 
directors and recommend and 
declare dividends.
Significant agreements
The Company’s facility agreements 
and the private placement loan 
notes agreement, details of which 
can be found in note 22 to the

of the Company. 
23 Directors’ report
Contractual arrangements
The Group has contractual 
arrangements with numerous 
third parties in support of its 
business activities, none of which 
are considered individually to 
be essential to its business and, 
accordingly, it has not been 
considered necessary for an 
understanding of the development, 
performance or position of the 
Group’s business to disclose 
information about any of those 
third parties.
Financial instruments
Information on the Company’s use 
of financial instruments, financial 
risk management objectives and 
policies and exposure is given 
in note 25 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
Compensation for loss of office
There are no agreements between 
the Company and its directors 
or employees providing for 
compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs as a result 
of a takeover bid.
Supplier payment policy
The Company has no trade creditors 
(4 March 2010: nil). The Group 
keeps to the payment terms which 
have been agreed with suppliers. 
Where payment terms have not 
been specifically agreed, it is the 
Group’s policy to settle invoices 
close to the end of the month 
following the month of invoicing. 
The Group’s ability to keep to 
these terms is dependent upon 
suppliers sending accurate and 
adequately detailed invoices to the 
correct address on a timely basis. 
The Group had 48 days’ purchases 
outstanding at 3 March 2011 
(4 March 2010: 48 days), based on 
the trade creditors at that date and 
purchases made during the year.

Employment policies
Whitbread has a range of 
employment policies covering 
such issues as diversity, employee 
well-being and equal opportunities. 
The Company takes its 
responsibilities to the disabled 
seriously and seeks not to 
discriminate against current or 
prospective employees because 
of any disability. Employees who 
become disabled during their career 
at Whitbread will be retained in 
employment wherever possible 
and given help with rehabilitation 
and training. 
Employee involvement
The importance of good 
relations and communications 
with employees is fundamental 
to the continued success of our 
business. Each of the Group’s 
operating businesses maintains 
employee relations and consults 
employees as appropriate to its 
own particular needs. Regular 
internal communications are made 
to all employees to ensure that 
they are kept well informed of the 
performance of the Group. Further 
information can be found in the 
section ‘Our people’ on page 12.
Directors’ indemnity
A qualifying third party indemnity 
provision (as defined in Section 
236 (1) of the Companies Act 2006) 
is in force for the benefit of the 
directors.
 
Purchase of own shares
The Company is authorised to 
purchase its own shares in the 
market. Approval to renew this 
authority for a further year will 
be sought from shareholders at 
the 2011 AGM. 
The Company did not purchase 
any of its own shares during 
the year. 14.3 million shares 
(representing 7.38% of the total 
called up share capital at the 
beginning of the year) are held 
as treasury shares (4 March 2010: 
14.8 million). During the course of 
the year, the company transferred 
500,000 shares from treasury to 
the Employee Share Ownership 
Trust for the future satisfaction 
of awards under the Long Term 
Incentive Plan.

financial year and the date of this report.
Auditor 
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed 
their willingness to continue in 
office as auditor of the Company 
and a resolution proposing their 
reappointment will be put to 
shareholders at the 2011 AGM. 
After proper consideration, the 
Audit Committee is satisfied that 
the Company’s auditor, Ernst 
& Young LLP, continues to be 
objective and independent of 
the Company. In coming to this 
conclusion, the Audit Committee 
gave full consideration to the 
non-audit work carried out by 
Ernst & Young LLP. 
The Audit Committee has 
considered what work should not 
be carried out by the external 
auditor and have concluded that 
certain services, including internal 
audit, acquisition due diligence and 
IT consulting services, will not be 
carried out by Ernst & Young LLP. 
Disclosure of information 
to auditor
The directors have taken all 
reasonable steps to make 
themselves aware of relevant 
audit information and to establish 
that the auditor is aware of that 
information. The directors are 
not aware of any relevant audit 
information which has not been 
disclosed to the auditor. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely 
to effect its future development, 
performance and position are set 
out in the business review on pages 
2 to 19. The financial position of the 
Company, its cash flows, net debt 
and borrowing facilities and the 
maturity of those facilities are set 
out in the Finance Director’s report 
on pages 16 and 17. In addition there 
are further details in the financial 
statements on the Group’s financial 
risk management, objectives and 
policies (note 25) and details of the 
financial instruments (note 26). 
The Group has considerable 
financial resources and, as a 
consequence, the directors believe 
that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks.
The directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements.

The directors’ report that has been drawn up

The Annual Report and Accounts contain 
certain statements about the future outlook

believes that the expectations are based on 
reasonable assumptions, any statements 
about future outlook may be influenced by 
factors that could cause actual outcomes

25 Corporate governance report
Whitbread is committed to 
maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance to enhance 
performance and for the protection 
of its shareholders. It is about 
ensuring that the Company is 
managed with integrity and 
transparency. The new UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the 2010 Code’) 
came into force during the year, but 
only applies to accounting periods 
beginning on or after 29 June 2010. 
For Whitbread’s 2010/11 financial 
year the 2008 Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance (‘the 2008 
Code’) still applied and the Company 
is required to make a compliance 
statement in respect of the 2008 
Code in this report. Simon Barratt, 
General Counsel, explains below how 
the main and supporting principles 
of the 2008 Code (which is available 
at www.frc.org.uk) were applied 
during the year and also provides 
an update on how the Company 
will amend some of its governance 
processes to reflect the 2010 Code.
Did Whitbread comply with 
the 2008 Code?
During the year the Company 
complied with all provisions set 
out in Section 1 of the 2008 Code. 
Details of how Whitbread has 
applied the main and supporting 
principles of the 2008 Code with 
regard to remuneration can be 
found in the remuneration report on 
pages 31 to 34. In addition, details of 
the membership and activities of the 
Remuneration Committee can be 
found on page 29.
How did the Board satisfy 
itself of the adequacy of 
its governance procedures?
The General Counsel prepared 
a full report to the Board on 
the Company’s governance 
arrangements. This was considered 
at the January Board meeting 
where it was concluded that the 
Company had been fully compliant 
with the 2008 Code during the year. 
In addition, the Company takes the 
view that corporate governance 
is not a matter for the Board or 
its committees alone in behaving 
and working in the right way. The 
Code of Ethics covers dealings with 
customers, suppliers and government 
officials; safeguarding the Company’s 
assets; keeping accurate and reliable 
records; and avoiding conflicts of 
interest. Its principal message is 
that all employees must behave 
with honesty and integrity. A new 
Global Code of Conduct is being 
developed, partly in order to align 
the Company's policies with the 
new UK Bribery Act, and will be 
briefed to employees. 
The Board
Who is on the Board of directors?
The Board currently comprises the 
Chairman, three executive directors 
and five independent non-executive 
directors, one of whom has been 
appointed Senior Independent 
Director. Biographies of each of the 
directors are set out on pages 20 
and 21 of the Annual Report. We 
believe that the balance of skills 
and experience on the Board is 
appropriate for the requirements 
of the Company.
Is there clarity between the roles of 
the Chairman and Chief Executive?
The roles of Chairman and Chief 
Executive are separate, with 
responsibilities clearly divided 
between them.
The Chairman is responsible for:
•  leadership of the Board and 
setting its agenda;
•   ensuring, through the General 
Counsel, that the members of the 
Board receive accurate, timely and 
clear information and that there is 
a good flow of information;
•  working with the Chief Executive 
to ensure effective communication 
with shareholders;
•  ensuring a culture of openness and 
debate around the Board table;
•  managing the Board to ensure 
that sufficient time is allowed for 
the discussion of complex  
or contentious issues;
•  ensuring that the directors 
continually update their 
knowledge and capabilities;
•  ensuring that the members of the 
Board develop an understanding of 
the views of the major investors; and
•  the annual evaluation of the 
performance of the Board and 
its committees and implementing 
the action required following 
such evaluation.
The Chief Executive is responsible for:
•  recommending the strategic 
direction of the Company;
•  overseeing the day-to-day 
management of the Company;
•  the line management of senior 
executives;
•  the activities of the Whitbread 
Directors’ Forum – a group of 
the Company’s most senior 
executives; and
•  ensuring effective communication 
with shareholders and employees.
How important is the role of the 
non-executive directors?
The non-executive directors play 
a very important role on the 
Whitbread Board in giving the 
benefit of their experience and 
knowledge and by constructively 
challenging the Whitbread 
executive team.
In particular, Whitbread’s non-
executive directors add great 
value in the following areas:
•  Strategy – constructively 
challenging and helping to 
develop proposals on strategy;
•  Performance – scrutinising the 
performance of management 
in meeting agreed goals and 
objectives and monitoring the 
reporting of performance; and
•  Risk – being satisfied through the 
activity of the Audit Committee, 
the Finance Director and the 
executive team that appropriate 
processes are in place for 
producing the appropriate 
financial information, and 
assessing the financial controls 
and systems of risk management.
What is the role of the Senior 
Independent Director?
Stephen Williams, as the Senior 
Independent Director, is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns 
which the normal channels have 
failed to resolve or which would 
be inappropriate to raise with the 
Chairman or the executive team. 
He also:
•  leads the evaluation of the 
Chairman on behalf of the other 
directors;
•  provides support to the Chairman 
in the delivery of his objectives;
•  provides a sounding board for the 
Chairman; and
•  is available to serve as an 
intermediary for the other 
directors if necessary.
How does the Board demonstrate 
independence?
The Board is committed to 
ensuring a majority of directors are 
independent. The non-executive 
directors all act in an independent 
manner at meetings in providing 
constructive challenge. Additionally, 
both the 2008 and 2010 Codes list a 
number of circumstances that might 
call the independence of a director 
into question and the Board is 
satisfied that no such circumstances 
exist for any of the Company’s non-
executive directors. None of the 
current non-executive directors have 
served for longer than nine years. 
26 In line with the 2010 Code all 
directors will be subject to annual 
re-election from this year onwards.
How does the Board operate? 
The Board holds meetings 
regularly and for specific purposes, as 
and when required. During the year 
there were eleven Board meetings. 
Attendance by directors at Board 
meetings and Board committees 
is set out in the table on page 29. 
Before each Board meeting directors 
are given timely and appropriate 
information, including monthly 
financial and trading reports. 
There is a schedule of matters 
which are dealt with exclusively by 
the Board. These include approval 
of financial statements and the 
preliminary announcement of the half 
and full-year results, changes relating 
to the Group’s capital structure, 
the Group business plan, the Group 
budget, material investments or 
disposals, fundamental changes 
to the internal control system and 
maintaining sound risk management 
and internal control systems. 
What were the Board’s key 
activities during the year?
During the year, among other 
considerations, the Board:
•  reviewed and agreed the Group’s 
business plans and strategy;
• set the budget for the year; 
•  reviewed the operational and 
financial performance of the 
businesses;
•  oversaw the orderly succession of 
Chief Executive;
•  reviewed the funding policy and 
agreed the US private placement;
•  approved the acquisition of  
Coffee Nation; and
•  reviewed the YOUR SAY 
engagement results. 
What is the Board’s policy and 
procedure for identifying and 
considering directors’ conflicts 
of interest?
The Companies Act 2006 provisions 
relating to the duty of directors to 
avoid conflicts of interest came into 
force in October 2008. In August 
2008 the directors completed a 
questionnaire to determine whether 
any conflicts or potential conflicts 
required authorisation by the 
Board. The conflicts and potential 
conflicts disclosed by directors 
were considered and authorised by 
the Board at the following Board 
meeting. Any new directors joining 
the Board are required to complete 
the same questionnaire.
Directors are required to notify 
the General Counsel of any new 
conflicts or potential conflicts as 
and when they arise during the 
year. These are then considered 
and approved by the Board, if 
appropriate, at the next meeting. 
All authorisations are for a period 
of twelve months and an annual 
process is in place for the Board to 
review all notifications and approve 
them for a further twelve months. 
In authorising a conflict or potential 
conflict, the Board considers 
whether the matter being approved 
would affect the director’s ability 
to act in accordance with his/her 
duties to the Company. No director 
is counted as part of a quorum 
in respect of the authorisation of 
his/her own conflict situation. It 
is recognised that all companies/
organisations are potential 
customers of Whitbread and the 
Board has authorised all directors’ 
current external directorships on 
that basis.
How does the Board review 
its performance?
During the year the performance 
of the Board, and individual 
directors’ contributions to the 
Board, are appraised by the 
Chairman. This year each director 
completed a formal questionnaire 
on the Board’s performance and 
the Chairman met or spoke to each 
director on a one to one basis. 
The performance of the Board’s 
committees was also reviewed 
during the year.
The results of the review were 
discussed by the Board and 
appropriate action plans were 
agreed. There was a consistently 
positive response from directors 
on the effectiveness of the Board 
and its committees. As a result of 
the review a number of actions 
will be taken including giving 
greater opportunity for the non-
executive members of the Board 
to visit Whitbread outlets, and the 
introduction of an updated rolling 
Board meeting agenda. 
The performance of the Chairman 
is evaluated during the year by 
the Senior Independent Director 
who reviews the Chairman’s 
performance with each of the 
directors and discusses the results 
with the Chairman.
A provision of the 2010 Code states 
that evaluation of the Board should 
be externally facilitated at least 
every three years. The Board is 
considering the manner in which 
it will respond to this provision.
How are directors kept up to date 
with new developments?
The monthly Secretariat report 
gives updates to directors on 
relevant corporate legislation, such 
as the Bribery Act, and specific 
sessions are arranged at Board 
meetings on topics such as health 
and safety and pensions. During 
the year directors attended training 
courses and seminars, or received 
tailored training, on a number of 
relevant issues including: 
• company law;
• board practice;
• audit committees;
• remuneration committees;
• health and safety;
• role of the Chairman;
• stewardship code;
• challenge of leadership;
• corporate responsibility;
• pensions; and
• board responsibility.
The Board receives regular 
investor relations reports, which 
include share price performance, 
movements in institutional holdings 
and the reaction of investors to 
the communications programme. 
The Board is also informed of legal 
and corporate governance updates 
and best practice.
27 Corporate governance report
Internal control
Does the Company maintain 
adequate systems of internal 
control?
The Board is responsible for the 
Group’s systems of internal control 
and risk management, and for 
reviewing their effectiveness. These 
systems are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives. They 
can only provide reasonable, and 
not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established an 
ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the 
Group’s significant risks. This 
process was in place throughout 
the 2010/11 financial year and up 
to the date of this report. The 
process is regularly reviewed by the 
Board and accords with the internal 
control guidance for directors in 
the Combined Code. A report of 
the key risks can be found on 
pages 18 and 19. 
Key elements of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control 
system include:
•  the formulation, evaluation and 
annual approval by the Board 
of business plans and budgets. 
Actual results are reported 
monthly against budget and the 
previous year’s figures. Key risks 
are identified and action plans 
prepared accordingly;
•  the production by each business 
of a risks and controls matrix, 
covering major risks and plans 
which are considered regularly 
by the management boards 
and form the basis of the Group 
risks matrix considered by the 
Audit Committee;
•  a regular review by the Board of 
changes in the major risks facing 
the Group and development of 
appropriate action plans;
•  the consideration of risks and 
appropriate action plans, when 
appraising and approving all 
major capital and revenue projects 
and change programmes. A post 
completion review of each major 
project is undertaken;
•  financial policies, controls and 
procedures manuals, which are 
regularly reviewed and updated;
•  the limits of authority, which 
are prescribed for employees. 
Whitbread’s organisational 
structure allows the appropriate 
segregation of tasks;
•  the Code of Ethics, which is 
communicated to employees;
•  the operational audit team (which 
has been outsourced to PwC) 
activity, which reports on the 
effectiveness of operational and 
financial controls across the Group; 
and
•  the Audit Committee regularly 
reviews the major findings from 
both operational and external 
audit.
Management and specialists 
within the finance department 
are responsible for ensuring the 
appropriate maintenance of financial 
records and processes that ensure 
all financial information is relevant, 
reliable, in accordance with the 
applicable laws and regulations, 
and distributed both internally 
and externally in a timely manner. 
A review of the consolidation and 
financial statements is completed 
by management to ensure that the 
financial position and results of the 
Group are appropriately reflected. 
All financial information published 
by the Group is subject to the 
approval of the Audit Committee. 
The Board, acting through the Audit 
Committee, has directed the work 
of PwC’s operational audit team to 
a rolling risk based audit agenda. 
The Committee approves a rolling 
audit programme, ensuring that all 
significant areas of the business 
are independently reviewed within 
at least a three year period. The 
programme and findings of the 
reviews are continually assessed 
to ensure they take account of 
the latest information and, in 
particular, the results of the annual 
review of internal controls. The 
effectiveness of the operational 
audit team is reviewed annually by 
the Committee. The Committee 
considers the principal risks 
identified by the risk management 
process which are also considered 
by the main and management 
boards throughout the year.
An annual review of internal controls 
is undertaken by the Board with the 
assistance of the Audit Committee, 
which reports to the March Board 
meeting. 
Board committees
What committees does the 
Board have?
The Company has an Audit 
Committee, a Nomination Committee 
and a Remuneration Committee. The 
committees operate within defined 
terms of reference, copies of which 
can be found on the Company’s 
website: www.whitbread.co.uk. 
Audit Committee
Members of Committee:
Simon Melliss (Chairman)
Richard Baker
Wendy Becker
The Audit Committee comprises 
three non-executive directors under 
the chairmanship of Simon Melliss, 
who is Chief Financial Officer of 
Hammerson plc, and has recent  
and relevant financial experience.
The role of the Committee is 
to assist the Board in fulfilling 
its corporate governance and 
oversight responsibilities by: 
•  monitoring, reviewing and 
reporting to the Board on 
the integrity of the financial 
statements, the effectiveness of 
the Group’s risk management 
system and internal controls, 
the scope, objectivity and 
effectiveness of the operational 
auditors, the independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness of the 
external auditors, and any matters 
in respect of which it considers 
that action or improvement is 
needed in this context and making 
recommendations as to the steps 
to be taken;
•  developing and implementing 
policy on the engagement of the 
external auditor to supply non-
audit services; and
•  making recommendations to 
the Board, for it to be put to the 
shareholders for their approval 
in general meeting, in relation to 
the appointment of the external 
auditors, and approving the 
remuneration and terms of their 
engagement.
28 The Committee generally holds 
three meetings in a year. In 
October and April each year the 
Committee considers the half 
and full-year financial statements 
respectively. As part of that process 
the management team present 
the statements to the Committee 
with the external auditors (Ernst & 
Young) and operational auditors 
(PwC) present. Ernst & Young 
present a paper on the audit/review 
process and the main points of 
discussion that have arisen. PwC 
report on the internal audits carried 
out in the respective periods. 
In March each year the Committee 
considers, in detail, internal control 
processes including treasury, tax 
and retail audit reports along with 
a Group risk analysis.
The performance of the external 
and operational audits are 
considered each year along 
with the effectiveness of the 
Committee itself. The Committee 
also meets with both the external 
and operational auditors without 
the executive team being present. 
Terms of reference are reviewed 
annually. 
During the year the Audit 
Committee engaged in a full review 
of the provision of external audit 
services, where other audit firms 
were given the opportunity to 
tender. Following presentations from 
each bidding firm it was agreed that 
Ernst & Young would continue to be 
the Company’s auditor.
Remuneration Committee
Members of Committee:
Ian Cheshire (Chairman)
Richard Baker
Wendy Becker
Anthony Habgood
Stephen Williams
The Remuneration Committee

directors and the Company 
Chairman under the chairmanship 
of Ian Cheshire who is Group Chief 
Executive of Kingfisher plc. Ian 
replaced Philip Clarke as Chairman 
of the Committee on 1 March 2011.
The Remuneration Committee’s 
role is to assist the Board in 
determining the remuneration of 
the executive directors and the 
Chairman, approving the executive 
incentive schemes and monitoring 
the remuneration of other senior 
executives. Full details of the 
Committee’s work are set out in 
the remuneration report on pages 
31 to 34.
Nomination Committee
Members of Committee:
Anthony Habgood (Chairman)
Simon Melliss
Stephen Williams
The Nomination Committee

Chairman, who also chairs the 
Committee.
The Nomination Committee is 
responsible for succession planning 
and regularly reviews the structure, 
size and composition of the Board 
and makes recommendations to the 
Board with regard to any potential 
appointments. Before making 
recommendations an evaluation 
of the skills and experience on the 
Board is made and a description 
of the role and capabilities 
required is prepared. During 
the current year the Committee 
recommended the appointment 
of Ian Cheshire having appointed 
an external search consultancy. 
The appointment followed the 
decision of Philip Clarke to step 
down from the Board as a result of 
his appointment as Chief Executive 
of Tesco. Ian Cheshire is a serving

29 Corporate governance report
Shareholder relations
Any shareholder may contact the 
Chairman or, if appropriate, the 
Senior Independent Director to 
raise any issue, including those 
relating to strategy and governance. 
Alternatively, shareholders may 
raise any such issues with one or 
all of the non-executive directors 
of the Company. The General 
Counsel can facilitate any such 
communication if requested. 
Recent topics of interest to investors 
have been the new Chief Executive’s 
strategic plans, the development 
of dynamic pricing in Premier Inn, 
expansion plans for the businesses, 
including internationally and the 
impact of continuing cost inflation.
How does the Company interact 
with institutional investors?
Institutional shareholders, fund 
managers and analysts are 
briefed at regular meetings and 
presentations. Following the full 
year and interim results in April 
and October respectively, the 
Chief Executive and the Finance 
Director have meetings with 
institutional investors. The Chairman 
also had meetings with a number 
of the largest shareholders in 
the Company during the year. 
Andy Harrison met a number 
of shareholders when he joined 
the Company to get a good 
understanding of their views. 
At the annual Board strategy 
meeting in November 2010, 
reports were presented which 
described the views of major 
shareholders of the Company 
and its current strategy. It is 
believed that the Board, including 
the Senior Independent Director, 
has an adequate understanding 
of the issues and concerns of 
major shareholders. No other 
meetings have been requested 
by shareholders with the Chairman 
or Senior Independent Director. 
Non-executive directors are able 
to attend these meetings and 
would do so if requested by 
major shareholders. 
How does the Company interact 
with private investors?
Annual and interim results 
presentations are webcast live so 
that all shareholders can receive 
the same information at the same 
time. The Company has taken 
advantage of the provisions in the 
Companies Act 2006, which allows 
communication to be made with 
shareholders electronically unless 
they have requested hard copy 
documentation. The Company’s 
website provides comprehensive 
information for private shareholders, 
with the Annual Report and 
Accounts, trading statements, 
interim management statements 
and public announcements all being 
available at www.whitbread.co.uk.
The Board recognises the 
importance of two-way 
communication with the Company’s 
shareholders and believes the 
Annual General Meeting provides 
a forum for the Board to inform 
shareholders about how the 
Company has performed during 
the year. Private shareholders have 
the opportunity to put questions 
to the Board at the AGM and at all 
other times by emailing or writing 
to the Company. Wherever possible, 
all directors attend the AGM. At 
the 2011 AGM, all voting will be 
on a poll. Electronic handsets will 
be utilised and voting results will 
be displayed on a screen at the 
meeting. In addition, the audited 
poll results will be disclosed on 
the Company’s website following 
the meeting, and announced 
by regulatory news service. The 
information that is required by 
DTR 7.2.6, information relating to 
the share capital of the Company, 
can be found within the directors’ 
report on pages 22 and 25.
30 Introduction from Ian Cheshire
When I joined the Board of 
Whitbread I was pleased to be 
given the opportunity to chair the 
Remuneration Committee. I would 
like to thank Philip Clarke, who 
preceded me, for his contribution 
as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee.
The future success of Whitbread 
is dependent on the skills and 
enthusiasm of the people who work 
in our businesses. It is important 
that employees throughout the 
organisation are motivated to 
continue to deliver outstanding 
service to our customers and value 
to our shareholders. We consider 
the pay and employment conditions 
across the Group when determining 
executive remuneration.
In this report you will find a 
summary of key facts, information 
about our current remuneration 
policy and the TSR graph, 
followed by a series of questions 
and answers. The usual tables 
outlining directors’ remuneration 
and share scheme participation 
are at the back of this report. The 
remuneration report will be the 
subject of a shareholder resolution 
to be proposed at the AGM. There 
are parts of this report that have 
to be audited and these are clearly 
marked as ‘audited information’.
Key points are:
•  we have recently decided to 
extend eligibility to LTIP awards 
to an additional 32 executives in 
order to incentivise them over the 
medium term, and shareholding 
guidelines have been introduced 
for this group;
•  the increase in profits has resulted 
in good bonuses deservedly 
being awarded, with a significant 
proportion of these bonuses paid 
in deferred shares; 
•  based on a strong performance 
over the past three years, the 
2008 LTIP award has vested at 
82.4% of its maximum;
•  Towers Watson was appointed as 
the Committee’s external adviser; 
and
•  Alan Parker retired as Chief 
Executive during the year and 
we implemented the leaving 
arrangements disclosed in last 
year’s remuneration report.

31 Remuneration report
Questions & Answers
In this section, Ian Cheshire answers 
questions on how remuneration is 
managed at Whitbread.
Does Whitbread’s Remuneration 
Committee fully meet the 
requirements of the 2008 Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance?
Yes, the membership of the 
Committee is compliant with the 
Combined Code.
The Combined Code (which is 
available at www.frc.org.uk) sets 
out the duties and powers which 
companies are expected to delegate 
to their remuneration committees. 
Whitbread’s Committee has terms 
of reference (available at www.
whitbread.co.uk or by requesting 
a copy in writing from the General 
Counsel’s office) which set out 
its duties and powers and these 
terms of reference comply with the 
Combined Code. These terms of 
reference have been reviewed and 
implemented by the Committee.
The Committee met eight times 
in 2010/11. The attendance 
of individual members of the 
Committee at meetings is shown 
on page 29.
Who provides advice to the 
Committee?
During the year, the Committee 
ran a tender process to determine 
which independent remuneration 
consultants would provide advice 
for the future. This was a thorough 
and robust process. The result was 
that Towers Watson was appointed 
as the Committee’s new adviser and 
we look forward to working with 
them. Hewitt New Bridge Street 
provides external advice in relation 
to the LTIP vesting calculations. In 
addition, internal advice is received 
from the Group Human Resources 
Director, Louise Smalley. Simon 
Barratt, General Counsel, acts as 
Secretary to the Committee.
The Group also receives advice 
on the implementation of the 
Committee’s decisions and 
recommendations from Towers 
Watson and Slaughter and May. 
Towers Watson provides pay 
benchmarking, retirement and 
change management services 
and Slaughter and May provides 
legal services.
What are the main principles of 
Whitbread’s remuneration policy?
It is important that our senior 
executives have the skills, expertise, 
enthusiasm and drive to achieve the 
Group’s objectives resulting in the 
long-term sustainable success of the 
business. Our job is to ensure that 
the overall remuneration package is 
sufficiently competitive to attract, 
retain and motivate executives with 
the necessary attributes.
We are determined to ensure 
that the interests of executives 
and shareholders are aligned and 
we recognise the importance of 
having a significant proportion of 
an executive’s remuneration being 
linked to performance as well as the 
importance of the balance between 
short and long-term rewards. 
How are base salaries determined?
We review base salaries on an 
annual basis and consider a number 
of factors, including market data 
as well as pay and employment 
conditions across the Group. When 
awarding a base salary increase to 
an executive director, we take into 
account the personal performance 
of the director measured against 
agreed objectives as well as the 
trading circumstances across 
the whole Group. Any salary 
increases take effect from 1 May. 
The Committee has agreed salary 
increases for the executive directors 
as follows.
Increase Salary from 
1 May 2011
Andy 
Harrison
2.5% £717,500
Christopher 
Rogers
3.0% £504,700
Patrick 
Dempsey
5.0% £420,000
Fees for the Chairman and non-
executive directors have remained 
unchanged and will be reviewed 
during the year.
Are executives entitled to 
other benefits?
All executive directors are entitled 
to life assurance and private health 
cover. Non-core benefits, for which 
cash alternatives are available, 
are family health cover and a fully 
expensed company car.
What are the pension 
arrangements for executive 
directors?
Our policy is to pay a Company 
contribution of 25% of salary for 
executive directors, with these 
contributions being increased 
by a further 2.5% of salary after 
each of five and ten years’ service. 
Executives are given the option 
of receiving a monthly amount 
in cash (less an amount equal to 
the employer’s national insurance 
payable on the amount) instead of 
the Company pension contribution.
Full details of the directors’ 
pension entitlements, including 
cash supplements, can be found 
on page 35.
How does the Whitbread 
Incentive Scheme Work?
The Whitbread Incentive Scheme 
(WIS), is a bonus scheme which 
applies to approximately 50 
executives. The scheme is intended 
to provide a clear link between 
annual performance and reward for 
key executives. It promotes alignment 
with shareholders by providing a 
significant proportion of the bonus 
earned in the form of deferred shares.
There are two elements of the WIS 
for 2011/12:
• a profit element; and
•  a WINcard (further details can 
be found on page 13) element 
(excluding profit growth).
At the beginning of the financial 
year profit targets are set for 
the Group and its businesses. 
Depending on the profit 
performance achieved during the 
year, a bonus award of cash and 
deferred shares may be made at the 
end of the year. The cash element of 
the bonus is payable immediately. 
The deferred shares will normally 
be transferred into the executive’s 
name three years after the award 
date as long as the executive 
remains employed by the Whitbread 
Group during that period.
32 For 2011/12 the levels of cash and 
deferred shares (expressed as 
percentages of base salaries) that 
can be awarded at different levels 
of performance to executive 
directors are as follows:
Performance Bonus earned 
(% of salary)
Below threshold Nil
At threshold 7% cash 
15% deferred 
shares
On target 20% cash 
37% deferred 
shares
Stretch or above 49% cash 
(maximum 
payable) 
88% deferred 
shares
Straight lines operate between 
the above levels of performance. 
Threshold will be the minimum level 
at which awards will be earned. The 
level of performance required to 
achieve threshold has been raised 
for 2011/12. The target level of 
performance will be consistent with 
budgeted performance and stretch 
will be significantly above budget. 
The profit element of the bonus will 
be reduced if a return on capital 
hurdle is not achieved. The failure 
to meet this hurdle would result in 
the reduction of cash and deferred 
shares payable as outlined above 
being reduced by 25%.
Targets for future financial years 
will be determined by the 
Committee at, or near to, the 
beginning of each financial year.
The Committee assesses the 
results of the business at the end 
of each financial year, as well as 
the performance of each executive 
director against pre-determined 
targets before agreeing the awards.
Whitbread uses the WINcard to 
manage its businesses, but to what 
extent are executives incentivised 
based on WINcard measures?
Profit growth, a key WINcard 
measure, is the main basis for 
awards made under the WIS. 
Executives may also earn a 
maximum cash bonus of 30% of 
base salary for meeting other 
WINcard targets. This has increased 
from 20% in the prior year in order 
to place greater emphasis on 
performance against the WINcard. 
However, the maximum bonus 
opportunity is unchanged. These 
targets apply to all management 
throughout the Company. They are 
set at the beginning of the financial 
year and, for executive directors, 
performance against other WINcard 
measures is reviewed and approved 
by the Committee after the year-
end. The WINcard element of the 
bonus will be reduced in the event 
that a health and safety hurdle is 
not achieved. Further details on the 
WINcard can be found on page 13.
What is the Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP)?
The LTIP is all about the future. 
It rewards executives with share 
awards if earnings and relative total 
shareholder return performance 
conditions are met over a three-year 
period. For 2011/12, LTIP participation 
will be extended to an additional 32 
executives in order to provide greater 
focus on the longer term. Executive 
directors will be granted awards in 
2011/12 calculated as follows:
% of salary
Andy Harrison 125%
Christopher Rogers 125%
Patrick Dempsey 100%
The shares will normally only be 
transferred into the executive’s 
name in the event that the 
executive remains a Whitbread 
employee and that performance 
conditions are met over a three-
year performance period.
How are the LTIP performance 
conditions selected and what 
are they?
The Committee selects performance 
conditions that it believes will 
closely align the interests of 
executives with the creation of 
long-term sustainable value.
For awards made in 2011, as 
was the case for awards made in 
2010, two performance conditions 
have been selected. Each condition 
will apply to half of the awards. 
The two conditions are relative 
total shareholder return (TSR) and 
earnings per share (EPS) growth 
as shown on page 34.
The measurement of relative TSR 
will compare Whitbread’s TSR 
with that of a comparator group of 
companies over a three-year period. 
For the 2011 awards, this will be 
the period from 4 March 2011 to 
27 February 2014. Averaging will 
take place before the start and end 
of the performance period to reduce 
the impact of short-term share price 
fluctuations. The Committee has 
decided that the most appropriate 
comparator group for 2011 awards 
continues to be the FTSE 51-150 
excluding companies in the financial 
services, mining and oil & gas.
Our policy for the EPS targets is 
that there must be real growth of 
4% to 10% per annum from the most 
recent EPS figure at the time of 
grant. Again this is measured over 
three years, with the third year’s EPS 
determining the vesting level. The 
EPS and TSR targets for unvested 
awards are set out in the table on 
page 37.
The TSR calculations are produced 
for the Committee by Hewitt 
New Bridge Street, while the EPS 
calculations are verified by the 
Company’s auditor Ernst & Young 
LLP. The results are considered by 
the Committee before the vesting 
level is confirmed.
Have any LTIP awards vested 
in 2011?
The awards made in 2008 
were subject to a relative TSR 
performance condition and EPS 
condition. The EPS performance 
condition was partially met and 
the TSR of Whitbread was in the 
upper quartile of the FTSE 51-150 
comparator group, resulting in an 
overall vesting level of 82.4%.
Are executive directors required 
to hold Whitbread shares?
Under our share ownership 
guidelines executive directors 
are required to build and hold a 
shareholding equal to 100% of their 
salary within five years and other 
senior executives 50% of salary.
33 Remuneration report
Did Andy Harrison receive any 
awards on appointment?
As was disclosed in last year’s 
annual report, Andy Harrison 
received two awards under the 
terms of his appointment. Firstly, 
Andy received an LTIP award to the 
value of 175% of his base salary. This 
award is subject to the same terms 
as the LTIP awards received by the 
other executive directors and will 
vest, subject to the satisfaction of 
performance conditions, at the end 
of the 2012/13 financial year.
In addition, Andy was entitled to 
a matching award if he purchased 
£1 million worth of Whitbread 
shares by the end of the financial 
year that has just ended. Andy 
demonstrated his belief in the 
future success of the Company by 
purchasing 161,673 shares. Andy 
purchased 67,468 shares for his 
initial £1 million investment and this 
is the number of shares over which 
he has been granted a matching 
award. This award is subject to the 
same performance conditions as 
the 2010 LTIP awards, but with no 
vesting at threshold performance. 
The performance period will run 
from 4 March 2011 to 27 February 
2014. It is also contingent on Andy’s 
retention of the original 67,468 
shares he purchased. 
Did Alan Parker receive any 
bonuses or awards when 
he retired?
Last year it was explained in this 
report that Alan Parker would not 
receive an LTIP award in 2010, but 
would be entitled to a cash award of 
50% of his base salary for achieving 
a number of non-profit targets 
related to the Chief Executive 
transition process. Alan achieved 
these objectives and received a 
cash payment of £357,750. Alan is 
also entitled to a pro-rated bonus 
for the 2010/11 financial year from 
the WIS. Details of the cash and 
deferred share awards he has 
received can be found on page 35. 
The deferred shares will vest at the 
end of the 2013/14 financial year 
along with the awards made this 
year to other executives.
How is the remuneration of the 
Chairman and the non-executive 
directors determined?
The fees paid to non-executive 
directors are determined by the 
Chairman, together with the 
executive directors. The Chairman’s 
remuneration is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee, but the 
Chairman is not present at these 
discussions.
The LTIP awards granted in 2011 will vest in three years’ time as follows:
TSR Condition (applies to half of the award)
Position at which the Company is ranked Proportion of award vesting to executive
Upper quartile and above Full vesting
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata on a straight line between 
quarter and full vesting
Median (threshold) Quarter of the award vests
Below Median This half of the award does not vest
EPS Condition (applies to half of the award)
2013/14 EPS: required annual percentage growth 
above Whitbread’s 2010/11 EPS
Proportion of award vesting to executive
RPI +10% or above per annum Full vesting 
Between RPI +4% and RPI +10% per annum Pro rata on a straight line between 
quarter and full vesting
RPI +4% per annum (threshold) Quarter of the award vests
Below RPI +4% per annum This half of the award does not vest
34 Directors’ pension entitlements 
(audited information)
None of the executive directors are 
accruing benefits under any other 
company pension arrangements. No 
elements of the executive directors’

**  As explained on pages 33 and 34, under the terms of Andy Harrison’s appointment, he received a matching award over 67,468 shares on 
1 March 2011. The award is subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and the continued retention of the same number of shares 
previously purchased by Andy. The performance conditions are the same as those for the general 2010 LTIP award, except that the 
performance period runs for three years up to the end of the 2013/14 financial year and that there is no vesting at threshold performance.  
The LTIP award made to Andy Harrison when he joined the Company on 1 September 2010 was, under the rules of the Plan, technically 
made on 1 March 2011 and was therefore based on the same market price as awards made earlier in the year.

The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to the 
director remaining an employee of Whitbread at that date. If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread 
prior to the release date by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other 
reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee the awards will be released in full. If the 
director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread for any other reason the proportion of award which vests 
depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date the director ceases to be an employee. 
If the director leaves within the first year after an award is made none of the award vests, between the first 
and second anniversary 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary 50% vests.

Share Option Scheme which is open to all employees on the same terms.
The exercise periods shown below are the normal exercise periods at the date of grant. Actual exercise periods 
are subject to change in accordance with the rules of the schemes when a director ceases to be employed by 
the Company.
At 3 March 2011 the directors and previous executive directors held the following share options under the Savings-
related Share Option Scheme, with the latest exercise date being July 2016. Savings-related share options have a

of exercise where the shares were retained.
Employee Share Ownership Trust 
(ESOT)
The Company funds an ESOT to 
enable it to acquire and hold shares 
for the LTIP, matching awards and 
the Whitbread Incentive Scheme. 
As at 27 April 2011, the ESOT held 
904,321 shares. The executive 
directors each have a technical 
interest in these shares as potential 
beneficiaries of the trust but no 
shares in the trust are earmarked 
to any individuals. All dividends on 
shares in the ESOT are waived by 
the Trustee. During the period from 
4 March 2011 to 27 April 2011, no 
director has exercised an option to 
call for the transfer of shares from 
the ESOT.
Share price information
The mid-market price of Whitbread 
ordinary shares on 3 March 2011 was  
1708.0p (4 March 2010: 1472.0p). 
The highest and lowest price paid 
for ordinary shares during the 
year were as 1887.0p and 1266.0p 
respectively.
Changes since 3 March 2011
There have been no changes in 
directors’ interests in ordinary 
shares since 3 March 2011.

responsibilities
The	directors	are	responsible		
for	preparing	the	Annual	Report		
and	the	consolidated	financial	
statements	in	accordance	with	
applicable	company	law	and	those	
International	Financial	Reporting	
Standards	(IFRSs)	as	adopted	by		
the	European	Union.
Under	company	law	the	directors	
must	not	approve	the	Group	
financial	statements	unless	they	are	
satisfied	that	they	present	fairly	the	
financial	position	of	the	Group	and	
the	results	and	cash	flows	of	the	
Group	for	that	period.	In	preparing	
those	financial	statements,	the	
directors	are	required	to:
•		 select	suitable	accounting	
policies	in	accordance	with	IAS	8:	
Accounting	policies,	changes	in	
accounting	estimates	and	errors,	
and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•		 make	judgements	and	estimates	
that	are	reasonable	and	prudent;
•		 state	that	the	Group	financial	
statements	comply	with	IFRS	
subject	to	any	material	departures	
being	disclosed	and	explained	in	
the	financial	statements;
•		 prepare	the	accounts	on	a	
going	concern	basis	unless	it	is	
inappropriate	to	presume	that	the	
Group	will	continue	in	its	business;
•		 present	information,	including	
accounting	policies,	in	a	manner	
that	provides	relevant,	reliable,	
comparable	and	understandable	
information;	and
•		 provide	additional	disclosures	
when	compliance	with	the	specific	
requirements	in	IFRSs	is	insufficient	
to	enable	users	to	understand	the	
impact	of	particular	transactions,	
other	events	and	conditions	on	
the	Group’s	financial	position	and	
financial	performance.
The	directors	are	responsible	for	
keeping	adequate	accounting	
records,	which	disclose	with	
reasonable	accuracy	at	any	time	
the	financial	position	of	the	Group	
and	enable	them	to	ensure	that	the	
Group	financial	statements	comply	
with	the	Companies	Act	2006	and	
Article	4	of	the	IAS	Regulation.	They	
are	also	responsible	for	safeguarding	
the	assets	of	the	Group	and	hence,	
taking	reasonable	steps	for	the	
prevention	and	detection	of	fraud	
and	other	irregularities.
Responsibility statement 
We	confirm	on	behalf	of	the	Board	
that,	to	the	best	of	our	knowledge:
•		 the	financial	statements,	prepared	
in	accordance	with	International	
Financial	Reporting	Standards	as	
adopted	by	the	EU,	give	a	true	and	
fair	view	of	the	assets,	liabilities,	
financial	position	and	profit	of	the	
Group	taken	as	a	whole;	and
•		 the	directors’	report	includes	a	
fair	review	of	the	development	
and	performance	of	the	business	
and	the	position	of	the	Group	
taken	as	a	whole,	together	with	a	
description	of	the	principal	risks	
and	uncertainties	that	they	face.

Chief	Executive	 Finance	Director	
	
Directors’	responsibility	for	the	consolidated	financial	
statements/audit	report
40 Independent auditor’s report to  
the members of Whitbread PLC	
We	have	audited	the	Group	financial	
statements	of	Whitbread	PLC	for		
the	year	ended	3	March	2011	which	
comprise	the	Consolidated	Income	
Statement,	the	Consolidated	
Statement	of	Comprehensive	
Income,	the	Consolidated	Statement	
of	Changes	in	Equity,	the	Consolidated	
Balance	Sheet,	the	Consolidated	
Cash	Flow	Statement	and	the	related	
notes	1	to	34.	The	financial	reporting	
framework	that	has	been	applied	in	
their	preparation	is	applicable	law	
and	International	Financial	Reporting	
Standards	(IFRSs)	as	adopted	by		
the	European	Union.
This	report	is	made	solely	to	the	
Company’s	members,	as	a	body,	in	
accordance	with	Chapter	3	of	Part	
16	of	the	Companies	Act	2006.	Our	
audit	work	has	been	undertaken	so	
that	we	might	state	to	the	Company’s	
members	those	matters	we	are	
required	to	state	to	them	in	an	
auditor’s	report	and	for	no	other	
purpose.	To	the	fullest	extent	
permitted	by	law,	we	do	not	accept	
or	assume	responsibility	to	anyone	
other	than	the	Company	and	the	
Company’s	members	as	a	body,	for	
our	audit	work,	for	this	report,	or		
for	the	opinions	we	have	formed.
Respective responsibilities of 
directors and auditors
As	explained	more	fully	in	the	
Directors’	Responsibilities	Statement	
set	out	above,	the	directors	are	
responsible	for	the	preparation	of	
the	Group	financial	statements	and	
for	being	satisfied	that	they	give	a	
true	and	fair	view.	Our	responsibility	
is	to	audit	and	express	an	opinion	
on	the	Group	financial	statements	in	
accordance	with	applicable	law	and	
International	Standards	on	Auditing	
(UK	and	Ireland).	Those	standards	
require	us	to	comply	with	the	
Auditing	Practices	Board’s	Ethical	
Standards	for	Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the  
financial statements 
An	audit	involves	obtaining	evidence	
about	the	amounts	and	disclosures	
in	the	financial	statements	sufficient	
to	give	reasonable	assurance	
that	the	financial	statements	are	
free	from	material	misstatement,	
whether	caused	by	fraud	or	error.	
This	includes	an	assessment	of:	
whether	the	accounting	policies	
are	appropriate	to	the	Group’s	
circumstances	and	have	been	
consistently	applied	and	adequately	
disclosed;	the	reasonableness	of	
significant	accounting	estimates	
made	by	the	directors;	and	the	
overall	presentation	of	the	financial	
statements.
In	addition,	we	read	all	the	financial	
and	non-financial	information	in	the	
Annual	Report	to	identify	material	
inconsistencies	with	the	audited	
financial	statements.	If	we	become	
aware	of	any	apparent	material	
misstatements	or	inconsistencies		
we	consider	the	implications	in		
our	report.
Opinion on financial statements
In	our	opinion	the	Group	financial	
statements:
•		 give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	
of	the	Group’s	affairs	as	at	3	March	
2011	and	of	its	profit	for	the	year	
then	ended;
•		 have	been	properly	prepared	in	
accordance	with	IFRSs	as	adopted	
by	the	European	Union;	and
•		 have	been	prepared	in	accordance	
with	the	requirements	of	the	
Companies	Act	2006	and	Article	4	
of	the	IAS	Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In	our	opinion	the	information		
given	in	the	Directors’	report	for		
the	financial	year	for	which	the	
Group	financial	statements	are	
prepared	is	consistent	with	the	
Group	financial	statements.

1 Authorisation of financial statements
The	consolidated	financial	statements	of	Whitbread	PLC	for	the	year	ended	3	March	2011	were	authorised	for	
issue	by	the	Board	of	Directors	on	27	April	2011.	Whitbread	PLC	is	a	public	limited	company	incorporated	and	fully	
domiciled	in	England	and	Wales.	The	Company’s	ordinary	shares	are	traded	on	the	London	Stock	Exchange.
The	significant	activities	of	the	Group	are	described	in	note	4,	segment	information.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting and preparation
The	consolidated	financial	statements	of	Whitbread	PLC	and	all	its	subsidiaries	have	been	prepared	in	accordance	
with	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	(IFRSs)	as	adopted	for	use	in	the	European	Union	and	as	applied	in	
accordance	with	the	provisions	of	the	Companies	Act	2006.
The	consolidated	financial	statements	are	presented	in	pounds	sterling	and	all	values	are	rounded	to	the	nearest	
hundred	thousand	except	when	otherwise	indicated.	The	significant	accounting	policies	adopted	are	set	out	below.
The	accounting	policies	adopted	in	the	preparation	of	these	consolidated	financial	statements	are	consistent	with	those	
followed	in	the	preparation	of	the	Group’s	annual	financial	statements	for	the	year	ended	4	March	2010,	except	for	the	
adoption	of	the	following	new	Standards	and	Interpretations	that	are	applicable	for	the	year	ended	3	March	2011:
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment – Amendments to Group Cash-settled Share-based Payments
The	amended	standard	affects	the	accounting	for	cash-settled	share-based	payment	transactions.	This	amendment	
supersedes	IFRIC	8	and	IFRIC	11.	The	adoption	of	this	amendment	did	not	have	an	impact	on	the	financial	position	or	
performance	of	the	Group.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised)
The	amended	standard	introduces	changes	in	the	accounting	for	business	combinations	occurring	after	becoming	
effective.	Changes	affect	the	valuation	of	non-controlling	interest,	the	accounting	for	transaction	costs,	the	initial	
recognition	and	subsequent	measurement	of	a	contingent	consideration	and	business	combinations	achieved	in	
stages.	These	changes	will	impact	the	amount	of	goodwill	recognised,	the	reported	results	in	the	period	when	an	
acquisition	occurs	and	future	reported	results.	
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (amended)
IAS	27	(amended)	requires	that	a	change	in	the	ownership	interest	of	a	subsidiary	(without	loss	of	control)	is	
accounted	for	as	a	transaction	with	owners	in	their	capacity	as	owners.	Therefore,	such	transactions	will	no	
longer	give	rise	to	goodwill,	nor	will	it	give	rise	to	a	gain	or	loss.	Furthermore,	the	amended	standard	changes	the	
accounting	for	losses	by	the	subsidiary	as	well	as	the	loss	of	control	of	a	subsidiary.	The	change	in	accounting	policy	
was	applied	prospectively	and	had	no	material	impact	on	earnings	per	share.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation – Classification of Rights Issues (amendment)
The	amendment	to	IAS	32	is	effective	for	annual	periods	beginning	on	or	after	1	February	2010	and	amended	
the	definition	of	a	financial	liability	in	order	to	classify	rights	issues	(and	certain	options	or	warrants)	as	equity	
instruments	in	cases	where	such	rights	are	given	pro	rata	to	all	of	the	existing	owners	of	the	same	class	of	an	entity’s	
own	non-derivative	equity	instruments,	or	to	acquire	a	fixed	number	of	the	entity’s	own	equity	instruments	for	a	
fixed	amount	in	currency.	This	amendment	had	no	impact	on	the	Group.
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Amendments to Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items
The	amendment	clarifies	that	an	entity	is	permitted	to	designate	a	portion	of	the	fair	value	changes	or	cash	flow	
variability	of	a	financial	instrument	as	a	hedged	item.	This	also	covers	the	designation	of	inflation	as	a	hedged	risk	or	
portion	in	particular	situations.	The	Group	has	concluded	that	the	amendment	will	have	no	impact	on	the	financial	
position	or	performance	of	the	Group,	as	the	Group	has	not	entered	into	any	such	hedges.
IFRIC 17 Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners
This	interpretation	provides	guidance	on	accounting	for	arrangements	whereby	an	entity	distributes	non-cash		
assets	to	shareholders	either	as	a	distribution	of	reserves	or	as	dividends.	This	interpretation	has	had	no	impact		
on	the	Group.
Basis of consolidation 
The	consolidated	financial	statements	incorporate	the	accounts	of	Whitbread	PLC	and	all	its	subsidiaries,	together	
with	the	Group’s	share	of	the	net	assets	and	results	of	joint	ventures	and	associates	incorporated	using	the	equity	
method	of	accounting.	These	are	adjusted,	where	appropriate,	to	conform	to	Group	accounting	policies.	The	financial	
statements	of	material	subsidiaries	are	prepared	for	the	same	reporting	year	as	the	parent	Company.
Apart	from	the	acquisition	of	Whitbread	Group	PLC	by	Whitbread	PLC	in	2000/1,	which	was	accounted	for	using	
merger	accounting,	acquisitions	by	the	Group	are	accounted	for	under	the	acquisition	method	and	any	goodwill	
arising	is	capitalised	as	an	intangible	asset.	The	results	of	subsidiaries	acquired	or	disposed	of	during	the	year	are	
included	in	the	consolidated	financial	statements	from	or	up	to	the	date	that	control	passes	respectively.	All	intra-
Group	transactions,	balances,	income	and	expenses	are	eliminated	on	consolidation.	Unrealised	losses	are	also	
eliminated	unless	the	transaction	provides	evidence	of	an	impairment	of	the	asset	transferred.

2 Accounting policies (continued)
Significant accounting policies
Goodwill
Goodwill	arising	on	acquisition	is	capitalised	and	represents	the	excess	of	the	fair	value	of	consideration	over	the	
Group’s	interest	in	the	fair	value	of	the	identifiable	assets	and	liabilities	of	a	subsidiary	at	the	date	of	acquisition.	
Goodwill	is	reviewed	for	impairment	annually	or	more	frequently	if	events	or	changes	in	circumstances	indicate	that	
the	carrying	value	may	be	impaired.	On	disposal	of	a	subsidiary,	the	attributable	amount	of	goodwill	is	included	in	
the	determination	of	the	profit	or	loss	on	disposal.
Intangible	assets
Intangible	assets	are	carried	at	cost	less	accumulated	amortisation	and	accumulated	impairment	losses.
Intangible	assets	acquired	separately	from	a	business	are	carried	initially	at	cost.	An	intangible	asset	acquired	as	part	
of	a	business	combination	is	recognised	outside	goodwill	if	the	asset	is	separable	or	arises	from	contractual	or	other	
legal	rights	and	its	fair	value	can	be	measured	reliably.
Amortisation	is	calculated	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	estimated	life	of	the	asset	as	follows:
•	Trading	licences	have	an	infinite	life
•	Brand	assets	are	amortised	over	periods	of	two	to	15	years
•	IT	software	and	technology	are	amortised	over	periods	of	three	to	10	years
•	The	asset	in	relation	to	acquired	customer	relationships	is	amortised	over	10	years
•	The	franchise	fee	and	brand	name	agreements	are	amortised	over	periods	up	to	15	years
Amortisation	is	reported	within	administrative	expenses	in	the	income	statement.	The	carrying	values	are	reviewed	
for	impairment	if	events	or	changes	in	circumstances	indicate	that	they	may	not	be	recoverable.
Property,	plant	and	equipment
Prior	to	the	1999/2000	financial	year,	properties	were	regularly	revalued	on	a	cyclical	basis.	Since	this	date	the	
Group	policy	has	been	not	to	revalue	its	properties	and,	while	previous	valuations	have	been	retained,	they	have	
not	been	updated.	As	permitted	by	IFRS	1,	the	Group	has	elected	to	use	the	UK	GAAP	revaluations	before	the	date	
of	transition	to	IFRS	as	deemed	cost	at	the	date	of	transition.	Property,	plant	and	equipment	are	stated	at	cost	or	
deemed	cost	at	transition	to	IFRS,	less	accumulated	depreciation	and	any	impairment	in	value.	Gross	interest	costs	
incurred	on	the	financing	of	qualifying	assets	are	capitalised	until	the	time	that	the	projects	are	available	for	use.	
Depreciation	is	calculated	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	estimated	useful	life	of	the	asset	as	follows:
•	Freehold	land	is	not	depreciated
•	Freehold	buildings	are	depreciated	to	their	estimated	residual	values	over	periods	up	to	50	years
•	Plant	and	equipment	is	depreciated	over	three	to	30	years
The	carrying	values	of	property,	plant	and	equipment	are	reviewed	for	impairment	if	events	or	changes	in	
circumstances	indicate	that	their	carrying	values	may	not	be	recoverable.	Any	impairment	in	the	value	of	property,	
plant	and	equipment	is	charged	to	the	income	statement.
Profits	and	losses	on	disposal	of	property,	plant	and	equipment	reflect	the	difference	between	net	selling	price	and	
the	carrying	amount	at	the	date	of	disposal	and	are	recognised	in	the	income	statement.
Payments	made	on	entering	into	or	acquiring	leaseholds	that	are	accounted	for	as	operating	leases	represent	
prepaid	lease	payments.	These	are	amortised	on	a	straight-line	basis	over	the	lease	term.
Impairment
The	Group	assesses	assets	or	groups	of	assets	for	impairment	whenever	events	or	changes	in	circumstances	indicate	
that	the	carrying	value	of	an	asset	may	not	be	recoverable.	Individual	assets	are	grouped	for	impairment	assessment	
purposes	at	the	lowest	level	at	which	there	are	identifiable	cash	flows	that	are	largely	independent	of	the	cash	flows	
of	other	groups	of	assets	(cash	generating	units	or	CGUs).	If	such	indication	of	impairment	exists	or	when	annual	
impairment	testing	for	an	asset	group	is	required,	the	Group	makes	an	estimate	of	the	recoverable	amount.
An	assessment	is	made	at	each	reporting	date	as	to	whether	there	is	any	indication	that	previously	recognised	
impairment	losses	may	no	longer	exist	or	may	have	decreased.	If	such	indication	exists,	the	CGU’s	recoverable	
amount	is	estimated.	A	previously	recognised	impairment	loss	is	reversed	only	if	there	has	been	a	change	in	the	
estimates	used	to	determine	the	asset’s	recoverable	amount	since	the	last	impairment	loss	was	recognised.	If	that	
is	the	case,	the	carrying	amount	of	the	asset	is	increased	to	its	recoverable	amount.	That	increased	amount	cannot	
exceed	the	carrying	amount	that	would	have	been	determined,	net	of	depreciation,	had	no	impairment	loss	been	
recognised	for	the	asset	in	prior	years.	Such	reversal	is	recognised	in	the	income	statement.	After	such	a	reversal,	the	
depreciation	charge	is	adjusted	in	future	periods	to	allocate	the	asset’s	carrying	amount,	less	any	residual	value,	on	a	
systematic	basis	over	its	remaining	useful	life.
48 2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Impairment	(continued)
The	recoverable	amount	of	an	asset	or	CGU	is	the	greater	of	its	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	and	value	in	use.	In	
assessing	value	in	use,	the	estimated	future	cash	flows	are	discounted	to	their	present	value	using	a	pre-tax	discount	
rate	that	reflects	current	market	assessments	of	the	time	value	of	money	and	the	risks	specific	to	the	asset.	For	
an	asset	that	does	not	generate	largely	independent	cash	inflows,	the	recoverable	amount	is	determined	with	
reference	to	the	CGU	to	which	the	asset	belongs.	Impairment	losses	are	recognised	in	the	income	statement	in	the	
administrative	and	distribution	line	items.
An	impairment	loss	is	recognised	if	the	carrying	amount	of	an	asset	or	CGU	exceeds	its	estimated	recoverable	amount.	
Impairment	losses	recognised	in	respect	of	CGUs	are	allocated	first	to	reduce	the	carrying	amount	of	any	goodwill	
allocated	to	the	units	and	then	to	reduce	the	carrying	amounts	of	other	assets	in	the	CGU	on	a	pro	rata	basis.
For	the	purposes	of	impairment	testing,	all	centrally	held	assets	are	allocated	in	line	with	IAS	36	to	CGUs	based		
on	management’s	view	of	the	consumption	of	the	asset.	Any	resulting	impairment	is	recorded	against	the	centrally	
held	asset.
Goodwill and intangibles
Goodwill	acquired	through	business	combinations	is	allocated	to	groups	of	CGUs	at	the	level	management	monitor	
goodwill,	which	is	at	strategic	business	unit	level.	The	Group	performs	an	annual	review	of	its	goodwill	to	ensure	
that	its	carrying	amount	is	not	greater	than	its	recoverable	amount.	In	the	absence	of	a	comparable	recent	market	
transaction	that	demonstrates	that	the	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	of	goodwill	and	intangible	assets	exceeds	their	
carrying	amount,	the	recoverable	amount	is	determined	from	value	in	use	calculations.	An	impairment	is	then	made	
to	reduce	the	carrying	amount	to	the	higher	of	the	fair	value	less	cost	to	sell	and	the	value	in	use.
Property, plant and equipment
For	the	purposes	of	the	impairment	review	of	property,	plant	and	equipment	the	Group	considers	CGUs	to	be	each	
trading	outlet.
The	carrying	values	of	property,	plant	and	equipment	are	reviewed	for	impairment	when	events	or	changes	in	
circumstances	indicate	the	carrying	value	may	not	be	recoverable.
Consideration	is	also	given,	where	appropriate,	to	the	market	value	of	the	asset,	either	from	independent	sources	or	
in	conjunction	with	an	accepted	industry	valuation	methodology.
Assets	held	for	sale
Non-current	assets	and	disposal	groups	are	classified	as	held	for	sale	only	if	available	for	immediate	sale	in	their	
present	condition	and	a	sale	is	highly	probable	and	expected	to	be	completed	within	one	year	from	the	date	of	
classification.	Such	assets	are	measured	at	the	lower	of	carrying	amount	and	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	and	are	not	
depreciated	or	amortised.
Inventories	
Inventories	are	stated	at	the	lower	of	cost	and	net	realisable	value.	Cost	is	calculated	on	the	basis	of	first	in,	first	out	
and	net	realisable	value	is	the	estimated	selling	price	less	any	costs	of	disposal.
Provisions
Provisions	for	warranties,	onerous	contracts	and	restructuring	costs	are	recognised	when	the	Group	has	a	present	
legal	or	constructive	obligation	as	a	result	of	a	past	event,	when	it	is	probable	that	an	outflow	of	resources	will	be	
required	to	settle	the	obligation,	and	when	a	reliable	estimate	can	be	made	of	the	amount	of	the	obligation.	
Provisions	are	discounted	to	present	value,	where	the	effect	is	material,	using	a	pre-tax	discount	rate	that	reflects	
current	market	assessments	of	the	time	value	of	money	and	the	risks	specific	to	the	liability.	The	amortisation	of	the	
discount	is	recognised	as	a	finance	cost.
Non	GAAP	performance	measure
The	face	of	the	income	statement	presents	underlying	profit	before	tax	and	reconciles	this	to	profit	before	tax	as	
required	to	be	presented	under	the	applicable	accounting	standards.	Underlying	earnings	per	share	is	calculated	
having	adjusted	profit	after	tax	on	the	same	basis.	The	term	underlying	profit	is	not	defined	under	IFRSs	and	may	not	
be	comparable	with	similarly	titled	profit	measures	reported	by	other	companies.	It	is	not	intended	to	be	a	substitute	
for,	or	superior	to,	GAAP	measurements	of	profit.	The	adjustments	made	to	reported	profit	in	the	income	statement	
in	order	to	present	an	underlying	performance	measure	include:
Exceptional items
The	Group	includes	in	non	GAAP	performance	measures	those	items	which	are	exceptional	by	virtue	of	their	size	or	
incidence	so	as	to	allow	a	better	understanding	of	the	underlying	trading	performance	of	the	Group.	The	Group	also	
includes	the	profit	or	loss	on	disposal	of	property,	plant	and	equipment,	property	reversions,	profit	or	loss	on	sale	of	
business,	impairment	and	exceptional	interest	and	tax.
IAS 19 Income Statement finance charge/credit for defined benefit pension schemes.
Underlying	profit	includes	the	service	costs	but	excludes	the	volatile	finance	cost/revenue	element	of	IAS	19.

Taxation
The	tax	impact	of	the	above	items	is	also	excluded	in	arriving	at	underlying	earnings.
Foreign	currency	translation	
Monetary	assets	and	liabilities	denominated	in	foreign	currencies	are	translated	into	sterling	at	the	rates	of	exchange	
quoted	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	Non-monetary	items	that	are	measured	in	terms	of	historical	cost	in	a	foreign	
currency	are	translated	using	the	exchange	rates	as	at	the	dates	of	initial	transactions.
Trading	results	are	translated	into	the	functional	currency	(generally	sterling)	at	average	rates	of	exchange	for	the	
year.	Day	to	day	transactions	in	a	foreign	currency	are	recorded	in	the	functional	currency	at	an	average	rate	for	the	
month	in	which	those	transactions	take	place,	which	is	used	as	a	reasonable	approximation	to	the	actual	transaction	
rate.	Translation	differences	on	monetary	items	are	taken	to	the	income	statement	except	where	they	are	part	of	a	
net	foreign	investment	hedge,	in	which	case	translation	differences	are	reported	in	other	comprehensive	income.	The	
differences	that	arise	from	translating	the	results	of	foreign	entities	at	average	rates	of	exchange,	and	their	assets	
and	liabilities	at	closing	rates,	are	also	dealt	with	in	a	separate	component	of	equity.	On	disposal	of	a	foreign	entity,	
the	deferred	cumulative	amount	recognised	in	equity	relating	to	that	particular	foreign	operation	is	recognised	in	the	
income	statement.	All	other	currency	gains	and	losses	are	dealt	with	in	the	income	statement.
A	number	of	subsidiaries	within	the	Group	have	a	non	sterling	functional	currency.	These	are	translated	into	sterling	in	
the	Group	accounts.	Balance	sheet	items	are	translated	at	the	rate	applicable	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	Transactions	
reported	in	the	income	statement	are	translated	using	an	average	rate	for	the	month	in	which	they	occur.
Revenue	recognition	
Generally,	revenue	is	the	value	of	goods	and	services	sold	to	third	parties	as	part	of	the	Group’s	trading	activities,	
after	deducting	discounts	and	sales-based	taxes.	The	following	is	a	description	of	the	composition	of	revenues	of		
the	Group:
Rendering of services
Owned	hotel	revenue,	including	the	rental	of	rooms	and	food	and	beverage	sales	from	a	network	of	hotels,	is	
recognised	when	rooms	are	occupied	and	food	and	beverages	are	sold.	Revenue	from	franchise	fees	received	in	
connection	with	the	franchise	of	the	Group’s	brand	names	is	recognised	when	earned.
Royalties
Royalties	are	recognised	as	the	income	is	earned.
Sale of goods
Revenue	from	the	sale	of	food	and	beverages	is	recognised	when	they	are	sold.	Under	IFRIC	13,	a	portion	of	revenue	
equal	to	the	fair	value	of	the	reward	points	earned	under	Costa	loyalty	card	transactions	is	deferred	until	those	points	
are	redeemed.
Finance revenue
Interest	income	is	recognised	as	the	interest	accrues,	using	the	effective	interest	method.
Leases
Leases	where	the	lessor	retains	substantially	all	the	risks	and	benefits	of	ownership	of	the	asset	are	classified	as	
operating	leases.	Rental	payments	in	respect	of	operating	leases	are	charged	against	operating	profit	on	a	straight-line	
basis	over	the	period	of	the	lease.	Lease	incentives	are	recognised	as	a	reduction	of	rental	costs	over	the	lease	term.
Borrowing	costs	
Borrowing	costs	are	recognised	as	an	expense	in	the	period	in	which	they	are	incurred,	except	for	gross	interest	costs	
incurred	on	the	financing	of	major	projects,	which	are	capitalised	until	the	time	that	the	projects	are	available	for	use.
Retirement	benefits
In	respect	of	defined	benefit	pension	schemes,	the	obligation	recognised	in	the	balance	sheet	represents	the	present	
value	of	the	defined	benefit	obligation	as	adjusted	for	any	unrecognised	past	service	cost,	reduced	by	the	fair	value	
of	the	scheme	assets.	The	cost	of	providing	benefits	is	determined	using	the	projected	unit	credit	actuarial	valuation	
method.	Actuarial	gains	and	losses	are	recognised	in	full	in	the	period	in	which	they	occur	in	the	Consolidated	
Statement	of	Comprehensive	Income.
For	defined	benefit	plans,	the	employer’s	portion	of	the	past	and	current	service	cost	is	charged	to	operating	profit,	
with	the	interest	cost	net	of	expected	return	on	assets	in	the	plans	reported	within	finance	costs.	The	expected	return	on	
plan	assets	is	based	on	an	assessment	made	at	the	beginning	of	the	year	of	long-term	market	returns	on	scheme	assets,	
adjusted	for	the	effect	on	the	fair	value	of	plan	assets	of	contributions	received	and	benefits	paid	during	the	year.
Curtailments	and	settlements	relating	to	the	Group’s	defined	benefit	plan	are	recognised	in	the	period	in	which	the	
curtailment	or	settlement	occurs.
Payments	to	defined	contribution	pension	schemes	are	charged	as	an	expense	as	they	fall	due.
50 2 Accounting policies (continued) 
Share-based	payment	transactions
Equity-settled transactions
Certain	employees	and	directors	of	the	Group	receive	equity-settled	remuneration	in	the	form	of	share-based	
payment	transactions,	whereby	employees	render	services	in	exchange	for	shares	or	rights	over	shares.	The	cost	of	
equity-settled	transactions	with	employees	is	measured	by	reference	to	the	fair	value,	determined	using	a	stochastic	
model,	at	the	date	at	which	they	are	granted.	The	cost	of	equity-settled	transactions	is	recognised,	together	with	a	
corresponding	increase	in	equity,	over	the	period	in	which	the	performance	conditions	or	non-vesting	conditions	are	
fulfilled,	ending	on	the	relevant	vesting	date.	Except	for	awards	subject	to	market	related	conditions	for	vesting,	the	
cumulative	expense	recognised	for	equity-settled	transactions	at	each	reporting	date	until	the	vesting	date	reflects	
the	extent	to	which	the	vesting	period	has	expired,	and	is	adjusted	to	reflect	the	directors’	best	available	estimate	
of	the	number	of	equity	instruments	that	will	ultimately	vest.	The	income	statement	charge	or	credit	for	a	period	
represents	the	movement	in	cumulative	expense	recognised	as	at	the	beginning	and	end	of	that	period.	If	options	are	
subject	to	market	related	conditions,	awards	are	not	cumulatively	adjusted	for	the	likelihood	of	these	targets	being	
met.	Instead	these	conditions	are	included	in	the	fair	value	of	the	awards.
Where	an	equity-settled	award	is	cancelled,	it	is	treated	as	if	it	had	vested	on	the	date	of	cancellation,	and	any	
expense	not	yet	recognised	for	the	award	is	recognised	immediately.
Cash-settled transactions
The	cost	is	fair	valued	at	grant	date	and	expensed	over	the	period	until	the	vesting	date	with	a	recognition	of	
a	corresponding	liability.	The	liability	is	remeasured	to	fair	value	at	each	reporting	date	up	to	and	including	the	
settlement	date,	with	changes	in	fair	value	recognised	in	profit	or	loss	for	the	period.
Tax
The	income	tax	charge	represents	both	the	income	tax	payable,	based	on	profits	for	the	year,	and	deferred	income	tax.
Deferred	income	tax	is	recognised	in	full,	using	the	liability	method,	in	respect	of	temporary	differences	between	
the	tax	base	of	the	Group’s	assets	and	liabilities,	and	their	carrying	amounts,	that	have	originated	but	have	not	been	
reversed	by	the	balance	sheet	date.	No	deferred	tax	is	recognised	if	the	temporary	difference	arises	from	goodwill	
or	the	initial	recognition	of	an	asset	or	liability	in	a	transaction	that	is	not	a	business	combination	and,	at	the	time	of	
the	transaction,	affects	neither	the	accounting	profit	nor	taxable	profit	or	loss.	Deferred	income	tax	is	recognised	in	
respect	of	taxable	temporary	differences	associated	with	investments	in	associates	and	interests	in	joint	ventures,	
except	where	the	timing	of	the	reversal	of	the	temporary	differences	can	be	controlled	and	it	is	probable	that	the	
temporary	differences	will	not	reverse	in	the	foreseeable	future.	
Deferred	income	tax	assets	are	recognised	to	the	extent	that	it	is	probable	that	taxable	profit	will	be	available	against	
which	the	deductible	temporary	differences	can	be	utilised.	The	carrying	amount	of	deferred	income	tax	assets	is	
reviewed	at	each	balance	sheet	date	and	reduced	to	the	extent	that	it	is	no	longer	probable	that	sufficient	taxable	
profit	will	be	available	to	allow	all	or	part	of	the	deferred	income	tax	asset	to	be	utilised.
Deferred	income	tax	assets	and	liabilities	are	measured	at	the	tax	rates	that	are	expected	to	apply	in	the	year	when	
the	asset	is	realised	or	the	liability	is	settled,	based	on	tax	rates	that	have	been	enacted	or	substantively	enacted	at	
the	balance	sheet	date.
Income	tax	is	charged	or	credited	to	other	comprehensive	income	if	it	relates	to	items	charged	or	credited	to	other	
comprehensive	income.	Similarly	income	tax	is	charged	or	credited	directly	to	equity	if	it	relates	to	items	that	are	
charged	or	credited	to	equity.	Otherwise	income	tax	is	recognised	in	the	income	statement.
Treasury	shares
Own	equity	instruments	which	are	held	by	the	Group	(treasury	shares)	are	deducted	from	equity.	No	gain	or	loss	is	
recognised	in	the	income	statement	on	the	purchase,	sale,	issue	or	cancellation	of	the	Group’s	own	equity	instruments.
Investments	in	joint	ventures	and	associates
Joint	ventures	are	established	through	an	interest	in	a	company	(a	jointly	controlled	entity).
Investments	in	joint	ventures	and	associates	are	initially	recognised	at	cost,	being	the	fair	value	of	the	consideration	
given	and	including	acquisition	charges	associated	with	the	investment.
After	initial	recognition,	investments	in	joint	ventures	and	associates	are	accounted	for	using	the	equity	method.
Recognition	and	derecognition	of	financial	assets	and	liabilities
The	recognition	of	financial	assets	and	liabilities	occurs	when	the	Group	becomes	party	to	the	contractual	provisions	
of	the	instrument.	The	derecognition	of	financial	assets	takes	place	when	the	Group	no	longer	has	the	right	to	cash	
flows,	the	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership,	or	control	of	the	asset.	The	derecognition	of	financial	liabilities	occurs	
when	the	obligation	under	the	liability	is	discharged,	cancelled	or	expires.
Financial	Assets
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Some	assets	held	by	the	Group	are	classified	as	financial	assets	at	fair	value	through	profit	or	loss.	On	initial	
recognition	these	assets	are	recognised	at	fair	value.	Subsequent	measurement	is	also	at	fair	value	with	changes	
recognised	through	finance	revenue	or	costs	in	the	income	statement.
51 Notes	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements
At	3	March	2011
2 Accounting policies (continued)
Financial	Assets	(continued)
Loans and receivables
Loans	and	receivables	are	non-derivative	financial	assets	with	fixed	or	determinable	payments	that	are	not	quoted	
in	an	active	market,	do	not	qualify	as	trading	assets	and	have	not	been	designated	as	either	fair	value	through	profit	
and	loss	or	available-for-sale.	Such	assets	are	carried	at	amortised	cost	using	the	effective	interest	method	if	the	
time	value	of	money	is	significant.	Gains	and	losses	are	recognised	in	the	income	statement	when	the	loans	and	
receivables	are	derecognised	or	impaired,	as	well	as	through	the	amortisation	process.
Trade	receivables	are	recognised	and	carried	at	original	invoice	amount	less	any	uncollectable	amounts.	An	estimate	
for	doubtful	debts	is	made	when	collection	of	the	full	amount	is	no	longer	probable.	Bad	debts	are	written	off	when	
identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash	and	short-term	deposits	in	the	balance	sheet	comprise	cash	at	bank	and	in	hand	and	short-term	deposits	with	
an	original	maturity	of	three	months	or	less.	For	the	purpose	of	the	Consolidated	Cash	Flow	Statement,	cash	and	
cash	equivalents	consist	of	cash	and	cash	equivalents	as	defined	above,	net	of	outstanding	bank	overdrafts.
Derivative	financial	instruments	
The	Group	enters	into	derivative	transactions	with	a	view	to	managing	interest	risks	associated	with	underlying	
business	activities	and	the	financing	of	those	activities.	Derivative	financial	instruments	used	by	the	Group	are	stated	
at	fair	value	on	initial	recognition	and	at	subsequent	balance	sheet	dates.	Cash	flow	hedges	hedge	exposure	to	
variability	in	cash	flows	that	are	either	attributable	to	a	particular	risk	associated	with	a	recognised	asset	or	liability		
or	a	forecast	transaction.	Fair	value	hedges	hedge	exposure	to	changes	in	the	fair	value	of	a	recognised	asset	or	
liability,	or	an	unrecognised	firm	commitment	and	include	foreign	currency	swaps.
Hedge	accounting	is	only	used	where,	at	the	inception	of	the	hedge,	there	is	formal	designation	and	documentation	
of	the	hedging	relationship,	it	meets	the	Group’s	risk	management	objective	strategy	for	undertaking	the	hedge	and	
it	is	expected	to	be	highly	effective.
The	fair	value	of	interest	rate	swap	contracts	is	determined	by	reference	to	market	values	for	similar	instruments.	
The	portion	of	any	gains	or	losses	of	cash	flow	hedges,	which	meet	the	conditions	for	hedge	accounting	and	are	
determined	to	be	effective	hedges,	is	recognised	directly	in	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Comprehensive	Income.	
The	gains	or	losses	relating	to	the	ineffective	portion	are	recognised	immediately	in	the	income	statement.	The	
change	in	fair	value	of	a	fair	value	hedging	derivative	is	recognised	in	the	income	statement	in	finance	costs.	The	
change	in	the	fair	value	of	the	hedged	asset	or	liability,	that	is	attributable	to	the	hedged	risk,	is	recognised	in	the	
carrying	value	of	the	hedged	item	and	is	also	recognised	in	the	income	statement	within	finance	costs.	
When	a	firm	commitment	that	is	hedged	becomes	an	asset	or	a	liability	recognised	on	the	balance	sheet,	then,		
at	the	time	the	asset	or	liability	is	recognised,	the	associated	gains	or	losses	that	had	previously	been	recognised	
in	equity	are	included	in	the	initial	measurement	of	the	acquisition	cost	or	other	carrying	amount	of	the	asset	or	
liability.	For	all	other	cash	flow	hedges,	the	gains	or	losses	that	are	recognised	in	equity	are	transferred	to	the	income	
statement	in	the	same	period	in	which	the	transaction	that	results	from	a	firm	commitment	that	is	hedged	affects		
the	income	statement.
Gains	or	losses	arising	from	changes	in	fair	value	of	derivatives	that	do	not	qualify	for	hedge	accounting	are	
recognised	immediately	in	the	income	statement.
Hedge	accounting	is	discontinued	when	the	hedging	instrument	expires	or	is	sold,	terminated,	exercised	or	no	
longer	qualifies	for	hedge	accounting.	At	that	point	in	time,	for	cash	flow	hedges,	any	cumulative	gain	or	loss	on	
the	hedging	instrument	recognised	in	equity	is	kept	in	equity	until	the	forecast	transaction	occurs.	If	a	hedged	
transaction	is	no	longer	expected	to	occur,	the	net	cumulative	gain	or	loss	recognised	in	equity	is	transferred	to	
the	income	statement.	When	a	fair	value	hedge	item	is	derecognised,	the	unamortised	fair	value	is	recognised	
immediately	in	the	income	statement.
Borrowings
Borrowings	are	initially	recognised	at	fair	value	of	the	consideration	received	net	of	any	directly	associated	issue	
costs.	Borrowings	are	subsequently	recorded	at	amortised	cost,	with	any	difference	between	the	amount	initially	
recorded	and	the	redemption	value	recognised	in	the	income	statement	using	the	effective	interest	method.
Significant	accounting	judgements	and	estimates
Key	assumptions	concerning	the	future,	and	other	key	sources	of	estimation,	at	the	balance	sheet	date	have	a	
significant	risk	of	causing	a	material	adjustment	to	the	carrying	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	within	the	next	
financial	year.		
The	main	assumptions	are	outlined	below:	
Judgements	and	estimates	are	required	in	the	identification	of	separable	assets	and	liabilities	upon	acquisition,	
particularly	in	the	case	of	the	valuation	and	identification	of	intangible	assets	such	as	brand,	technology	and	
customer	databases.	Note	10	provides	details	of	business	combinations	in	the	current	year.	
52 2 Accounting policies (continued)
Significant	accounting	judgements	and	estimates	(continued)
An	impairment	test	of	tangible	and	intangible	assets	is	undertaken	each	year	on	both	an	EBITDA	multiple	approach	
and	a	discounted	cash	flow	approach.	Note	15	describes	the	assumptions	used	together	with	an	analysis	of	the	
sensitivity	to	changes	in	key	assumptions.	
Judgement	is	used	in	determining	the	value	of	provisions	carried	for	onerous	contracts.	This	is	primarily	based	around	
assumptions	on	rent	and	property	related	costs	for	the	period	the	property	is	vacant	and	then	assumptions	over	future	
rental	incomes	or	potential	reverse	lease	premiums	paid.	Note	24	provides	details	of	the	value	of	the	provision	carried.	
Defined	benefit	pension	plans	are	accounted	for	in	accordance	with	actuarial	advice	using	the	projected	unit		
credit	method.	Note	32	describes	the	assumptions	used	together	with	an	analysis	of	the	sensitivity	to	changes		
in	key	assumptions.	
The	calculation	of	the	Group’s	total	tax	charge	necessarily	involves	a	degree	of	estimation	and	judgement	in	respect		
of	certain	items	whose	tax	treatment	cannot	be	finally	determined	until	resolution	has	been	reached	with	the	relevant	
tax	authority.	The	final	resolution	of	certain	of	these	items	may	give	rise	to	material	income	statement	and/or	cash	
flow	variances.
Corporation	tax	is	calculated	on	the	basis	of	income	before	taxation,	taking	into	account	the	relevant	local	tax	rates	
and	regulations.	For	each	operating	entity,	the	current	income	tax	expense	is	calculated	and	differences	between	the	
accounting	and	tax	base	are	determined,	resulting	in	deferred	tax	assets	or	liabilities.
Assumptions	are	also	made	around	the	assets	which	qualify	for	capital	allowances	and	the	level	of	disallowable	
expenses	and	this	affects	the	income	tax	calculation.	Provisions	are	also	made	for	uncertain	exposures	which	can		
have	an	impact	on	both	deferred	and	current	tax.	
A	deferred	tax	asset	shall	be	recognised	for	the	carry	forward	of	unused	tax	losses,	pension	deficits	and	unused	tax	
credits	to	the	extent	that	it	is	probable	that	future	taxable	profit	will	be	available	against	which	the	unused	tax	losses	
and	unused	tax	credits	can	be	utilised.		
Detailed	amounts	of	the	carrying	values	of	corporation	and	deferred	tax	can	be	found	in	note	9.
Standards	issued	by	the	International	Accounting	Standards	Board	(IASB)	not	effective	for	the	current	year	and	not	
early	adopted	by	the	Group
The	following	standards	and	interpretations,	which	have	been	issued	by	the	IASB	and	are	relevant	for	the	Group,	
become	effective	after	the	current	year	end	and	have	not	been	early	adopted	by	the	Group:
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures (Amendment) 
The	amended	standard	clarifies	the	definition	of	a	related	party	to	simplify	the	identification	of	such	relationships		
and	to	eliminate	inconsistencies	in	its	application.	The	Group	does	not	expect	any	impact	on	its	financial	position		
or	performance.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement
IFRS	9	as	issued	reflects	the	first	phase	of	the	IASBs	work	on	the	replacement	of	IAS	39	and	applies	to	classification	
and	measurement	of	financial	assets	as	defined	in	IAS	39.	In	subsequent	phases,	the	IASB	will	address	classification	
and	measurement	of	financial	liabilities,	hedge	accounting	and	derecognition.	The	Group	will	quantify	the	effect	in	
conjunction	with	the	other	phases,	when	issued,	to	present	a	comprehensive	picture.
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement (Amendment)
The	amendment	provides	guidance	on	assessing	the	recoverable	amount	of	a	net	pension	asset.	It	permits	an	entity		
to	treat	the	prepayment	of	a	minimum	funding	requirement	as	an	asset.	The	adoption	of	this	interpretation	will	have	
no	effect	on	the	financial	statements	of	the	Group.
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments
The	interpretation	clarifies	that	equity	instruments	issued	to	a	creditor	to	extinguish	a	financial	liability	qualify	as	
consideration	paid.	The	equity	instruments	issued	are	measured	at	their	fair	value	of	the	liability	extinguished.	Any	
gain	or	loss	is	recognised	immediately	in	profit	or	loss.	The	adoption	of	this	interpretation	will	have	no	effect	on	the	
financial	statements	of	the	Group.

4 Segment information
For	management	purposes,	the	Group	is	organised	into	two	strategic	business	units	(Hotels	&	Restaurants	and	Costa)	
based	upon	their	different	products	and	services:
•	Hotels	&	Restaurants	provide	services	in	relation	to	accommodation	and	food
•	Costa	generates	income	from	the	operation	of	its	branded,	owned	and	franchised	coffee	shops
No	operating	segments	have	been	aggregated	to	form	the	above	reportable	operating	segments.
Management	monitors	the	operating	results	of	its	strategic	business	units	separately	for	the	purpose	of	making	
decisions	about	allocating	resources	and	assessing	performance.	Segment	performance	is	measured	based	on	
operating	profit	before	exceptional	items.	Included	within	the	unallocated	and	elimination	columns	in	the	tables	below	
are	the	costs	of	running	the	public	company.	The	unallocated	assets	and	liabilities	are	cash	and	debt	balances	(held	
and	controlled	by	the	central	treasury	function),	taxation,	pensions,	certain	property,	plant	and	equipment	and	central	
working	capital	balances.	
Inter-segment	revenue	is	from	Costa	to	the	Hotels	&	Restaurants	segment	and	is	eliminated	on	consolidation.	
Transactions	were	entered	into	on	an	arm’s	length	basis	in	a	manner	similar	to	transactions	with	third	parties.	
The	following	tables	present	revenue	and	profit	information	and	certain	asset	and	liability	information	regarding

1.  The £4.6m of VAT refunded had previously been charged on income from gaming machines operated in the restaurants of the Group. 
HMRC refunded the amount paid, plus accrued interest of £0.7m, on the basis of a ruling that VAT may not be applicable on certain 
types of gaming machine income. HMRC continues to appeal the ruling, but the Group does not consider it probable that an appeal 
will be successful. Accordingly no provision for repayment has been made although a contingent liability is disclosed in note 30.
2.  During the year a net loss of £0.4m was recognised on disposals of property, plant and equipment.
3.  Following a strategic review the Bulgarian and Czech businesses acquired as part of the Coffeeheaven acquisition have been disposed 
of as going concerns.
4.  The pension curtailment credit arose due to the closure of the defined benefit scheme to future accrual on 31 December 2009 (note 32).
5.  In 2007/8, the Group sold its interests in David Lloyd Leisure Limited and TGI Friday’s. Following these disposals it was announced that 
the Restaurant and Hotels divisions would merge and that the shared service teams would be disbanded. This restructuring included 
the final costs associated with the aligning of IT with the new structures. This then completed the income statement impact of the 
restructuring programme that was announced in 2007/8.
6.  An impairment review of the Costa operating stores in Russia resulted in an impairment of 74.1m Roubles. This is a joint venture 
partnership and hence the Group has incurred a joint venture exceptional loss of £0.7m.
7.  The interest arising on late payment of an item claimed in a previous year, which is disputed, is included in exceptional interest charges.
8.  The interest arising from the unwinding of the discount rate within provisions is included in exceptional interest, reflecting the 
exceptional nature of the provisions created.
9.  Following the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances for hotel buildings, the Group has reviewed and resubmitted prior year 
capital allowance claims.
10.  Reduction in deferred tax liability on rolled over gains for differences between the tax deductible cost and accounts residual value  
of the reinvestment assets.

Total	deferred	tax	liabilities	released	as	a	result	of	disposals	during	the	year	was	£nil	(2010:	£0.1m).
As	a	result	of	the	transaction	referred	to	in	note	32,	a	current	tax	benefit	of	£10.9m	(2009/10:	£28.6m)	has	been	
obtained	in	the	current	year.	The	deferred	tax	balance	associated	with	the	pension	deficit	has	been	adjusted	to	reflect	
this	benefit.
Following	the	enactment	of	the	Finance	Act	2009,	the	Group	considers	that	the	receipts	of	unremitted	earnings	from	
overseas	entities	would	be	exempt	from	UK	tax	and	therefore	the	temporary	difference	in	relation	to	unremitted	
earnings	is	£nil.
Tax	relief	on	total	interest	capitalised	amounts	to	£0.8m	(2010:	£0.1m).
Factors	affecting	the	tax	charge	for	future	years
In	his	budget	of	22	June	2010,	the	Chancellor	of	the	Exchequer	announced	a	decrease	in	the	rate	of	UK	corporation	
tax	from	28%	to	24%,	phased	over	a	period	from	April	2011	to	April	2014.	An	additional	1%	reduction,	with	effect	
from	April	2011,	was	announced	in	the	budget	of	23	March	2011.	Further	UK	tax	changes,	subject	to	enactment,	are	
a	reduction	from	1	April	2012	in	the	rate	of	the	capital	allowances	applicable	to	plant	and	machinery	and	to	integral	
features	from	20%	to	18%	and	from	10%	to	8%	respectively.
The	Group’s	financial	statements	for	the	year	ended	3	March	2011	reflect	only	those	changes	which	had	been	enacted	
by	the	balance	sheet	date,	namely	the	reduction	from	28%	to	27%,	which	was	enacted	in	the	Finance	(No.2)	Act	2010	
and	which	applies	from	April	2011.	In	accordance	with	IFRSs,	the	remaining	proposed	changes	will	only	be	reflected	in	
the	financial	statements	ended	on	or	after	the	date	such	changes	have	been	‘substantively	enacted’.
The	additional	1%	reduction	in	the	rate	of	corporation	tax,	with	effect	from	April	2011,	was	enacted	on	29	March	2011	
by	virtue	of	the	Provisional	Collection	of	Taxes	Act	1968.	If	the	change	had	been	enacted	before	the	Group’s	balance	
sheet	date,	the	effect	would	have	been	to	reduce	the	deferred	tax	liability	by	£5.2m.
The	effect	of	the	subsequent	reduction	to	23%,	if	enacted,	will	be	to	reduce	the	deferred	tax	liability	by	a	further	
£12.1m.	The	rate	change	will	also	impact	the	amount	of	the	future	cash	tax	payments	to	be	made	by	the	Group.
10 Business combinations
On	2	March	2011	Costa	Limited	acquired	the	entire	issued	share	capital	of	Coffee	Nation	for	a	total	cash	consideration	
of	£59.5m.	Coffee	Nation	operates	over	800	customer	facing	espresso	based	coffee	vending	machines.

adjustment	to	receivables	has	been	made	to	bring	the	balance	in	line	with	what	is	deemed	recoverable.	Fair	value	
adjustments	to	the	remaining	net	assets	have	been	made	to	bring	the	accounting	in	line	with	the	Group’s	policies.
Acquisition	related	costs	amounting	to	£0.9m	are	included	within	administrative	expenses	in	the	consolidated	income	
statement	and	do	not	form	a	part	of	the	above	consideration.
Goodwill	arising	on	the	acquisition	of	Coffee	Nation	arises	as	a	result	of	synergies	from	coupling	the	acquired	
technology	and	customer	relationships	in	Coffee	Nation	with	the	Costa	brand	and	the	Mocha	Italia	blend	of	coffee.
From	the	date	of	acquisition,	the	Company	acquired	contributed	£nil	revenue	and	£nil	profit	to	the	net	profit	of	the	
Group.	If	the	acquisition	had	taken	place	at	the	beginning	of	the	year,	the	profit	before	interest	and	taxation	for	the	
Group	would	have	increased	by	£1.1m	and	the	revenue	would	have	increased	by	£24.3m.

11 Earnings per share
The	basic	earnings	per	share	figures	are	calculated	by	dividing	the	net	profit	for	the	year	attributable	to	ordinary	
shareholders,	therefore	before	non-controlling	interests,	by	the	weighted	average	number	of	ordinary	shares	in	issue	
during	the	year	after	deducting	treasury	shares	and	shares	held	by	an	independently	managed	employee	share	
ownership	trust	(ESOT).
60 11 Earnings per share (continued)
The	diluted	earnings	per	share	figures	allow	for	the	dilutive	effect	of	the	conversion	into	ordinary	shares	of	the	
weighted	average	number	of	options	outstanding	during	the	period.	Where	the	share	price	at	the	year	end	is	lower	
than	the	option	price	the	options	become	anti-dilutive	and	are	excluded	from	the	calculation.	The	number	of	such	
options	was	nil	(2010:	nil).

relating	to	additions	in	the	year	has	been	allocated	for	impairment	testing	purposes	to	the	Costa	CGU	with	£nil	being	
allocated	to	the	Hotels	&	Restaurants	CGU.	Both	of	these	CGUs	are	also	operating	segments	and	represent	the	lowest

The	Group	considers	each	trading	outlet	to	be	a	CGU	and	each	CGU	is	reviewed	annually	for	indicators	of	impairment.
In	assessing	whether	an	asset	has	been	impaired,	the	carrying	amount	of	the	CGU	is	compared	to	its	recoverable	
amount.	The	recoverable	amount	is	the	higher	of	its	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	and	its	value	in	use.	In	the	absence	of	
any	information	about	the	fair	value	of	a	CGU,	the	recoverable	amount	is	deemed	to	be	its	value	in	use.
The	Group	estimates	value	in	use	using	a	discounted	cash	flow	model,	which	applies	a	pre-tax	discount	rate	of	
9.7%	in	the	UK	with	geographic	specific	percentages	overseas	(2009/10:	10.0%).	The	future	cash	flows	are	based	
on	assumptions	from	the	business	plans	and	cover	a	five	year	period.	These	business	plans	and	forecasts	include	
management’s	most	recent	view	of	medium	term	trading	prospects.	Cash	flows	beyond	this	period	are	extrapolated	
using	a	2.0%	growth	rate	(2009/10:	2.0%).
The	events	and	circumstances	that	led	to	the	impairment	charge	of	£13.0m	are	set	out	below:
Hotels & Restaurants
The	impairment	of	£12.1m	at	15	sites	in	this	strategic	business	unit	was	driven	by	a	number	of	factors.
•	Changes	in	the	local	competitive	environment	in	which	the	hotels	are	situated
•	Impairment	of	assets	held	for	sale	to	their	recoverable	value
•		 High	asset	prices	in	the	market	at	the	point	of	acquisition	for	acquired	sites	which	also	anticipated	higher	growth	
rates	at	that	time	than	are	now	expected.
Costa
Three	UK	Costa	sites,	nine	sites	in	Shanghai	and	two	in	the	Coffeeheaven	business	all	with	an	established	trend	of	poor	
performance	against	the	required	capital	investment	have	been	impaired	by	£0.9m	where	their	expected	future	cash	
flows	have	fallen	to	such	a	level	that	their	value	in	use	is	below	carrying	value.
Impairment reversals
Following	an	improvement	in	trading	performance	and	an	increase	in	amounts	of	estimated	future	cash	flows	of	
previously	impaired	sites,	reversals	of	£9.2m	have	been	recognised.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The	level	of	impairment	is	predominantly	dependent	upon	judgements	used	in	arriving	at	future	growth	rates		
and	the	discount	rate	applied	to	cash	flow	projections.	The	impact	on	the	impairment	charge	of	applying	different	
assumptions	to	the	growth	rates	used	in	the	five	year	business	plan	and	in	the	pre-tax	discount	rates	would	be		
as	follows:
	 Hotels	&	 	
	 Restaurants	 Costa	 Total
	 £m	 £m	 £m
Impairment	if	business	plan	growth	rates	were	reduced	by	1ppt	 (1.0) – (1.0)
Impairment	if	discount	rate	was	increased	by	1ppt	 (1.2) – (1.2)
64 15 Impairment (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill	acquired	through	business	combinations	is	allocated	to	groups	of	CGUs	at	strategic	business	unit	level,	being	
the	level	at	which	management	monitor	goodwill.
The	recoverable	amount	is	the	higher	of	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	and	value	in	use.	In	the	absence	of	a	recent	market	
transaction	the	recoverable	amount	is	determined	from	value	in	use	calculations.	This	is	calculated	using	the	five	year	
business	plans	approved	by	senior	management.	The	key	assumptions	in	these	calculations	relate	to	revenue	and	the	
increase	in	rooms.	The	calculation	is	most	sensitive	to	revenue	assumptions,	however	senior	management	believe	
that	the	assumptions	used	are	reasonable.	Cash	flows	beyond	this	period	are	extrapolated	using	a	2.0%	growth	rate	
(2009/10:	2.0%).	The	pre-tax	discount	rate	applied	to	cash	flow	projections	is	9.7%	(2009/10:	10.0%).
The	resultant	impairment	review	required	no	impairment	of	goodwill	allocated	to	either	the	Hotels	&	Restaurants	CGU	
or	the	Costa	CGU.
A	review	of	goodwill	acquired	in	2010/11	as	part	of	the	Coffee	Nation	acquisition	on	2	March	2011	showed	no		
indication	of	impairment	in	the	current	year	and	will	be	assessed	for	impairment	as	part	of	the	Costa	impairment	
review	in	future	years.		
Other intangibles
Other	intangibles	comprise	Costa	overseas	trading	licences	and	the	franchise	fee	and	brand	name	arrangements	
acquired	with	the	Premier	Lodge	business.	Costa	have	reviewed	the	intangible	assets	held	in	relation	to	the	Russian		
JV	and	impaired	them	down	by	£0.6m	(2009/10:	£nil).	Hotels	&	Restaurants	have	reviewed	assets	in	relation	to	a	site	
in	Dublin	and	impaired	them	down	by	£0.2m	(2009/10:	£nil).

22 Financial liabilities (continued)
Private placement loan notes
On	13	August	2010,	the	Group	completed	a	financing	transaction	in	the	United	States	Private	Placement	market.	The	
Group	issued	loan	notes	in	a	combination	of	both	sterling	and	US	dollars	at	maturities	of	both	seven	and	10	years	with	
a	fixed	coupon	payable	semi-annually.	Further	details	of	the	loan	notes	are	set	out	below.
Title	 Principal	value	 Maturity	 Coupon
Series	A	loan	notes	 $40m	 13-Aug-17	 4.55%
Series	B	loan	notes	 $75m	 13-Aug-20	 5.23%
Series	C	loan	notes	 £25m	 13-Aug-20	 5.19%
Following	the	issue	of	the	Series	A	loan	notes,	the	Group	entered	into	cross-currency	swaps	whereby	it	receives	a	
fixed	interest	rate	of	4.55%	on	a	notional	amount	of	$40.0m	and	pays	an	average	of	4.53%	on	a	notional	sterling	
balance	of	£26.7m.	These	swaps	have	been	formally	designated	as	a	cash	flow	hedge	of	the	Series	A	loan	notes.
The	Series	B	loan	notes	have	been	converted	to	sterling	debt	with	a	floating	rate	coupon	by	entering	into	cross-
currency	swaps	whereby	the	Group	receives	a	fixed	interest	rate	of	5.23%	on	a	notional	amount	of	$75.0m	and	pays	a	
spread	of	between	1.715%	and	1.755%	over	6m	GBP	LIBOR	on	a	notional	sterling	balance	of	£50.1m.	These	swaps	have	
been	formally	designated	as	a	fair	value	hedge	of	the	Series	B	loan	notes,	with	any	fair	value	movements	on	both	the	
derivatives	and	the	underlying	debt	taken	to	the	income	statement.	At	3	March	2011	the	carrying	value	of	the	private	
placement	loan	notes	included	a	fair	value	hedge	adjustment	of	£4.7m	which	decreased	the	liability.
The	above	swaps	eliminate	any	foreign	exchange	risk	on	the	repayment	of	the	principal	amounts	of	the	Series	A	
and	B	notes.	The	sterling	denominated	Series	C	loan	notes	remain	as	fixed	rate	sterling	debt	with	no	related	swap	
transactions.

Maturity	analysis	is	grouped	by	when	the	debt	is	contracted	to	mature	rather	than	by	repricing	dates,	as	allowed		
under	IFRS.
The	swaps	with	maturities	beyond	the	life	of	the	current	revolving	credit	facilities	(2013)	are	in	place	to	hedge	against	
the	core	level	of	debt	the	Group	will	hold.
The	carrying	amount	of	the	Group’s	borrowings	is	denominated	in	sterling	and	US	dollars.
At	3	March	2011,	the	Group	had	available	£503.9m	(2010:	£626.6m)	of	undrawn	committed	borrowing	facilities	in	
respect	of	revolving	credit	facilities	on	which	all	conditions	precedent	had	been	met.

Onerous	contracts
Onerous	contract	provisions	relate	primarily	to	property	reversions.	Provision	is	made	for	rent	and	other	property	
related	costs	for	the	period	that	a	sub-let	or	assignment	of	the	lease	is	not	possible.
Where	the	property	is	deemed	likely	to	be	assigned,	provision	is	made	for	the	best	estimate	of	the	reverse	lease	
premium	payable	on	the	assignment.	Where	the	property	is	deemed	likely	to	be	sub-let,	the	rental	income	and	the	
timing	of	the	cash	flows	are	estimated	by	both	internal	and	external	property	specialists	and	a	provision	is	maintained	
for	the	cost	incurred	by	the	Group.
Onerous	lease	provisions	are	discounted	using	a	discount	rate	of	3.74%	(2010:	4.20%)	based	on	a	10	year	Government	
Gilt	rate	as	an	approximation	for	a	risk	free	rate.
The	amount	and	timing	of	the	cash	outflows	are	subject	to	variations.	The	Group	utilises	the	skills	and	expertise	of	
both	internal	and	external	property	experts	to	determine	the	provision	held.
Provisions	are	expected	to	be	utilised	over	a	period	of	up	to	30	years.

24 Provisions (continued)
Reorganisation
The	reorganisation	provisions	were	created	as	a	result	of	an	overhead	review	carried	out	after	the	disposal	of	
David	Lloyd	Leisure	Limited	and	TGI	Friday’s,	and	for	the	outsourcing	of	the	Group’s	logistics	operations	and	the	
simplification	of	IT.	The	remaining	provision	relates	to	the	final	redundancy	costs	of	the	IT	simplification	project	whose	
implementation	has	been	delayed	to	2011/12.
Other
Other	provisions	relate	to	warranties	given	on	the	disposal	of	businesses.	These	are	expected	to	be	used	over	periods	
of	up	to	six	years.
25 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The	Group’s	principal	financial	instruments,	other	than	derivatives,	comprise	bank	loans,	private	placement	loans,	cash	
and	short-term	deposits.	The	Group’s	financial	instrument	policies	can	be	found	in	the	accounting	policies	in	note	2.	
The	Board	agrees	policies	for	managing	the	risks	summarised	below:

The	Group’s	exposure	to	market	risk	for	changes	in	interest	rates	relates	primarily	to	the	Group’s	long-term	sterling	
debt	obligations.	Interest	rate	swaps	are	used	to	achieve	the	desired	mix	of	fixed	and	floating	rate	debt.	The	Group’s	
policy	is	to	fix,	on	a	long-term	basis,	between	35%	and	65%	of	projected	net	interest	cost	over	the	next	15	years,		
which	is	beyond	the	life	of	the	Group’s	existing	revolving	credit	facilities.	This	policy	reduces	the	Group’s	exposure	to	
the	consequences	of	interest	rate	fluctuations.	Most	of	the	swaps	held	at	the	balance	sheet	date	were	entered	into	in	
January	2007	as	part	of	a	long-term	fixing	strategy.	However,	following	the	reduction	in	debt	during	the	year,	at	year	
end,	£445.9m	(84.7%)	of	Group	debt	was	fixed	for	an	average	of	3.75	years	(2010:	£400.7m,	71.4%,	for	4.0	years),	
using	floating	rate	borrowings	and	interest	rate	swaps.	The	intention	is	that	the	fixed	rate	debt	ratio	will	reduce		
going	forward	to	come	back	in	line	with	Group	policy.	The	average	rate	of	interest	on	this	fixed	rate	debt	was		
5.5%	(2009/10:	5.6%).
Although	the	private	placement	loan	rates	are	US	dollar	denominated,	cross-currency	swaps	mean	that	the	interest	
rate	risk	is	effectively	sterling	only.
In	accordance	with	IFRS	7	the	Group	has	undertaken	sensitivity	analysis	on	its	financial	instruments	which	are	affected	
by	changes	in	interest	rates.	This	analysis	has	been	prepared	on	the	basis	of	a	constant	amount	of	net	debt,	a	constant	
ratio	of	fixed	to	floating	interest	rates,	and	on	the	basis	of	the	hedging	instruments	in	place	at	3	March	2011	and	4	March	
2010	respectively.	Consequently,	the	analysis	relates	to	the	situation	at	those	dates	and	is	not	representative	of	the	
years	then	ended.	The	following	assumptions	were	made:
•			 Balance	sheet	sensitivity	to	interest	rates	applies	only	to	derivative	financial	instruments,	as	the	carrying	value	of	
debt	and	deposits	does	not	change	as	interest	rates	move;
•			 Gains	or	losses	are	recognised	in	equity	or	the	income	statement	in	line	with	the	accounting	policies	set	out	in	
note	2;	and
•		Cash	flow	hedges	were	effective.
Based	on	the	Group’s	net	debt	position	at	the	year	end	a	1ppt	change	in	interest	rates	would	affect	the	Group’s	profit	
before	tax	by	approximately	£0.7m	(2009/10:	£1.2m),	and	equity	by	approximately	£11.3m	(2010:	£13.8m).
Liquidity	risk
The	Group	mitigates	liquidity	risk	by	managing	cash	generated	by	its	operations	combined	with	bank	borrowings		
and	long-term	debt.	In	its	funding	strategy	the	Group’s	objective	is	to	maintain	a	balance	between	the	continuity		
of	funding	and	flexibility	through	the	use	of	overdrafts	and	bank	loans.	This	strategy	includes	monitoring	the	maturity	
of	financial	liabilities	to	avoid	the	risk	of	a	shortage	of	funds.
Excess	cash	used	in	managing	liquidity	is	placed	on	interest-bearing	deposit	with	maturities	fixed	at	no	more	than	
three	months.	Short-term	flexibility	is	achieved	through	the	use	of	short-term	borrowing	on	the	money	markets.
The	tables	below	summarise	the	maturity	profile	of	the	Group’s	financial	liabilities	at	3	March	2011	and	4	March	2010

Credit	risk
There	are	no	significant	concentrations	of	credit	risk	within	the	Group.
The	Group	is	exposed	to	a	small	amount	of	credit	risk	that	is	primarily	attributable	to	its	trade	and	other	receivables.	
This	is	minimised	by	dealing	with	counterparties	with	high	credit	ratings.	The	amounts	included	in	the	balance	sheet	
are	net	of	allowances	for	doubtful	debts,	which	have	been	estimated	by	management	based	on	prior	experience	
and	known	factors	at	the	balance	sheet	date	which	may	indicate	that	a	provision	is	required.	The	Group’s	maximum	
exposure	on	its	trade	and	other	receivables	is	the	carrying	amount	as	disclosed	in	note	20.
With	respect	to	credit	risk	arising	from	the	other	financial	assets	of	the	Group,	which	comprise	cash	and	cash	
equivalents,	the	Group’s	exposure	arises	from	default	of	the	counterparty,	with	a	maximum	exposure	equal	to	the	
carrying	value	of	these	instruments.	The	Group	seeks	to	minimise	the	risk	of	default	in	relation	to	cash	and	cash	
equivalents	by	spreading	investments	across	a	number	of	counterparties.
In	the	event	that	any	of	the	Group’s	banks	get	into	financial	difficulties	the	Group	is	exposed	to	the	risk	of	withdrawal	
of	currently	undrawn	committed	facilities.	This	risk	is	mitigated	by	the	Group	having	a	range	of	counterparties	to	its	
facilities	and	by	maintaining	headroom.
Foreign	currency	risk
Foreign	exchange	exposure	is	currently	not	significant	to	the	Group.	Although	the	Group	has	US	dollar	denominated	loan	
notes	these	have	been	swapped	into	sterling	thereby	eliminating	foreign	currency	risk.	Sensitivity	analysis	has	therefore	
not	been	carried	out.
Overseas	investments	are	generally	start-up	businesses	undertaken	through	joint	venture	arrangements.	The	Group	
monitors	the	growth	and	risks	associated	with	its	overseas	operations	and	will	undertake	hedging	activities	as	and	
when	they	are	required.
Capital	management
The	Group’s	primary	objective	in	regard	to	capital	management	is	to	ensure	that	it	continues	to	operate	as	a	going	
concern	and	has	sufficient	funds,	at	its	disposal	to	grow	the	business	for	the	benefit	of	shareholders.	The	Group	seeks	
to	maintain	a	ratio	of	debt	to	equity	that	balances	risks	and	returns	and	also	complies	with	lending	covenants.	See	
pages	16	and	17	of	this	report	for	the	policies	and	objectives	of	the	Board	regarding	capital	management,	analysis	of	
the	Group’s	credit	facilities	and	financing	plans	for	the	coming	years.
The	Group	aims	to	maintain	sufficient	funds	for	working	capital	and	future	investment	in	order	to	meet	growth	targets.	
The	Group	has	adopted	a	framework	to	keep	leverage	(debt	divided	by	EBITDA)	on	a	pensions	lease	adjusted	basis	
at	3.5	times	or	below	which	was	achieved	for	the	year	ended	3	March	2011.	This	calculation	takes	account	of	net	debt,	
pensions	deficit	and	capital	value	of	leases.	The	management	of	equity	through	share	buy	backs	and	new	issues	is	
considered	as	part	of	the	overall	leverage	framework	balanced	against	the	funding	requirements	of	future	growth.
The	Group’s	financing	is	subject	to	financial	covenants.	These	covenants	relate	to	measurement	of	EBITDA	against	
consolidated	net	finance	charges	(interest	cover)	and	total	net	debt	(leverage	ratio,	on	an	unadjusted	basis).	The	
Group	has	complied	with	all	covenants.
The	above	matters	are	considered	at	regular	intervals	and	form	part	of	the	business	planning	and	budgeting	
processes.	In	addition,	the	Board	regularly	reviews	the	Group’s	dividend	policy	and	funding	strategy.

Fair	values
Set	out	below	is	a	comparison	by	category	of	carrying	amounts	and	fair	values	of	the	Group’s	principal	financial	
instruments.
The	fair	value	of	loan	capital	and	derivative	instruments	is	calculated	by	discounting	all	future	cash	flows	by	the	
market	yield	curve	at	the	balance	sheet	date.

Hierarchical	classification	of	financial	assets	and	liabilities	measured	at	fair	value
IFRS	7	requires	that	the	classification	of	financial	instruments	at	fair	value	be	determined	by	reference	to	the	source	of	
inputs	used	to	derive	the	fair	value.	The	classification	uses	the	following	three-level	hierarchy:
Level 1
Quoted	prices	(unadjusted)	in	active	markets	for	identical	assets	or	liabilities.
Level 2
Other	techniques	for	which	all	inputs	which	have	a	significant	effect	on	the	recorded	fair	value	are	observable,	either	
directly	or	indirectly.
Level 3
Techniques	which	use	inputs	which	have	a	significant	effect	on	the	recorded	fair	value	that	are	not	based	on	
observable	market	data.

Hedges
Cash flow hedges
At	3	March	2011	the	Group	had	interest	rate	swaps	in	place	to	swap	a	notional	amount	of	£400m	(2010:	£400m)	
whereby	it	receives	a	variable	interest	rate	based	on	LIBOR	on	the	notional	amount	and	pays	fixed	rates	of	between	
5.145%	and	5.695%	(2010:	5.145%	and	5.695%).	The	swaps	are	being	used	to	hedge	the	exposure	to	changes	in	future	
cash	flows	from	variable	rate	debt.
The	swaps	with	maturities	beyond	the	life	of	the	current	revolving	credit	facilities	(2013)	are	in	place	to	hedge	against	
the	core	level	of	debt	the	Group	will	hold.	
Following	the	issue	of	the	Series	A	loan	notes	during	the	year	in	the	US	Private	Placement	market,	the	Group	entered	
into	cross-currency	swap	whereby	it	receives	a	fixed	interest	rate	of	4.55%	on	a	notional	amount	of	$40.0m	and	pays	
an	average	of	4.53%	on	a	notional	sterling	balance	of	£26.7m.
Fair value hedges 
Following	the	issue	of	the	Series	B	loan	notes	during	the	year	in	the	US	Private	Placement	market,	the	Group	entered	
into	cross-currency	swap	whereby	it	receives	a	fixed	interest	rate	of	5.23%	on	a	notional	amount	of	$75.0m	and	pays	a	
spread	of	between	1.715%	and	1.755%	over	6m	GBP	LIBOR	on	a	notional	sterling	balance	of	£50.1m.	
Cash	flow	and	fair	value	hedges	are	expected	to	impact	on	the	income	statement	in	line	with	the	liquidity	risk	table	
shown	in	note	25.
The	cash	flow	hedges	were	assessed	to	be	highly	effective	at	3	March	2011	and	a	net	unrealised	gain	of	£8.6m	
(2009/10:	net	unrealised	gain	of	£3.0m)	has	been	recorded	in	other	comprehensive	income.	The	fair	value	hedges	
were	also	assessed	to	be	highly	effective	at	3	March	2011	with	nil	impact	on	the	income	statement	(2009/10:	£nil).	
During	the	year,	a	loss	of	£18.4m	(2009/10:	£15.9m)	was	charged	to	the	income	statement	in	respect	of	hedged	items	
affecting	the	net	finance	charge	for	the	year.

28 Share capital (continued)
At	the	2010	Annual	General	Meeting,	the	Company	was	authorised	to	purchase	up	to	17.8m	of	its	own	shares	on	the	
open	market.
During	the	year	no	ordinary	shares	were	acquired	(2009/10:	nil).	No	shares	were	cancelled	in	the	year	(2009/10:	nil).	
The	remainder	are	being	held	in	the	treasury	reserve	(note	29).
During	the	year	to	3	March	2011	options	over	0.3m	ordinary	shares,	fully	paid,	were	exercised	by	employees	under		
the	terms	of	various	share	option	schemes	(2009/10:	0.2m).
Shareholders	were	offered	a	scrip	alternative	to	the	2009/10	cash	final	dividend	of	28.35p	and	to	the	2010/11	cash	
interim	dividend	of	11.25p.	Ordinary	shares	issued	in	respect	of	this	totalled	491,875.	The	issue	of	shares	in	lieu	of		
cash	dividends	is	treated	as	a	bonus	issue,	with	the	nominal	value	of	the	shares	being	charged	against	the	share	
premium	account.
The	total	number	of	shares	in	issue	at	the	year	end	used	in	the	calculation	of	the	basic	weighted	average	number	of	
ordinary	shares	was	191.4m,	less	14.3m	treasury	shares	held	by	Whitbread	PLC	and	0.9m	held	by	the	ESOT	(2010:

29 Reserves
Share	premium
The	share	premium	reserve	is	the	premium	paid	on	the	Company’s	76.80p	ordinary	shares.	The	issue	of	shares	in	lieu	
of	cash	dividends	is	treated	as	a	bonus	issue,	with	the	nominal	value	of	the	shares	being	charged	against	the	share	
premium	account.	During	the	year,	shares	with	a	nominal	value	of	£0.4m	were	issued	in	lieu	of	the	2009/10	final	and	
2010/11	interim	cash	dividends	(2009/10:	£0.7m).
Capital	redemption	reserve
A	capital	redemption	reserve	was	created	on	the	cancellation	of	the	Group’s	B	and	C	preference	shares	(note	28)	and	
also	includes	the	nominal	value	of	cancelled	ordinary	shares.
Retained	earnings
In	accordance	with	IFRS	practice,	retained	earnings	include	revaluation	reserves	which	are	not	distributable	under		
UK	law.
Currency	translation	reserve

30 Commitments and contingencies
Operating	lease	commitments
The	Group	leases	various	buildings	which	are	used	within	the	Hotels	&	Restaurants	and	Costa	businesses.	The	leases	
are	non-cancellable	operating	leases	with	varying	terms,	escalation	clauses	and	renewal	rights.	The	Group	also	leases	
various	plant	and	equipment	under	non-cancellable	operating	lease	agreements.
Contingent	rents	are	the	portion	of	the	lease	payment	that	is	not	fixed	in	amount	but	based	upon	the	future	amount		
of	a	factor	that	changes	other	than	with	the	passage	of	time	(e.g.	percentage	of	future	sales,	amount	of	future	use,	
future	price	indices,	future	market	rates	of	interest).
Future	minimum	rentals	payable	under	non-cancellable	operating	leases	are	as	follows:
	 2011 2010
 £m £m
Due	within	one	year	 109.5	 93.0 
Due	after	one	year	but	not	more	than	five	years	 385.8	 312.2 
Due	after	five	years	but	not	more	than	ten	years	 326.0	 266.9 
Due	after	ten	years	 1,025.0	 957.1 
	 1,846.3	 1,629.2 
Future	minimum	rentals	payable	under	non-cancellable	operating	leases	disclosed	above	includes	£94.3m	in	relation	
to	privity	contracts.	Future	lease	costs	in	respect	of	these	privity	contracts	are	included	within	the	onerous	contracts	
provision	(note	24).	Onerous	contracts	are	under	constant	review	and	every	effort	is	taken	to	reduce	this	obligation.
The	weighted	average	lease	life	of	future	minimum	rentals	payable	under	non-cancellable	operating	leases	is	16.0

received	under	non-cancellable	sublease	agreements	as	at	3	March	2011	are	£18.8m	(2010:	£21.8m).
Contingent	liabilities
As	disclosed	in	note	6,	during	the	period	the	Group	received	£4.6m	refund	of	VAT	charged	on	gaming	machine	income,	
together	with	associated	interest	of	£0.7m.	The	refund	was	made	following	a	ruling	that	the	application	of	VAT	to	certain	
types	of	gaming	machine	income	contravened	the	European	Union’s	principle	of	fiscal	neutrality.	HMRC	have	appealed	
against	the	ruling,	and	if	HMRC’s	appeal	is	upheld	the	refund	and	associated	interest	of	£5.3m	would	be	repayable.

Long-Term	Incentive	Plan	(LTIP)
The	LTIP	awards	shares	to	directors	and	senior	executives	of	the	Group.	Vesting	of	shares	under	the	scheme	will	
depend	on	continued	employment	and	meeting	total	shareholder	return	(TSR)	and	earnings	per	share	(EPS)	
performance	targets	over	a	three	year	period.	Details	of	the	performance	targets	for	the	LTIP	awards	can	be	seen		
in	the	Remuneration	report	on	pages	31	to	38.
The	awards	are	settled	in	equity	once	exercised.
Movements	in	the	number	of	share	awards	are	as	follows:

Deferred	equity	awards
Awards	are	made	under	the	Whitbread	Leadership	Group	Incentive	Scheme	implemented	during	2004/5.
The	awards	are	not	subject	to	performance	conditions	and	will	vest	in	full	on	the	release	date	subject	to	continued	
employment	at	that	date.	If	the	director	or	senior	executive	of	the	Group	ceases	to	be	an	employee	of	Whitbread	prior	
to	the	release	date,	normally	three	years	after	the	award,	by	reason	of	redundancy,	retirement,	death,	injury,	ill	health,	
disability	or	some	other	reason	considered	to	be	appropriate	by	the	Remuneration	Committee	the	awards	will	be	
released	in	full.	If	employment	ceases	for	any	other	reason	the	proportion	of	awards	which	vests	depends	upon	the	
year	in	which	the	award	was	made	and	the	date	that	employment	ceased.	If	employment	ceases	in	the	first	year	after	
an	award	is	made	none	of	the	award	vests,	between	the	first	and	second	anniversary	25%	vests	and	between

No	changes	will	be	made	to	options	already	granted.
The	only	option	still	outstanding	was	granted	in	2001	and	the	performance	conditions	required	the	Company’s	adjusted	
earnings	per	share	to	exceed	RPI	plus	4%	per	annum	measured	over	any	three	consecutive	years	out	of	the	10	year

Expected	volatility	reflects	the	assumption	that	historical	volatility	is	indicative	of	future	trends,	which	may	not	
necessarily	be	the	actual	outcome.
The	risk-free	rate	is	the	rate	of	interest	obtainable	from	government	securities	over	the	expected	life	of	the		
equity	incentive.	
The	expected	dividend	yield	is	calculated	on	the	basis	of	publicly	available	information	at	the	time	of	the	grant	date	
which,	in	most	cases,	is	the	historic	dividend	yield.
No	other	features	relating	to	the	granting	of	options	were	incorporated	into	the	measurement	of	fair	value.
At	3	March	2011	there	were	outstanding	options	for	employees	to	purchase	up	to	1.3m	(2010:	1.3m)	ordinary	shares	of	
76.80	pence	each	between	2011	and	2016	at	prices	between	£5.39	and	£14.17	per	share	(2010:	between	2010	and	2015	
at	prices	between	£5.39	and	£14.17	per	share).
Employee	Share	Ownership	Trust	(ESOT)
The	Company	funds	an	ESOT	to	enable	it	to	acquire	and	hold	shares	for	the	LTIP	and	executive	share	option		
schemes.	The	ESOT	held	0.9m	shares	at	3	March	2011	(2010:	0.5m).	All	dividends	on	the	shares	in	the	ESOT	are		
waived	by	the	Trustee.
32 Retirement benefits
Defined	contribution	schemes
The	Group	operates	a	contracted-in	defined	contribution	scheme	under	the	Whitbread	Group	Pension	Fund.	
Contributions	by	both	employees	and	Group	companies	are	held	in	externally	invested	trustee-administered	funds.		
The	Group	also	has	a	contracted-out	defined	contribution	pension	scheme	which	closed	to	new	members	on		
31	December	2001.
The	Group	contributes	a	specified	percentage	of	earnings	for	members	of	the	above	defined	contribution	schemes,	
and	thereafter	has	no	further	obligations	in	relation	to	the	schemes.	The	total	cost	charged	to	income	in	relation	to	
defined	contribution	schemes	in	the	year	was	£3.3m	(2009/10:	£2.0m).
At	the	year	end,	1,743	employees	(2010:	1,641)	were	active	members	of	the	schemes,	which	also	had	6,791	deferred	
members	(2010:	6,769).
Defined	benefit	schemes
The	defined	benefit	(final	salary)	section	of	the	principal	Group	pension	scheme,	the	Whitbread	Group	Pension	Fund,	
was	closed	to	new	members	on	31	December	2001	and	to	future	accrual	on	31	December	2009.	The	scheme	is	funded,	
and	contributions	by	both	employees	and	Group	companies	are	held	in	externally	invested	trustee-administered	
funds.	Members	of	the	scheme	are	contracted	out	of	the	State	Second	Pension.
At	the	year	end	the	scheme	had	no	active	members	(2010:	nil),	26,101	deferred	pensioners	(2010:	26,744)	and	16,258	
pensions	in	payment	(2010:	15,998).
78 32 Retirement benefits (continued)
Defined	benefit	schemes	(continued)
A	scheme	specific	actuarial	valuation	for	the	purpose	of	determining	the	level	of	cash	contributions	to	be	paid	into	
the	Whitbread	Group	Pension	Fund	was	undertaken	as	at	31	March	2008.	A	deficit	recovery	plan	and	some	protection	
whilst	the	scheme	remains	in	deficit	have	been	agreed	with	the	Trustee.	The	Group	will	make	the	following	payments	
to	the	Fund:	£55m	in	each	of	August	2011,	August	2012	and	August	2013;	£65m	in	each	of	August	2014	and	August	
2015;	£70m	in	August	2016;	£80m	in	each	of	August	2017	and	August	2018.	For	the	period	of	the	deficit,	the	Group	
has	agreed	to	give	undertakings	to	the	Trustee	similar	to	some	of	the	covenants	provided	in	respect	of	its	banking	
agreements,	up	to	the	value	of	any	outstanding	recovery	plan	payments	or	the	remaining	deficit,	if	lower.	Until	the	
next	valuation	the	Trustee	has	also	been	given	a	promise	of	participation	in	increases	in	ordinary	dividends	where	
these	exceed	RPI	and	the	right	to	consultation	before	any	special	distribution	can	be	made.
In	addition	to	the	scheduled	deficit	contribution	payments	described	above,	the	Pension	Scheme	will	receive	a	share	
of	the	income,	profits	and	a	variable	capital	payment	from	its	investment	in	Moorgate	Scottish	Limited	Partnership,	
which	was	established	by	the	Group	in	the	year	ended	4	March	2010	(the	share	in	profits	is	accounted	for	by	the	
Group	as	contributions	when	paid).	The	partnership	interests	in	Moorgate	SLP	are	held	by	the	Group,	the	general	
partner,	and	by	the	Pension	Scheme.	A	further	£39m	investment	was	made	during	the	year	on	the	same	basis	as	the	
£102m	investment	made	by	the	Pension	Scheme	Trustee	in	the	previous	financial	year.
Moorgate	SLP	holds	an	investment	in	a	further	partnership,	Farringdon	Scottish	Partnership,	which	was	also	
established	by	the	Group	during	the	previous	financial	year.	Property	assets	with	a	market	value	of	£221m	have	been	
transferred	from	other	Group	companies	to	Farringdon	SP	and	leased	back	to	Whitbread	Group	PLC	and	Premier	
Inn	Hotels	Limited.	The	Group	retains	control	over	these	properties,	including	the	flexibility	to	substitute	alternative	
properties.	However,	the	Trustee	has	first	charge	over	the	property	portfolio	and	certain	other	assets	with	an	
aggregate	value	of	£228m.	The	Group	retains	control	over	both	partnerships,	and	as	such	they	are	fully	consolidated	
in	these	Group	financial	statements.
The	Pension	Scheme	is	a	partner	in	Moorgate	SLP	and,	as	such,	is	entitled	to	an	annual	share	of	the	profits	of	the	
partnership	over	the	next	14	years.	At	the	end	of	this	period,	the	partnership	capital	allocated	to	the	Pension		
Scheme	partner	will	be	changed,	depending	on	the	funding	position	of	the	Pension	Scheme	at	that	time,	to	a		
value	up	to	£150m	(2010:	£110m).	At	that	point,	the	Group	may	be	required	to	transfer	this	amount	in	cash		
to	the	Pension	Scheme.
Under	IAS	19	the	investment	held	by	the	Pension	Scheme	in	Moorgate	SLP,	a	consolidated	entity,	does	not	represent		
a	plan	asset	for	the	purposes	of	the	Group’s	consolidated	financial	statements.	Accordingly	the	pension	deficit	
position	in	these	Group	financial	statements	does	not	reflect	the	£141m	(2010:	£102m)	investment	in	Moorgate	SLP	
held	by	the	Pension	Scheme.
The	total	service	cost	contributions	to	the	Whitbread	Group	Pension	Fund	in	2011/12	will	be	£nil.
The	IAS	19	pension	cost	relating	to	the	defined	benefit	section	of	the	Whitbread	Group	Pension	Fund	is	assessed	
in	accordance	with	actuarial	advice	from	Lane	Clark	&	Peacock	and	Towers	Watson,	using	the	projected	unit	credit	
method.	As	the	scheme	is	now	closed	to	future	accrual,	there	will	be	no	service	cost	in	the	future.
The	principal	assumptions	used	by	the	independent	qualified	actuaries	in	updating	the	most	recent	valuation	carried	
out	as	at	31	March	2008	of	the	UK	schemes	to	3	March	2011	for	IAS	19	purposes	were:

1.  The Whitbread Group Pension fund was closed to future accrual on 31 December 2009. From this point active members’ benefits only 
increase in line with inflation.
The	mortality	assumptions	are	based	on	standard	mortality	tables	which	allow	for	future	mortality	improvements.	
The	assumptions	are	that	a	member	currently	aged	65	will	live	on	average	for	a	further	20.7	years	(2010:	20.6)	if	they	
are	male	and	for	a	further	23.2	years	(2010:	23.1)	if	they	are	female.	For	a	member	who	retires	in	2030	at	age	65,	the	
assumptions	are	that	they	will	live	on	average	for	a	further	22.6	years	(2010:	22.5)	after	retirement	if	they	are	male	and	
for	a	further	25.0	years	(2010:	24.9)	after	retirement	if	they	are	female.
The	Group	employs	a	building	block	approach	in	determining	the	long-term	rate	of	return	on	pension	plan	assets.	
Historical	markets	are	studied	and	assets	with	higher	volatility	are	assumed	to	generate	higher	returns	consistent	with	
widely	accepted	capital	market	principles.	The	assumed	long-term	rate	of	return	on	each	asset	class	is	set	out	within	
this	note.	The	overall	expected	rate	of	return	on	assets	is	then	derived	by	aggregating	the	expected	return	for	each	
actual	asset	allocation	for	the	Fund	at	3	March	2011	(rounded	to	the	nearest	0.1%	per	annum).

Fair	value	of	scheme	assets	 1,257.0	 1,281.0 
Liability	recognised	in	the	balance	sheet	 (488.0)	 (434.0)
During	the	year	the	accounting	deficit	increased	from	£434.0m	at	4	March	2010	to	£488.0m	at	3	March	2011.	The	
actual	returns	on	assets	over	the	period	have	been	lower	than	expected	based	on	the	expected	rate	of	return	and	the	
asset	value	at	the	start	of	the	period.
The	actual	pension	increase	in	February	2011	was	higher	than	the	assumption	at	the	start	of	the	period.	This	has	led	to	
an	increase	in	the	defined	benefit	obligation	at	3	March	2011.	This	was	somewhat	offset	by	a	modest	gain	as	a	result	of	
changes	in	other	financial	assumptions	from	the	beginning	to	the	end	of	the	period.

Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities
The	directors	are	responsible	for	
preparing	the	Annual	Report	and	the	
financial	statements	in	accordance	
with	applicable	law	and	regulations.	
Company	law	requires	the	directors	
to	prepare	financial	statements	
for	each	financial	year.	Under	that	
law	the	directors	have	elected	to	
prepare	the	financial	statements	in	
accordance	with	United	Kingdom	
Generally	Accepted	Accounting	
Practice	(United	Kingdom	Accounting	
Standards	and	applicable	law).
Under	company	law	the	directors	
must	not	approve	the	financial	
statements	unless	they	are	satisfied	
that	they	give	a	true	and	fair	
view	of	the	state	of	affairs	of	the	
Company	and	of	the	profit	or	loss	
of	the	Company	for	that	period.	In	
preparing	those	financial	statements,	
the	directors	are	required	to:
•		 select	suitable	accounting	policies	
and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•		 make	judgements	and	estimates	
that	are	reasonable	and	prudent;
•		 state	whether	applicable	UK	
accounting	standards	have	been	
followed,	subject	to	any	material	
departures	disclosed	and	explained	
in	the	financial	statements;	and
•		 prepare	the	financial	statements	on	
the	going	concern	basis	unless	it	is	
inappropriate	to	presume	that	the	
Company	will	continue	in	business.
The	directors	are	responsible	for	
keeping	adequate	accounting	
records	that	are	sufficient	to	
show	and	explain	the	Company’s	
transactions	and	disclose	with	
reasonable	accuracy	at	any	time	the	
financial	position	of	the	Company	
and	enable	them	to	ensure	that	the	
financial	statements	comply	with	
the	Companies	Act	2006.	They	are	
also	responsible	for	safeguarding	the	
assets	of	the	Company	and	hence	
for	taking	reasonable	steps	for	the	
prevention	and	detection	of	fraud	
and	other	irregularities.
Independent auditor’s report to 
the members of Whitbread PLC
We	have	audited	the	parent	
company	financial	statements	of	
Whitbread	PLC	for	the	year	ended	
3	March	2011	which	comprise	parent	
company	Balance	Sheet	and	the	
related	notes	1	to	11.	The	financial	
reporting	framework	that	has	
been	applied	in	their	preparation	is	
applicable	law	and	United	Kingdom	
Accounting	Standards	(United	
Kingdom	Generally	Accepted	
Accounting	Practice).
This	report	is	made	solely	to	the	
Company’s	members,	as	a	body,	in	
accordance	with	Chapter	3	of	Part	
16	of	the	Companies	Act	2006.	Our	
audit	work	has	been	undertaken	
so	that	we	might	state	to	the	
Company’s	members	those	matters	
we	are	required	to	state	to	them	
in	an	auditor’s	report	and	for	no	
other	purpose.	To	the	fullest	extent	
permitted	by	law,	we	do	not	accept	
or	assume	responsibility	to	anyone	
other	than	the	Company	and	the	
Company’s	members	as	a	body,	for	
our	audit	work,	for	this	report,	or		
for	the	opinions	we	have	formed.
Respective responsibilities 
of directors and auditors
As	explained	more	fully	in	the	
Directors’	Responsibilities	Statement	
set	out	above,	the	directors	are	
responsible	for	the	preparation	
of	the	parent	company	financial	
statements	and	for	being	satisfied	
that	they	give	a	true	and	fair	view.	
Our	responsibility	is	to	audit	the	
parent	company	financial	statements	
in	accordance	with	applicable	law	
and	International	Standards	on	
Auditing	(UK	and	Ireland).	Those	
standards	require	us	to	comply	
with	the	Auditing	Practices	Board’s	
Ethical	Standards	for	Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements 
An	audit	involves	obtaining	evidence	
about	the	amounts	and	disclosures	
in	the	financial	statements	sufficient	
to	give	reasonable	assurance	
that	the	financial	statements	are	
free	from	material	misstatement,	
whether	caused	by	fraud	or	error.	
This	includes	an	assessment	of:	
whether	the	accounting	policies	are	
appropriate	to	the	parent	company’s	
circumstances	and	have	been	
consistently	applied	and	adequately	
disclosed;	the	reasonableness	of	
significant	accounting	estimates	
made	by	the	directors;	and	the	
overall	presentation	of	the	financial	
statements.	In	addition,	we	read	
all	the	financial	information	in	the	
Whitbread	PLC	Annual	Report	to	
identify	material	inconsistencies		
with	the	audited	financial	
statements.	If	we	become	aware	of	
any	apparent	material	misstatements	
or	inconsistencies	we	consider	the	
implication	for	our	report.
Opinion on financial statements
In	our	opinion	the	parent	company	
financial	statements:
•		 give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the		
state	of	the	Company’s	affairs	as		
at	3	March	2011;
•		 have	been	properly	prepared	in	
accordance	with	United	Kingdom	
Generally	Accepted	Accounting	
Practice;	and
•		 have	been	prepared	in	accordance	
with	the	requirements	of	the	
Companies	Act	2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In	our	opinion:
•		 the	part	of	the	Directors’	
Remuneration	Report	to	be	audited	
has	been	properly	prepared	in	
accordance	with	the	Companies	
Act	2006;	and
•		 the	information	given	in	the	
Directors’	Report	for	the	financial	
year	for	which	the	financial	
statements	are	prepared	is	
consistent	with	the	parent	
company	financial	statements.
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
We	have	nothing	to	report	in	respect	
of	the	following	matters	where	the	
Companies	Act	2006	requires	us		
to	report	to	you	if,	in	our	opinion:
•		 adequate	accounting	records	
have	not	been	kept	by	the	parent	
company,	or	returns	adequate	for	
our	audit	have	not	been	received	
from	branches	not	visited	by	us;	or
•		 the	parent	company	financial	
statements	and	the	part	of	the	
Directors’	Remuneration	Report		
to	be	audited	are	not	in	agreement	
with	the	accounting	records	and	
returns;	or
•		 certain	disclosures	of	directors’	
remuneration	specified	by	law		
are	not	made;	or
•		 we	have	not	received	all	the	
information	and	explanations		
we	require	for	our	audit.
Other matter
We	have	reported	separately	on	
the	Group	financial	statements	of	
Whitbread	PLC	for	the	year	ended		
3	March	2011.

may	not	be	recoverable.
3 Profit earned for ordinary shareholders 
The	profit	and	loss	account	of	the	parent	company	is	omitted	from	the	Company’s	accounts	by	virtue	of	the

Principal activity
Ariana Resources PLC is a public limited 
company incorporated and domiciled in Great 
Britain. The Company’s shares are listed on 
the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. 
The principal activities of the Company and its 
subsidiaries ( the “Group”) are related to the 
exploration for and development of gold and 
other minerals in Turkey.

Market capitalisation (£m)
2012: 4.6
Ariana is headquartered in London and 
its Turkish operating subsidiary Galata 
Madencilik San. ve Tic. Ltd. (“Galata”), 
operates from Ankara, Turkey. Galata also  
has a regional base operating from Sındırgı, 
which is close to the Red Rabbit Gold  
Project area. 
Ariana currently holds a 73.5% stake in Zenit 
Madencilik San. ve Tic. A.S. (“Zenit”). Zenit was 
incorporated following the joint venture (JV) 
of the Red Rabbit Gold Project with Proccea 
Construction Co. (“Proccea”). Under the terms 
of the JV, Proccea is earning into a 50% stake 
in Zenit. Management control of the JV was 
transferred to Proccea in 2013. At the date  
of this report, Proccea had earned in to 26.5%  
of the Red Rabbit Gold Project and is responsible 
for sole funding of the construction stage of  
the project.
Ariana owns 49% of Pontid Madencilik San. ve 
Tic. Ltd., the Turkish operating company formed 
through the JV with Eldorado Gold in north-
eastern Turkey. Eldorado has operational control 
of the project and is responsible for wholly 
funding exploration at Ardala and Salinbaş. 
Ariana is run with as low a cost-base as is 
practical to enable the Company to maximise 
the efficiency of exploration activities in western 
Turkey. The Company maintains some of 
the most competitive industry discovery and 
acquisition costs per gold ounce (currently ~ 
US$22 oz) inclusive of corporate costs.

Strategic Report
Ariana at a glance It gives me great pleasure to write my 
inaugural Chairman’s Statement to you at  
this exciting juncture in Ariana’s development. 
Michael Spriggs, our previous Chairman, 
worked tirelessly to progress the Company 
from a grassroots explorer with interests 
in Turkey, to the business which I inherited 
as Chairman in July last year – a gold-silver 
developer on the eve of production, with plenty 
of exploration upside from a world class 
greenfield database. I would firstly like to 
take this opportunity to thank Michael for all 
he has done for the Company over his tenure 
as Chairman, as well as congratulate the 
rest of the team for significant and material 
achievements over the past year; all of which 
have moved Ariana closer to our objective  
of achieving gold production in the near term.
I will leave it to our ever-competent Managing 
Director , Dr . Kerim Sener , to run through  
the bulk of the operational successes that  
we have achieved over the year , but I believe it 
would be remiss of me not to highlight the key 
milestones which we have passed, and hurdles 
overcome, as we move towards becoming a 
cash generative gold explorer , developer and 
producer during the next year . 
Given that the Red Rabbit Gold Project (“RRGP”) 
is the most advanced in our portfolio, we have 
focused our efforts in this area. Our emphasis 
in 2013 was marked by systematically securing 
the requisite permits ahead of targeted 
production in the next 12 months. The year 
began with our Environmental Project 
Summary Document being submitted to the 
Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning for 
the Kiziltepe Sector of the RRGP, being the site 
of our initial mine. This marked the initiation  
of the formal process for the permitting of the 
mine. A further key milestone for the Company  
was the successful completion of the public 
and ministerial consultation process as part  
of our Environmental Impact Assessment 
(“EIA”) submission, with positive EIA certification 
subsequently being received in December  
2013. The public meeting was attended by 
approximately 100 people from the surrounding 
communities, and Ariana received overwhelming 
support for the proposed development of the 
mine at Kiziltepe. The Company also received 
confirmation from the Turkish authorities that 
the mine development site was also deemed 
suitable and appropriate by the Provincial 
Directorate.
Your company is fortunate to have developed 
a strong symbiotic relationship with a very 
successful and well respected Turkish mine 
construction firm in the form of Proccea 
Construction Co. Having such a technically and 
financially stable operator in partnership with 
Ariana, will enable us to jointly develop both 
the Red Rabbit project, as well as any new gold 
resources we are in the process of discovering. 
Proccea continues to fund the development 
of the Red Rabbit project under their earn in 
arrangement and have successfully advanced 
the arrangements for local project finance  
for the mine construction.
The support of the local community and 
regional authorities is very important to the 
Ariana team, and also to the success of the 
RRGP . We are now on the verge of creating  
a project that generates new revenue and  
local employment in the region, enhancing  
the overall socio-economic development of  
the area. Our plans for local employment 
include the employment of approximately  
100 people directly in mining and processing 
and a further multiple thereof employed 
indirectly via support services and related 
enterprises.

Strategic Report  With a current mine life of eight years from 
Kiziltepe itself and a further two satellite 
targets at Kizilcukur and Ivrindi, the road 
map for the next decade is well established. 
However the Ariana board is confident that 
this mine life can be substantially enhanced 
through the delineation of additional mineable 
resources in and around the Kiziltepe area, 
which, in due course, would feed into the 
main Kiziltepe plant. With this in mind, our 
specifications for the plant and Tailing Storage 
Facility surpass the current parameters  
of the project, ensuring our mining operations 
at the RRGP are sustainable in the long term.
One factor affecting the sustainability of  
our , and in fact all, gold projects is the long 
term gold price. I think I speak for most gold 
explorers, developers and producers in saying 
that 2013 was a truly dismal year for gold – 
dropping from highs almost touching US$1,900 
to recent lows of below US$1,200. There  
was a marginal recovery during the first few  
months of this year . However , the long term 
message for gold companies, and investors  
in gold equities, is that low cost producers  
can still generate healthy margins and  
hence deliver attractive returns for investors. 
I am pleased to say that with projected cash 
costs at around US$600/oz, the RRGP enjoys  
robust economic fundamentals even at low  
gold prices. The importance of this cannot be 
overstated – by keeping our gold production 
costs low, we can support a long term 
sustainable and successful gold production 
project for the benefit of all stakeholders.
Our exploration interests fall into three distinct 
segments: proximal exploration of prospects 
in the wider RRGP area; exploration and 
development in tandem with our joint venture 
partner Eldorado Gold over the 1.09 Moz Ardala 
and Salinbaş areas in north-eastern Turkey; 
and progression of targeted areas using the 
Newmont database secured in March 2013. 
These key exploration interests, together  
with Ariana’s investment in Tigris Resources, 
which focuses on the frontier gold province 
of south-eastern Turkey , provide Ariana with 
extensive blue-sky upside over the coming 
months and years. Indeed, positioning 
ourselves as a soon-to-be cash generative 
gold exploration company with an exceptional 
mineralised footprint across Turkey gives us  
a unique competitive advantage. 
Our focus on Turkey is not purely down to  
the country boasting world-class mineralised 
provinces, but also reflects on the very 
roots of Ariana. We have a strong Turkish 
identity , stemming from many of our senior 
management and board members having 
Turkish backgrounds and/or nationality ,  
which, I believe has helped the evolution  
of the Company and kept it aligned with the 
requirements and desires of all stakeholders. 
Our Managing Director , Dr . Kerim Sener is  
a Turkish national, and is a strong proponent 
of doing business in this rapidly emerging 
European economic powerhouse. Despite the 
well-documented political developments over 
the past 12 months, Turkey remains a stable 
and supportive jurisdiction for the development 
of mineral resources and we remain committed 
to investing in the country in the coming years. 
Our strong affiliations within Turkey , both on a 
regional and national scale, have been critical 
to building a sustainable project with significant 
longevity creating a long-term revenue 
generator and employer for the local region.
I would like to take this opportunity to again 
thank the Ariana team and Proccea, whose 
unwavering support for achieving our 
strategic and operational goals has driven the 
Company’s progress forward. I would also like 
to extend my thanks to the local communities in 
and around the RRGP area for their continuing 
support and guidance throughout this process, 
without whom we would not have been able  
to reach this point. Lastly , I would like to show 
my gratitude to our shareholders and reiterate 
my confidence that the next year will prove  
to be a transformational period for Ariana  
as we move into mine construction and begin 
generating revenues – a momentous occasion 
for any gold developer .

Strategic Report  Ariana’s business strategy 
focuses on developing a 
balanced portfolio with three 
key components: advancing 
the Red Rabbit Gold Project 
(“RRGP”) toward production, 
targeted exploration and 
licence acquisition and 
diversification through joint 
ventures and investments.
Ariana’s flagship Red Rabbit Gold 
Project was formed in 2009 to 
advance the opportunities identified 
by the Company in two licence 
areas in western Turkey: Kiziltepe 
and Tavşan. 
A joint venture with the Turkish 
construction firm, Proccea 
Construction Co. (“Proccea”)  
is advancing the project toward 
production. In 2013 the EIA was 
granted and the project is now 
formally in Phase 2 development 
ahead of construction.
Exploration in the Red Rabbit 
project area has revealed the 
potential for the Sındırgı Gold 
Corridor to contain at least 
one and possibly two porphyry 
mineralisation centres.
A new geological model has 
improved the exploration targeting 
in the RRGP area. This could lead 
to the identification of significant 
new resources that have the 
potential to increase mine life.
The Artvin JV with Eldorado  
Gold is focused on the Ardala  
and Salinbaş copper-gold  
systems in north-eastern Turkey.  
In 2013 Ariana announced  
the project’s maiden Inferred  
and Indicated JORC resource  
of 1.09 Moz gold.
Ariana also has a strategic 
investment in Tigris Resources 
Limited, which is focused on 
exploration for copper-gold 
resources in south-eastern Turkey.

Strategic Report  The risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are reviewed on  
a regular basis to ensure they are minimised as far as possible.
The Directors have identified the following risks in relation to the 
Group’s affairs:
Risks and 
uncertainties
Risk Description Mitigation
Exploration and  
development risk
Inherent risks associated with the failure 
to discover or develop an economically 
recoverable ore reserve, to conclude  
a definitive feasibility study , and to obtain  
the necessary consents and approvals  
for the conduct of exploration and mining. 
The Board is committed to reviewing progress relating to the 
development of its various exploration targets and assesses this 
against planned expenditure and expected outcomes. The Group 
employs highly trained geologists with extensive knowledge of the 
style of gold/silver mineralisation located in western Turkey. 
Political/ 
in-country risk
Political instabilities, which could cause  
the loss of an asset through expropriation, 
war or unrest. 
Turkey benefits from a stable political environment and has 
established fiscal and mining codes and respect for the rule of  
law. The Group enjoys a good working relationship with the relevant 
authorities in Turkey and has a permanent management team in 
the country to monitor developments.
Environmental/ 
safety risk
Major pollution arising from operations and/
or loss of life due to systems or equipment 
failure. 
The Group adopts best practice in the industry with on-site, country 
level and corporate level policies and procedures. 
Commodity risk
A potential fall in commodity prices which 
could lead to it becoming uneconomic for  
the Group to mine its assets. 
The Group’s principal interest is gold and silver and the outlook for 
gold remains broadly positive as a continuing safe haven vehicle for 
wealth protection. The Group will consider the use of appropriate 
hedging products to mitigate this risk as it approaches production. 
Financing risk
This is the risk of running out of working  
and investment capital. 
The Group relies primarily on the issue of share capital and joint 
venture agreements to finance its activities. The Group maintains 
tight financial and budgetary control to keep its operations cost 
effective. Forward planning helps ensure it is adequately funded  
to reach its objectives. 
Foreign currency  
risk
The Group’s results are sensitive to foreign 
currency movements and in particular  
with its exposure to the Turkish Lira, arising 
from the Group’s primary operations being  
in Turkey. 
The Group finances its overseas operations by transferring  
Pounds Sterling from the UK to meet local operating costs which 
are generally either denominated in Turkish Lira or US Dollars.  
The Group maintains the majority of its cash in Pounds Sterling and 
continues to monitor relevant currency movements and considers 
action where appropriate.

Strategic Report
Operations review The Company is committed to the discovery 
and development of gold and silver deposits 
in the Western Anatolian Volcanic and 
Extensional (WAVE) province in western 
Turkey. This province hosts four operating  
gold mines and remains highly prospective  
for large epithermal and porphyry deposits. 
The Company considers the exploration and 
development risk in this region to be low due 
to excellent infrastructure and established 
gold mining operations. 
Within the WAVE province, the Company  
is focused on the ‘Red Rabbit Gold Project’ 
comprising the Kiziltepe and Tavşan sectors. 
Other exploration projects held by the Company 
in western Turkey include the Ivrindi, Demirci 
and Kizilcukur project areas. The region 
surrounding these projects is named the  
WAVE project area, with our base of operations 
in Sındırgı located strategically at its core. 
In joint venture with Proccea Construction Co., 
the Company is actively developing the Red 
Rabbit Gold Project as an environmentally 
friendly small-footprint open-pit mine,  
with mining expected to be initiated at the 
Kiziltepe Sector prior to development of the 
Tavşan Sector . 
2013 operational update
During 2013, the focus was to advance  
the Red Rabbit Gold Project to Phase 2 
development and to the point of a construction 
decision. The team focused on four key areas: 
Definitive Feasibility Study
In June 2013, Ariana concluded its Definitive 
Feasibility Study (“DFS”) on Kiziltepe. The  
study confirmed that highly attractive economic 
fundamentals are achievable from the Kiziltepe 
Sector of the Red Rabbit Gold Project. The 
study showed an increase in mineable tonnage 
and as a consequence an increase in mine life 
to eight years. Pit-optimisation was carried  
out using a conservative figure of US$1,058/oz  
gold and an economic base case established  
at a gold price of US$1,304/oz and silver price 
of US$22.6/oz. The in-pit reserve now stands  
at 1,193,700 tonnes corresponding to 117,640 oz 
of gold and 1,504,710 oz of silver at an average 
grade of 3.1 g/t Au and 39.8 g/t Ag respectively.  
Key figures from the DFS base-case financial 
model are shown below and are quoted on  
a 100% project basis.
•  US$34.4m Net Present V alue (8%) (“NPV”).
•  Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) 37.8%. 
•  Payback of 2.4 y ears on US$31.1m  
initial capital.
• Projected cash costs of US$600/oz.

Environmental Impact Assessment
An Environmental Project Summary Document 
was submitted to the Ministry of Environment 
and Urban Planning (“MEUP”) for the Kiziltepe 
Sector in early February 2013. This formed 
a major part of the permitting process for 
the proposed mine and involved public and 
ministerial consultation meetings and the 
receipt by MEUP of consents from several  
other ministries and government departments. 
The public and ministerial consultation 
meetings are forums for individuals, 
organisations and government agencies  
to debate the mine development programme 
proposed by the Company. In April 2013,  
a public consultation meeting was held  
by the community in which there was no 
opposition to the proposed mine development. 
Additionally , the Provincial Directorate approved 
the Company’s proposal for the location of  
the mine and process plant.
The final EIA was completed and submitted 
in August 2013. The EIA for the Kiziltepe 
gold-silver mine was then formally approved 
by MEUP in late December 2013, providing 
the Company with the ability to advance final 
permitting for construction. Approval of the 
EIA satisfies one of the conditions for securing 
mine finance. 
Land acquisition
Many of the required permits are now in place 
for the development of the Kiziltepe mine and 
land acquisition has been underway since 2011. 
Through a 99% owned subsidiary of Ariana, 
known as Çamyol Gayrimenkul, Madencilik, 
Turizm, Tarim ve Hayvancilik Ltd (“Çamyol”), 
approximately 234,432m
2
 of land has been 
purchased, which corresponds to almost all 
of the freehold land in the planned Arzu South 
open-pit area. Any land acquired by Çamyol will 
either be sold or leased to Zenit for the duration 
of the project. Additional land will now be 
acquired in advance of mine construction either 
directly by the JV or by Çamyol, as appropriate.

Operations review Project area resource expansion
The potential to expand the project at the 
Kiziltepe Sector is significant as the current 
resource and economics are based on just 
6% of the known vein system. In parallel with 
bringing the Red Rabbit Gold Project into 
production, the Company has been focused 
on better understanding the distribution of 
mineralised structures across the project 
area, which could be shown to host open-
pittable resources in the future. Such satellite 
resources would provide additional mill-feed  
for the planned plant at Kiziltepe. Significant 
new exploration rock-chip results from the  
area around Kiziltepe include:
•  Highly silver-rich zone identified at Kepez 
Main, returning grades of up to 383 g/t Ag + 
1.5 g/t Au and 234 g/t Ag + 1.7 g/t Au.
•  Gold-rich area identified at Kepez F ar West, 
returning results including 14.5 g/t Au + 39 g/t 
Ag and 5.9 g/t Au + 24 g/t Ag.
•  Complex swarm of veins discovered at Kepez 
South, returning grades of up to 9.0 g/t Au + 
58 g/t Ag.
•  Karakavak South vein mapped and sampled, 
including grades up 20.8 g/t Au + 34 g/t Ag 
and 8.9 g/t Au.
A particular focus for Ariana has been an  
area referred to as Arzu Central, an area 
located between the planned Arzu North and 
Arzu South pits at Kiziltepe which is obscured 
by cap rocks. Exceptional drilling results 
obtained in 2012 from this area indicated 
potential for multiple parallel vein and breccia 
zones which could host additional resources. 
An Exploration Target in accordance with  
the JORC Code was established for this area  
in May 2013 and determined the potential  
for a further 92,000 oz gold and 1,100,000 oz  
silver . The Company has planned a deep 
drilling campaign to determine the long-
term underground potential of the project 
based on this Exploration Target. Future 
resource expansion will focus on identifying 
mineralisation that could be accessed by 
underground development originating from 
either the bottom of the Arzu South or the  
Arzu North pits.
The Kizilcukur Project, which is located 25km 
ENE from Kiziltepe, was granted its forestry 
permits during 2013. The Company is now 
planning for an RC drilling programme to  
test the full strike length of the mapped veins 
on this project and targeting the definition of  
a near surface resource that could in the longer 
term provide additional feed for the planned 
Kiziltepe plant. To date, 2km of mineralised 
quartz veins containing gold and silver have 
been delineated at Kizilcukur . An Inferred  
JORC resource of 16,600 oz gold equivalent  
was estimated utilising historical drilling data 
on this property in October 2013.

A revised exploration model
Ariana has developed a  
new exploration plan with 
the objective of doubling the 
potentially mineable resources  
in the Kiziltepe Sector over  
the next two years.
The new geological model aims to define 
the link between high-grade gold-silver 
zones, particular structural trends and 
clay alteration zones and a probable extinct 
volcanic centre known as a caldera.

Operations review Artvin Project
Reconnaissance exploration in eastern Turkey 
for large porphyry copper-gold and related 
deposits identified potential in north-eastern 
Turkey and resulted in the acquisition of the 
Artvin Project by the Company in 2007. 
This project, in addition to several other 
licences, is now being advanced through a  
JV agreement with Eldorado Gold Corporation 
(TSX:ELD, NYSE: EGO), which is focused 
exclusively on exploration in the Artvin Province.
2013 operational update
Ariana has long recognised the exploration 
potential of the Artvin Project in north-eastern 
Turkey. Following the 2011 and 2012 drilling 
campaigns at Salinbaş, the results showed the 
presence of a mineralised body of areal extent 
2.5km x 1km. The mineralisation remains open 
to the south and east, which indicates that there 
is considerable scope to define a substantial 
gold system at this locality. In addition to this, 
the orientation of the mineralisation and the 
continuity of high grades towards the Ardala 
porphyry at relatively shallow depth (<150m) 
suggest that the mineralised body could be 
mined by open-pit methods. 
In 2012 and 2013 the aim for both JV partners 
was to rapidly move the Artvin Project up 
the development curve. A joint review of the 
Artvin JV agreement resulted in Ariana being 
granted operational management of the project 
during 2012 until the establishment of the first 
resource estimate. 
In April 2013, the Company completed  
an independent JORC mineral resource 
estimate on the Salinbaş and Ardala properties.  
180,000 oz gold plus 820,000 oz silver in 
Indicated resources and 590,000 oz gold plus 
3.3 Moz silver in Inferred resources were 
identified at Salinbaş. Based on historic data 
an additional 323,000 oz gold Inferred resource 
was identified at Ardala. In total 1.09 Moz of 
Inferred and Indicated gold resources have 
been defined at Ardala and Salinbaş. Based  
on the JV agreement 49% of the resource is  
net attributable to Ariana.
Since the completion of the resource estimate, 
Ariana has transferred management of the  
JV back to Eldorado to enable the Company  
to focus its attention on the Red Rabbit  
Gold Project.

Strategic Report
Operations review Core to the Company’s long-term strategic 
plan is the development of its exploration 
portfolio through grassroots exploration, 
prospect definition and licence acquisition. 
The Company recognises that one of the most 
significant elements for long-term exploration 
success is to maintain the pace of exploration 
with tenacity. Many of the key projects forming 
the development pipeline for the Company 
were identified through this kind of exploration 
process over several years. 
In line with Ariana’s strategy to develop its 
pipeline of exploration properties, the Company 
secured access to a 10-year non-exclusive 
licence on the Newmont Ventures Limited 
(“Newmont”) Turkish exploration database.  
This database is valued at an estimated 
US$20m and provides Ariana with a key 
strategic exploration advantage in Turkey.  
In the first instance, the information within  
the database is being prioritised and analysed 
in line with the Company’s strategy to identify 
potential additional resources within trucking 
distance of the planned Kiziltepe operation.
Ariana was granted access to the database for 
a 1% Net Smelter Return royalty and a Right 
of First Refusal payable to Newmont on any 
discovery made by Ariana within 5km from any 
point data derived from the database, excluding 
areas covered by existing Ariana tenements. 
Information included in the database 
comprises stream-sediment, rock-chip and 
soil geochemistry , drilling results, geo-imagery , 
aeromagnetic and gravity datasets, digital 
geology and structure, mineral occurrences, 
reports of previous prospects and projects.
Regional 
exploration
Outlook 
2014 marks exactly 10 years since Ariana  
began operating in Turkey following the grant 
of its first exploration licences in January 
2004. During the past decade the Company 
has nurtured a vision to discover new gold and 
silver deposits in Turkey and to develop these 
ultimately into mining operations. In this time, 
we have raised a total of £13.9m through the 
capital markets and have gone on to identify  
1.5 Moz of gold resources, representing  
an all-in (including corporate) discovery cost  
of approximately US$22/oz. 
As a measure of exploration success, this 
marks Ariana as a highly efficient exploration 
company in comparison with many of our 
peers, for which unit discovery costs are 
running at US$40/oz or more. In 2013, during 
a year in which few exploration companies 
were able to raise capital, Ariana raised 
approximately £2.4m, which is testament to  
the quality and substantially de-risked nature 
of our projects. It is also a reflection of our 
efficiency as an exploration company and 
shows that there is still capital available to 
those who use it wisely. 
Progress on our joint ventures has been 
significant during the year . Proccea, our Red 
Rabbit JV partner , is continuing to sole fund the 
Red Rabbit Gold Project prior to construction, 
having invested US$2.9m since the start  
of the JV in 2010. Meanwhile, Eldorado Gold 
Corporation, our Artvin Project JV partner , 
continues to fund exploration across the 
Salinbaş and Ardala areas and to advance  
these projects up the development curve.  
We are pleased that the Salinbaş and Ardala 
areas have shown the potential to host over  
a million ounces and both Eldorado and  
Ariana are keen to capitalise further on this 
major discovery.
Every year brings new uncertainties and 
challenges. 2014 will not be any different.  
But in ten years, Ariana has successfully 
navigated every hurdle and marked significant 
progress at every step along the way. We will 
continue…

Operations review Financial 
review
The results for the year and the financial  
position of the Company and the Group are  
set out in annexed financial statements.
 
The Group reported a loss for the year 
amounting to £1.3m, compared to a loss of 
£1.18m in the previous year . Administrative 
expenses increased partly due to higher staff 
costs and professional fees, as well as financing 
costs and foreign exchange losses arising due  
to the declining value of the Turkish Lira. 
 
During the year the Group has also spent over 
£770,000 on deferred exploration expenditure  
as we continue to push forward with the RRGP 
and other exploration activities as set out in 
more detail in this report.
 
The loss for the year and the Company’s 
exploration expenditure has been funded largely 
through the issue of equity. During the year  
the company completed placings for £588,500  
in February and £1.25m (net of expenses) 
in June. The June placing was completed 
exclusively with US based Lanstead Capital LP, 
and involved a £1m equity swap, whereby the 
Company receives this part of the proceeds  
over a period of 24 months, the final sum  
to be received depending on our share price 
performance. Due to our declining share  
price over the period to the end of the year  
a charge totaling £139,000 has been booked  
in these accounts, adding to the reported loss  
for the year .
In January 2014, our three year term on a £5m 
Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (“SEDA”) 
secured through US based Yorkville Advisors 
LLC, expired along with a US$2m promissory 
note. During the validity period of the SEDA,  
the Company utilised approximately £1.4m  
of the SEDA and the entirety of the promissory 
note, with the majority of these funds applied to 
the RRGP during a period of agreed co-funding 
with Proccea Co. The promissory note had been 
completely repaid by the year end.
 
After the year end the Company raised £770,000 
through a private placement, the proceeds  
of which are to be used for further exploration 
programmes and for working capital purposes. 
 
As at the year end, and the date of this report, 
the Company is debt free and has 1.53m  
Turkish Lira in receivables due to be repaid from 
RRGP JV, once the project enters construction 
and production together with a further sum  
of 824,420 Turkish Lira that the Group has  
spent directly on land acquisitions, which will 
also be repaid.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year . As required by the 
AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare  
the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view  
of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent 
company financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the EU; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless  
it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company 
will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination  
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Provision of information to auditor
The Directors who were in office on the date of approval of these financial 
statements have confirmed, as far as they are aware, that there is no 
relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware. Each of the 
directors has confirmed that he has taken all the steps that he ought  
to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that it has been communicated to  
the auditor .
Corporate governance
The Board of Directors
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. The risk management process and 
systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s objectives. Any such system of 
internal control can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Full meetings are held quarterly to review Group strategy , direction 
and financial performance. The Executive Directors meet regularly to 
review operational reports from all of the Group’s areas of operations. 
The process is used to identify major business risks and evaluate their 
financial implications and ensure an appropriate control environment. 
Certain control over expenditure is delegated to on site project managers 
subject to Board control by means of monthly budgetary reports.  
Internal financial control procedures include:
•  preparation and regular review of operating budgets and forecasts;
•  prior approval of all capital expenditure;
•  review and debate of treasury policy; and
•  unrestricted access of Non-Executive Directors to all members  
of senior management.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Michael de Villiers and William  
Payne. The Audit Committee may examine any matters relating to 
the financial affairs of the Group and the Group’s audits. This includes 
reviews of the annual financial statements and announcements,  
internal control procedures, accounting procedures, accounting  
policies, the appointment, independence, objectivity , terms of reference 
and fees of external auditors and such other related functions as the 
Board may require.

Governance Remuneration Committee 
The committee comprises Michael de Villiers and William Payne.  
It determines the terms and conditions of the employment and annual 
remuneration of the Executive Directors. It consults with the Managing 
Director , takes into consideration external data and comparative  
third party remuneration and has access to professional advice outside  
the Company.
The key policy objectives of the Remuneration Committee in respect  
of the Company’s Executive Directors and other senior executives are:
•  to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their personal 
contribution to the Company’s overall performance; and
•  to act as the independent committee ensuring that due regard is given 
to the interest of the Company’s shareholders and to the financial and 
commercial health of the Company.
Remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises basic salary , 
discretionary bonuses, participation in the Company’s share option 
scheme and other benefits. The Company’s remuneration policy with 
regard to options is to maintain an amount of not more than 10% of the 
issued share capital in options for the Company’s management and 
employees which may include the issue of options in line with any new 
share issue.
Total Directors’ emoluments are disclosed in Note 3 to the financial 
statements and the Directors’ options are disclosed above.
Auditor
In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution

are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

company , or returns adequate for our audit have not been received

with the accounting records and returns; or

Financial statements 1. General information
Ariana Resources PLC (the “Company”) is a public limited company 
incorporated and domiciled in Great Britain. The Company’s shares 
are listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock 
Exchange. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries 
(the “Group”) are related to the exploration for and development of gold 
and other minerals in Turkey.
The Company’s registered office address is Bridge House,  
London Bridge, London, SE1 9QR.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling 
(£), which is the parent company’s functional and presentation currency , 
and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand except where 
otherwise indicated.
Basis of preparation
The Group consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  
as adopted by the European Union, effective for the Group’s reporting  
for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as 
required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by that Act, the 
separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS. These financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, (except for available for sale financial assets) and the 
accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group.
Going concern
These financial statements have been prepared on the going concern 
basis. As an exploration company the Directors are mindful that there 
is an ongoing need to monitor overheads and costs associated with 
delivering the exploration programme, and raise additional working 
capital on an ad hoc basis to support the Group’s activities.
In January 2011 the Group arranged a £5 million Standby Equity 
Distribution Agreement (“SEDA”) with Yorkville Advisers LLC. This entitled 
the Group to draw down funds in exchange for the issue of shares at  
a price based on the Company’s market price over the previous 10 day 
period. During the year the Company issued 46,429,980 shares under  
the SEDA for a consideration of £588,500. In addition the Company 
exclusively placed 137,500,000 shares with Lanstead Capital LP for an 
initial part consideration of £250,000. The placing involved a £1,000,000 
equity swap whereby the Company will receive the remaining proceeds  
of the placing over a 24 month period. Since the year end the Company 
has raised £770,000 by placing 85,555,556 shares.
At the year end the Group had cash and cash equivalents amounting 
to £212,000. The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the 
Group for the period to 30 June 2015 based on their assessment of the 
prospects of the Group’s operations. These cash flow forecasts include 
the normal operating costs for the Group over the period together with 
the necessary and specific expenditure to meet the minimum licence 
expenditure requirements. These forecasts indicate that the Group will 
require additional funds in the foreseeable future.
In assessing the going concern assumption for the Group, the directors 
have excluded the Red Rabbit joint venture because the joint venture 
partner is currently funding all the costs of the development through a 
mixture of its own resources and bank facilities as required to construct 
the mine once all the relevant permits have been obtained. 
Despite challenging capital markets, the Company and Group have been 
successful historically in raising equity finance and in light of this, the 
directors have a reasonable expectation of securing sufficient funding to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these 
reasons, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. 
New Accounting Standards and Interpretations 
Effective and adopted during the year
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
The Group has applied IFRS 13 for the first time in the current year . IFRS 13 
establishes a single source of guidance for fair value measurements and 
disclosures about fair value measurements. It does not affect which items 
are required to be fair valued. The scope of IFRS 13 is broad, the fair value 
measurement requirements of IFRS 13 apply to both financial instrument 
items and non-financial instrument items for which other IFRSs require 
or permit fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value 
measurements, except for share-based payment transactions that are 
within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions 
that are within the scope of IAS 17 Leases, and measurements that have 
some similarities to fair value but are not fair value.
IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the 
principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date  
under current market conditions. Fair value under IFRS 13 is an exit  
price regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated 
using another valuation technique. Also, IFRS 13 includes extensive 
disclosure requirements.
IFRS 13 requires prospective application from 1 January 2013. In addition, 
specific transitional provisions were given to entities such that they 
need to apply the disclosure requirements set out in the Standard in 
comparative information provided for periods before the initial application 
of the Standard. In accordance with these transitional provisions, the 
Group has not made any new disclosures required by IFRS 13 for the 
2012 comparative period (please see notes 14 for the 2013 disclosures). 
Other than the additional disclosures, the application of IFRS 13 has not 
had any material impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements.
Not yet effective
The following new and revised IFRSs have been issued but are not yet 
effective and have not been adopted early by the Group:
•  Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures – Offsetting financial assets and financial 
liabilities
  The Amendments to IAS 32 clarify that an entity currently has a legally 
enforceable right to set–off if that right is not contingent on a future 
event and enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the 
event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the entity and all counter 
parties. The Amendments are effective from 1 January 2014.
  A package of consolidation standards are effective for annual periods 
beginning or after 1 January 2013 (1 January 2014 for entities applying 
IFRSs adopted by the EU). Information on these new standards is 
presented below. The Directors have yet to fully assess the impact of 
these new and revised standards on the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements.
•  IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (IFRS 10)
  IFRS 10 supersedes IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2013
Ariana Resources PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2013  
Financial statements
 
32 Statements (IAS 27). It revised the definition of control together  
with accompanying guidance to identify an interest in a subsidiary. 
However , the requirements and mechanics of consolidation and the 
accounting for any non–controlling interests and changes in control 
remain the same.
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (IFRS 11)
  IFRS 11 supersedes IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures (IAS 31). It 
aligns more closely the accounting by the investors with their rights 
and obligations relating to the joint arrangement. In addition, IAS 31’s 
option of using proportionate consolidation for joint ventures has been 
eliminated. IFRS 11 now requires the use of the equity accounting 
method, which is currently used for investments in associates.
•  IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (IFRS 12)
  IFRS 12 integrates and makes consistent the disclosure requirements 
for various types of investments, including unconsolidated structured 
entities. It introduces new disclosure requirements about the risks to 
which an entity is exposed from its involvement with structured entities. 
•  Consequential amendments to IAS 27 and IAS 28 Investments  
in Associates and Joint Ventures (IAS 28)
  IAS 27 now only deals with separate financial statements.  
IAS 28 brings investments in joint ventures into its scope. However ,  
IAS 28’s equity accounting methodology remains unchanged.
• Transition guidance (Amendments to IFRS 10, 11 and 12)
  The amendments change the transition guidance to provide further 
relief from full retrospective application. The guidance covers date  
of initial application of IFRS 10, assessment of whether control 
exists at date of initial application, retrospective adjustments and 
comparative periods.
Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial  
statements of Ariana Resources PLC and its subsidiaries for the  
year ended 31 December 2013.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has power to govern  
the financial and operating policies accompanying a shareholding of 
more than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-
consolidated from the date that control ceases. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured at fair value of the assets and equity instruments acquired, 
and the liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Investments in companies where the Group has joint financial and 
operational control and that meet the conditions for proportional 
consolidation are consolidated into these accounts by taking the 
appropriate proportion of that company’s results and assets and 
liabilities into the consolidated financial statements.
Where necessary , adjustments are made to the financial statements  
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with  
those used by other members of the Group. All significant intercompany 
transactions and balance between group entities are eliminated on 
consolidation.
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to  
exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the 
investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint 
control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in 
these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except 
when classified as held for sale. Investments in associates are carried in 
the statement of financial position at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associates, less 
any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of the 
associates in excess of the Group’s interest in those associates are not 
recognised.
In the Company accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings are 
held at cost. 
Income and expense recognition
The Group’s other income otherwise represents consultancy fees and 
interest receivable from bank deposits. Interest income is accrued on  
a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective 
rate of interest applicable. The effective interest rate is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected 
life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
Operating expenses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income upon utilisation of the service or at the date of their origin and  
are reported on an accrual basis.
Foreign currency translation
• Functional and presentation currency
  Items included in the financial statements are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the Group’s 
presentation currency. 
• Transactions and balances 
  Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the comprehensive income statement.
• Group companies
  The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none  
of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that  
have a functional currency different from the presentation currency  
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 •  assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position 
presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that 
statement of financial position;
 •  income and expenses for each income statement are translated 
at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on 
the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the dates of the transaction); and
 •  all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate 
component of equity. On consolidation, exchange differences  
arising from the translation of monetary items receivable from 
foreign subsidiaries for which settlement is neither planned nor 
likely to occur in the foreseeable future are taken to shareholders’ 
equity. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as part  
of the gain or loss on sale.

Financial statements 1. General information continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property , plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their 
estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated 
useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at 
each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for 
on a prospective basis.
Land  – not depreciated
Computer equipment  – between 25% & 33%
Drilling equipment  – between 10% & 20%
Fixtures and fittings  – between 5% & 33% 
Motor vehicles  – between 20% & 25% 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of 
property , plant and equipment is determined as the difference between 
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Depreciation charged on exploration and evaluation assets is capitalised 
within intangible exploration assets. 
Intangible exploration assets
Intangible assets represent exploration and evaluation assets (IFRS 6 
assets), being the cost of acquisition by the Group of rights, licences  
and know how. Such expenditure requires the immediate write-off  
of exploration and development expenditure that the Directors do not 
consider to be supported by the existence of commercial reserves.
All costs associated with mineral exploration and investments, are 
capitalised on a project-by-project basis, pending determination of the 
feasibility of the project. Costs incurred include appropriate technical 
and administrative expenses but not general overheads and these 
assets are not amortised until technical feasibility and commercial 
viability is established. If an exploration project is successful, the related 
expenditures will be transferred to mining assets and amortised over 
the estimated life of the commercial ore reserves on a unit of production 
basis. Where a licence is relinquished or a project abandoned, the  
related costs are written off. 
The recoverability of all exploration and development costs is dependent 
upon the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, the ability of 
the Group to obtain necessary financing to complete the development 
of reserves and future profitable production or proceeds from the 
disposition thereof. 
Exploration and evaluation assets shall no longer be classified as  
such when the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting 
mineral resources are demonstrable. When relevant, such assets  
shall be assessed for impairment, and any impairment loss recognised, 
before reclassification to mine development.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts 
of its tangible and intangible assets (except for intangible exploration 
assets) to determine whether there is any indication that those assets 
have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the 
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate 
the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can 
be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-
generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group  
of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation 
basis can be identified.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet 
available for use are tested for impairment annually , and whenever there  
is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows 
have not been adjusted.
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets include non-derivative financial assets 
that are either designated as such or do not qualify for inclusion in any  
of the other categories of financial assets. Shares in unlisted companies 
are recorded at cost. Any other financial assets within this category are 
measured subsequently at fair value, with changes in value recognised  
in equity , through other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising 
from investments classified as available for sale are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income when they are sold or 
when the investment is impaired. In the case of impairment of available 
for sale assets, any loss previously recognised in equity is transferred  
to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Impairment 
losses recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income on equity instruments are not reversed through the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. Impairment losses recognised 
previously on debt securities are reversed through the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income when the increase can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Inventory
Gold recovered from trial mining and held for resale is included in  
deferred exploration expenditure at its net realisable value. The Directors  
consider this valuation to be appropriate as the expense of ascertaining 
the apportioned cost of gold extracted from the associated trial mining  
would outweigh any benefits to be obtained. Gains or losses resulting 
in changes to market price at time of disposal are taken to the 
comprehensive statement of income.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position 
comprise cash on hand and demand deposits together with other short 
term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known 
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes 
in value.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2013
continued
Ariana Resources PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2013  
Financial statements
 
34 Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to 
the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets 
of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments
For such grants of share options, the fair value as at the date of grant 
is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual 
number of share options that are likely to vest, except where forfeiture  
is only due to market-based conditions not achieving the threshold  
for vesting.
Where shares are issued in settlement of goods or services supplied, 
the relevant expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, with the related share issue recorded within 
share capital and share premium.
Shareholder warrants
The shareholder warrants entitle shareholders to a number of  
common shares based upon the number of shares they subscribed  
for at the date of issue of the warrant instrument. The warrants relate 
to a transaction with the equity holders as opposed to a transaction 
in exchange for any goods or services. The equity component of the 
instrument is not considered material and there is no liability component 
arising as a result of these warrants. Upon exercise of the warrant the 
proceeds received, net of attributable transaction costs, are credited  
to share capital and where appropriate share premium.
Taxation
Current income tax assets and liabilities comprise those obligations  
to, or claims from, fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior 
reporting year , that are unpaid at 31 December 2013. They are calculated 
according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the fiscal periods  
to which they relate, based on the taxable profit for the year .
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method  
on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the 
difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  
and their tax bases. However , deferred tax is not provided on the  
initial recognition of goodwill or on the initial recognition of an asset  
or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination  
or affects tax or accounting profit. 
Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in 
subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences  
can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not 
occur in the foreseeable future. In addition tax losses available to be 
carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are 
assessed for recognition as deferred tax assets. 
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be 
offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply 
to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted as at 31 December 2013. Changes in deferred  
tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense  
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except where 
they relate to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in  
which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited to equity. 
The deferred tax asset arising from trading losses carried forward as 
referred to in Note 9 has not been recognised. The deferred tax asset will 
be recognised when it is more likely than not that it will be recoverable.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the Board of Directors who have been 
identified as responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments.
Pensions
The Group pays contributions to the personal pension schemes of  
some employees. These contributions are charged to the statement  
of comprehensive income in the year to which they relate.
Accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and judgements regarding the future. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on  
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events  
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, 
actual experience may deviate from these estimates and assumptions. 
The estimates and judgements that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year are discussed as follows:
• Intangible exploration assets 
  The Group determines that exploration costs are capitalised at the 
point the Group has a valid exploration licence. The recovery of the  
cost of the Group’s exploration projects is reviewed in the light of  
future production estimates based upon ongoing geological studies. 
Over the longer term the actual mineable resources achieved may vary 
significantly from the current estimates. 
• Impairment of assets
  The Group assesses impairment at each reporting date by evaluating 
conditions specific to the Group that may lead to impairment of assets. 
Where an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is determined.
• Share-based payments
  In order to calculate the charge for share-based payments as  
required by IFRS 2, the Group makes estimates principally relating  
to assumptions used in its option-pricing model.

7. Loss on dilution of interest in joint venture
In July 2010 the Group entered into an agreement with Proccea 
Construction Co. (“Proccea”) such that Galata Madencilik San. ve Tic. 
Ltd. (“Galata”) would transfer its principal assets at Sındırgı and Tavşan, 
collectively known as the “Red Rabbit Project” into a new wholly owned 
subsidiary , Zenit Madencilik San. ve Tic. A.S. (“Zenit”). Proccea earn their 
50% share in Zenit by investing US$8m in the capital of Zenit, US$1.4m 
of such funds to be spent on a Feasibility Study and an Environmental 
Impact Assessment (“EIA”), with the balance on initial mine construction, 
once the Feasibility Study and EIA are completed satisfactorily. Ultimately 
profits from Zenit will be shared in the ratio of 51% the Group and 49% 
Proccea, but key decisions require approval from both the Group and 
Proccea, and consequently the Group consolidates the results of Zenit 
by way of proportional consolidation. Proccea’s stake in Zenit increased 
during the period from 13.98% to 18.32%, resulting in a corresponding 
reduction in the Group’s shareholding in Zenit. This dilution in 
shareholding has been valued at £162,000 and accordingly charged  
to the comprehensive income account.

The non-current available for sale investment represents the Group’s investment in Tigris Resources Limited (“Tigris”), an unlisted company 
registered in Jersey involved in Turkish gold exploration. The investment is held at cost as Tigris is an unlisted entity and as such the fair value of  
the shares held cannot be reliably measured. The decrease in the year is a result of the Group disposing of £2.1m shares in Tigris to raise £104,000.

* In the absence of available consolidated figures for the Greater Pontides Exploration B.V. Group, the figures for 2013 and 2012 now reflect that 
company's unaudited balance sheet only.
In July 2010 the Group entered into an agreement with Proccea Construction Co. (“Proccea”) such that Galata Madencilik San. ve Tic. Ltd. (“Galata”) 
would transfer its principal assets at Sındırgı and Tavşan, collectively known as the “Red Rabbit Gold Project” into a new wholly owned subsidiary ,  
Zenit Madencilik San. ve Tic. A.S. (“Zenit”). Proccea earn their 50% share in Zenit by investing US$8m in the capital of Zenit, US$1.4m of such funds  
to be spent on a Feasibility Study and an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”), with the balance on initial mine construction, once the Feasibility 
Study and EIA are completed satisfactorily. Proccea’s stake in Zenit increased during the year to 18.32% (2012: 13.98%) as further shares were issued 
to them in accordance with the joint venture agreement.
Ultimately profits from Zenit will be shared in the ratio of 51% the Group and 49% Proccea, but key decisions require approval from both the Group  
and Proccea, and consequently the Group consolidates the results of Zenit by way of proportional consolidation.

Other receivables falling due after more than one year represent amounts due from the government of Turkey in respect of VAT relating to the Group’s 
mining projects. These amounts are due for repayment between 2015 and 2016 and the fair value is not materially different to the carrying value 
presented.
16. Other financial asset
In May 2013 the Company raised £1.25 million following the issue of 125 million new shares at 1p per share to Lanstead Capital L.P . (“Lanstead”). 
The Company received £250,000 in cash and entered into an equity swap price mechanism with Lanstead for the balance of these shares with 
consideration payable on a monthly basis over a period of 24 months. The Company also issued 12.5 million shares to Lanstead in consideration  
for the equity swap agreement.
The consideration from Lanstead has been treated as a non-derivative financial asset and its fair value has been determined by reference to the  
Company’s share price at the balance sheet date as measured against a benchmark price of 1.33 pence per share. If the actual share price exceeds 
the benchmark price during any of the 24 settlement months, the Company will receive more than 100% of the monthly settlement due. Should  
the share price fall below the benchmark price, the Company will receive less than 100% of the expected monthly settlement on a pro rata basis.

44 26. Capital management policies and procedures
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
• To ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern;
• To increase the value of the assets of the business; 
•  To provide an adequate return to shareholders in the future when exploration assets are taken into production; and
•  To secure sufficient funding to bring the Red Rabbit Project into production.
These objectives will be achieved by identifying the right exploration projects, adding value to these projects (principally Red Rabbit) and ultimately 
taking them through to production and cash flow, either with partners or by our own means.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity , cash and cash equivalents as presented on the face of the consolidated 
statement of financial position. Movements in capital for the reporting period under review are summarised in Note 19 and in the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity.
The Group manages its capital structure in response to changes in economic conditions and in accordance with the Group’s objective to bring the  
Red Rabbit Project into production.
27. Financial instruments
In the normal course of its operations, the Group and Company are exposed to gold prices, currency , interest rate, and liquidity risk. 
The Group and Company use financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprising, short term deposits, cash, liquid resources and various  
items such as sundry debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance 
for the Group’s operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s and Company’s financial instruments are liquidity and currency differences on foreign currency net 
investments. The Directors review and agree policies for managing these risks and these are summarised below.
Market operational risk
The nature of the Group’s and Company’s investments requires the commitment of significant funding to finance its mining projects. It is the nature 
of mining operations that each project is long term before exploration proves to be viable and progresses to reach commercial production. To control 
these risks the Board arranges for the provision of technical support, commissions technical research and feasibility studies both prior to entering 
into these commitments and subsequently over the life of these projects.
Liquidity risk 
The Group and Company seek to manage financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets 
safely and profitably. The Board will seek additional funds from the issue of share capital and warrants where appropriate, by reviewing financial  
and operational budgets and forecasts. The Group and Company’s financial liabilities, including interest bearing liabilities, trade and other payables  
all of which will be settled within six months.
Credit risk and Treasury management 
The Company has borrowings outstanding from its subsidiaries, the ultimate realisation of which depends on the successful exploration and realisation 
of the Group’s intangible exploration assets. This in turn is subject to the availability of financing to maintain the ongoing operations of the business. 
The Group manages its financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign exchange risk arises due to the Group’s and Company’s primary operations being in Turkey. The Group and Company have a general policy 
of not hedging against its exposure of foreign investments in foreign currencies. The Group and Company are exposed to translation and transaction 
foreign exchange risks and take profits or losses on these as they arise.
Borrowing facilities and interest rate risk 
The Group and Company finances its operations primarily through the issue of equity share capital and debt in order to ensure sufficient cash 
resources are maintained to meet short-term liabilities and future project development requirements. Additional cash was received during the year 
as a result of further capital raising activities. Cash assets returned on average an interest rate of 0.5% during the year . Cash deposits are kept under 
regular review, with reference to future expenditure requirements, and to maximise interest receivable.
Interest rate sensitivity
(a) The Group and Company have limited exposure to changes to Interest rates both locally and in Turkey since the interest accruing on bank  
deposits was relatively immaterial.
(b) The Group and Company have no interest rate exposure on the loan finance provided during the year as the amounts owed by Group  
undertakings are interest free.

Fair values of financial instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between  
willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Where applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values 
is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.
Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all the Group’s financial instruments:
Carrying amount Fair values

Trade and other receivables (non-current) 91 75 91 75
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
Interest bearing borrowings – (238) – (238)
Trade and other payables (890) (506) (890) (506)
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest  
at the reporting date. For receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year , the notional amount is deemed to reflect fair value.  
All other receivable and payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Level 2 fair value measurements have been determined by reference to observable data in quoted markets at the balance sheet dates.
All payables for the Company and the Group are considered repayable on demand.
Differences arising between the carrying and fair value are considered not significant to adjust for in these accounts.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
We now have a clear strategy in place
that should enable Invensys to become
a high performing, sustainable and
cohesive business.
I am very pleased to report that Invensys has made further
significant progress during the past year in continuing the
turnaround in its performance. For the Group as a whole, we
increased orders, revenue, operating profit and in particular
operating cash flow which, together with the 2006 Refinancing,
resulted in a significant reduction in the level of net debt at
the year end. Our net debt is now £166 million compared with
£1,556 million around the time I joined the Board in 2003. In
the same period, our pension fund deficit has reduced from
£931 million to £522 million and our other legacy liabilities
have fallen from £700 million to £95 million.
On behalf of the Board and everyone within Invensys, I would
like to thank our shareholders, bankers and advisors for their
tremendous support for the 2006 Refinancing, details of which
I explained to you in my Statement in last year’s Annual report.
It was completed successfully and we are now benefiting from
the expected significant reduction in finance costs and the greater
confidence being shown by all our stakeholders in the future stability
of the Group. We also anticipated that the 2006 Refinancing would
provide us with an improved platform for growth and our Chief
Executive, Ulf Henriksson, explains in his Statement the progress
that we have already made and his plans to ensure that each of
our businesses continue to improve their performance.
After the difficulties that we have experienced in recent years, it is
encouraging to see that we now have a clear strategy in place that
should enable Invensys to become a high performing, sustainable
and cohesive business. The Board has taken a great interest in the
development of the strategic plans by the executive teams for each
of the businesses and the Group as a whole and we believe that we
now have the right strategy and the right leadership team to take
Invensys to the next stage. The Board is also pleased to see the
progress that we have made in addressing ethical, social and
environmental issues so that we act as a good corporate citizen
across the world.
Summary of results
The continuing turnaround of the Group is clearly shown in
our results. During the year ended 31 March 2007, orders from
continuing operations were up 5% at constant exchange rates (CER)
to £2,694 million and revenue from continuing operations was up

Martin has been Chairman
since July 2003. Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 13

7% at CER to £2,562 million. Operating profit before exceptional
items was up 30% at CER to £241 million, resulting in an operating
margin of 9.4% (2006: 7.8%).
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations were
10.1 pence per share (2006: 6.2 pence loss per share). The Board
is recommending that no dividend be paid for the year ended
31 March 2007 (2006: nil).
For the second year in succession, we produced a strong cash
performance with operating cash flow from continuing operations
of £266 million (2006: £209 million), representing cash conversion
of 110% (2006: 109%). For the first time in three years, free cash
flow was positive at £93 million (2006: £75 million outflow), which
together with the 2006 Refinancing, resulted in a very substantial
reduction in year end net debt to £166 million (2006: £757 million).
I believe that the combination of Ulf’s leadership and the hard work
by everyone across the Group has been the major factor in achieving
this improvement in performance and I would like to thank everyone
in Invensys for their contribution to a very successful year.
The Board
Pasquale (Pat) Zito joined the Board as a non-executive director on
23 May 2007. Pat is President of the worldwide automotive original
equipment and aftermarket operations of Pilkington Group Ltd, one
of the world’s largest manufacturers of glass and glazing products for
the building and automotive markets and now part of Nippon Sheet
Glass Company. He joined Pilkington in 1985 as finance director of
the Group’s Australian operations. He became President, Automotive
OE Europe in 1997 and was appointed to the Board of Pilkington plc
in 2002. He will be joining the Remuneration and Audit Committees.
As mentioned in my Statement last year, Adrian Hennah resigned
on 16 June 2006 and Steve Hare joined the Board as Chief Financial
Officer on 21 July 2006. Also Michael Parker joined the Board on
24 May 2006 and Larry Farmer and Andrew Macfarlane retired
from the Board on 3 August 2006.
Outlook
During the new financial year, we expect that market conditions
in our long cycle businesses will remain generally positive but that
the markets for Controls will continue to be uncertain for some
time. Our actions to improve productivity will allow increased
funding for research and development and sales and marketing.
Overall the Board is confident that the Group will make further
progress in the year ending 31 March 2008.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
The successful completion of the
2006 Refinancing has significantly
strengthened our financial position
and increased our freedom to resolve
our operational issues.
In my second report to you as Chief Executive of Invensys, I am
pleased to report that the turnaround at Invensys is continuing and
that we are making good progress in transforming Invensys into a
high performing, sustainable and cohesive business. The successful
completion of the 2006 Refinancing has significantly strengthened
our financial position and increased our freedom to resolve our
operational issues.
Looking across our businesses
Process Systems
The very good results from Process Systems reflect the continuing
high levels of spend within our core global markets of oil and gas,
petrochemicals and power generation. The improved technical
offering, strengthened in the year by the launch of the groundbreaking
InFusion™ enterprise control system, and our large installed base has
enabled us to again become a leading player in the process
automation market.
Eurotherm
The restructuring at Eurotherm is aimed at capturing the growth
in Eastern Europe and Asia, targeting four vertical markets with
engineered solutions and at reducing our cost base by outsourcing
component manufacture and relocating assembly to Poland and
China. Although the pace of this restructuring has been slower than
anticipated, it is not expected to materially affect the final outcome
of the programme.
APV
The much improved performance by APV during the year
demonstrates the tremendous efforts of its new management team
in creating a turnaround. We have improved the profitability of
our project business by improving execution and rejecting contracts
which are low margin or have high execution risk. At the same time
we have been addressing our large installed base and have increased
revenue significantly from products, spares and services sales.
This rebalancing of the business has created a much more stable
platform going forward.
Rail Group
Rail Group continues to perform well in its core markets in the UK,
Iberia and the US where significant, stable infrastructure spending
provides a solid earnings base. We have also been successful in

of our journey.
gaining business in export markets, particularly in Asia Pacific. Going
forward, our priority is to expand our geographical footprint and we
are currently investing in the exploration of opportunities in several
new jurisdictions including Latin America, North Africa, the new
member states of the European Union, India and other regions
of Asia Pacific.
Controls
Controls has made good progress in addressing the many market
and operational issues that have affected its performance in recent
years. We have improved the quality of our management information
which has enabled us to better assess the performance of each
product group and to facilitate the identification of remedial actions.
Controls has improved product quality and on-time delivery to
levels that have enabled us to have a normal conversation with our
customers. We have exited some product lines that have become
commoditised but we have gained in areas where we can show that
our engineering skills benefit the customer. For example, we have
been able to implement pricing actions that are now recouping
some of the margin lost through the significant raw material price
increases over the last three years.
Strategy for the future
Our priorities during the past three years have been about stopping
our decline and starting to build a foundation for growth. Our
primary focus has been upon the operational and cash performance
of our businesses and improving our capital structure and therefore
reducing the limitations the old structure placed upon our actions
and value. These results demonstrate the progress that we have
made and the Board believes that we are now at a stage where
we can begin to take Invensys on to the next phase of our journey.
This phase of our journey towards becoming a high performing,
sustainable and cohesive business consists of four separate strategic
initiatives:
• increasing our investments in each of our businesses to deliver
more value-added innovative engineering solutions and services
with the objective of giving our customers greater efficiency and
success;
• leveraging our capabilities for greater value. Where natural and
appropriate, we will share technology and market capabilities
across businesses;
• creating greater efficiency within our support functions under
leadership and guidance from the corporate centre. Our first
project is within our finance function through co-sourcing with
a third party provider; and
• improving our capital structure, with the objective of removing
our remaining limitations so that we can improve our ability to
achieve our growth potential.
Corporate social responsibility (CSR)
As a member of the FTSE4Good Index, we remain committed to
ensuring that our people act in an ethical and proper manner, that
we safeguard the welfare of our employees, customers, suppliers and
others by having an effective health and safety culture, that we make
a positive contribution to the communities in which we operate and
that we reduce to a minimum the environmental consequences of
our activities. In each of these areas, we have made good progress
during the year and the CSR report contained in this document
provides both qualitative and, particularly in the case of health,
safety and the environment, detailed quantitative descriptions of
our achievements.
Employees
In an engineering Group like Invensys, the most important asset that
we have is our people. During the past year, I have been struck by
the immense enthusiasm and commitment shown by everyone
to the recent achievements of Invensys and the opportunities for
personal progression available within the Group. Our improved
performance is allowing us to increase our investment in people,
particularly in learning and development, to ensure that we support
them to achieve their own aspirations as well as enabling them to
increase their own contributions to the Group’s success.

Orders
Orders received in the year ended 31 March 2007 for continuing
operations of £2,694 million increased by 5% at CER compared to
last year (2006: £2,637 million). Increases in order intake at CER were
seen at Process Systems, APV and at Rail Group but reductions were
reported at Eurotherm and Controls due mainly to a contract loss
in Controls and the effect of the disposal of businesses in prior years.
A summary of orders by business group and movements at CER is set
out below:
The order book for continuing operations was £2,052 million
at 31 March 2007, an increase of 3% over the order book at
31 March 2006 of £1,995 million. The increase in order book
was largely attributable to Process Systems and Rail Group.

Revenue
Revenue was £2,562 million in the year ended 31 March 2007,
an increase of 4% over the previous year (2006: £2,457 million).
The Group has operations around the world and as a result has a
significant exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates and in
particular to the US dollar and euro. The US dollar weakened by 6%
from an average rate of $1.79 to an average rate of $1.89 against
sterling over the same period.
The translation effect of foreign exchange rates during the year was
a decrease in revenue of £65 million or 3%.
Revenue at CER increased by £170 million or 7% in the year ended
31 March 2007 compared to the prior year. The increase in revenue
was attributable to Process Systems, APV and Rail Group, partially
offset by decreases at Eurotherm and Controls. A summary of

FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Operating profit and margin
Operating profit before exceptional items was £241 million in the
year ended 31 March 2007 (2006: £191 million), which represents
an increase of 30% at CER. Operating margin increased to 9.4%
(2006: 7.8%). The main increases in operating profit and margin were
in Process Systems, APV and Rail Group reflecting the improvement
in order intake and revenue in their businesses. The translation
effect of foreign exchange rates during the year was a decrease
in operating profit before exceptional items of £5 million or 3%.

Exceptional items
Exceptional items for continuing operations in the year ended
31 March 2007 totalled £34 million (2006: £60 million). This
included restructuring costs of £23 million or 0.9% of revenue
(2006: £41 million or 1.7% of revenue), which principally relate
to employee severance expenses and surplus property costs.
Property, plant and equipment impairment of £2 million arose
from restructuring activity at Controls (2006: £14 million).
Other exceptional items of £14 million (2006: £8 million credit)
arose from the charge of £20 million (2006: £nil) relating to the
augmentation of members’ benefits in the Australian Superannuation
Fund based on latest actuarial estimates. This was a condition to
secure a cash repatriation to Invensys of £18 million from this fund.
This was offset by a £5 million credit (2006: £nil) relating to the
release of product recall provisions in Controls following successful
management of the recalls and £1 million (2006: £12 million credit)
of other pension credits. The prior year also included a £4 million
charge for the write down to fair value less costs of a small business
held for sale.
In addition, a £5 million gain on the sale of assets and operations
was made in the year ended 31 March 2007 (2006: £13 million loss).
A full analysis of exceptional items is given in Note 3 to the Group
financial statements.
Foreign exchange gains and losses
Foreign exchange gains in the year ended 31 March 2007 of
£35 million (2006: £33 million losses) relate to exchange differences
arising on the translation of unhedged foreign currency monetary
items used in the financing of the Group and its subsidiaries. These
are principally attributable to exchange differences on the Group’s
non-sterling denominated currency borrowings held in companies
whose functional currency is sterling. Of the exchange gains,
£24 million arose on net external US dollar borrowings, £10 million
on net external euro borrowings and £1 million on other currencies.
The Group’s hedging policy is determined by reference to the
currency of the underlying cash generation, ensuring, as far as
possible, an economic hedge. This results in an unhedged position
under IAS 21.
Exceptional finance costs
Exceptional finance costs were £67 million (2006: £nil), of which
£55 million arose on the 2006 Refinancing and £12 million on the
partial redemption of the principal amount of $180 million of High
Yield Notes during the year.
Net finance costs and cover
Net finance costs reduced to £66 million in the year (2006:
£119 million) reflecting the benefits of the 2006 Refinancing. The
reduction in net finance costs together with improved operating
profit led to an increase in net finance cost cover from 1.6 times
to 3.7 times.
Taxation
The tax charge for continuing operations for the year ended 31 March
2007 was £23 million (2006: £12 million) which comprises a current
year income tax charge of £31 million (2006: £24 million), offset by
a deferred tax credit of £10 million (2006: £1 million), including a
£9 million credit from the recognition of US tax losses, and a prior
year net tax charge of £2 million (2006: £11 million credit).
Profit from discontinued operations
Discontinued operations comprised Invensys Building Systems in the
US and Asia Pacific (IBS). The sale of IBS was completed on 28 July
2006 for an aggregate gross cash consideration of £159 million.
The gain of £133 million from discontinued operations in the year
ended 31 March 2007 comprised £4 million operating profit and
£120 million profit on the disposal of IBS. In addition, there was a tax
credit of £9 million following the resolution of certain taxation issues
in Brazil and the US.
Net profit for the year
The net profit for the year ended 31 March 2007 was £209 million
(2006: £22 million). Key influences were increased operating profit,
lower exceptional items, foreign exchange gains and profit from
discontinued operations.
Business review 20 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007
FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Basic earnings/(loss) per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations in the year
ended 31 March 2007 was 10.1p (2006: 6.2p loss per share),
calculated using the weighted average number of shares in issue
during the year of 733 million shares (2006: 609 million shares) and
the profit after taxation and minority interests for continuing
operations of £74 million (2006: £38 million loss).
Cash flow
The year ended 31 March 2007 produced an operating cash flow
from continuing operations of £266 million (2006: £209 million).
The improvement in operating cash flow was driven by higher
operating profit and reduced restructuring spend. This resulted
in an operating cash conversion for the year of 110% (2006: 109%),
largely due to strong receipts from long-term contracts.
Free cash flow for the year was £93 million (2006: £75 million
outflow). The improvement was mainly due to higher operating
profit and lower legacy payments.
Financial position at year end
Capital structure
The Group’s capital structure is as follows:
Total equity – deficit
The Company had an issued share capital of approximately
796 million ordinary shares of 10p as at 31 March 2007.
As at 31 March 2007, Invensys had a significant deficit on
distributable reserves and is subject to restrictions on payment of
dividends under the terms of the High Yield Bonds. Accordingly,
Invensys is currently unable to pay dividends.
Minority interests
The minority interests balance is £60 million (2006: £66 million).
The majority of the balance relates to the interests of the minority
in Baan Company NV.
Net debt
Net debt decreased from £757 million to £166 million during the
year ended 31 March 2007, a £734 million reduction in gross debt
offset by a £143 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents.
The principal components of the reduction in gross debt were
repayments of the High Yield £365 million, 2nd Lien £277 million,
Term Loan B £113 million and 144A £110 million; offset by a new
term loan of £147 million. The reductions were made from the
proceeds of the 2006 Rights issue and from the sale of the IBS
business in July 2006.
The Group’s current capital structure reflects the refinancing
exercises undertaken in 2006 and 2004. The facilities provide
liquidity for the Group until March 2011 and support the objectives
of the Group. Investigations are continually undertaken to review
alternative financing arrangements. In making those considerations
the Board takes into account the cost of any refinancing compared
to the benefits, which include both the possibility of cheaper finance
as well as longer repayment schedules.
Treasury policy
The objective of the Group’s treasury policy is to ensure that:
• adequate financial resources are available for the development of
the Group’s businesses, ensuring also long-term security in support
of the Group’s products for the benefit of customers. This includes
the provision of funding for capital expenditure, working capital
and the bonding requirements of the Group’s contract businesses;

• financial risk of currency, interest rate and counterparty exposure
is minimised as far as possible, as set out in the following sections,
and no speculative transactions are undertaken.
Group treasury policy is to centralise its operations as far as possible.
Group Treasury manages the following:
• cash management and funding of all worldwide operations,
where possible, through automated cash management procedures;
• foreign exchange risk protection products;
• inter company settlement mechanism; and
• bonding instrument issuance.
The Group’s policy in respect of the major areas of treasury
management is set out below.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to set the proportion of fixed and floating
rate debt taking into account several factors including:
• the profitability of the Group in relation to the business cycle
and the consequent level of interest rates in relation to that
business cycle;
• the absolute levels of interest rates; and
• the financial leverage of the Group.
To implement this policy the Group uses fixed-rate borrowings,
interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and currency swaps
to manage its interest rate exposure.
As at 31 March 2007, £431 million of borrowings (including interest
rate swaps) were in fixed-rate form, representing 260% of net debt
and 89% of gross debt (2006: £911 million, representing 120% of net
debt and 75% of gross debt).
Currency risk
Translation exposure
In common with other companies operating with many international
subsidiaries, a currency risk arises on the translation of the results
of foreign subsidiaries into sterling. This risk is not hedged but, as
discussed below, future currency cash flows are considered in
determining the mix of net debt.
Similarly, a currency risk arises on the translation of the balance
sheets of foreign subsidiaries into sterling and the translation of
non-sterling borrowings in those Group companies with a sterling
functional currency, including the Company.
Gains and losses resulting from the translation of the net assets of
foreign subsidiaries into sterling are recorded in reserves. Gains and
losses resulting from the translation of non-sterling denominated
monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the net investment
in foreign operations are recorded in reserves.
Other gains and losses, including the translation of non-sterling
borrowings in those Group companies with a sterling functional
currency, are recorded in the income statement.
The Group targets a level of net debt by currency according to the
level of cash generation by currency and with reference to gross
debt, pension liabilities and finance costs. The use of a range of
measures helps to minimise the risk of breach of any financial
covenant by reason of the movement in interest rates or exchange
rates alone.
The Group adjusts the level of currency liabilities by using forward
foreign exchange contracts.
Transaction exposure
Currency transaction exposure arises where actual revenues and
purchases are made by the Group’s businesses in a currency other
than their own functional currency. The incidence of this risk varies
across the different businesses of the Group although the majority
of revenues and purchases will usually be in local markets and
in functional currency. Where this is not the case, the Group’s
businesses are required to hedge their known exposures. The Group
is also subject to risk in bids where an exchange rate assumed in
making such a bid to a customer can lead to a change in margin
should a bid be successful and lead to a contract. This risk is hedged
if significant. The Group predominantly uses forward currency
contracts to manage transaction exposure.
Business review 22 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007
FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Counterparty risk
The Group monitors the identity of the counterparties with
whom it deposits cash and transacts other financial instruments
so as to control exposure to any territory or institution. In many
countries funds are deposited with only the highest rated
local counterparties.
Deposits
Surplus funds are placed for short periods with highly-rated
institutions in money market deposits.
Derivatives
Derivatives are used only to manage the risks described above and
never for speculative purposes. Further detail is provided in Note 22
to the Group financial statements.
Security
The current Senior Credit Facilities enjoy security over real estate,
plant and machinery, working capital, cash and share certificates
of subsidiaries.
Sources of funding
Sources of funding are diversified as far as possible and the 2006
Refinancing accessed several different markets.
Length of funding
To the extent that there is real choice available in terms of maturity
of debt, as a general rule longer maturities are preferred to shorter
maturities provided this does not result in an excessive cost
premium. Non-call periods are minimised as far as possible so
that the Group has flexibility to refinance its debt at any time.
Capital employed
Capital employed reduced by £138 million in the year from
£164 million as at 31 March 2006 to £26 million at 31 March 2007.
This was attributable mainly to a reduction in property, plant and
equipment of £34 million, working capital of £68 million and an
increase in the pension liability of £33 million.
Pension liabilities
Actuarial assessments of pension assets and liabilities have been
updated as at 31 March 2007, resulting in an overall pension liability
at the year end of £522 million (2006: £489 million), an increase
of £33 million since 31 March 2006. The increase is due mainly
to a reduction of £38 million in the surplus of the Australian
Superannuation Fund following an augmentation of members’
benefits and the associated repatriation of cash to Invensys. There
was an actuarial loss of £56 million during the year (2006: loss of
£88 million) and contributions to defined benefits schemes totalled
£61 million, including a £19 million payment related to the proceeds
from the disposal of businesses in the year and a £20 million agreed
funding deficit payment for the UK plan. In addition, there were
£8 million of payments to defined contribution schemes in the year
ended 31 March 2007.
Summary and conclusions
In my first report it is pleasing to report a set of results that
show good progress compared to the prior year especially in
terms of operating profit and margin, earnings per share and
cash performance. However, there is still much to be done and
my priorities for the coming financial year will be to continue
to focus on cash generation, in particular in terms of improved
working capital management, and margin development with
an emphasis on increasing productivity within the businesses.

Markets
Global demand within Process Systems’ core industries has increased
thus driving the necessity for growth in capacity through the creation
of new greenfield sites and through efficiency improvements at
existing sites.
Its upstream and downstream oil and gas and petrochemicals
markets continue to see good growth due to increased capital
spend supported by crude oil and natural gas prices remaining
at high levels as well as the increasing demand for energy sources
globally. The utilities and power generation markets are also growing
due to the expansion of capacity, particularly in Asia Pacific, as well as
continued increasing demand in North America and Western Europe.
Finally, its specialty chemicals and life sciences markets continue to
see production increases driven largely by growth in demand in
Asia Pacific.

Business review
Global demand within Process Systems’ core industries has
increased thus driving the necessity for growth in capacity
through the creation of new greenfield sites and through
efficiency improvements at existing sites.
2006 and Plant Engineering recognising it as one of the Products
of the Year.
The development of new product enhancements and the positioning
of the Process Systems’ offering (expanded to promote services and
solutions to the installed base) have been successfully progressed
across all parts of the business. At the December 2006 North
American customer conference attended by nearly 600 customer
participants, product enhancements were launched to the Triconex
safety system and the Avantis asset management system. For the
eleventh consecutive year, the readers of CONTROL magazine have
again rated Triconex as the top manufacturer of Safety/Emergency
Shutdown Systems for the process control and automation industry.
In addition the latest wireless technology is attracting interest as it is
beginning to overcome the reluctance of some customers who have
previously cited security issues as a major barrier to adoption.
On 3 May 2007, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement
to acquire Cimnet, Inc., a Manufacturing Execution System (MES)
software company based in Pennsylvania, US. Invensys has agreed
to pay approximately US$24 million on a debt/cash free basis.
The agreement has been approved by the Board of Cimnet and
completion is expected to take place by the end of July 2007.
Completion is subject to certain customary conditions including
Cimnet stockholder approval; stockholders representing
approximately 51% of Cimnet’s outstanding shares have entered
into voting agreements to support its acquisition by Invensys.
Performance
Process Systems delivered a good performance with orders for the
year rising 9% at CER to £845 million (2006: £798 million). Asia Pacific
witnessed particularly strong growth where orders rose by 23% at
CER compared to last year, helped by the contract from Reliance for
automation and safety systems to be installed into what will be the
world’s largest refinery in Jamnagar, India; this refinery will also have
one of the world’s largest Foundation Fieldbus installations. Orders in
EMEA were up 5% at CER with some significant orders in the oil and
gas sector in the Middle East. Orders in South America were up 17%
at CER including significant projects from PDVSA in Venezuela. In
North America, orders were up only 6% at CER with some recovery
in the second half of the year; year on year growth can be attributed
to large project bookings, particularly with two significant Triconex
projects and several large InFusion projects. Orders from the seven
global key accounts were up only 4% versus the prior year mainly
due to the timing of several large project bookings.
Revenue for the year increased by 11% at CER to £779 million (2006:
£725 million). This growth was principally driven by Asia Pacific, up
35% at CER, and EMEA, up 4% at CER. The significant growth in Asia
Pacific can be attributed to continued growth in China, the execution
of several major project bookings in ASEAN and South Korea and the
Reliance refinery project. Similarly the EMEA strength was due to a
stronger backlog conversion from several large project bookings
across the region, particularly in France, Italy and Germany.
Operating profit rose 33% at CER to £104 million (2006: £81 million)
due to the higher revenue, improved sales mix and a particularly
good margin performance in Asia Pacific and EMEA. Operating
margin improved to 13.4% (2006: 11.2%). Operating cash flow
was £94 million (2006: £79 million) with the effect of the higher
operating profit being offset slightly by working capital
requirements on the higher volume.
Outlook
In Process Systems, we do not anticipate any major changes in
demand in its global markets in the coming year. The continued
increase in global demand for oil and gas should ensure that this
market continues to grow despite commodity price increases and
engineering resource constraints. Its other markets should remain
buoyant, especially in the core industries of petrochemicals, power,
pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals. The growth in the emerging
markets of Asia Pacific, especially China and India, the Middle East
and Eastern Europe will continue to be driven by major new
construction.
The services side of the automation market remains good and
is a great area of opportunity. Despite the strong market, many
customers are still looking for improvements in operational
efficiency and competitiveness. In addition, the InFusion enterprise
control system is gaining market momentum and is being recognised
as an innovative product by the market and industry analysts. 26 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007
Eurotherm’s commitment is to provide market leading control and
automation solutions, and to help customers meet the demands
of the statutory regulations and validation requirements for their
industry. The Eurotherm offering includes consultancy in the initial
project planning phase, solution and system design, project
management, installation, onsite services and operator training.
These services are supported by market leading products ranging
from sensors and measurement indicators, through process and
power controllers to graphical paperless data recorders and
integrated process automation equipment. Eurotherm has global
expertise in many industrial markets with dedicated specialists in
some key areas including life sciences, glass manufacturing, heat
treatment of metals (for industries such as aerospace and
automotive), metals and plastics.
Markets
In our traditional markets in Western Europe and North America,
the general trend whereby customers are transferring their
industrial manufacturing capacity to low-cost countries is inhibiting
Eurotherm’s growth in those regions. In North America, strength
in the semiconductor equipment and extrusion machinery markets
was offset by weak markets in plastics and durable goods. In
Western Europe, life sciences is seeing good growth but other
markets, particularly heat treatment and glass, remain challenging. In
contrast, market growth in Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific continues
on a strong upward trend, especially in China where the rate of GDP
growth continues to exceed expectations.
Developments
During the year Eurotherm has continued to implement a major
restructuring programme to enable us to capture the expected
growth in certain industries and regional markets and to address
issues within our manufacturing cost base.
In addressing key industrial markets, Eurotherm has set in place
dedicated global vertical sales and marketing teams, notably
within heat treatment and life sciences. Our product and solutions
offerings have been enhanced by the introduction of new industrial
controllers, graphic recorders and system components to support
the offering.

Reducing our manufacturing cost base has involved migrating
manufacturing and assembly from Western Europe to new
facilities in Poland and Shanghai, China. Also we continue the
process of transferring much of our component manufacturing
into our supply chain. The pace of this restructuring has been
slower than anticipated but is not expected to materially affect
the final outcome of the programme.
Performance
The delays in implementing our restructuring programme have
had a relatively minor impact on the performance of the business
during the year. Although orders for the year were reduced by 5% at
CER to £111 million (2006: £119 million), £10 million of this decline
was attributable to the motor drives distribution agreement which
ceased in November 2005. The remaining Eurotherm underlying
business has seen a £2 million increase in orders over the period
caused in part by increased systems business. Revenue of £109 million
(2006: £118 million) was 5% lower at CER, principally due to the
£10 million reduction in motor drives revenue. Operating profit fell to
£13 million (2006: £16 million), a decrease of 16% at CER. The fall of
£3 million arose mainly due to the lost contribution from the reduced
motor drives revenue. Operating margin fell to 11.9% (2006: 13.6%)
the fall in margin again reflects the lost contribution from the motor
drives business. Operating cash flow fell to £12 million, compared
to £15 million in 2006.
Outlook
The benefits from the actions being taken by the management team
to restructure the business should gradually become evident during
the current financial year. The dedicated sales approach should enable
Eurotherm to capture more business within our traditional markets
and the new presence within Poland and China should help us to
participate in the regional growth.
Business review
During the year Eurotherm has continued to implement a
major restructuring programme to enable us to capture the
expected growth in certain industries and regional markets
and to address issues within our manufacturing cost base. Our manufacturing facility at Kolding
produces hygienic pumps and heat
exchangers which are used in a
variety of industries from heavy
offshore to complex pharmaceutical.
Both products are supplied to
Danone, who use a broad spectrum
of our quality components
to improve the manufacturing
processes in their global facilities.
We also provide support and
services to their operations on
a worldwide basis.

Business review
APV is a global supplier of process engineering and automation
solutions to the dairy, food, beverage, pharmaceutical and healthcare
industries. From the supply of engineered components through to a
complete process plant equipped with latest automation technology,
it specialises in helping its customers to improve their plants’
performance and profitability which is maintained throughout the
life time of the plant by a range of support services, carefully tailored
to its customers’ needs.
Markets
APV’s markets for Products, Spares and Services (PSS) and projects
have remained robust during the year with strong demand arising
from its focus upon a large installed base and the levels of capital
expenditure especially within the global food and beverage,
pharmaceutical and chemicals industries. The significant increase
in demand for large industrial plate heat exchangers continues
to offer good opportunities across several market sectors such
as power generation and desalination, although APV’s ability to
capture this growth is being hampered by a shortage of titanium
supply. From a geographic perspective the market is evenly divided
between Europe, North America and Asia Pacific and in line with
GDP growth expectations the Asia Pacific region is expected to
exhibit the highest growth.
Developments
APV has been undertaking a variety of restructuring measures during
the year to alter the mix of its business in order to achieve a more
stable and profitable financial performance. The profitability of
its project business has been improved by better execution and
rejecting contracts which are low margin or have high execution risk.
At the same time it has been addressing its large installed base and
has increased PSS revenue significantly. This rebalancing of the
business has created a much more stable platform going forward.
However APV’s product sales have been constrained during the
year by the pricing and shortage of certain raw materials, especially
stainless steel and titanium. In particular, despite some success in
securing additional supplies of titanium, this shortage has prevented
it from accepting some orders for large industrial plate heat
exchangers thereby suppressing order growth. Further investment
has been made in a new plate component which is expected to

open up a new sector of the industrial market as well as providing
more efficient usage of titanium.
An additional production facility was opened in Poland during
the year in order to expand capacity to meet the increased
demand for products and spares.
Performance
APV’s restructuring over the past couple of years is beginning
to yield results with a considerable improvement in overall
performance. Orders for the year rose 10% at CER to £448 million
(2006: £419 million), the increase being driven by large project
wins in North America, Belgium, Denmark and the UK and a large
service contract in New Zealand. The PSS intake has been impacted
by the ongoing shortage in global supply of titanium, resulting in a
significant reduction in large industrial plate heat exchanger orders.
Good growth in PSS revenue and strong project trading in North
America, Europe, China and Japan led to an increase in revenue of
11% at CER to £421 million (2006: £388 million). Operating profit
rose substantially from break even in the prior year to £16 million
in 2007 due to the growth in higher margin PSS business and an
improvement in executed project margins. As a result, operating
margin improved to 3.8% from break even in the prior year.
The operating cash flow rose to £18 million, compared to £6 million
in 2006. This was driven by good working capital management in the
final quarter of the year.
Outlook
APV is in a much stronger position than it has been for several
years and the continued self-help and further restructuring with
regards to the business mix should lead to increased consistency
in performance.
The key trends in the dairy industry, including plant consolidation,
product traceability and plant productivity, provide good
opportunities for APV in automation, plant modifications and
product. The emerging markets continue to provide good prospects
for projects growth and the increase in the heat transfer business
looks set to continue, with APV making investments in industrial
plate heat exchanger designs, further manufacturing capacity and
alternative materials research.
APV is in a much stronger position than it has been
for several years and the continued self-help and further
restructuring with regards to the business mix should lead
to increased consistency in performance. Our Dimetronic employees
are responsible for the design,
installation, testing, commissioning
and maintenance of the signalling

RAIL GROUP
Rail Group is a multinational leader in the design, manufacture,
supply, installation, commissioning and maintenance of safety-related
rail signalling and control systems, as well as a complete range of rail
signalling products. The global business in rail signalling automation
is highly regionalised, and as such the business of the Rail Group is
largely channelled through its regional businesses, all of which hold
leading positions in their markets.
Markets
During the year UNIFE, the Association of European Railway
Industries, commissioned Roland Berger to carry out a World
Market Study for the industry which highlighted a variety of trends.
The world rail market is expected to grow at 2% above inflation
per annum from 2005 to 2015, with signalling growing at 1.6% per
annum over the same period. The signalling and rail control market
is estimated to be €7 billion, with Western Europe and Asia Pacific
identified as the largest markets. Signalling growth to 2015 is likely
to contract slightly in Western Europe but strong real growth per
annum is expected to be seen in Latin America (7%), Africa and
the Middle East (5%) and Asia Pacific (4%). Growth in mass transit
signalling is expected to be significantly higher than growth in
mainline signalling, with the three regions of strong growth
showing particularly large variation.
Rail Group’s core markets have remained stable throughout the
year. In the UK, Network Rail continues to spend on improving
the infrastructure and its award of three Category A framework
agreements to us during the year should provide us with a sound
base. The European Union (EU) infrastructure spending in Spain
is likely to be reduced but €14 billion of EU funds have been
earmarked for rail investment between now and 2013 in the
member states that have joined since 2004. According to the Roland
Berger study, the NAFTA Rail Controls Systems market, estimated
at €700 million, is expected to grow at 0.9% per annum until 2015.
Developments
During the year, our UK rail business Westinghouse was formally
awarded three out of the available six Category A large signalling
renewal framework agreements by Network Rail. Two major
contracts for projects under these framework agreements were
signed during the year and the third contract has been signed since
the year end. Work continues on the 14 year £960 million Public

Private Partnership contracts to install new signalling and train
control systems on approximately two thirds of the London
Underground and we continue to monitor the situation closely.
In addition, Westinghouse has received the contract for signalling
on the new extension to the East London Line in the UK.
The Iberian market remained strong throughout the year with work
proceeding on several high speed line projects and it also won the
first order for European Rail Traffic Management System technology
in a suburban commuter environment.
In the US, the anticipated benefits of the signing of the Transportation
Bill last year have been slower to materialise than expected but this
has been offset by an improvement in orders for signalling as the
railroad companies have focused on increasing capacity.
In export markets, Rail Group continues to examine potential
opportunities to capture the anticipated increase in global rail
infrastructure spend, particularly in higher growth regions. Amongst
those regions some have been identified as potential core strategic
markets, namely India, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East,
China and South East Asia. It is also seeking additional engineering
resources outside its core markets to mitigate potential capacity
constraints.
Performance
A good performance from our core markets resulted in orders
for the year rising 11% at CER to £549 million (2006: £504 million).
Despite the delay in the formal signing of one of the three initial
contracts for large projects under the Network Rail Category A
framework agreements, the full year book-to-bill ratio was 106%.
Revenue growth was particularly good in the UK, Spain and
Australia, and overall revenue rose by 20% at CER to £516 million
(2006: £438 million).
Operating profit rose to £80 million (2006: £65 million), an increase
of 24% at CER, reflecting the increase in revenue. This produced
a higher than normal operating margin for the year of 15.5%
(2006: 14.8%) due to the benefit of increased volume and improved
mix. The increased profitability and strong receipts on long-term
contracts resulted in an operating cash flow of £135 million,
compared to £92 million in 2006.
Outlook
The levels of planned investment in rail infrastructure within the
Rail Group’s core markets of UK, Iberia and the US should provide
a sound base for future operating performance. In addition, the Rail
Group is seeking to establish itself selectively in new markets, where
there is expected to be a significant increase in spending on
signalling and train controls systems.
Business review
The levels of planned investment in rail infrastructure
within Rail Group’s core markets should provide a sound
base for future operating performance as it seeks to

CONTROLS
Controls is a leading global provider of components, systems, and
services used in the appliance, heating, air conditioning, refrigeration
and residential markets.
Markets
Controls markets around the world have, in general, remained
uncertain throughout the year. In North America, demand for smoke
and carbon monoxide alarms and thermostats has been affected
by the downturn in the US new residential construction market.
However demand from the US appliance and HVAC market has
remained strong as our customers generally have a larger exposure
to the residential remodelling market, which has not been as
significantly affected by the downturn in the new residential
construction market. The US new residential market accounts
for some 10% of Controls revenue. In the rest of the world,
market conditions during the year were generally favourable.
Developments
The improved operating performance at Controls is gaining
momentum with a broad range of actions being taken to address
the operational issues that have affected the results of the business
in recent years.
During the year, we have improved the quality of our management
information which has enabled us to better assess the performance
of each product group and to facilitate remedial actions. This has
identified a number of areas of underperformance that had not
been apparent and has enabled management to produce clear
plans to deal with the issues.
Our increased commitment to research and development has led to
a significant increase in new product introductions, which have been
well received by customers and helped to strengthen relationships.
The continued progress in operational efficiency, on-time delivery
and product quality allowed us to enter price discussions with many
of our customers for the first time in several years. These discussions
have led to a series of price rises across most of our product groups
in the second half of the year and the impact of these rises has
helped to mitigate the effect of recent raw material price inflation.

We are continuing to consolidate and optimise our manufacturing
footprint where economically sensible. During the year, the transfer
of production from Japan to China progressed well and is nearing
completion. Our European Appliance business has continued to
review its high cost manufacturing base and in March initiated
discussions with employee representatives and local trade unions
regarding our intention to close down the manufacturing facility
located in Lomazzo, Italy. Since the year end, we have also initiated
discussions regarding our intention to end manufacturing operations
in Thyez, France; these discussions do not affect the research and
development activities carried on at that site.
Performance
Overall orders for the year were down 4% at CER to £741 million
(2006: £797 million) mainly due to the previously announced loss
of the EDF contract at IMServ and the disposal of small contracting
businesses; excluding the effect of these items, orders rose 3% at
CER. Reported revenue followed a similar trend, falling 4% at CER
to £737 million (2006: £788 million); excluding the effect of the
above items, revenue also rose by 3% at CER.
Operating profit rose to £65 million (2006: £64 million), an increase
of 3% at CER. The significant effect of raw material price inflation was
offset by the effect of price rises, improved operational efficiency
within the manufacturing plants and the absence this year of external
consultancy costs. As a result, operating margin improved to 8.8%
(2006: 8.1%). Operating cash flow was £54 million compared to
£48 million in 2006 with lower disbursements relating to the earlier
product recalls.
Following successful management of the two product recalls
that were announced in prior years, Controls was able to release
£5 million from the provision made in 2005.
Outlook
Controls has made good progress in breaking what was a
long-term negative trend in performance through a focus upon
operational improvement that allowed price conversations with
customers. Market conditions are expected to continue to be
uncertain in most regions particularly in North America, where the
US new residential construction market is not expected to improve
during 2007. Some raw material prices are expected to increase
further in the year. However, key product penetration in other
regions, the ongoing benefits from exiting low margin areas and
focus on operational improvements are expected to drive further
improvements in performance in the new financial year.

The commitment of the Invensys Board
and staff to all areas of corporate social
responsibility has strengthened further
year on year.
We recognise the importance to all stakeholders of ensuring the
health and safety of our employees, minimising the environmental
impact that our businesses have on society and giving back
something to the communities in which we operate.
The Code of Conduct training continues to be successfully
implemented and further programmes have been introduced to
educate employees on specific topics. On environmental matters,
we have been recognised, in a survey published in November 2006
by Trucost on behalf of a Department of the UK Government, as
one of only five UK companies who report quantitatively on all
environmental performance metrics. We have further improved
our environmental disclosures in this report which show that,
despite increases in activity, the impact of Invensys’ activities
continues to fall with further reductions in CO2 emissions, hazardous
waste production and energy used, an increasing proportion of
which is from renewable sources. On employee safety, we had a
second consecutive year of decline in the rates of illness and injury.
Code of Conduct
The Invensys Code of Conduct (the Code) remains a key element of
our commitment to ensuring that our employees and suppliers act
with integrity, and in accordance both with local law and our own
legal and ethical standards. The Code, which is available on our
website, sets out our ethical practice as a business, and includes
instruction on health and safety, responsible computer usage,
workplace conduct and competition law, among other topics.
Launched in September 2005, over 95% of employees have now
completed training, and new recruits receive training, either as part
of their induction process or through web-based exercises. This task
is supported with executive communications and printed materials.
The Code is the first and core part of a broader Invensys
Compliance Programme, in which specific issues relevant to our
conduct as a business and as individuals are being highlighted.
Training on intellectual property rights and compliant computer
usage has so far been delivered, and a health and safety training
module for all employees will be launched in 2007. Further modules
will be developed and launched as part of an ongoing commitment
by Invensys to informing and educating our employees.
Environment, Health and Safety (EHS)
We have an increasing commitment to our EHS philosophy with
regard to our responsibility to provide products, services and
ongoing support in a sustainable manner. We continue to strive
for EHS excellence in conjunction with our efforts to become a
world class organisation.
In order to achieve these goals, we have strengthened the EHS
resources within Rail Group and Process Systems by employing
EHS professionals who are responsible for specific regions within
the business groups. We have also established an EHS Management
System that provides us with the opportunity to enlarge the number
of plants with external environmental certifications. New certificates
awarded during the year include:

In addition, we launched an EHS Compliance Assurance Verification
Process for all our sites and during the year an independent and
external organisation performed 19 audits examining general
EHS compliance. Under this programme we will audit all our major
locations in a three year period.
This year, in a survey published in November 2006 by Trucost on
behalf of the UK Government’s Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) we were recognised as one of only five UK
companies that reported on all environmental performance metrics
in quantitative terms. In order to continue to be recognised as an
ethical investment option, we executed for the fifth consecutive year,
our Environmental Performance Questionnaire (EPQ) within our
54 manufacturing operations.
Under DEFRA guidelines, we have established the following as KPIs
for our manufacturing facilities:
• total CO2 emissions (kg);
• total water consumption (cubic metres);
• total non-hazardous wastes (kg); and
• total hazardous wastes (kg).
We continue to collect data from our primary sites on a calendar
year basis to validate baseline performance. The first ‘Full survey’
column in the table below presents the results for the calendar year
2006 including all the 54 sites surveyed. For comparability purposes,
we have included in the next two columns data from the 52 sites
which were surveyed in both years.

We recognise the importance to all stakeholders of ensuring
the health and safety of our employees, minimising the
environmental impact that our businesses have on society
and giving back something to the communities in which
we operate.
For these 52 manufacturing sites reporting both for the calendar
year 2006 and 2005, the table below illustrates the data normalised
on a per employee basis:
• a decrease in total CO2 emissions of 9% due to an overall
reduction in natural gas and electricity consumption attributed
to greater conservation awareness;
• an increase in total water consumption of 4% due to increased
production at key locations in the UK and China;
• an increase in total non-hazardous wastes of 3%, also due to
increased production at several key locations; however, there
was also a corresponding 13% increase in recycling driven
primarily by these locations;
• a decrease in total hazardous wastes of 19% due primarily to a
reduction in hazardous material usage at a key location in China;
• in addition to decreasing the total amount of hazardous waste,
Invensys increased the proportion of hazardous waste recycled
from 31% in 2005 to 35% in 2006; and
• reduced overall usage of volatile organic compounds by 6%
in 2006 over 2005.
In addition, Invensys has nearly doubled the percentage of electricity
from renewable resources from 15% in 2005 to 26% in 2006.
The Board continues to be briefed on company EHS performance
and receives monthly reports on any violations, citations or
environmental releases. In the past year the following were reported:
• Louisville, KY – a minor citation was received by Safetran System
Corp on 12 October 2006 in regards to waste satellite
accumulation areas; proper corrective actions were established
and the citation did not result in any fine or penalty; and
• Changzhou, China – the local Environmental Protection Bureau
(EPB) cited the plant for noise and waste water violations and
fined the plant. After the authorities were able to verify the status
of the corrective actions, the penalty was reduced to US$6,300.
Health and safety
“We hold ourselves accountable for safeguarding the health and
safety of our employees and contractors, visitors to our sites,
customers and the communities in which we conduct our business
activities.” (Ulf Henriksson)
A clear demonstration of this commitment is our reduction in
Injury/Illness Incident Frequency Rates. From the end of March 2006
to the end of March 2007, the Total Recordable Cases Incident Rate
(TCIR)

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CONTINUED)
Despite measured improvements in safety, we continue to be diligent
in planning and prevention activities. In order to reduce the risk
posed to all Invensys personnel and to business continuity by the
potential avian flu pandemic, we have implemented a Pandemic
Preparedness Plan and established a cross-functional global team
with participation from all businesses.
Employees
We believe that to achieve maximum potential value for our
shareholders and customers, we need to unlock the potential of
every employee to perform to the best of their abilities and are
working hard to create an environment where this is possible.
For 2008, we have increased the budget for learning and
development by 46%. This budget provides financial support for
employees seeking to gain professional qualifications, access to
leadership development programmes and many other learning
interventions. An annual goal deployment process ensures that
all our employees understand Invensys’ organisational goals and
objectives. In addition each employee has an annual performance
and development review where they get the opportunity to set their
personal annual objectives, discuss their performance and create a
personal development plan.
Top talent in the organisation is assessed and developed through our
annual organisational capability review (OCR). Through this review
we manage internal global career progression for key leaders in line
with our succession plans and also identify and develop future talent
through our ‘rising stars’ programme.
We believe in a meritocracy and strive to offer competitive
remuneration and benefits in each market in which we participate
through a system of differentiated base pay, cash and equity
bonuses, based on the individual’s contributions to Invensys’ success.
At Invensys we respect and support the Human Rights Act 1998 by
ensuring we comply with the labour laws of the countries in which
we operate and by creating an inclusive culture for our employees,
including men and women from different nations, cultures, ethnic
groups, generations and backgrounds. In addition to our Code of
Conduct, we also have in place local policies and procedures which
set out our commitment to create an environment where our
employees can work without concerns that they will not be treated
appropriately as a result of their gender, marital status, sexual
orientation, colour, religion, race, nationality, ethnic origin, age
or disability.
The Invensys European Employees Forum, with elected employee
representatives, promotes dialogue with management. Globally we
communicate with our employees through local communications
networks, town hall meetings, ‘skip level’ meetings and employee
newsletters and blogs. This year we are increasing our cross-Invensys
communication opportunities; especially in regards to two-way
communication so we can hear the ideas, suggestions and feedback
from as many employees as possible.
We strive to make Invensys a place where top people choose to be;
where they can enhance their lives and careers; and are motivated
to perform their best and better their performance.
Community
We continue to recognise the importance of our relationship
with the communities in which we operate and encourage our
businesses and employees to provide support. Given the nature
of our activities and the structure of the Group, community
contact is currently organised at a local level by the site managers.
For example one of our Rail Group employees, following on from
organising a live radio link between children at a primary school
near Chippenham and the International Space Station in 2003, has
helped the school to receive a £35,000 grant to set up their own
project to bring science, engineering and computing to life for the
current generation of pupils; and in the US some Process Systems
employees volunteered their time to create a five year strategic
improvement plan for their local school district while also helping
students explore future careers through on-site work experiences
in the field of engineering.
The Group has also made financial contributions to charities and
community causes of £0.3 million. These payments were made to a
wide range of charitable organisations both in the UK and overseas.

Invensys operates globally in varied markets and is affected by a
number of risks inherent in its activities, not all of which are within
its control. The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group,
which could cause the Group’s actual results to vary materially from
historic and expected results, are set out below. These principal risks
and uncertainties are disclosed under the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985.
The process used by Invensys to manage these risks is set out in
the Corporate Governance section on internal control on page 47.
Invensys seeks to implement practical measures to mitigate exposure
to all forms of risk and to transfer risk to insurers, where cost-effective.
The Group may be exposed to additional liabilities with respect
to its UK and US pension plans
The interaction of, among other things, increased life expectancy,
equity market performance and low interest rates over the past
several years has had a significant negative impact on the funding
levels of the Group’s pension plans including the Group’s plans in both
the UK and the US. These developments have been exacerbated by
the Group’s very high proportion of pensioners relative to its active
workforce. With respect to both the Group pension plans for its UK
operations and for its US operations, any decline in the equity market,
improvements in life expectancy, changes in expected morbidity rates
or future decreases in interest rates could increase the funding deficit
and require additional funding contributions in excess of those
currently expected. An increase in required funding contributions
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
The Group could be exposed to deterioration in its financial
results if the restructuring and turnaround initiatives of certain
of the Group’s significant businesses, including the relocation of
manufacturing and engineering facilities to low cost countries,
are not successful
In response to increased competition for some of the Group’s
products in certain markets, especially from low-cost manufacturers
in Asia, a number of significant restructuring activities are in process
or planned at operations in Controls, APV and Eurotherm. The
objective of these initiatives is to increase competitiveness in these
markets by improving manufacturing efficiencies and reduce the
operating cost base. These restructuring activities and turnaround
initiatives involve the closure of a number of production facilities
and in certain instances the transfer of manufacturing and
engineering facilities to countries that have lower operating costs.
The Group will commit substantial resources to complete these
restructuring and turnaround initiatives successfully. However,
transition issues may cause disruption to the businesses and there
can be no assurance that these restructuring activities will ultimately
be successful. This may result in loss of market share and a
deterioration in the Group’s financial results.
The Group is subject to ongoing litigation and
environmental liabilities
As a consequence of the disposal of a significant number of
businesses in the past the Group currently has liabilities in relation
to environmental claims (including the cost associated with the
remediation of contaminated sites no longer owned by the Group),
disputed taxes, retained litigation including personal injury claims
arising from alleged exposure to asbestos and silica, indemnity claims
and other disposal costs in relation to businesses it no longer owns.
The Group also has environmental liabilities in relation to the
remediation of vacant sites owned by it. These risks are expected to
recede over time as warranties and indemnities in relation to past
disposals expire, existing disputes are settled and remediation work
on contaminated sites is completed.
All of the above liabilities are subject to a number of uncertainties,
assumptions and contingencies. While the Group continually
monitors these liabilities there can be no assurance that these
liabilities will not be substantially higher or become payable sooner
than currently anticipated or that any of the current reserves in the
Group’s accounts in respect of any such liabilities will be sufficient
or if currently unknown liabilities should arise. If these liabilities
were to be substantially higher than currently estimated or if
currently unknown liabilities should arise, the resulting increase in
the Group’s liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Operating in global markets subjects the Group to risks
associated with changes in political and economic conditions
and in applicable laws and regulations
The Group operates in over 60 countries and is subject to a broad
range of laws, regulations and standards in each of the jurisdictions
Business review
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 42 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (CONTINUED)
in which it operates. More recently an increasing portion of its
revenues are from customers outside Europe and North America.
In addition a number of its production and engineering facilities
have been or are in the process of being relocated to countries
in Asia and Eastern Europe. As a result Invensys has become
increasingly exposed to changes in political and economic conditions,
laws and regulations or other factors affecting its businesses outside
Europe and North America. Unexpected changes in any of these
variables could significantly impair the Group’s performance, as could
failure to comply with the relevant laws, regulations or standards,
which could damage the reputation of the Group.
The Group faces intense competition and failure to maintain
a competitive and technologically advanced product range
could reduce its margins and revenue growth
Invensys operates in highly competitive markets and the Group’s
products and services are characterised by continually evolving
industry standards and rapidly changing technology driven by
the demands of the Group’s customers. Failure to keep pace with
technological changes and product requirements in the industrial
sectors may result in loss of market share and lower margins.
The Group invests in research and development to develop new
technologies and products to sustain or improve its competitive
position.
However, all new technologies and products involve business risk
in terms of possible abortive expenditure, reputational risk, and
potentially customer claims or onerous contracts. Such risks may
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
The Group’s business could be harmed if it is unable to protect
its intellectual property rights
The Group’s intellectual property rights in the ArchestrA and InFusion
products are important to the future prospects of the Group. If the
Group’s competitors succeed in reproducing these products at
comparatively low costs, or in improving the Group’s products,
processes or know-how, this could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
given the extent of the Group’s activities worldwide, the Group may
be unable to protect itself from infringement of intellectual property,
particularly of intellectual property embedded in applications or
solutions products, in jurisdictions in which it may be unable to
obtain adequate intellectual property rights or is unable to enforce
its intellectual property rights.
Undertaking large, long-term projects exposes the Group’s
business to risk of loss
A significant number of the Group’s businesses involve long-term
projects, that can take many months or even years to complete.
These projects may be subject to delays and cost overruns due
to delays in equipment deliveries, engineering problems, work
stoppages, unanticipated cost increases, shortages of materials
or skilled labour or labour unrest or other unforeseen problems.
Further, these projects may be particularly susceptible to cost
overruns and delays due to the engineering and construction
uncertainties inherent in the nature of the projects. Any cost
overruns or delays which are not recoverable under contractual
terms may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.
The Group may be subject to liability as a result of product
liability claims
The Group has incurred and may continue to incur product liability
claims, warranty claims or product recalls and associated claims in
the future particularly as some of the Group’s products, such as
fire alarms and valves, are safety critical. Errors and defects in the
Group’s products, systems or applications could cause injury to
persons or damage to property and equipment. These occurrences
could result in claims, loss of revenue, warranty costs, costs and
damages associated with product recalls, litigation, delay in market
acceptance or harm to the Group’s reputation for safety and quality.
The Group may not be able to dispose of any such claims
successfully or effect any product recalls without incurring significant
costs, which in each case could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The timing and frequency of substantial contract awards
for the Group’s Rail Group business are unpredictable
The revenue of the Group’s Rail Group business depends on a small
number of large customers, such as Network Rail and the Public
Private Partnership (PPP) consortia in the UK and other large rail
and mass-transport operators in Europe, Asia Pacific and the US.
New contract awards are generally associated with major transport Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 43
infrastructure upgrades and as a result by their nature are large and
infrequent. Funding for these new projects is frequently dependent
on governmental investment decisions and these may be affected by
changes in political and economic conditions. As a result the timing
of contract awards is uncertain and delays in awards may result in
volatility in the results of the Rail Group business and have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.
The Group’s Process Systems business is reliant on the
capital expenditure requirements from the oil, gas and
chemical sectors
A substantial part of the Group’s Process Systems business is
associated with the supply of automation and information
systems to the oil, gas and chemical industries. Capital expenditure
requirements from customers in these industries are often highly
cyclical and linked to the international supply and demand and
pricing of hydrocarbons. These may fluctuate depending on political
developments or conflicts (especially in the Middle East), natural
disasters, weather, economic conditions or actions by major oil-
exporting countries. Consequently demand for the Group’s products
may fluctuate significantly based on short, medium or long-term
investment assessments made by multinational customers. There may
also be a significant time lag between when the changes in supply
and demand cycles occur and when this feeds down to the Group in
terms of capital expenditure requirements. As a result the timing of
contract awards is uncertain and delays in awards may result in
volatility in the results of the Process Systems business and have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition
and results of operations.
If the Group is unable to retain key personnel and hire
additional personnel, it may not be able to effectively
implement its business strategy and could experience
delays in the development of, or increased difficulty
in selling, its products and services
In the past two years, the Group has been through a period of
significant change in its senior management team with a number
of changes at head office and within many of the Group’s businesses.
Several of these appointees are new to the Group with limited
knowledge of the organisation.
Invensys believes its future success will depend in part upon
its ability to retain and develop the existing senior management
team and to attract further highly skilled personnel. The Group has
in the past experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining employees
with appropriate qualifications. If the Group does not succeed
in attracting and retaining skilled personnel, it may not be able
to manage and grow its business as anticipated.
Business review 44 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Combined Code – principles and compliance
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance.
Throughout the year under review Invensys has been compliant
with provisions of the Code on Corporate Governance issued
by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 (the Code) save for
the appointment of the Chairman, Martin Jay, to the Remuneration
Committee in August 2006 in anticipation of the amendments to the
Code published in 2006 taking effect. The following report, together
with the Remuneration report, describes how the principles set out
in the Code have been applied.
The Board
The Board is chaired by Mr Jay, who was appointed non-executive
Chairman in July 2003. At 23 May 2007, the Board consisted of two
executive directors and four non-executive directors, in addition to
the Chairman. Biographies of all directors are presented on page 11.
Michael Parker joined the Board as a non-executive director on
24 May 2006. Mr Parker replaced Larry Farmer who, together with
Andrew Macfarlane, retired from the Board at the Annual General
Meeting on 3 August 2006. Mr Parker was appointed Senior
Independent Director on 7 December 2006, replacing Bay Green
who had held this role since 22 July 2005. Mr Parker, as Senior
Independent Director, is available for shareholders to contact should
they have concerns. Mr Green was appointed as acting Chairman of
the Audit Committee to replace Mr Macfarlane and was appointed as
permanent Chairman of the Audit Committee on 7 December 2006.
Steve Hare joined the Board on 21 July 2006 as Chief Financial
Officer, replacing Adrian Hennah who resigned from the Board on
16 June 2006. In addition, Pat Zito was appointed to the Board as
a non-executive director on 23 May 2007 and as a member of the
Audit and Remuneration Committees.
As announced to the London Stock Exchange on 3 May 2007,
Mr Henriksson joined the Board of Hexagon AB as a non-executive
director on 2 May 2007. Hexagon AB is a Swedish global technology
group, listed on the Swedish Stock Exchange, specialising in
measurement technologies, polymers and key components.
Executive directors are encouraged to hold one external non-
executive directorship which is in line with the Code requirements
that Boards should not agree to full-time executive directors taking
on more than one non-executive directorship. In line with these
requirements, this will be Mr Henriksson’s only non-executive
directorship outside his role as Chief Executive. Prior to giving
Mr Henriksson permission to accept this role, the Board undertook
a review to ensure there was no conflict between the business of
the Group and Hexagon AB.
Meetings
The Board meets at least eight times during the course of the year
with additional meetings convened as necessary; in the financial
year under review, the Board met on 11 occasions. The Board’s
programme includes meetings of the Chairman and the non-
executives without the executives being present. Individual
attendance is set out in the table below. To enable the Board to
perform its duties, all directors have full and timely access to all
relevant information and to the services of the Company Secretary.
Independent financial and professional advice is available to the
directors and Board committees, collectively and individually,
as circumstances require, at the Company’s expense.
Attendance
During the year the directors attended the following number
of meetings of the Board and its Committees. This analysis includes
the quorum for meetings and does not include attendance at the
invitation of the respective committees.

Board Audit Committee Remuneration Committee Nominating Committee Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 45
Role and procedures
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the decision
of the Board for all major strategic and financial decisions. This
includes approval of the quarterly results and the formulation of
strategic and annual operating plans; certain decision making is
delegated through structured procedures to committees and,
for operational matters, to senior management. Although all the
directors have an equal responsibility for the operations of Invensys,
the role of the non-executive directors is particularly important in
ensuring that the strategy and business proposals of the executive
management team are fully discussed and examined to ensure that
they meet the long-term interests of shareholders and also take
account of issues affecting employees, customers, suppliers and
the many communities within which Invensys conducts its business.
At least one full day’s meeting every year is devoted to the overall
strategic planning of the Group. The Board delegates specific
authorities to its Nominating Committee, Audit Committee and
Remuneration Committee. Reports of these committees are set
out on pages 46 to 59. All directors receive copies of all committee
minutes and the chairmen of each committee provide an update on
matters of significance at the Board meeting following the
committee meeting.
Board and committees: performance evaluation
The Board has a formal review process with discrete components
covering the evaluation of the Board’s collective performance, the
appraisal of the performance of individual directors, including the
Chairman, and each of the Board’s committees.
Evaluation of executive directors is conducted by the Chairman
and non-executive directors. Appraisal of the non-executive
directors is led by the Chairman in consultation with all directors.
Additionally, each non-executive director is asked to assess
themselves. The evaluation of the Chairman is led by the Senior
Independent Director in consultation with the other non-executive
directors; taking into account the views of the executive directors.
Individual feedback is provided by the Chairman to each of the
directors and by the Senior Independent Director to the Chairman.
In relation to the evaluation of the Board and its committees, an
internal questionnaire based on the Code provisions is used for this
process. The evaluation process involves assessment by reference
to the relevant roles and responsibilities under review, the current
terms of reference of the committees and best practice. The results
of the evaluation provide the basis for continuous improvement in
the Board’s procedures and the Board’s action plans and objectives
for the following year.
Following the most recent set of reviews, the Board remains satisfied
that each ongoing director remains committed to his role and that
the Board and each of its committees remains effective.
Board composition and independence
The Board meets the Code requirement that at least half of the
Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise independent
non-executive directors. The Board considers that all of the
non-executive directors are independent for Code purposes.
The Board has a majority of independent non-executive directors
and a good balance between non-executive and executive directors,
ensuring that no individual or small group dominates the Board’s
decision making. Terms and conditions of appointment of non-
executive directors are available on request from the Company
Secretary. Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial three
year term from the date of their first election by shareholders until
the date of the third annual general meeting thereafter. After which,
their appointment may be extended for a second term, subject to
mutual agreement and shareholder approval.
Division of responsibilities
There is a clear division of responsibility between the Chairman
and the Chief Executive, formulated in their terms of appointment
and in the delegation of authorities prescribed by the Board, which
ensures that there is a proper balance of power and authority. Mr Jay,
as Chairman, is responsible for leadership of the Board and ensuring
its effectiveness. He facilitates the contribution of the non-executive
directors, ensures constructive relations between the executive and
non-executive directors and effective communication with
shareholders. Mr Henriksson, as the Chief Executive, is responsible
for executing the strategy approved by the Board.
Induction and development
On appointment, new directors receive an induction programme
tailored to their experience, including an induction pack comprising
relevant information, scheduled meetings with key personnel and
advisors and site visits. As part of his induction, Mr Parker met senior
employees and advisers, visited a number of the Controls’ business
sites in the US and met with employees and the President of the
Controls business. Mr Hare’s programme included discussions with
major shareholders, advisers and senior employees, visits to the
businesses and hand-over sessions with Mr Hennah. The continuing
development of directors, collectively and individually, is mainly
effected through the provision to them by relevant external and
internal advisers of briefings on matters of current significance to
the Group and also through attendance at external briefings. In the
year under review, briefings included the Transparency Directive and
anti age discrimination legislation. A briefing on the implications of
the Companies Act 2006 is planned for later in the year.
Communication with shareholders
Communication with all shareholders is at all times given a high
priority and a number of means are used to promote greater
understanding and dialogue with investment audiences. In order
to develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders,
the Board receives regular reports from the Chief Executive and
the Group’s investor relations team. The Group investor relations
team offers major shareholders the opportunity to meet with the
Chairman and, where appropriate, other non-executive directors.
During the year, the Chairman met with Standard Life and Insight
and the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee met with several
Corporate governance 46 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (CONTINUED)
major shareholders as part of the proposed remuneration policy
changes.
During the course of a year, shareholders are kept informed of
the progress of the Group through quarterly results and other
announcements of significant developments that are released
through the London Stock Exchange and other news services. There
is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and participation
in sector conferences. Shareholders can also raise questions directly
with the Company at any time by contacting the investor relations
team, whose contact details are listed on the Group’s website.
Additionally, directors are available at the annual general meeting
for shareholders’ questions. The Annual report and accounts are sent
to shareholders at least 20 working days prior to the annual general
meeting. Voting on resolutions proposed separately is conducted by
polls at general meetings and voting results are announced through
the London Stock Exchange and other news services; the results and
proxy levels are available on the website and on request.
Nominating Committee report
Membership
The Committee currently comprises three non-executive directors,
the majority of whom are independent. This table details members
of the Committee during the year under review:

Current members
Martin Jay January 2003, Chairman of the
Nominating Committee since 23 July 2003
Bay Green 1 January 2005
Jean-Claude Guez 23 July 2003
Role
The Nominating Committee is appointed by the Board from
the non-executive directors of the Company. During the year,
the terms of reference for the Nominating Committee were
reviewed and updated. This consisted of a review against the
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Adminstrators’ model,
and of ‘best in class’ standards. The revised terms of reference
are available on the Group’s website.
The Committee’s responsibilities include:
• making recommendations to the Board for the appointment,
re-appointment and retirement of directors;
• reviewing the performance of directors;
• reviewing the composition and size of the Board and its
committees;
• setting the procedure for the appointment of new directors
to the Board; and
• succession planning.
In addition to the scheduled meetings, the Nominating Committee
undertook further responsibilities including the interviewing of
candidates for appointment to the Board.
Meetings
The Nominating Committee met formally on eight occasions during
the period. Attendance is shown in the table on page 44. At the
request of the Nominating Committee, the Chief Executive, Chief
Financial Officer and SVP Human Resources were invited to attend
some meetings of the Committee.
Principal matters considered during the year under review included:
• definition of the Board’s requirements for the selection and
appointment of the new Chief Financial Officer, Mr Hare, and
the new non-executive directors, Mr Parker and Mr Zito. The
Committee was assisted in this exercise by external recruitment
advisers;
• evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge and experience
of the Board and, in light of which, prepared descriptions of
the role and capabilities required for the three roles;
• evaluation of those directors proposed for election or re-election
at the annual general meeting (no individual director participating
in any matter relating to himself); and
• adoption of procedures for emergency succession planning.
All directors are required to retire by rotation no later than the
third annual general meeting following their appointment or
re-appointment. No director is proposed for election for a further
term of three years unless the Nominating Committee has, following
evaluation, recommended re-appointment to the Board. In recent
years, the Board has implemented a progressive refreshing of its
membership and at the present time, two of its members have
served more than one term of three years. The recommendations
of the Nominating Committee on election and re-election of
directors are described in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive
directors are available on request from the Company Secretary.

Bay Green is a qualified chartered accountant and fellow of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales and, with
over 30 years in financial roles, he is considered to have recent and
relevant financial experience for the purposes of the Code. He has
held a number of senior positions in Dresdner Kleinwort and is a
Specialist Adviser to the Wholesale and Institutional Markets Business
Unit of the Financial Services Authority.
Role
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board from the
non-executive directors of the Company. During the year,
the terms of reference for the Audit Committee were
reviewed and updated. This consisted of a review against the
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Adminstrators’ model,
and of ‘best in class’ standards. The revised terms of reference
are available on the Group’s website.
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities include:
• monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and
reviewing significant financial reporting issues and accounting
policies;
• reviewing the Group’s systems of internal control and risk
management;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function;
• making recommendations to the Board on the appointment,
dismissal, remuneration and terms of engagement of the external
auditor; and
• reviewing the external auditors’ independence, objectivity and
effectiveness, taking into account professional and regulatory
requirements.
Meetings
The Audit Committee meets at least four times a year and in the
year under review met on eight occasions. Attendance is shown
in the table on page 44. At least once a year, the Audit Committee
and external auditors meet without management present. At the
invitation of the Audit Committee, the Chairman and executive
directors normally attend all meetings. In addition other senior
managers are invited as required.
Principal matters considered during the year under review included:
• review of the financial disclosures in the Group’s Annual report
and accounts, Interim report and quarterly financial results;
• review of the effectiveness of the internal audit function,
consideration of internal audit reports and the annual internal
audit programme;
• review of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls
and risk management processes and procedures;
• approval of the external audit plan and fee proposal;
• the policy on auditor independence and provision of audit
and non-audit services by the auditor;
• the assessment of the effectiveness of the external auditors;
• recommendation to the Board of the re-appointment of
Ernst & Young LLP as the external auditor; and
• monitoring, through the Risk Committee, the Group’s
whistle-blowing programme.
The Audit Committee has guidelines to ensure that the
independence of Ernst & Young LLP as the auditor of the Group’s
financial statements is not impaired by providing non-audit services.
These guidelines govern the provision of non-audit services by Ernst
& Young LLP in identifying certain non-audit services that the auditor
is prohibited from providing. Permitted categories of non-audit
services are defined and approved by the Chairman of the Audit
Committee. The engagements for non-audit services are subject to
formal approval based on the level of fees involved. Details of the
amounts paid to the external auditor during the year for audit and
other services are set out in Note 5 to the Group financial statements.
Internal control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the system of internal
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Each of the Group’s
businesses is individually accountable to the Chief Executive and
is managed by a president who, with his senior management team,
provides day-to-day control over the businesses’ operations within
the strategic guidelines and delegated authorities determined by the
Board. The internal control system is designed to meet the Group’s
particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed but it should be
appreciated that, however effective a system of internal control is,
it can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established a structured approach to risk
management with the processes to identify and manage key risks
facing the Group being an integral part of the control environment.
The Risk Committee reports to the Board through the Audit
Committee. The Risk Committee is responsible for the system of risk
management and for the reporting of key risks and the associated
mitigating management actions. The Risk Committee comprises the
Head of Business Risk (Chairman of the Committee since 6 March
2007), the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive, the General
Counsel and Company Secretary, the Group Financial Controller,
the Group Treasurer, the VP Environment Health and Safety, the VP
Risk Management and Insurance, the Director of Internal Audit and
the Deputy Secretary. During the year, its activities have included
reviewing the Group’s risk framework and its monitoring processes.
A summary of the principal risks facing the Group is presented on
pages 41 to 43.
Corporate governance 48 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE (CONTINUED)
In accordance with the Turnbull guidance, the Board confirms that
it has undertaken its annual assessment of the Group’s systems of
internal control. Inputs into the assessment undertaken by the
Audit Committee included:
• consideration of the key risks facing the businesses as part of the
review of the Group’s strategic planning and annual operating
planning processes;
• review of the enhancements to the overall control environment;
• consideration of the key elements of the Group’s control
processes including organisational structure, the application of
governance rules and systems, information management including
monthly reporting routines and risk management activities;
• reports received from both internal and external audit during
the course of the year; and
• the findings from the annual self-assessment questionnaire which
requires all senior managers, from reporting unit level upwards,
to certify compliance with the Group’s financial and operational
procedures and controls, including environmental, health and
safety matters and the Invensys Code of Conduct.
Following detailed review, the Audit Committee reported on its
findings to the Board. The Board is satisfied that the information
that it has received throughout the year and for its annual review
together with the procedural review framework that has been
established are sufficient to enable it to review the effectiveness
of the Group’s system of internal control. Whilst areas for
improvement in control have been identified and actions initiated
on account of the above processes, no significant shortcomings in
internal control were identified from the annual assessment. The
internal control process has been in place for the year under review
and up to the date of approval of the Annual report and accounts.
Internal audit
Internal audit has a direct reporting line to the Chairman of the
Audit Committee and its responsibilities include the examination and
evaluation of the scope and effectiveness of the Group’s system of
internal control. The audit plan is constructed to provide geographic
coverage over broadly a three year cycle with a degree of tailoring to
address specific risk concerns. During the year, it reported regularly
to the Audit Committee on its assessment of internal control issues
arising in the course of its internal audit reviews of the Group’s
operations. Each year a consolidated review is provided to assist
the Board to undertake its own annual review of internal control.
Whistle-blowing
The Committee reviews the Group’s arrangements under which
staff can, on a confidential basis, raise concerns about potential
irregularities and arrangements for follow-up actions. The helpline
is operated by Global Compliance Services Inc., an independent
company, and is publicised to employees via the Invensys Code
of Conduct. Any investigations are undertaken by the Company
Secretary, or at her direction, and any material investigations are
brought to the immediate attention of the Audit Committee which
determines an appropriate follow-up action. Statistics on the volume
and general nature of calls are reported annually to the Audit
Committee and the Board. No material issues were reported
through this route during the year. REMUNERATION REPORT
Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 49
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s report
on directors’ remuneration (Remuneration report) for the year
to 31 March 2007.
As set out in the Chairman’s Statement on page 12, Invensys has
continued to make significant progress in its turnaround journey.
To meet the strategic needs of the Company over the ensuing critical
years and to reflect particular circumstances more fully described
below, the Committee felt it was appropriate to initiate a
comprehensive review of our remuneration strategy. As a result a
number of changes are proposed, including two specific matters
requiring formal shareholder approval.
The Committee believes that the proposed remuneration policy
(including the matters set out below and in the Notice of Annual
General Meeting for approval by ordinary resolution) which, subject
to your approval, will be in place from 2007/08 is necessary and
appropriate to enable us to recruit the new people we need, and
retain and motivate those already with us, in all of our businesses.
The changes will stand us in good stead to support the continued
execution of our strategy.
Resolutions to vote on the two specific matters mentioned, and on the
Remuneration report itself, will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
I hope that you will support these three resolutions.
The Remuneration report was approved by the Board of directors on
23 May 2007 and signed on its behalf by:
Jean-Claude Guez
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Remuneration Committee (Committee)
Membership
The Committee comprised four non-executive directors for the year
under review and Pat Zito joined the Committee with effect from
23 May 2007. The table below details members of the Committee
during the year under review:
Name Date of appointment/retirement
Current members
Jean-Claude Guez Appointed 21 January 2003; appointed
Chairman of the Committee 9 January 2004
Bay Green Appointed 13 December 2006
Martin Jay Appointed 2 August 2006
Michael Parker Appointed 2 August 2006
Former members
Larry Farmer Retired 3 August 2006
Andrew Macfarlane Retired 3 August 2006
They are all independent non-executive directors save for Mr Jay, as
Chairman of the Company.
No non-Committee member may attend other than by invitation of
the Committee Chairman. At the request of the Committee Chairman
the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), SVP Human Resources,
Head of Executive Programmes and General Counsel are also invited to
attend and speak at meetings, except when their own remuneration is
being considered.
Meetings
The Committee meets at least four times each year and met on
seven occasions during the year under review. The adoption of this
Remuneration report is subject to a separate shareholder resolution at
the Annual General Meeting and, to ensure that shareholders continue
to support the remuneration policy, there is appropriate dialogue with
major institutional shareholders and representative bodies such as the
Association of British Insurers (ABI) and Research, Recommendations
and Electronic Voting (RREV).
Principal matters considered during the year under review were:
• review and update of the Committee’s terms of reference;
• review of the Company’s remuneration strategy in the light of
business needs;
• review of executive remuneration, including base salary and
bonus packages;
• review of external advisers to the Committee;
• approval of the adjustments to awards under the Company’s share
schemes as a consequence of the Rights issue and Share
consolidation effected in 2006;
• assessment of the impact of the Employment Equality (Age)
Regulations 2006 on the Company’s current policies and practices;
and
• review of external directorship policy guidelines.
Role
As noted above, the terms of reference for the Committee were
reviewed and updated during the year. This consisted of a review
against the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators’
model, and of ‘best in class’ standards.
The Committee is a committee of the Board and its principal duties
are to:
• determine and agree with the Board the framework or broad policy
for the remuneration of the Chairman, executive directors,
Company Secretary and first layer of management below Board
level taking into account all factors which it deems necessary
including to ensure that the interests of executives are aligned with
those of shareholders. The remuneration of non-executive directors
will be a matter for the Chairman and the executive members of
the Board. No director or manager will be involved in any decisions
as to their own remuneration;
• review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the
remuneration policy, review and note annually the remuneration
trends across the Company and obtain up to date information
about remuneration structures in other companies;
• approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance
related pay schemes operated by the Company and approve the
total annual payments made under such schemes;
• review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the
Board and shareholders. For any such plans, determine each year
whether awards will be made, and if so, the overall level of such
awards, the individual awards to executive directors and other
senior executives and the performance targets to be used;
• ensure that contractual terms on termination, and any payments
made, are fair to the individual, and the Company, that failure is
not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised;
• within the terms of the agreed policy and in consultation with the
Chairman and/or Chief Executive as appropriate, determine the
total individual remuneration package of each executive director
and other senior executives including bonuses, incentive payments
and share awards, pension arrangements and expatriation
allowances giving due regard to any relevant legal requirements,
the provisions and recommendations in the Combined Code and
the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules and associated guidance;
• oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures
throughout the Company;
• ensure that all provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration
including pensions, as set out in the relevant provisions of the
Companies Act 1985 and the Combined Code, are fulfilled;
• be exclusively responsible for establishing the selection criteria,
selecting, appointing and setting the terms of reference for
any remuneration consultants who advise the Committee; and
• consider any other matters as referred to the Committee by
the Board. REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)
50 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007
The Committee will not determine any matters reserved for the Board.
The Committee Chairman attends the Annual General Meeting and is
available to answer questions from shareholders on remuneration matters.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Group’s
website or from the Company Secretary.
Committee performance evaluation
As detailed in the Corporate governance report on page 45, Committee
performance is reviewed annually both by the Board as a whole and by
the Committee itself, with the emphasis on continued improvement
and effectiveness.
Advice
The Committee takes advice, as appropriate, from independent
remuneration advisers. During the year a comprehensive review of
the principal adviser to the Committee was undertaken the result of
which was that Deloitte & Touche LLP was appointed with effect from
23 October 2006, taking over from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
who had been in place since 2002.
During the year advice was received from the following:
• Deloitte & Touche LLP who were the principal source of external
advice to the Committee on issues relating to the review of
remuneration arrangements for the executive directors. In addition,
the tax department of Deloitte & Touche LLP undertook tax
compliance work for certain members of the Executive Leadership
Team and also provided advice in relation to some corporate
tax matters;
• Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in their capacity as lawyers to the
Company; and
• in addition, the Committee took advice internally from the Chief
Executive, the SVP Human Resources and the Head of Executive
Programmes.
Deloitte & Touche LLP was appointed by the Committee and the terms
of reference of their appointment are available on the Group’s website
or from the Company Secretary.
Compliance
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to
the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 (DRRR 2002)). It also describes how the
principles set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
issued by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 (the Code) have
been applied in relation to remuneration for the current and
forthcoming financial years.
The information in the report subject to audit pursuant to the DRRR
2002 is that included in the tables and related notes in the sections
relating to directors’ remuneration, directors’ interests (over shares
and all share incentive plans) and directors’ pension entitlements.
Remuneration Policy Review
To take account of the current stage of development of the Company
and of its strategic plan, the Committee has recently undertaken a
comprehensive review of remuneration policy for executive directors
and senior executives. This reflects that the Company has been
successfully refinanced earlier than expected and has made significant
progress with other elements in its turnaround. It was therefore
considered important that the reward structure was reviewed in the
light of these strategic factors and also specifically to take account
of increasing pressures experienced in recruiting and retaining senior
executives particularly in our North American markets.
As a result of this review, the Committee has concluded that the
following main changes should be made to executive directors’
remuneration policy (which will also be applied, with some
modifications, to members of the Executive Leadership Team):
(a) the annual incentive arrangements should be revised, by
(i) removing, one year early, the Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan
(the TBOP), created in 2005/06;
(ii) making changes to the level of annual bonus that can be
earned for target and maximum levels of performance; and
(iii) requiring bonus earned in excess of target to be deferred into
shares payable after three years;
(b) the current Long Term Incentive Plan (which expires next year in
any event) should be replaced; and
(c) in addition, a special one-off long term incentive award should be
made to the Chief Executive.
Items (b) and (c) above require the approval of shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting, and full information is set out in the Notice
of Annual General Meeting.
These elements are described in more detail below.
Annual Incentive Arrangements
For 2006/07, the annual incentive arrangements provided for the
amount of bonus to be paid to each executive director to be
determined by reference to the satisfaction of financial targets set by
the Committee. The maximum bonus payable to an executive director
(under the Annual Bonus Plan and TBOP) was equal to 200% of base
salary. Under the two plans, 5% of base salary was payable for threshold
performance (i.e. the minimum level of performance required for any
bonus to be payable); 50% of base salary at target level, and up to
200% of base salary was payable (in cash and deferred shares) at
stretch levels (i.e. the maximum level of performance required).
Whilst the TBOP could have been operated in 2007/08, the Committee
concluded that, to reflect the changing status of the Company as set
out more fully in the Chairman’s Statement, the annual incentive
arrangements going forward should reflect a lower overall incentive
opportunity, but with performance targets at the maximum level being
commensurately more achievable. Additionally, and to address
recruitment and retention issues for our wider Executive Leadership
Team (particularly in our North American markets), it was decided to
increase the level of bonus that may be earned for performance at
target level as a percentage of the maximum bonus achievable. The
Committee also felt that it was important to retain the clear link to
shareholder interests and longer term performance of the Company
by continuing to have a part of the annual incentive paid in shares.
Therefore, for 2007/08 the maximum bonus that can be paid to an
executive director will be 150% of base salary if maximum performance
is achieved. At threshold performance, 10% of base salary will be
payable, and 100% of base salary will be payable for performance at
target level. Any bonus earned in excess of the target level will be paid
in shares, which will only be transferred at the end of a three year
period. These deferred shares will only be forfeited if the participant
is dismissed for cause.
For participants who are not executive directors, the maximum level
of bonus will be set according to relevant benchmarks and the deferral
period for any part paid in shares will be two years.
Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan
It was originally anticipated that the TBOP created in 2005/06 would
be operated up to and including 2007/08. However, as a result of the
changes being made to the annual incentive arrangements for 2007/08
onwards (as described above), the TBOP will cease to be operated one
year early. Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 51
Long Term Incentive Arrangements
For awards made during 2005/06 and 2006/07 under the 1998 Senior
Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (1998 LTIP), vesting is conditional
on the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a basket
of 12 global comparators over a three year performance period, and
meeting specific ‘underpin’ targets. 25% of an award vests for median
performance with full vesting requiring upper decile performance.
50% of vested shares are released at the end of the performance
period and the remainder after one year, subject to continued
employment. The usual annual award level for executive directors
was 200% of base salary per annum.
As part of the remuneration review, the Committee determined
that a number of changes should be made to long term incentive
arrangements, to reflect better Invensys’ status as it moves from
being a company in turnaround to a more stable company; to provide
greater flexibility for the future; and to address recruitment and
retention issues, again with particular emphasis on our North American
markets. Additionally, it was decided that the performance measures
should be amended so as to reflect financial measures as well as
relative returns to shareholders.
Given that no further awards can be granted under the 1998 LTIP after
July 2008, it has been decided that a new share-based long term
incentive plan, to be known as the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan
(2007 LTIP), should be established. Implementation of the 2007 LTIP is
subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
For executive directors and other participants, the usual maximum
annual award level will remain at 200% of base salary, with 25% of
an award vesting for threshold performance and 100% vesting for
maximum performance.
Vested awards will be released after three years, and will be subject
to two independent performance conditions. For 50% of an award,
vesting will be based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the
constituent companies of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital
Goods Index; and for the remaining 50% of the award vesting will be
based on the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the Company’s
Earnings Per Share (EPS). Vested awards will include an additional
number of shares representing the value of any dividends that would
have been paid on those vested shares had they been held throughout
the vesting period.
The Committee will in all cases retain discretion to ensure that, as a
condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance
of the Company has been satisfactory.
To reflect increasing competitive market pressure particularly in North
America, for all participants who are not executive directors,
performance conditions will not apply to 30% of an award.
Further information on the 2007 LTIP is set out below and in the
Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Chief Executive’s Long Term Incentive Arrangements
For 2006/07 and recent years, the Chief Executive (Mr Henriksson) has
participated in the 1998 LTIP. For 2007/08 and subsequently, he will be
entitled to participate in the 2007 LTIP. However, after careful
consideration (including a specific review of companies that have
undertaken similarly challenging business turnarounds), and thorough
consultation with major shareholders and shareholder representative
bodies, the Committee has concluded that Mr Henriksson should be
granted (subject to shareholder approval) a special one-off long term
incentive award, to be known as the 2007 CEO Special Award (Special
Award), in addition to his normal annual award under the proposed
2007 LTIP.
The Company has made good progress over the past two years, and
achieved a major and successful refinancing sooner than anticipated.
This success is attributable to the hard work of all of our people but
most particularly to the leadership and skills of Mr Henriksson. Given
the significant number of new recruits amongst the Chief Executive’s
direct reports, there are two main reasons why the Committee feels
it is appropriate to make this one-off special award to the Chief
Executive now.
First, in the context of this renewed Executive Leadership Team, it is
desirable that the services of Mr Henriksson be retained throughout
the next crucial years of Invensys’ development. The Board is firmly
of the view that Mr Henriksson is ideally qualified to lead the
Company through this phase and to deliver our strategy and grow
shareholder value.
Secondly, the market for proven talent has changed dramatically over
the recent past with the rise of private equity and major public to
private transactions. Given Mr Henriksson’s successful track record at
Invensys, the Committee is of the view that it is necessary to make this
one-off retention award, the receipt of which is linked to highly
stretching targets, to ensure that Mr Henriksson remains committed
to the Company during the next critical phase of our development.
In addition to the normal annual LTIP Award of 200% of base salary,
the Special Award will entitle Mr Henriksson to shares having a value
at the date of grant of £5,250,000, being 700% of Mr Henriksson’s
2007/08 base salary (£750,000). The Special Award will normally vest
following the end of a three year performance period ending March
2010 provided that Mr Henriksson remains employed in the Group
throughout the performance period and to the extent that the
performance conditions are satisfied. 50% of the shares will be released
to Mr Henriksson as soon as practicable following the end of the
performance period, with the balance being released as soon as
practicable after a further 12 months. Prior to their release, shares
will be forfeited if Mr Henriksson resigns or is dismissed for cause.
The performance conditions which apply to the Special Award will also
be based on growth in the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent
companies of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index
and on the compound annual growth rate in the Company’s EPS, over
the performance period. Shares released will include an additional
number of shares representing the value of any dividends that would
have been paid on those released shares had they been held throughout
the vesting/holding periods. Further details are set out on page 55 and in
the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
The Committee will in all cases retain discretion to ensure that, as a
condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance
of the Company has been satisfactory.
In conjunction with the introduction of the Special Award, the Chief
Executive will build up to an increased level of shareholding of 300%
of base salary. This increased requirement will continue to apply until
May 2010. Thereafter, the normal 200% of base salary under the Share
Ownership Guidelines will apply. Remuneration policy for executive directors

Guidelines (SOG)
• To align the interests of
executive directors and other
senior executives with those
of shareholders
• Executive directors required
to build and maintain a
shareholding of 200% of base
salary
• A more stringent shareholding
requirement applies to the
Chief Executive until May 2010
• Executive directors are expected to retain shares (net of
taxes) acquired through the vesting of shares under the
Group’s share incentive plans until the target holding is
achieved. Existing shareholdings and shares acquired in
the market are also taken into account
• Exceptionally, in conjunction with the Special Award an
increased shareholding requirement of 300% of base
salary will apply to the Chief Executive until May 2010
Service contracts • To provide suitable protection
to both the executives and
the Company
• Notice periods not to exceed
12 months (except, where
necessary, for a transitional
period on joining)
• To provide for mitigation
and/or phasing of any
payment
• The Chief Executive’s and CFO’s contract provide for
12 months’ notice. The Chief Executive’s contract permits
any termination payment to be made on a phased basis
More detailed individual elements of the remuneration package that
will apply in 2007/08 are set out below. The Committee considers that
these constitute an appropriate balance between fixed and variable
remuneration.
Base salary
The Committee determines the level of base salary for each executive
director annually. For 2007/08, base salaries are set within a market
competitive range based on analysis of salaries paid in FTSE350
companies taking account of the relative complexity and size of the
index constituents. The Committee additionally take into account
salaries in relevant comparator companies and groups of companies;
specific factors relating to the individual (including personal
performance); internal relativities; wage inflation elsewhere in the
Group; and overall affordability. In establishing individual salary levels,
the Committee is conscious that it should pay no more than is
necessary to retain the executive whilst ensuring business objectives
are fulfilled. There is no automatic adjustment in respect of inflation.
Taking account of the factors above, with effect from 1 April 2007,
the Chief Executive’s base salary is £750,000 (2006: £668,000) and the
CFO’s base salary is £430,000 (2006: £400,000). The Committee
considers these base salary levels are necessary and appropriate to
meet its objective of retaining the executive directors and maintaining
competitive pay levels.
The next review date for base salaries will be 1 April 2008.
Annual bonus
Bonuses are paid under the Annual Bonus Plan which provides short-
term incentives for the executive directors in order to encourage the
achievement of defined annual financial objectives and focus on the
most important measures of business success, whilst rewarding them
for outstanding performance. In this way, the Annual Bonus Plan seeks
to align the interests of shareholders and those participating in it.
In respect of 2006/07, targets related to Group free cash flow before
legacy items (calculated on a per share basis) accounting for 40%,
operating profit before interest and tax also accounting for 40% and
revenue accounting for 20%. For 2007/08 the targets relate to Group
free cash flow after legacy items (calculated on a per share basis)
accounting for 40%, EPS accounting for 40% and revenue accounting
for 20%. Bonus payments are also influenced, through exercise of
discretion by the Committee, by the achievement of personal objectives.
The Committee considers these measures of performance are
appropriate to support continued delivery of the Group’s strategy.
For executive directors and certain nominated senior leaders the pay-
out levels for the plan for 2007/08 are capped at 150% of base salary
for maximum performance, with 100% of salary payable for on target
performance. Below this level, lower pay-out rates are set. Any bonus
earned in excess of target will be paid in deferred shares, which will only
be forfeitable in the event of dismissal for cause, as described above.
Each year, the Committee sets out in its Remuneration report the
basis on which bonuses have been paid in relation to the targets set
at the beginning of the financial year under review. This ensures that
shareholders are able to assess the bonus targets and the link between
bonuses payable and the performance of the business.
The bonuses paid to the executive directors in relation to the year
under review are set out on page 57. In line with the Annual Bonus
Plan rules, the salary used for bonus calculation purposes is the salary
effective from 1 July 2006. In respect of 2006/07 actual performance
against the revenue target was close to the stretch performance
level and against the other two targets was in excess of the agreed
stretch level.
Having rigorously reviewed the results achieved against the
performance targets set for 2006/07 the Committee is satisfied that
the targets it set upfront were challenging and that the bonuses
awarded were earned by actual performance that was demonstrably
exceptional. REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)
54 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007
Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan (TBOP)
On a transitional basis, the Committee introduced the TBOP in
2005/06, and anticipated it would be operated up to and including the
financial year 2007/08. The TBOP was subject to the same performance
targets as the Annual Bonus Plan but only commenced payment where
an above target level of performance was achieved. At target, no
payment was due with the potential bonus increasing, on a straight-line
basis, to 100% of salary if the maximum bonus was earned under the
Annual Bonus Plan.
To align the interests of executive directors and shareholders, any
bonuses earned under the TBOP are payable in shares with 50% of the
shares awarded being released following the first anniversary of those
shares being awarded and the other 50% being released following
the second anniversary. Release of the shares is generally subject to
continued employment at the relevant date although shares may be
released early in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of
the Committee. Such shares will be subject to the Share Ownership
Guidelines explained further below.
In relation to Mr Henriksson and Mr Hare, bonus performance in
respect of the TBOP for 2006/07 was close to the stretch performance
level against the revenue target and in excess of the agreed stretch
level for the other two targets.
1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan
(1998 LTIP)
In 2006/07, the 1998 LTIP was Invensys’ sole long term incentive.
Under this plan, conditional awards of shares have been granted,
which vest after three years subject to the achievement of performance
conditions. 50% of any shares vesting on completion of the
performance period are to be released at that time with the other 50%
being deferred for one year (subject to the same good leaver rules as
the TBOP). Subject to shareholder approval of the introduction of the
2007 LTIP at the Annual General Meeting, the Committee does not
intend to make any further awards under the 1998 LTIP in 2007/08
and subsequently.
Awards granted in July 2005 and 2006 are based on three year TSR
relative to a bespoke comparator group of international industrial
companies including major competitors which each compete in at
least one or other of the Group’s core markets. The companies
that comprise the comparator group are ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE,
Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, Schneider,
Siemens, Smiths Group and Yokogawa.
25% of an award vests for median performance rising, on a straight-line
basis, to 100% of an award vesting for upper decile performance.
The performance conditions attaching to previous awards are detailed
in the Notes to the table on page 59; these conditions were selected by
the Committee at the time of grant as they were considered
challenging and appropriate to the strategy and scale of the Company
at that time.
The 1998 LTIP generally operates within an individual limit of 200% of
base salary and award levels for 2006/07 were made within this limit.
2007 Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP)
As noted above, subject to shareholder approval, the Company intends
to introduce the 2007 LTIP at the Annual General Meeting, and make
awards in 2007/08 and thereafter. Full details of the 2007 LTIP are set
out in the appendix to the Chairman’s explanatory letter and Notice of
Annual General Meeting. The key points are as follows:
The maximum annual award level for executive directors will be 200%
of base salary (although the Committee will have discretion to make
awards in excess of this level in specific and exceptional circumstances,
for example on recruitment). Vesting of awards will be based on
meeting stretching performance targets over a three year performance
period, and subject to meeting all relevant conditions shares will
normally be released to participants as soon as possible following the
third anniversary of the award. The satisfaction of all performance
targets will be subject to external verification.
For 50% of an award, the performance measure will be relative TSR
performance measured against that of the constituents of the Standard
& Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index. This measure was chosen to
provide a focus on delivering high levels of returns to shareholders.
The Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index was selected
as the comparator group because its constituents represent a wide
grouping of over 100 companies that have businesses that are, in
whole or in part, similar to or in competition with some or all of those
operated by Invensys, and cover a wide geographic range including
the America’s, Europe and Asia Pacific.
25% of the TSR part of an award will vest for performance equal to the
unweighted mean of the index constituents, excluding outliers. The
calculation will not be weighted by reference to market capitalisation
of index constituents to avoid any single large company unduly
influencing the results. For similar reasons, an equal number of outliers
at the top and bottom of the TSR range will be excluded.
100% of the TSR part of an award will vest for out performance of the
mean of index constituents (excluding outliers) equivalent to upper
quartile performance. For 2007/08 awards this has been calculated by
the Committee’s remuneration advisers as out performance by a factor
of 1.3 (i.e. 30%) over the three year performance period.
For awards made in 2007/08, the TSR performance period for the
Company and each constituent of the index will be based on the nine
month average to 31 March 2010 compared to the nine month average
to 31 March 2007. This period was chosen to include the 2006
Refinancing of the Company in the base period.
For the remaining 50% of an award, the performance target will be the
CAGR in EPS. This measure was chosen to provide a focus on delivering
financial returns.
25% of the EPS part of an award will vest for EPS CAGR of 20%. 100%
of the EPS part of an award will vest for EPS CAGR of 42.5%. EPS growth
will be measured from 2006/07 actual numbers, and the Committee
will have discretion to exclude from the calculation matters such as
one-off items of a non-recurring nature, to ensure that the focus is
on underlying growth in EPS.
The Committee will in all cases retain discretion to ensure that, as a
condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance
of the Company has been satisfactory. For the TSR part of the award,
factors that will be taken into account will include EPS growth and the
Group’s cash position. Vested awards will include an additional number
of shares representing the value of any dividends that would have
been paid on those vested shares had they been held throughout the
vesting period.
As noted, the performance conditions will not apply to 30% of
an award for executive participants below Board level. This is to
address specific recruitment and retention issues facing the Group,
particularly in terms of its senior leaders located in its North
American markets.
If a participant resigns or is dismissed for cause before shares are
released, they will be forfeited. If their employment ceases due to
ill health or disability, performance will be measured at the normal
vesting date and the award will then be pro rated based on
the period of service save that the Committee may moderate the
application of the pro rata reduction if it considers that the
participant’s contribution to the business would not be properly
recognised if the award was scaled down. The Committee will have
discretion to accelerate vesting in compassionate circumstances. Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 55
In the event of a change of control in the performance period,
performance will be measured at the latest possible date before
the change of control to assess the proportion vesting based on
performance. The proportion of the award that may be released
will then be time pro rated.
The Committee will have discretion to disapply the impact of time
pro rating and to permit up to 100% of awards to vest on a change of
control if, due to exceptional business circumstances to be assessed by
them, returns to shareholders are considered to be at a superior level.
2007 CEO Special Award (Special Award)
As noted above, the Committee believes it is appropriate to make a
one-off award of shares with a value of 700% of base salary to the
Chief Executive in 2007/08 (subject to shareholder approval) in
addition to the award under the 2007 LTIP of 200% of base salary.
The performance measures applying to the Special Award will reflect
those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being more
demanding, as described below. Additionally, the Special Award will
be split into two layers, each of which will vest on a different basis.
For the first layer being 200% of base salary, 20% of the Special Award
will vest for threshold performance, and 100% for maximum
performance. For the second layer, being the balance of 500% of base
salary, 0% of the Special Award will vest for threshold performance,
and 100% for maximum performance. Vesting in each layer will be
on a straight-line basis between these points.
For each layer of the Special Award 50% will vest based on TSR and
50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP. However, for the
TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting will require more
stretching performance equivalent to upper quintile. This has been
calculated by the Committee’s remuneration advisers as out performance
of the mean of the Standard & Poor’s Global 1200 Capital Goods Index
constituents by a factor of 1.4 (i.e. 40%). The calculation of TSR will
follow that as described for the 2007 LTIP. Vesting can be summarised
as follows:
EPS part of TSR part of
Special Award (50%) Special Award (50%)
Target for EPS CAGR of 20% Performance equal to
threshold vesting mean of Index constituents
(excluding outliers)
Target for EPS CAGR of 42.5% Equivalent to upper quintile
maximum vesting (out performance of mean
of Index constituents
(excluding outliers) by
factor of 1.4 i.e. 40%)
Performance will be measured over a three year period ending
31 March 2010 (as for the 2007 LTIP). 50% of vested shares will be
released at the end of the performance period (or as soon as
practicable thereafter) and the balance of 50% will be released after
a 12 month holding period. Shares released will include an additional
number of shares representing the value of any dividends that would
have been paid on those released shares had they been held
throughout the vesting/holding periods.
The Committee will in all cases retain discretion to ensure that as a
condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance
of the Company has been satisfactory. In the case of the TSR part of
the award, factors that will be taken into account will include EPS
growth and the Company’s cash position.
If Mr Henriksson resigns or is dismissed for cause before shares are
released, they will be forfeited. If his employment ceases due to ill health,
or disability, performance will be measured at the normal vesting date
and the award will then be pro rated based on the period of service save
that the Committee may moderate the application of the pro rata
reduction if it considers that Mr Henriksson’s contribution to the business
would otherwise not be properly recognised. The Committee will have
discretion to accelerate vesting in compassionate circumstances.
In the event of a change of control in the performance period,
performance will be measured at the latest possible date before the
change of control to assess the proportion vesting based on
performance. The proportion of the award that may be released will
then be time pro rated.
In the event of a change of control in the holding period, all vested
shares will be released.
The Committee will have discretion to disapply the impact of time
pro rating and to permit up to 100% of awards to vest on a change of
control if, due to exceptional business circumstances to be assessed by
them, returns to shareholders are considered to be at a superior level.
An increased level of shareholding over and above that set out under
the Share Ownership Guidelines will apply until May 2010.
Other share schemes
In addition to the 1998 LTIP, the Company has in the past operated its
Executive Share Option Scheme and has received shareholder approval
for a deferred bonus plan. However the Company does not propose
using these plans in relation to executive directors.
The Company also operates a Savings Related Share Option
Scheme in the UK and Overseas although no invitations have been
made under this Scheme in the last two years. The Scheme enables
employees to purchase shares in the Company at a favourable price,
using the proceeds of a savings account to which they make monthly
contributions for a three, five or seven year period. Executive
directors are eligible to participate in this Scheme, which operates
in the UK within specific tax legislation and is therefore not subject
to performance conditions. In 2007/08 a business review will be
conducted to determine whether the Company will offer new
invitations under this Scheme.
Dilution limits
The Company has, at all times, complied with the dilution limits
contained within its share plans (principally a limit of 10% in 10 years)
and the Committee reviews the position before any proposed grants
to ensure that this remains the position. Awards granted in 2007/08
under the 2007 LTIP and Special Award will, when aggregated with the
current potential of approximately 2.77% under subsisting awards, be
within the Company’s limit of 10% in any 10 year period. Shares to
satisfy the TBOP and the part of annual incentive paid in shares will
be purchased in the market.
Pension
The Chief Executive received a pension allowance in place of
membership of the Invensys Pension Scheme.
The CFO also received a pension allowance all of which was paid as
contributions to a pension scheme.
The former CFO, Mr Hennah, chose to cease membership of the
Invensys Pension Scheme with effect from 31 March 2006 and elected
to receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension entitlement effective
1 April 2006. Mr Hennah’s accrued pension at year ended 31 March
2007 was £36,641 per annum and further details are set out in the
table on page 59.
Other benefits
Other benefits provided for executive directors comprise the provision
of a company car or cash allowance in place of a company car, the use
of a pool car, typical life assurance/permanent health insurance benefits
and healthcare and a specific immigration expense relating to the
Chief Executive. Share Ownership Guidelines (SOGs)
The SOGs, requiring executives to build up and maintain a shareholding
over time, were introduced in 2004/05. Under the current SOGs,
executives were required to build up and maintain shareholdings using,
except as required to meet their tax obligations, the entire share
element of the entitlements vesting under the TBOP and 1998 LTIP and
other share awards until the minimum holding had been reached.
To reflect the fact that the TBOP is being discontinued with effect
from 2007/08 and to help to address specific recruitment issues, the
Committee has agreed that the SOGs will be changed with effect
from 2007/08 such that, except as required to meet tax obligations,
executives will only have to retain at least 50% of the shares (100%
of shares for executive directors) which vest under the 1998 LTIP and
2007 LTIP and following vesting of awards under all share incentive
plans or the payment of annual incentives in shares, until the minimum
level of shareholding is achieved.
The following new requirements as to the minimum level of retention
will apply:
• Executive directors – 200% of base salary
• Business presidents – 50% of base salary
• Other participants – 25% of base salary
As noted above, a further requirement applies to the Chief Executive
to retain shares over and above these levels until May 2010.
Service contracts
(i) Policy
The Combined Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors
recommend that notice periods of no more than one year be set as an
objective for executive directors and that any payments to a departing
executive director should be determined having full regard to the duty
of mitigation. It is the Company’s policy to achieve these objectives,
wherever possible.
(ii) Specific contracts
Set out below is a summary of the main provisions of the service
contracts of those executive directors who served during the year.
All of the contracts are expressed to terminate automatically on the
executive director’s 60th birthday unless otherwise stated.
Ulf Henriksson
Mr Henriksson is employed under a service contract with the Company
dated 28 April 2004 which can be terminated by either party giving
the other not less than 12 months’ written notice and, at the Company’s
option, the choice of pay in lieu of notice or phased payment (the
Company may elect to pay the amount due in lieu of notice as a single
lump sum or pay the first six months’ worth on departure and then on
a phased basis at six-monthly intervals with appropriate reduction in
the event that he finds alternative employment).
Steve Hare
Mr Hare is employed under a service contract with the Company dated
20 April 2006 as from 21 July 2006 which will terminate automatically
on his 70th birthday. The contract can be terminated by either party
giving the other not less than 12 months’ written notice. The Company
may elect to pay a sum in lieu of notice equal to the basic salary which
Mr Hare would have been entitled to receive under his service contract
during the notice period if notice had been given, and the cost to the
Company of the benefits provided to him which he would have been
entitled to receive during the remainder of the notice period.
Alternatively, the Company may continue to provide such benefits
during that period.
Mr Hare received a one-off payment of £50,000 on joining the
Company to cover transitional costs and relocation as agreed by the
Committee.
Adrian Hennah
Mr Hennah was employed under a service contract with the Company
dated 29 July 2002 (and amended on 19 May 2004). Mr Hennah
stood down as CFO and resigned from the Board on 16 June 2006.
No compensation was paid to Mr Hennah on termination.
(iii) Changes to service contracts
The Committee has approved changes to Messrs Henriksson’s and
Hare’s service contracts entitling them, in the event of a material
adverse change to their title, responsibilities or status following a
change of control of the Company to terminate their employment and
receive a payment equal to the termination payment set out above.
Non-executive directors
The Chairman and other non-executive directors do not have service
contracts or contracts for services save that Mr Jay’s letter of
appointment dated 28 May 2003 requires, except in the case of
dismissal for cause, 12 months’ notice by either party; on early
termination at the request of the Company any compensation will be
subject to mitigation. They are appointed under the Company’s Articles
of Association, under which they are required to seek re-election not
later than the third Annual General Meeting following their last
election and are subject to review by the Nominating Committee prior
to being considered for election or re-election by shareholders and
serve the Company under appointment letters that do not contain any
notice period. They do not participate in any bonus plan or any of the
Group’s share incentive, option or pension schemes.
Fees for non-executive directors other than the Chairman are
determined by a committee of the Board comprising the Chairman and
the executive directors. Fee levels are determined taking account of
time commitments and responsibilities, together with comparative
market rates and benchmarking data. Non-executives do not receive
any form of performance-related pay. The Committee is responsible for
reviewing the Chairman’s fees. The Chairman is not involved in any
decision on his own remuneration. The fees currently paid to the
Chairman and the other non-executive directors are subject to the
limits set in the Articles of Association. The Chairman’s fee was set on
appointment at £250,000 per annum. With effect from 1 April 2006
the non-executive director fee structure was changed. The previous
fee arrangement was set in 1999 and, based on benchmarking data,
the Chairman and executive directors determined that this was not
competitive against companies of comparable size and complexity.
The new fee structure is a basic fee of £50,000 per annum (with £8,000
to be paid in shares). The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
receives an additional £8,000 per annum and the Chairman of the
Audit Committee receives an additional £10,000 per annum. The fees
of each non-executive director for the year are set out in the
remuneration table on page 57.
External directorships
The executive directors are encouraged to hold not more than one
external non-executive directorship in order to broaden their
experience for the benefit of the Company. Such appointments are
subject to approval by the Board and the director may retain any fees
paid in respect of such directorship; there are no fees to disclose for
the year under review. Mr Henriksson joined the board of Hexagon AB
as a non-executive director with effect from 2 May 2007.
Performance graph
Companies are required under the DRRR 2002 to include a graph
indicating their total shareholder return performance (that is, share
price growth assuming reinvestment of any dividends) over the last
five years relative to a recognised equity index. Accordingly, the left
hand graph shows the Company’s performance relative to the
FTSE250, which the Committee considers an appropriate index
for comparison purposes as the Company had been a constituent
during most of that period.

Notes
1. The emoluments of the highest paid director, Mr Henriksson, excluding pension rights were £1,562,738 (2006: £1,499,581 paid to Mr Henriksson).
2. Mr Hare was appointed as a director of the Company on 21 July 2006 and therefore his emoluments for 2007 relate to the period from 21 July 2006 to 31 March 2007.
3. The other payments figure of £50,000 paid to Mr Hare relates to a one-off payment on joining the Company to cover transitional costs and relocation.
4. In addition to the annual cash bonus amount for the year, Mr Henriksson and Mr Hare will be awarded £648,294 and £269,252 respectively in the form of shares under the
TBOP in respect of the bonus due to them for 2006/07. The TBOP awards will not be made until 1 June 2007 and therefore the number of shares to which Mr Henriksson and
Mr Hare will be entitled will not be known until that date. Under the TBOP 50% of the shares under award will, subject to continued employment, be released after the first
anniversary of the date of grant with the other 50% being released after the second anniversary.
5. Mr Hare was entitled to a pension allowance of £83,333 and elected for this amount to be paid to a pension scheme.
6. Mr Henriksson’s salary for the year under review was £600,000, rising to £668,000 with effect from 1 June 2006.
7. As detailed on page 56, with effect from 1 April 2006, the fee structure for the non-executive directors includes £8,000 per annum which, after tax, is invested in shares.
These amounts are included in the above emoluments table. These purchases are normally made on a quarterly basis or in the case of Mr Farmer and Mr Macfarlane a
pro rata amount was purchased for them for the period since the last quarter end to 3 August 2006. During the year the following purchases were made for non-executive
directors: Mr Farmer 783 shares, Mr Green 2,317 shares, Mr Guez 2,600 shares, Mr Macfarlane 589 shares and Mr Parker 1,639 shares. Each non-executive director has
committed to retain these shares for the period of their directorship.
8. Mr Parker was appointed to the Board of directors on 24 May 2006 and therefore his fees for 2007 relate to the period from 24 May 2006 to 31 March 2007.
9. Mr Farmer and Mr Macfarlane retired as directors of the Company on 3 August 2006 and therefore their remuneration relates to the period 1 April 2006 to 3 August 2006.
10. Mr Hennah resigned as a director of the Company on 16 June 2006 and therefore his emoluments relate to the period from 1 April 2006 to 16 June 2006. No compensation
was paid to Mr Hennah on termination. However, as disclosed in the 2006 Remuneration report the Committee exercised its discretion and agreed to make a bonus of
£75,000 to Mr Hennah in June 2007 subject to the successful completion of personal objectives during the period of his 2006/07 employment.
11. The aggregate emoluments of all directors for the year ended 31 March 2007 were £2,913,602 (2006: £3,640,213). Directors’ interests

Notes
1. As a consequence of the 2006 Rights issue and Share consolidation the above options and awards have, in accordance with the rules of the respective schemes, been
adjusted. For the Rights issue adjustment (effective 15 June 2006) the number of shares comprised in each option/award was multiplied by a factor of 1.07058; option
exercise prices were multiplied by a factor of 0.93406; and fractions of ordinary shares were disregarded. For the Share consolidation adjustment (effective 7 August 2006)
the number of shares comprised in each option/award was divided by 10; option exercise prices were multiplied by 10; and fractions of ordinary shares were disregarded.
2. No options were exercised by or shares released under any share schemes to directors during the years ended 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2007, except the release of
2,000,000 shares under the restricted share award granted to Mr Henriksson which vested on 25 May 2006.
3. There have been no changes in the interests of directors over share options or awards between 31 March 2007 and 23 May 2007.
4. The details of the share schemes, including performance conditions which apply (if any), are set out in the following notes.
5. The exercise of the option and release of the restricted shares granted to Mr Henriksson is contingent on continued employment until the relevant date or, at the discretion
of the Committee, leaving in certain compassionate circumstances. The restricted shares must be retained until the second anniversary of their vesting except as necessary to
meet tax liabilities. Like the awards they replaced at his former employer, the option and restricted shares are not subject to performance conditions. Under the terms on
which the restricted share award was made, the first two million shares were expressed to vest on 21 November 2005, subject to an obligation to retain the shares (except
any necessary sale to meet tax liabilities) until 20 November 2007. Following a delay in effecting the vesting and a subsequent dealing prohibition which prevented the vesting
of these shares, the award vested on 25 May 2006 but remains subject to the original retention obligation stated above and the shares were delivered to him on 9 June 2006.
The market price of an Invensys plc share on the date of grant of 1 June 2004 was 149.45p (adjusted for the Rights issue and Share consolidation) and the price on the
vesting date of 25 May 2006 was 200.82p (adjusted for the Rights issue and Share consolidation). Also under the terms on which the restricted share award was made, the
second tranche was expressed to vest on 21 May 2007; as the Company was prohibited from satisfying the award on that date it is anticipated that the award will vest on
24 May 2007 and Mr Henriksson will remain subject to an obligation to retain the shares (except any necessary sale to meet tax liabilities) until 20 May 2009.
6. The executive share option granted to Mr Hennah on 4 December 2002 was granted under the Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme. This option would
normally be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant provided that the relevant performance condition was met. The performance
condition which applied was TSR calculated as the percentage variance in the price of shares and the value of reinvested net dividend payments over the performance period
compared to that of a group of comparator companies (Peer Group) comprising the FTSE100 Index on the dealing day preceding the date of grant. The performance period
was the period of three, four or five years commencing on the date of grant, 4 December 2002. Mr Hennah’s option lapsed with effect from cessation of employment on 16
June 2006.
7. The Sharesave options were granted under the Invensys Savings Related Share Option Scheme. These options are not subject to a performance condition as this is an
all-employee share scheme governed by specific tax legislation. Mr Hennah’s option lapsed with effect from cessation of employment on 16 June 2006.
8. The LTIP awards granted under the Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan are normally subject to a three year performance period, commencing on
the date of award, followed by a retention period. For awards granted prior to 2005 the retention period was two years; for awards made on or after 22 July 2005 50% of
any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements will be released at the end of the performance period with release of the other 50% being deferred for
one year. The following performance requirements apply:
TSR test: TSR ranked against a Peer Group, selected at the discretion of the Committee (with no re-testing opportunities). TSR must rank at the median position (when the
Peer Group is ranked in descending order of TSR) in order for 25% of the shares subject to the award to be available (subject to the retention period), rising to 100% of the
shares if the upper decile position is achieved. Between these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis. If at least median position is not
achieved the whole award will lapse. The Peer Groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows:
• awards granted on 20 June 2003 and 24 June 2004: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of grant; and
• awards granted on 22 July 2005, 1 June 2006 and 11 August 2006: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, Schneider, Siemens,
Smiths Group and Yokogawa.
Overall performance test: (a) awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained delivery over the performance period,
regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds and reduction in Group indebtedness; (b) for awards granted on 22 July 2005 that two
underpins have been met: (i) achievement of stretching internal free cash flow targets; and (ii) efficient management of legacy liability items; and (c) for awards granted on
or after 1 June 2006 that two underpin tests have been met (i) relating to the successful completion of the 2006 Refinancing and in addition that there has been a sustained
improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company and (ii) efficient management of legacy liability items.
9. The mid-market price of an ordinary share on 1 June 2006 and 11 August 2006, the date of grant of the LTIP awards granted to Mr Henriksson and Mr Hare during the year
respectively, was 217.17p (adjusted for the Rights issue and Share consolidation) and 166.75p. The awards were granted on the basis of 2 x salary at the date of grant divided
by an average of the Invensys plc mid-market share price for the four business days preceeding the date of grant, being 208.14p (adjusted for the Rights issue and Share
consolidation) and 173.31p respectively.
10. As reported last year, the LTIP award granted to Mr Haythornthwaite on 20 June 2003, who retired from the Board of directors on 21 July 2005, did not lapse on cessation of
employment but was preserved pro rata, and was subject to performance requirements measured over the entire three year performance period.
11. The performance condition attaching to the LTIP award granted on 20 June 2003 was not met and accordingly these awards lapsed on 20 June 2006.
12. The TBOP award was granted to Mr Henriksson on 1 June 2006 in respect of his 2005/06 bonus (based on an average share price over the four days prior to the date of grant
of 208.41p (adjusted for the Rights issue and Share consolidation)) and 50% of the shares will, subject to continued employment, be released after the first anniversary of the
date of grant with the other 50% being released following the second anniversary. Mr Henriksson and Mr Hare will also be granted TBOP awards of £648,294 and £269,252
respectively in the form of shares under the TBOP on 1 June 2007. These awards will be granted in respect of Mr Henriksson’s and Mr Hare’s 2006/07 bonus.
Pension entitlements
The following table gives details of Mr Hennah’s pension values for the year ended 31 March 2007. Mr Hennah chose to cease membership of the
Invensys Pension Scheme with effect from 31 March 2006. In place of participation in the pension scheme, Mr Hennah elected to receive a salary
supplement of 30% of salary with effect from 1 April 2006 up until he left the Company on 16 June 2006.

Activities and review for the year
The principal activities and review for the year are contained on pages
16 to 43.
Dividends
The directors do not propose a dividend (2006: nil). The Company
currently has a significant deficit on distributable reserves and is
subject to restrictions on payment of dividends under the terms of the
High Yield Bonds. Accordingly, the Company is currently unable to pay
a dividend.
Rights issue
A proposed two for five Rights issue of up to 2,276 million new
ordinary shares at 15p per new ordinary share was announced on
25 May 2006 and subsequently approved at an Extraordinary General
Meeting of the Company held on 14 June 2006. Consequent to the
Rights issue, 2,274,914,324 ordinary shares of 1p each, with an
aggregate nominal value of £23 million, were issued and fully paid
for cash of £342 million on 10 July 2006.
Share consolidation
Consequent to the Share consolidation approved by shareholders on
3 August 2006, the Company’s ordinary shares have been consolidated
on the basis of one new ordinary share of 10p each for every ten
existing ordinary shares of 1p each. Trading in the new ordinary shares
on the London Stock Exchange commenced on 7 August 2006.
The American Depository Receipts ratio has been changed from two
ordinary shares per ADS to one ordinary share per ADS, also effective
7 August 2006. Therefore, the ADSs have been consolidated on the
basis of one new ADS for every five existing ADSs.
Board of directors
The current directors of the Company and their biographical details
are given on page 11. A statement of their remuneration and interests
in the ordinary shares of the Company are set out in the Remuneration
report on pages 49 to 59. Adrian Hennah resigned as Chief Financial
Officer of the Company on 16 June 2006 and Steve Hare joined the
Board as Chief Financial Officer on 21 July 2006. Larry Farmer retired
from the Board at the Annual General Meeting on 3 August 2006 and
was replaced by Michael Parker who joined the Board on 24 May 2006.
Andrew Macfarlane retired by rotation at the 2006 Annual General
Meeting. All other directors served throughout the year.
Ulf Henriksson retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for
re-election at the Annual General Meeting. In addition, Pat Zito joined
the Board as a non-executive director on 23 May 2007. In accordance
with the Articles of Association, he will retire and offer himself for
election at the Annual General Meeting.
Directors’ indemnity and insurance
In accordance with the Articles of Association, the Company has
provided to all the directors an indemnity (to the extent permitted
by Companies Act 1985) in respect of liabilities incurred as a result
of their office, and the Company has taken out an insurance policy in
respect of those liabilities for which directors may not be indemnified.
Neither the indemnity nor insurance provides cover in the event that
the director is proved to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently.
Acquisitions and disposals
During the year the Group made no material acquisitions. The
following disposals have taken place in the year to 31 March 2007:

longer has to notify the Company of changes to its holding of voting rights below
the threshold of 5%. However, the Company has subsequently been informed that
Brandes no longer holds any ordinary shares in the Company, but does hold 27,186
American Depository Receipts.
Supplier payment policy
It is the policy of the Group that subsidiary companies should develop
long-term relationships with suppliers and establish terms of trade
consistent with established practice in their country of operation, and
to ensure that suppliers are aware of the terms of payment and that
such terms are followed. The Company is a holding company and has
no trade creditors.
Employee policy and development
Information concerning employees and their remuneration is given in
Note 6 to the Group financial statements. The Group seeks to ensure
that fair consideration is given to applications for employment
received from disabled persons and to ensure continued employment,
training and advancement where possible of employees who are or
become temporarily or permanently disabled.
The Group recognises the need to consult and provide information on
matters of concern to employees. To satisfy that need, the Company
provides employees with published financial and economic information
through its consultative procedures. Invensys also encourages the
involvement of all employees in the Group’s performance through the
Invensys Performance Management System (IPMS) which reinforces the
links between the Group’s business goals, the employee’s contribution
and his/her remuneration.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT

General information
Group donations to charities and community causes worldwide were
£0.3 million (2006: £0.3 million) with UK charities receiving £0.1 million
(2006: £0.1 million). The Board is of the view that it is not appropriate
for the Company to make charitable donations given the Company is
not paying dividends. However, many of the Group’s subsidiaries are
influential companies and important employers in their own countries
or localities and it is therefore believed to be in the best interests
of the Group for those companies’ community involvement to be
maintained at reasonable levels. No donations were made to political
parties (2006: £nil). The Group carries out research and development
in support of its activities. During the year expenditure on the research
and development of new products and processes amounted to
£89 million (2006: £110 million).
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in
office as auditors and resolutions proposing their re-appointment and
to authorise the directors to determine their remuneration will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Disclosure of information to auditors
In accordance with section 234ZA(2) of the Companies Act 1985, the
directors confirmed, so far as each is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware, and each
director has taken all steps that he ought to have taken as a director in
order to make himself aware of, and to establish that the auditors are
aware of, any relevant information.
Post balance sheet event
Acquisition of Cimnet, Inc.
On 3 May 2007 Invensys plc announced the signing of a definitive
agreement to acquire Cimnet, Inc., a Manufacturing Execution System
software company based in Pennsylvania, US.
Under the terms of the agreement, Invensys has agreed to pay US$2.43
per share, equivalent to approximately US$24 million on a debt/cash
free basis. The agreement has been approved by the Board of Cimnet
and the parties anticipate completion of the transaction within 60 to 90 days.
Completion is subject to certain customary conditions including Cimnet
stockholder approval. Stockholders representing approximately 51% of
Cimnet’s outstanding shares have entered into voting agreements to
support its acquisition by Invensys.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held on Thursday
2 August 2007 at 11am. The separate circular including the Notice of
Annual General Meeting sent to all shareholders gives full details of
the meeting and the resolutions to be proposed.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT
OF THE PREPARATION OF THE ACCOUNTS
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law
and those International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by
the European Union or, in the case of the Company’s financial
statements, UK GAAP.
In relation to the Group financial statements, the directors are
required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which
present fairly the financial position of the Group and its financial
performance and cash flows for that period. In relation to the
Company’s financial statements, the directors are required by law to
prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true
and fair view of the state of the affairs of the Company and its profit
and loss for that period. In preparing the Group and Company
financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific
requirements in applicable accounting standards are insufficient
to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions,
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and
financial performance; and
• state that the Company and the Group have complied with
applicable accounting standards, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and of the Group and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities. The directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. 62 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007

CONTENTS OF THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF
INVENSYS PLC
Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 63
We have audited the Group financial statements (financial statements)
of Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2007 which comprise
the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated balance sheet,
Consolidated cash flow statement, Consolidated statement of
recognised income and expense, Accounting policies, the related
Notes 1 to 35 and the list of Principal subsidiaries as at 31 March 2007.
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Parent company financial
statements of Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2007 and the
information in the Remuneration report that is described as having
been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by
the European Union as set out in the Statement of directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view, the financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation and the information given in the Directors’ report is
consistent with the financial statements. We also report to you if, in
our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures
or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
This other information comprises the Board of directors, the
Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s statement, Business review,
Corporate governance report, Remuneration report, Statement of
directors’ responsibilities, Financial summary, listing of Principal
subsidiaries as at 31 March 2007 and Shareholder information.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatement or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s
affairs as at 31 March 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation;
and
• the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
financial statements.

10 Statement of compliance
The Group’s Consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
as adopted by the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out the policies and
measurement bases that have been applied in preparing the financial
statements for the year ended 31 March 2007. The Consolidated
financial statements are presented in sterling and all amounts are
rounded to the nearest million (£m) unless otherwise indicated.
The Group’s date of transition to IFRSs was 1 April 2004.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated financial statements comprise Invensys plc and
its subsidiaries together with the Group’s share of the results of its
associates for the financial year to 31 March each year. The financial
statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year
as the Parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are
consolidated up to, or from, the date control passes.
The Group’s investments in its associates are accounted for using the
equity method of accounting. An associate is an entity in which the
Group has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a
joint venture. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate
is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in
the Group’s share of net assets of the associate, less any impairment in
value. The income statement reflects the share of the results of
operations of the associate. Where there has been a change recognised
directly in the associate’s equity, the Group recognises its share of any
changes and discloses this, when applicable in the reconciliation of
movements in equity.
The financial statements of the associate are used by the Group to
apply the equity method. The financial statements of associates are
prepared as of the same date as the Group’s financial statements and
use consistent accounting policies.
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase
method. The cost of the business combination is measured as the
fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly
attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date,
irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the
cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the
identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
In accordance with the exemption permitted by IFRS 1, First-time
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, applied by
the Group on transition to IFRSs, business combinations prior to IFRS
transition have not been restated to comply with IFRS 3, Business
Combinations.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the
previous financial year except as follows:
The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRSs and
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
interpretations during the year.
IAS 21 Amendment – The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange
Rates: Net Investment in a Foreign Operation
IAS 39 Amendments – Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement
IFRS 4 Amendment – Financial Guarantee Contracts
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 39 Financial
Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies
Adoption of these standards and interpretations has not had any
material effect on the financial statements of the Group.
The following new and amended IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations that
became effective during the year are currently not applicable to the
Group’s operations:
IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Assets (and
subsequent amendment to IFRS 6 and IFRS 1)
IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning,
Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds
IFRIC 6 Liabilities arising from Participating in a Specific Market –
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are material items of income and expense that
should be separately disclosed to assist in the understanding of the
Group’s financial performance and in making projections of future
results. Such items may be operating or non-operating in nature.
Exceptional items are presented separately on the face of the income
statement and analysed in the Notes to the financial statements.
Foreign currencies
The presentation currency of the Group and functional currency
of Invensys plc is sterling.
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries and
associates are prepared using their functional currency. The functional
currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in
which an entity operates.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates
ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are recognised in the income statement
unless:
a) the monetary assets or liabilities to which they relate form the
hedging instrument in a cash flow hedging relationship that
qualifies for hedge accounting; or
b) the monetary assets or liabilities to which they relate form part
of a net investment in a foreign operation;
in which case they are recognised directly in equity.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date
of the initial transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a foreign
currency are translated at the rates prevailing when the fair value was
determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in
the income statement for the period, except for exchange differences
arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair
value are recognised directly in equity.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
68 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 69
Financial statements of foreign operations
The trading results of overseas subsidiaries and associates are
translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the
year. Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries, including goodwill,
are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. All resulting exchange differences are recognised
directly in a separate component of equity. On disposal of a foreign
operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in equity are
transferred to the Consolidated income statement, as part of the profit
or loss on sale.
Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS
are presented in equity but not as a separate component. Cumulative
translation differences on foreign operations were deemed to be zero
at that date. When the foreign operation is sold, these cumulative
exchange differences are not recognised in the income statement.
Revenue
Composition of revenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of goods and services supplied
by the Group excluding intra-group transactions, sales by associated
undertakings and sales taxes. Revenue relating to construction
contracts, including long-term service provision contracts, represents
the value of work performed during the year determined by reference
to the stage of completion of the contract.
Recognition of revenue and profits
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be
reliably measured. The specific methods used to recognise the
different forms of revenue earned by the Group are set out below.
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks
and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and
the amount of revenue can be reliably measured.
Profit is recognised at the time of sale.
Construction contracts and rendering of services
Revenue from construction contracts, including long-term service
provision contracts, is recognised by reference to the stage of
completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is
normally determined by the proportion that contract costs incurred
to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this
would not be representative of the stage of completion. If the nature
of a particular contract means that costs incurred do not accurately
reflect the progress of contract activity, an alternative approach is
used such as the achievement of predetermined contract milestones.
Profit attributable to contract activity is recognised if the final outcome
of such contracts can be reliably assessed. On all contracts, full provision
is made for any losses in the year in which they are first foreseen.
Revenue from services provided on a short-term or one-off basis
is recognised when the service is complete.
Research and development
All research expenditure is expensed as incurred. Development
expenditure is expensed as incurred unless it meets the criteria
for recognition as an intangible asset (see policy on Other
intangible assets).
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
For defined benefit plans, the service cost of providing retirement
benefits to employees during the year is charged to operating profit
or loss in the year. The cost of providing benefits under the defined
benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the
projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The full cost of
providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service is also
charged to operating profit or loss in the year. The expected return
on the assets of the schemes during the year based on the market
value of scheme assets at the start of the financial year is included
within other finance charges – IAS 19. This also includes a charge
representing the expected increase in liabilities of the schemes
during the year, arising from the liabilities of the scheme being one
year closer to payment. Differences between actual and expected
returns on assets during the year are recognised in the statement of
recognised income and expense in the year, together with differences
from changes in assumptions. The net surplus or deficit on defined
benefit pension schemes is reported on the balance sheet within the
pension asset or liability.
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the income
statement in respect of pension costs is the contributions payable in
the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and
contributions actually paid are shown either as accruals or
prepayments in the balance sheet.
Goodwill
On a business combination, the net fair value of the identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities is assessed and adjustments are
made to bring the accounting policies of businesses acquired into
alignment with those of the Group. The excess of the price paid over
the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired
is included in intangible assets as goodwill. Any costs of integrating the
acquired business are taken to the income statement.
Goodwill arising on business combinations before 1 April 2004 has
been retained at the previous UK GAAP amount subject to being
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may be impaired, and it is subsequently carried at
cost less accumulated impairment losses. The Group’s policy on testing
assets for impairment is set out under ‘Impairment of non-financial
assets’ below.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying
amount of goodwill relating to the business sold.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of
intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value
at acquisition date. The cost of separately acquired intangible assets,
including computer software, comprises the purchase price and any
directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for use. Amortisation
begins when an asset is available for use and is calculated on a
straight-line basis to allocate the cost less residual value of assets
over their estimated useful lives using the following annual rates:
Development costs 10 to 25%
Computer software costs 10 to 25%
Patents, trademarks and licenses Shorter of period of the
agreement or 15 years
Useful lives are examined on an annual basis and adjustments where
applicable are made on a prospective basis. No intangible assets other
than goodwill are considered to have indefinite useful lives.
Expenditure incurred on development projects is capitalised as an
intangible asset if it meets the recognition criteria set out in IAS 38,
Intangible Assets. These require it to be probable that the expenditure
will generate future economic benefits and can be measured reliably. To meet these criteria, it is necessary to be able to demonstrate,
among other things, the technical feasibility of completing the
intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.
Costs incurred in the preliminary stage of a development project are
considered to be research costs, and are recognised in the income
statement as incurred. These costs are incurred to determine the
product concepts and alternatives, evaluate the alternatives and
related risks, assess the technical feasibility of concepts, make the
final selection from the possible alternatives and prepare the high
level design and project planning. The costs incurred in the following
development stage for substantially new or improved products are
assessed against the IAS 38 criteria and considered for recognition as
an asset when they meet those criteria. These costs are generally
incurred in developing the detailed product design, software
configuration and software interfaces; the coding of software, building
of prototypes and integration of the software with hardware; and
testing and releasing the product to manufacture and pilot production.
Development expenditure directed towards incremental improvements
in existing products does not qualify for recognition as an intangible
asset.
In general the costs of developing software products that are sold
in packaged form and not integrated and sold with hardware are
not recognised as intangible assets. The uncertainties associated with
the functionality of these products mean that technical feasibility is
achieved only immediately prior to or after field trial tests at customer
sites. As a result minimal or no costs are considered to meet the IAS 38
criteria for recognition.
An intangible asset acquired in a business combination is recognised
separately from the goodwill arising on the business combination if
the asset’s fair value can be measured reliably, regardless of whether
the asset had been recognised previously by the acquiree.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises purchase
price and directly attributable costs.
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated to their
residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives
at the following rates applied to original cost:
Freehold land Nil
Freehold buildings 2 to 2.5%
Leasehold properties Over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment 7 to 35%
Useful lives and residual values are examined on an annual basis and
adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Impairment of non-financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any
indication that any non-financial asset (excluding goodwill) may be
impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually whether or not
there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill was also tested for
impairment at the date of transition to IFRS. If there is an indication
of impairment, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable
amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount the asset is written down to its recoverable amount and an
impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs
to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset.
If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent
of those from other assets or groups of assets the recoverable amount
of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.
The calculation of an asset’s value in use uses a discount rate that
reflects the asset specific risks and the time value of money.
Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in
property, plant and equipment at fair value or, if lower, the present
value of the minimum lease payments. Capitalised leased assets are
subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the
asset’s useful life. Obligations related to finance leases, net of finance
charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate within
liabilities. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance
charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance
charges are charged directly against income.
Other leases are classified as operating leases. Lease payments,
including any premium paid at the outset of the lease, made under
operating leases are recognised as an expense over the lease term on
a straight-line basis.
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is
based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date and an
assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent
on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a
right to use the asset.
A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the
following applies:
(a) there is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or
extension of the arrangement;
(b) a renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term
of the renewal or extension was initially included in the
lease term;
(c) there is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment is
dependant on a specified asset; or
(d) there is a substantial change to the asset.
Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases
from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the
reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of renewal or
extension period for scenario b).
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable
value. Provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving items. Cost
comprises the cost of raw materials, determined on a first-in, first-out
cost basis, and an appropriate proportion of labour and manufacturing
overheads based on normal operating capacity, to reflect the costs
incurred in bringing the product to its present location and condition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, call deposits and other
short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months
or less.
Cash and short-term deposits at the balance sheet date are offset
against bank loans and overdrafts where formal rights of set-off exist
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis.
Taxation
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to
the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute
the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by
the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all
temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases

reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for
all taxable temporary differences:
• except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the
initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset
or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and,
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit
nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with
investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint
ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary
differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses,
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available
against which the deductible temporary differences, and the
carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be
utilised, except:
• where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset
or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and,
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit
nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with
investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint
ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent
that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in
the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all
or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised
deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date
and are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred
income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and
laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and
deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in
which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally
enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and
the same taxation authority.
Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments
The Group primarily uses forward foreign currency contracts and
interest rate swaps to manage its exposures to fluctuations in interest
and foreign exchange rates. These instruments are accounted for as
hedges when designated as hedges at the inception of the contract.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
financial trading purposes.
All derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value in the
balance sheet. The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts
and interest rate swaps are calculated by reference to current forward
exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The designation of derivative financial instruments as hedges is carried
out according to the Group’s risk management policies. Hedges fall
into three categories:
(a) Fair value hedges, which hedge the exposure to changes in the fair
value of a recognised asset or liability;
(b) Cash flow hedges, which hedge exposure to variability in cash flows
that is attributable to either a particular risk associated with a
recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast
transaction, or the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment;
and
(c) Net investment hedges, which hedge exposure to changes in the
value of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations due to
foreign currency exposure.
The accounting treatment for these categories is outlined below:
Fair value hedges
When the hedging instrument is remeasured at fair value, any resulting
gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Any gain or loss on
the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted
against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly
recognised in the income statement.
Cash flow and net investment hedges
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is
determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity. Any
ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised in the income
statement. When a hedged cash flow related to a hedged item results
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated
gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the
initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow
hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are
transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the
hedged item affects the income statement (on disposal of the hedged
investment in the case of a net investment hedge).
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Group’s net investment in
foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss on the borrowings
that is determined to be an effective hedge, in accordance with IAS 39,
is recognised in equity.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative
financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges are recognised in
the income statement.
Derivative instruments held by the Group’s pension and post-
retirement benefit schemes are accounted for within the schemes
themselves and are reflected in the Group financial statements within
the amounts reported for those schemes.
Other financial assets
Other financial assets are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured as follows: (a) at fair value for available-for-
sale financial assets. Gains and losses are recognised in equity except
for impairment losses, interest and dividends arising from these assets
which are recognised in the income statement; and (b) at amortised
cost, using the effective interest rate method, for held-to-maturity
financial assets.
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost less any
provision for impairment. Trade and other receivables are discounted
when the time value of money is considered material.
Debt instruments
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the
consideration received less directly attributable issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. This cost is computed as the amount initially recognised
minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation
of any difference between the initially recognised amount and the
maturity amount. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account
any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the
liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
Financial guarantee contracts
A financial guarantee contract is a contract issued by the Group that
requires the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the
holder of the guarantee for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor
fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or
modified terms of a debt instrument. In a very limited number of
cases, the Group has issued such contracts to guarantee certain
borrowings by third parties.
Financial guarantee contracts are initially recognised at fair value and
subsequently measured at the higher of (a) the estimated outflow of
resources required to meet any present obligation under the contract
(in accordance with IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and
Contingent Assets), and (b) the amount initially recognised less, when
appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with
IAS 18, Revenue.
Derecognition of financial instruments
A financial instrument is derecognised when the Group no longer
controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to the
contracts that give rise to them and are classified as financial assets at
fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held-to-maturity
investments; or as available for sale financial assets, as appropriate.
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part
of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised where:
• the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
• the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset,
but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material
delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or
• the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the
asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and
rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has
transferred control of the asset.
Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from
an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the
risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the
asset is recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing
involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form
of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of
the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount
of consideration that the Group could be required to repay. Where
continuing involvement takes the form of a written and/or purchased
option (including a cash-settled option or similar provision) on the
transferred asset, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is
the amount of the transferred asset that the Group may repurchase,
except that in the case of a written put option (including a
cash-settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at fair
value, the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement is limited to
the lower of the fair value of the transferred asset and the option
exercise price.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the
liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from
the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of
an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or
modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and
the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective
carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset
or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost
Assets carried at amortised cost, such as loans and receivables, are
impaired if there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has
been incurred. The loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not been
incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate
(i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying
amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account
and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
The assessment considers assets whether objective evidence of
impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually
significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are
not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective
evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial
asset, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar
credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is
collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually
assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is
recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If the amount of a recognised impairment loss decreases in a
subsequent period, and the decrease can be related objectively to an
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously
recognised impairment loss is reversed. The reversal is recognised in
the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the
asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
For trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there
is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or
significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not
be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of
the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through
use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised when
they are assessed as uncollectible.
Available-for-sale financial investments
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the
difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and
amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss
previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from
equity to the income statement. Reversals in respect of equity
instruments classified as available for sale are not recognised in the
income statement. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments
are reversed through the income statement, if the increase in fair
value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income
statement.
Share-based payment
The Group operates various equity-settled and cash-settled share
schemes. For equity-settled share options, the services received from
employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share
options. The fair value is calculated at grant date using a valuation
model and recognised in the Consolidated income statement, together
with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity, on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
72 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 73
options that will eventually vest. Vesting conditions, other than market
conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
Market conditions are those conditions that are linked to the share
price of the Company.
For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is calculated
based on the share price at the grant date and, where applicable, any
market vesting conditions, and expensed over the vesting period based
on the number of shares expected to vest. No expense is recognised
for awards that do not ultimately vest, with the exception of awards
where vesting is conditional upon a market condition; these are
treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition
is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are met.
For cash-settled share awards, the services received from employees
are measured at fair value and recognised in the Consolidated income
statement as an expense over the vesting period with recognition of a
corresponding liability. The fair value of the liability is remeasured at
each reporting date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair
value recognised in the Consolidated income statement.
In accordance with the exemption permitted by IFRS 1, First-time
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, applied by the
Group on transition to IFRSs, the requirements of IFRS 2, Share-based
Payment, have not been applied to equity instruments granted on or
before 7 November 2002 and those vesting before 1 January 2005.
New standards and interpretations not applied
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and
interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial
statements:
Effective date – financial periods
International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRSs) beginning on or after
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007
IAS 1 Amendment – Presentation of
Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs (revised) 1 January 2009
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Effective date – financial periods
Committee (IFRIC) beginning on or after
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 1 May 2006
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 1 June 2006
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 1 November
2006
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards
and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group financial
statements in the period of initial application.
Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the Group will have to disclose additional
information about its financial instruments, their significance and the
nature and extent of risks that they give rise to. More specifically the
Group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments
and its risk exposure in greater detail. There will be no effect on
reported income or net assets.
Upon adoption of IFRS 8, the Group will be required to adopt the
‘management approach’ to reporting on the financial performance
of its operating segments, so that the segment information to be
reported would generally be what management uses internally for
evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate
resources to operating segments. The Group is still evaluating the
effect of this standard, but considers that its adoption will not have a
significant impact on the segment information reported. There will be
no effect on reported income or net assets.
Critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management is required to
make judgments and assumptions concerning the future in a number
of areas. Actual results may be different from those estimated using
these judgments and assumptions. The key sources of estimation
uncertainty and critical accounting judgments that have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an
annual basis. This requires an estimation of the ‘value in use’ of the
cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating a
value in use amount requires management to make an estimate of the
expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to
choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value
of those cash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 March 2007
was £206 million (2006: £222 million). Further details are given in
Note 13.
Pension and post-retirement benefits
The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post employment
medical benefits is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial
valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, expected
rates of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and
future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans,
such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The net pension
liability at 31 March 2007 is £522 million (2006: £489 million). Further
details are given in Note 25.
Development costs
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s
accounting policy for other intangible assets. Determining the amounts
to be capitalised requires management to make assumptions and
estimates regarding the expected future cash generation of the assets
and the expected period of benefits. At 31 March 2007, the best
estimate of the carrying amount of capitalised development costs was
£76 million (2006: £74 million).
Provisions and contingent liabilities
The Group currently recognises provisions for a number of liabilities
including environmental claims and onerous lease rentals. The amounts
recognised for provisions represent the best estimate of the probable
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that will be
required to settle these liabilities. No provisions are recognised for
contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are possible obligations
whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, or
current obligations that are not recognised because it is not probable
that they will result in an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured
with sufficient reliability.
The determination of whether a liability should be disclosed as a
contingent liability or recognised as a provision requires judgments to
be made on the existence of a present obligation and the probability
of future events. When a provision is required, the amount recognised
is determined using judgments and assumptions, based on current
knowledge, to estimate the amount and timing of future cash outflows
arising from the liabilities. At 31 March 2007, the estimated amount of
liabilities requiring provisions was £166 million (2006: £195 million).
Further details are given in Note 24. Details of the Group’s contingent
liabilities are set out in Note 30. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

7 Foreign exchange gains and losses
Foreign exchange gains in the year of £35 million (2006: £33 million loss) relate to exchange differences arising on the translation of unhedged
foreign currency monetary items used in the financing of the Group and its subsidiaries. These are principally attributable to exchange differences
on the Group’s non-sterling denominated currency borrowings, held in companies whose functional currency is sterling.
Of the exchange gains, £24 million arose on net external US dollar borrowings, £10 million on net external euro borrowings and £1 million on
other currencies.
These foreign currency borrowings are held as an economic hedge by reference to the Group’s underlying cash generation by currency. However,
they are not accounted for as net investment hedges under IAS 39 and consequently exchange differences arising on these borrowings are
recorded in the income statement.

* Comparative figures for the weighted average number of shares have been restated after adjusting for the bonus element of the 2 for 5 Rights issue and the Share
consolidation of one 10p share for every ten 1p shares in July 2006. The adjustment factor for the Rights issue is 1.070588 calculated using 19.75p per share, being the closing
price on 6 July 2006.
** Before exceptional items.
The basic earnings/(loss) per share for the year has been calculated using 733 million shares (2006: 609 million), being the weighted average
number of shares in issue during the year, and the profit/(loss) after taxation and minority interests for continuing operations, discontinued
operations and total Group as shown above.
Earnings/(loss) per share for continuing operations is also calculated by reference to earnings before exceptional items, exceptional finance costs
and foreign exchange gains and losses with an underlying tax charge of £29 million (2006: £26 million), since the directors consider that this gives
a useful additional indication of underlying performance.
The diluted earnings/(loss) per share has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share without reference to adjustments in
respect of certain share options which are considered to be anti-dilutive.
There have been no transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of completion
of these financial statements.

Leased assets are pledged as security for the related finance lease. The title to land and buildings with a carrying amount of £6 million
(2006: £6 million) has been pledged as security for liabilities.
Included in plant and equipment at 31 March 2007 was an amount of £14 million (2006: £18 million) relating to expenditure for plant and
equipment in the course of construction.
Impairment losses of £2 million (2006: £15 million) represent the write-down of assets in relation to the closure of a Controls manufacturing plant
within Europe following the transfer of production from this site.
The recoverable amounts of these assets were estimated based on their fair value less costs to sell. Fair values were determined based on an
assessment of the current market values of the assets and past experience of sales of similar assets.

84 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 Annual impairment test
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable
amounts of each of the CGUs are determined from ‘value in use’ calculations using cash flow projections over a five year period.
The key assumptions for the ‘value in use’ calculations are:
• revenue volumes;
• revenue prices;
• operating costs;
• growth rate assumptions for years four and five of the cash flow projections;
• growth in perpetuity applied to calculate the terminal value; and
• discount rate.
Expected revenue volumes, revenue prices and operating costs are based on past experience and expected future developments in markets and
operations and are the same assumptions used in the most recent financial annual operating plans approved by management. These projections
cover the first three years of the cash flow projections.
Cash flows for years four and five are projected at a growth rate appropriate for the relevant CGU. These growth rates take into consideration
forecast GDP growth rates for the countries of operation, expected market growth rates for those regions and the levels of growth achieved
historically by the CGU and forecast in the periods covered by the annual operating plan. Lower growth rates are applied in perpetuity to calculate
the terminal value for each CGU. These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. The discount rate applied
to each CGU is a pre-tax rate based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect management’s estimate of the specific risk
profile associated with the cash flow projections for the CGU. These discount rates and growth rates by CGU are as follows:

In all cases the recoverable amounts of these CGUs were in excess of their carrying values and no impairment arose in the year (2006: £nil).
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
With respect to the assessment of value in use of all CGUs management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key
assumptions would cause the carrying value of those CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.

The Group has unrecognised income tax losses of £1,075 million with a tax value of £345 million (2006: £1,180 million with a tax value of
£385 million) available for offset against future profits. Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of £43 million (2006: £29 million) that
will expire within four years.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of £525 million with a tax value of £173 million (2006: £463 million with
a tax value of £167 million) in respect of pension and other retirement benefit obligations.
The Group has unrecognised capital losses of £2,144 million (2006: £2,267 million) that are only available for offset against future capital gains.
Included in capital losses are losses of £1,384 million (2006: £1,765 million) that will expire within four years. Other capital losses may be carried
forward indefinitely.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not
been recognised aggregate to £830 million (2006: £850 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group
is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

Available-for-sale financial assets consist of investments in listed ordinary shares and therefore have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
Financial assets at fair value through the income statement
The investments included above represent investments in unlisted euro denominated securities that offer the Group the opportunity for return
through fair value gains. The securities have final maturity dates between 2010 and 2020, with options for early redemption at set intervals linked
to the level of the Nikkei Index. Market values have been determined by external security dealers using pricing models, based on various financial
factors including bond prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and the Nikkei Index prices. The total amount of the change in fair value
estimated using a valuation technique that was recognised in the income statement during the year was £nil (2006: gain of £3 million). These assets
are classified as held for trading.

Trade receivables are recorded net of an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods. The average credit period
taken on sales of goods is 53 days. The allowance that has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods is £13 million
(2006: £15 million). This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience. The impairment loss recognised in the year
as a result of irrecoverable receivables balances is £3 million (2006: £4 million).
Trade and other receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing. Other receivables include amounts owed by associated undertakings,
interest receivable, refundable deposits, refunds due in respect of VAT, sales and payroll taxes, commissions earned and insurance recoveries.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of current and non-current trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

Restricted cash and short-term deposits
The refinancing undertaken in 2006 removed the previous requirement for the allocation of certain funds to deal with the Group’s legacy liabilities
and for such funds to be held in an escrow account. At 31 March 2007, the balance in this account was £nil (2006: £219 million). £40 million
(2006: £58 million) of cash and short-term deposits is cash collateral held in the ordinary course of business to provide security to third parties.
As an international Group, Invensys has operations in a number of territories (such as China, Brazil and Russia) which place restrictions on the
ability of subsidiaries to lend money to other Group entities outside those territories. However, distributions to the Group are permitted from
audited reserves.
Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is
represented by their respective carrying values as at the balance sheet date. Credit risks arising from acting as guarantor are disclosed in Note 30.

1. These loans and borrowings are secured by fixed and floating charges over certain Group companies’ assets. £1 million (2006: £5 million) of such loans is classified as
current liabilities.
2. The available facilities at 31 March 2007 are £396 million (2006: £410 million) of which £252 million (2006: £277 million) is drawn other than as a cash advance. The bonding
facilities are only able to be drawn as cash to finance or refinance cash collateral.
3. The borrowers have the right to prepay these facilities on five days’ notice, subject to conditions in other borrowing agreements. Prepayment is at par with payments being
applied first to the two Term loans. However, lenders have the right to decline prepayments of part (but not the whole) of the Term loans. The lenders have the right to
seek early repayment following any ‘Event of Default’ or ‘Change of Control’.
4. Senior Notes issued in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The Company has the right to call these Notes in whole or part at any date
following 15 March 2008, subject to any conditions in other borrowing agreements. The following prices would apply to any such call:
• 15 March 2008 to 14 March 2009: 104.938%
• 15 March 2009 to 14 March 2010: 102.469%
• 15 March 2010 to maturity: 100%
The noteholders have the right to seek early repayment following any ‘Event of Default’ or ‘Change of Control’, defined as when one party acquires 35% voting control plus
some other circumstances.
5. Senior Notes issued in the United States under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. The Company has no right to call these Notes prior to maturity. The noteholders
have the right to seek early repayment.
6. Repaid in full as part of the 2006 Refinancing.
The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are subject to several financial covenants. The Group is subject to ‘incurrence’ covenants which prohibit
it from taking certain actions if the incurrence test is failed. It is also subject to ‘maintenance’ covenants which are tested on a regular basis.
Failure of the maintenance covenants would allow the lenders under the relevant agreement to call for immediate repayment of loans made
to the Group.
Senior Notes due March 2011
These Notes carry only incurrence covenants which, if failed, restrict the ability of the Group to incur indebtedness beyond certain limits, pay
dividends or make similar payments.
Senior Credit Facilities maturing 15 December 2010 to 15 January 2011
These facilities carry maintenance covenants that include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings, a minimum level of interest cover and a
maximum level of capital expenditure. The covenants measure these as a number and must show performance better than a defined scale,
which changes over the period of the facilities. To date the Group has shown ratios better than those required by the relevant agreements.

22 Financial risk management and financial instruments
The Group’s treasury policy seeks to ensure that:
• adequate financial resources are available for the development of the Group’s businesses, ensuring also long-term security in support of
our products for the benefit of customers. This includes the provision of funding for capital expenditure, working capital and the bonding
requirements of our contract businesses; and
• financial risk of currency, interest rate and counterparty exposure is minimised as far as possible, as set out in the following sections, and
that no speculative transactions are undertaken.
Group Treasury operates as a service centre from locations in the UK, US and Singapore within clearly defined guidelines.
Policy in respect of the major areas of treasury management is set out below:
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to set the proportion of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt taking into account factors such as the interest rate, the business
cycle and the Group’s level of financial leverage.
The Group uses fixed-rate borrowings, interest rate swaps, forward-rate agreements and currency swaps to manage its interest rate exposure.
As at 31 March 2007, £431 million of borrowings (including £96 million of interest rate swaps maturing during 2007) were in fixed-rate form,
representing 260% of net debt and 89% of gross debt (2006: £911 million, representing 120% of net debt and 75% of gross debt).
Currency risk
Translation exposure
In common with other companies operating with many international subsidiaries, a currency risk arises on the translation of the results of foreign
subsidiaries into sterling. This risk is not hedged but, as discussed below, future currency cash flows are considered in determining the mix of
net debt.
Similarly a currency risk arises on the translation of the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries into sterling. The Group targets a level of net debt
by currency according to the level of cash generation by currency and with reference to gross debt, pension liabilities and finance costs.
Transaction exposure
Currency transaction exposure arises where actual revenue and purchases are made by the Group’s businesses in a currency other than their
own functional currency. The incidence of this risk varies across the different businesses of the Group although the majority of revenues and
purchases will usually be in the businesses’ local markets and in their respective functional currencies. Where this is not the case, the Group’s
businesses are required to hedge their known exposures. The Group is also subject to risk in bids where an exchange rate assumed in making
such a bid to a customer can lead to a change in margin should a bid be successful and lead to a contract. The risk is hedged if significant.
The Group predominantly uses forward currency contracts and currency options to manage transaction exposure.
Price risk
The Group’s exposure to changing market prices on the value of financial instruments has an impact on the carrying value of financial assets
that are classified as available-for-sale and on financial assets at fair value through the income statement.
On 31 March 2007, the total carrying value of these financial assets was £7 million (2006: £17 million).
Counterparty risk
The Group monitors the counterparties with whom it deposits cash and transacts other financial instruments so as to control exposure to any
territory or institution. Surplus funds are placed for short periods with highly-rated institutions in money market deposits.
Derivatives
Derivatives are used to manage the interest rate and currency risks described above and further detail is provided below:
(i) Classification and fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The following table sets out the classification, carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. The fair value is
defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates translated at year
end exchange rates. Receivables and payables have been included to the extent they are classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance
with IAS 32. Provisions have been included where there is a contractual obligation to settle in cash.

* The directors consider that the carrying amount of these financial assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.
The Group has, in the ordinary course of business, provided indemnities to banks in respect of performance guarantees issued to customers.
The fair value of such indemnities is not material as the likelihood of any liability arising from them is considered remote.
In a very limited number of cases, the Group has guaranteed certain borrowings by third parties. At 31 March 2007, the maximum credit risk to
the Group arising from these guarantees was £4 million (2006: £8 million), being the total amount of such borrowings outstanding at that date.
Financial assets with a carrying value of up to £148 million (2006: £412 million) are subject to charges relating to such loans.
(ii) Interest rate profiles of financial assets and liabilities
The interest rate profiles of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term borrowings are set out in Notes 20 and 21
respectively. The Group’s interest rate swaps are set out below. All other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are non-interest bearing
and a statement has been made to that effect in the relevant balance sheet notes.
(iii) Maturity analysis of interest bearing financial assets and liabilities
The maturity profile of the Group’s short and long-term borrowings is set out in Note 21 and of the Group’s cash and short-term deposits is set
out in Note 20.

income statement during the year to 31 March 2007 in respect of hedged interest cash flows.
Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge transaction exposure
The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to hedge currency exposure arising from sales and purchases made by the Group’s
businesses in currencies other than their own functional currency. The turnover (i.e. notional principal) of such derivatives (which typically have
a term of less than one year), excluding swaps, in the year to 31 March 2007 was £255 million (2006: £133 million) and their fair value at
31 March was:

Warranties are provided for in the normal course of business based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past claims. Such costs
are generally incurred over the product life cycle.
Restructuring provisions cover committed costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount can be determined reliably. This generally
coincides with a commitment to a formal plan or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites. These costs are expected to be incurred
over the next 30 years.
Other provisions principally relate to onerous lease rentals in respect of vacant property, other onerous contracts and legal claims. These
liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next five years.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of provisions equates to their fair value.
Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 95 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
25 Pensions and post-retirement benefits
(i) Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates many defined contribution schemes. Pension costs in respect of defined contribution schemes represented contributions
payable in the year and amounted to £8 million (2006: £9 million). At 31 March 2007, there were £1 million (2006: £1 million) of outstanding
contributions included in payables.
(ii) Defined benefit schemes – general
The Group operates many funded and unfunded defined benefit pension and post-retirement schemes. Contributions to the defined benefit
schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the independent actuary of the relevant scheme. There are two main funded
defined benefit schemes in the UK and US, together with other smaller schemes in the rest of the world.
The principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees is the Invensys Pension Scheme. The Invensys Pension Scheme is a funded
defined benefit scheme. The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group. These assets are managed by trustees, who are
required to act in the best interests of the schemes’ beneficiaries. Since 1988 the Trustee Board has been comprised of 11 directors drawn from
company and member nominees. Due in part to the changing membership profile the Trustee Board will in future be made up of nine directors,
four will be nominated by the Company and five by the members. The Company is responsible for appointing the Chairman from the Board.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme for funding purposes was carried out with a valuation date of 30 September 2005 by independent
actuaries using the projected unit credit method for valuing the liabilities. The assumptions that had the most effect on the results of this
valuation for funding purposes are those relating to the discount rate on scheme liabilities and mortality assumptions.
There are numerous schemes operated by overseas subsidiaries. Of these the largest US scheme is assessed annually by an actuary, and the other
overseas defined benefit schemes are normally assessed periodically by independent actuaries in accordance with local practice.
The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical
benefits to retired former employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the US. These schemes are generally unfunded.
The last full valuations of all schemes on an IAS 19 basis have been updated to 31 March 2007.
(iii) Defined benefit schemes – major assumptions
The major assumptions made when valuing the assets and liabilities of funded and unfunded schemes under IAS 19 are as follows:

** The inflationary pension increases granted in the year were 3.20% (2006: 2.90%; 2005: 2.90%).
96 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 The demographic assumptions which were consistently applied for the main schemes are as follows:
Invensys Pension Scheme (UK)
Standard actuarial mortality tables PA92 were adopted using year of birth and medium cohort projections. Probability of death at each age was
multiplied by 126%.
By way of illustration the impact of the application of these mortality tables on the expected longevity of pensioners is shown below:
Years
Retiring today at age 65: Male 20.2
Female 22.9
Retiring in 20 years at age 65: Male 21.4
Female 24.1
Invensys Pension Plan (US)
The mortality table adopted was the RP 2000 Table for combined employee/annuitants, projected to 2007 using projection scale AA.
Sensitivities
The Invensys Pension Scheme (UK) is the largest scheme within the Group, representing 47% of net assets and liabilities of all defined benefit schemes.
The principal sensitivities are illustrated below:

Liabilities for each scheme are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. This is an accrued benefits valuation
method that discounts the best estimate of future cash flows and makes allowance for projected earnings.
If the UK scheme were to be wound up, the relevant employers would be responsible, under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 to fund the
UK scheme up to the levels of the cost of buying out the benefits for all scheme members with an insurer. This cost would be considerably
more than the value placed on the ongoing liabilities for accounting purposes. The deficit in the UK scheme calculated on a winding up basis
was approximately £1.8 billion as at 30 September 2005.
** Following the repatriation of the surplus within the Australia Superannuation Fund, £28 million of assets and liabilities now accrue to defined contribution scheme members
and have therefore been reclassified.
***A summary of the overall net actuarial loss of £56 million and its components is provided within Note (iv) on page 97.

The expected return on each asset class has been determined on the basis of market expectations for the rate of return on each asset class over
the life of the related obligation, at the balance sheet date. In respect of the UK scheme, Government and Corporate Bond indices have been
used to set the expected rate of return on bonds, and a risk premium has been applied to determine the expected long-term rate of return on
equity investments. Similar processes are applied to other schemes.
The Trustee of the UK scheme adopted a new statement of investment principles which resulted in a change in the investment strategy of the
scheme during the year. Under the new principles, the Trustees will target a long-term rate or return on investments as a whole, at 1% per annum
over Government stock of appropriate duration to the scheme’s liabilities. This investment strategy would give an overall expected rate of return
of 5.50% per annum at the balance sheet date based on market conditions at this date.

Cumulative actuarial gains and losses
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 1 April 2004 in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and
expense is a loss of £194 million (2006: loss of £138 million). The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit
recognised on transition to IFRSs and taken directly to equity of £606 million in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since
inception of those pension schemes. Consequently the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would
have been recognised in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004. Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007 103
(ix) Pensions and post-retirement benefits – other
Total pension service costs charged to the income statement in respect of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes amounted to
£40 million (2006: £45 million).
The estimated levels of contributions expected to be paid to defined benefit schemes in the year to 31 March 2008 are as follows:

Regarding rates of contributions for future years, following the triennial valuation of the UK pension scheme (valuation date 30 September 2005)
contributions to the UK pension scheme will be made at the rate of 24.3% of pensionable salaries up to the date of the next triennial valuation.
In addition, the Company will continue to make supplemental contributions to the scheme of £20 million per annum in the year ending
31 March 2008, followed by contributions of £36 million per annum (increasing by £1 million per annum thereafter) until 31 March 2015.
Where the proceeds from the sale of a business exceed £1 million, at least 8% of the proceeds net of tax and costs will be paid as additional
contributions to the UK scheme. The funding plan is subject to revision after the next triennial valuation which is expected to have a reference
date of 31 March 2008. Under the US plan, the Company’s agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation provided for additional
contributions of 4% of net proceeds from future disposals.
Benefits to be paid by the UK pension scheme are expected to be as per the graph below:

Terms and conditions of the above financial liabilities are as follows:
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are on average normally settled on 60-day terms. Interest payable on the Group’s major borrowing
facilities is settled quarterly throughout the financial year. Other payables include sales taxes, social security and payroll taxes, payroll creditors,
customer advances (not related to construction contracts), payments received from customers in advance of work performed on construction
contracts and commissions payable. They are non-interest bearing. The majority of non-current other payables will mature in more than one
year but in less than two years; there is a small proportion that will mature in over five years.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of both current and non-current trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.

On 10 July 2006, 2,274,914,324 ordinary shares of 1p each with an aggregate nominal value of £23 million were issued and fully paid for cash of
£342 million in a fully underwritten two for five Rights issue.
Subsequent to the Rights issue, the Company’s ordinary shares have been consolidated on the basis of one new ordinary share of 10p each for
every 10 existing ordinary shares of 1p each on 7 August 2006. On that date, the total number of shares in issue therefore reduced from
7,962,222,990 ordinary shares of 1p each to 796,222,299 ordinary shares of 10p each.
Shares reserved for issue under share options and awards
As a consequence of the Rights issue, with effect from 15 June 2006 all options granted under the various share option schemes operated by the
Company and awards granted under the Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) have, in accordance with the rules of the
respective schemes and as approved by the HM Revenue and Customs (where appropriate), been adjusted as follows: (a) the number of shares in
respect of which options have been granted have been adjusted by the application of a multiplication factor of 1.07058 and the exercise price has
been adjusted by a multiplication factor of 0.93406; and (b) the number of shares in each LTIP award has been adjusted by a multiplication factor
of 1.07058. Subsequently, as a consequence of the Share consolidation, with effect from 7 August 2006, the number of shares comprised in each
option and award were divided by 10 and the exercise option prices were multiplied by 10.
All figures presented in the section below for the number of share options and awards, and the amounts for exercise prices and average prices
have been restated to take into account the effects of the Rights issue and Share consolidation as noted above.
During the year the Company issued 16,414 ordinary shares of 10p each pursuant to the exercise of options under the Invensys Savings Related
Share Option Scheme.
On 1 June 2006, 3 July 2006, 11 August 2006, 14 August 2006, 5 October 2006, 15 November 2006, 30 November 2006, 14 February 2007 and
21 March 2007 conditional awards over 4,523,636 shares, 90,454 shares, 496,220 shares, 164,364 shares, 83,624 shares, 19,695 shares, 85,719 shares,
263,318 shares and 21,823 shares respectively were granted under the LTIP. The awards are subject to a three year performance period from the
date of grant after which 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirement will be released at that time with the other 50%
being deferred for one year. Outstanding awards under the LTIP at 31 March 2007, which, subject to satisfaction of the performance requirement
and any appropriate holding period, will be released at various dates between 2008 and 2011, were 19,644,641 (2006: 21,596,351).
As at 31 March 2007, outstanding executive share options exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance condition, at
various dates between 2007 and 2014 and at various prices between 154.59p and 3,419.55p per ordinary share, and at an average price of
1,194.10p per ordinary share, were 3,110,465 (2006: 6,667,958).
Outstanding options under the Company’s various savings related share option schemes at 31 March 2007, exercisable at various dates between
2007 and 2010 and at various prices between 130.77p and 2,386.96p per ordinary share, and at an average price of 273.19p per ordinary share,
were 1,135,664 (2006: 1,928,560).
In addition, as at 31 March 2007, no options were outstanding over the Invensys International Holdings Limited (formerly BTR plc) ordinary
shares under the BTR Savings Related Share Option Scheme (2006: 28,443). All outstanding options lapsed on 1 July 2006. 28 Reconciliation of movements in equity

This reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.
Capital redemption reserve
This reserve arose when the Company repurchased its own shares for cancellation as part of a return of capital programme and is non-
distributable. Subsequently, in the year ended 31 March 2005, 3,499,780,822 deferred shares of 24p each were cancelled, in accordance with
their terms of issue. This cancellation resulted in a transfer of £840 million from share capital to the capital redemption reserve.
Capital reserve
Previously the Group merger reserve, this reserve was created on the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc in February 1999 and is non-distributable.
Cash flow hedge reserve
This reserve records, for each hedged item in an effective cash flow hedge, the cumulative change in fair value of the expected future cash flow
on the hedged item from the inception of the hedge relationship.
Foreign exchange reserve
The foreign exchange reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
It is also used to record the foreign exchange on net investments in these subsidiaries.

29 Share-based payment plans
Where applicable figures presented in this note for the number of share options and awards and the amounts for exercise prices and fair values
have been restated to take into account the effects of the Rights issue and Share consolidation as detailed in Note 27.
The Company operates various share schemes under which options and awards have been granted and are outstanding as detailed below:
Plans for senior employees
Executive share options
Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme
Grant details
An executive share option scheme under which options have been granted to directors and senior executives at no cost. Options are exercisable
between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant date at a price equal to the average middle market quoted price of the Company’s shares
over the five dealing days which precede the date of grant. Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or in the case of awards granted as
share appreciation rights, in cash.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: (a) for grants made prior to 25 July 2001, earnings per share (EPS) performance of RPI + 12% over a three year period
to be applied each year until the earlier of when the condition is met or the measurement period the last financial year of which is the year
preceding that in which the option will lapse; (b) for grants made between 25 July 2001 and 16 June 2002 EPS of RPI + 12% in the three years
after grant or EPS of RPI + 16% in the four years after grant or EPS of RPI + 20% in the five years after grant, failing which the option will lapse;
and (c) for grants made on 17 June 2002 and after, total shareholder return (TSR) performance against a peer group of the FTSE100 over a
performance period of three, four or five years commencing on the date of grant. 40% will be exercisable if the median position is achieved,
rising to 100% if upper quartile position is achieved. Between these two points the option will vest on a straight-line basis. If the performance
condition is not met in full at the first measurement then it will be retested against the fixed base in years four and five. If the median position
is not achieved by the end of the fifth year the option will lapse.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be exercisable
for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The Company does not propose to operate the Scheme, except in the case of recruitment situations, where it may be considered appropriate.
Hence no options were granted during the years ended 31 March 2007 or 31 March 2006.
Details of executive share options outstanding under this scheme including the option granted to Mr Henriksson under a separate arrangement
on 1 June 2004, are as follows:

The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.9 years (2006: 5.7 years) and the range
of exercise prices was between 154.59p and 2,601.17p.
Closed option schemes
In addition, during the year ended 31 March 2007, there were executive share options outstanding under the Siebe plc Share Option Scheme
1993, BTR Executive Share Option Scheme (1995) and Eurotherm plc Executive Share Option Scheme 1995. Grants are no longer made under
these closed schemes, the last grant having been made under the Siebe plc Share Option Scheme 1993 in March 1999. Outstanding options
under these schemes were 44,812 (2006: 316,384), with a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.2 years (2006: 1.0 years) and range
of exercise prices between 2,359.16p and 3,419.55p. Long-term incentives
Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) cost. Depending on the country
in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: (a) a nominal price option award which
is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment (unless the Company determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award
(granted in respect of a notional number of shares). Awards are normally subject to a three year performance period, commencing on the date
of award, followed by a retention period. For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 the retention period was two years; for awards made on or
after 22 July 2005, 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements will be released at the end of the performance
period with the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
TSR test
TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (with no retesting opportunities). TSR must rank
at the median position (when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR) in order for 25% of the shares subject to the award to be
available (subject to the retention period), rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is achieved. Between these positions, the
number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis. If at least the median position is not achieved the whole award will lapse. The peer
groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows:
• awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of grant; and
• awards granted on or after 22 July 2005: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, Schneider, Siemens,
Smiths Group and Yokogawa.
Overall performance test
The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that: (a) for awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 there has been a sustained delivery over
the performance period, regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds and reduction in Group indebtedness;
(b) for awards granted on or after 22 July 2005 that two underpins have been met: (1) achievement of stretching internal free cash flow targets;
and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items; and (c) for awards granted on or after 1 June 2006 that two underpin tests have been met:
(1) relating to the successful completion of the 2006 Refinancing and in addition that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying
financial performance of the Company; and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released
in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee after the completion of the first two years of the
performance period.
Scheme use
Given that no further awards can be granted under the LTIP after July 2008 it has been decided that a new share-based long-term incentive plan,
to be known as the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP) should be established. Implementation of the LTIP is subject to the approval of
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Grants made during the years ended 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2006 are detailed below:

Invensys Restricted Share Plan (RSP)
Grant details
A restricted share plan whereby awards, to be satisfied by the transfer of existing issued shares or in cash, are granted to certain senior employees
at no cost.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: awards are not subject to a specific performance condition apart from satisfactory personal performance, but in some
cases shares are subject to a holding period, historically of one or two years following vesting.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released in
defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The plan is operated predominantly for senior executives in special circumstances, such as recruitment and retention situations.

Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan (TBOP)
Grant details
The Company introduced the Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan (TBOP) in 2005/06 under which executives have the opportunity to receive a
supplemental bonus of up to 100% of their base salary in respect of any financial year to be paid in shares upon reaching specified target levels
of performance. The TBOP operates in addition to the existing Executive Bonus Plan (EBP). Any bonuses earned under the TBOP (the Overlay
Bonus) are payable in shares with 50% of the shares awarded being released following the first anniversary of those shares being awarded and
the other 50% being released following the second anniversary.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: the amount of the Overlay Bonus (which in turn determines the level of the award) is set by reference to the
performance targets specified for the executive in the EBP.
Service requirements: release of the shares is generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date although shares may be released
early in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The first grant under the TBOP was made on 1 June 2006. It was originally anticipated that the TBOP would be operated up to and including the
financial year 2007/08. However, as a result of the changes being made to the annual incentive arrangements for 2007/08 onwards (as detailed in
the Remuneration report), the TBOP will cease to be operated one year early. It is anticipated that the awards for the financial year 2006/07 will
be granted in June 2007.

All employee schemes
Invensys Savings Related Share Option Scheme
Grant details
The Scheme operates in the UK, is based on a savings plan and is offered to eligible full and part-time employees. Options may be granted at up
to a 20% discount to the market price of the Company’s shares immediately preceding the date of invitation. The vesting period for the options is
three, five or seven years.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: the Scheme operates in the UK within specific tax legislation and is therefore not subject to performance conditions
other than that a participant is required to complete the savings contract in order to exercise their options.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be exercisable
for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases.
Scheme use
The use of the scheme and potential future launches are reviewed on a regular basis. No options were granted under this Scheme during the
years ended 31 March 2007 or 31 March 2006.

Invensys Overseas Savings Related Share Option Scheme
Grant details
The Scheme operates in a number of overseas countries where it has proved advantageous and practicable based on the numbers of eligible
employees and local legal and tax requirements. It is based on a savings plan and is offered to eligible full and part-time employees. Options may
be granted at up to a 20% discount to the market price of the Company’s shares immediately preceding the date of invitation.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: there are no performance conditions, other than that a participant is required to complete the savings contract in
order to exercise their options.

The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.04 years (2006: 0.7 years) and the range
of exercise prices was between 387.03p and 810.05p.
Measurement of fair value
The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to calculate the fair value of options granted during the year. An ‘adjusted market value’
method of valuation, based on market value at grant date, adjusted for expected forfeitures and market-based performance conditions has been
used to calculate the fair value of all other awards (i.e. LTIP and RSP awards).
Expected volatility was based on both historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous ten years and on the implied volatility
of traded options of the Group’s shares. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Share-based payment expense
The Group recognised total expenses of £12 million (2006: £8 million) related to share-based payment transactions during the year, of which
£10 million (2006: £8 million) related to equity-settled and £2 million (2006: £nil) related to cash-settled transactions.

Capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment contracted at the balance sheet date but for which no provision has been made in the
accounts amounted to £2 million (2006: £3 million).
Operating leases
The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain land and buildings, motor vehicles and items of plant and equipment. Land and
buildings leases are generally subject to periodic rent reviews. Some leases have renewal options. These are at the option of the Group,
sometimes subject to a minimum notice period. In some cases rent escalations are set out in the lease contract. There are no material contingent
rents payable. No significant restrictions are placed upon the Group by entering into these leases.

The total of future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 March 2007 is £1 million
(2006: £4 million).
The Group leases a small proportion of its properties, plant and equipment under finance leases. The average lease term is 12 years for
properties and four years for plant and machinery. For the year ended 31 March 2007, the average effective borrowing rate was 7% (2006: 10%).
Leases are generally on a fixed repayment basis, with no material contingent amounts payable. The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations
approximates their carrying amount. These leases have terms of renewal and/or purchase options at the option of the Group. One property is
subject to a sale and leaseback arrangement and will be purchased by the Group when the lease expires in 2008. Provision has been made for
the amount by which the purchase price is expected to exceed market value. There are no significant escalation clauses and no significant
restrictions are placed upon the Group by entering into these leases.
The Group’s finance lease liabilities are secured against the assets to which they relate. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Contingent liabilities
In a very limited number of cases, the Group has guaranteed certain borrowings by third parties. At 31 March 2007, the maximum contingent
liability to the Group arising from these guarantees was £4 million (2006: £8 million), being the total amount of such borrowings outstanding
at that date.
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of bank loans and overdrafts and bank indemnities totalling £532 million (2006: £990 million).
Neither Invensys, nor any other member of the Group, is engaged in, nor (so far as the directors are aware) has pending, or is threatened by,
or against it any legal or arbitration proceedings which may have a significant effect on the financial position of the Group.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF
INVENSYS PLC
We have audited the Parent company financial statements (Company
financial statements) of Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2007
which comprise the Company balance sheet, Accounting policies and
the related Notes 1 to 13. These Company financial statements have
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have
also audited the information in the Remuneration report that is
described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of
Invensys plc for the year ended 31 March 2007.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report, the
Remuneration report and the Company financial statements in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and Accounting
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)
as set out in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Company financial statements and the
part of the Remuneration report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Company financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Company
financial statements and the part of the Remuneration report to be
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and the information given in the Directors’ report
is consistent with the Company financial statements. We also report to
you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Company financial
statements. This other information comprises the Chairman’s
statement, the Chief Executive’s statement, Business review, Corporate
social responsibility statement, Board of directors, Corporate
governance statement, unaudited part of the Remuneration report,
Statement of directors’ responsibilities, Financial summary, listing of
Principal subsidiaries as at 31 March 2007 and Shareholder
information. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatement or material inconsistencies with
the Company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend
to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to
the amounts and disclosures in the Company financial statements and
the part of the Remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the Company financial statements, and
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the Company financial statements and the part of the
Remuneration report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the Company financial statements and
the part of the Remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2007;
• the Company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration
report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
Company financial statements.

PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting
These accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and
in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards. The policies
are consistent with the previous year.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account for
the year.
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
For defined benefit plans, the service cost of providing retirement
benefits to employees during the year is charged to operating profit or
loss in the year. The cost of providing benefits under the defined
benefit schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the
projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The full cost of
providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service is also
charged to operating profit or loss in the year. The expected return on
the assets of the schemes during the year based on the market value
of scheme assets at the start of the financial year. The net surplus or
deficit on defined benefit pension schemes is reported on the balance
sheet within the pension asset or liability.
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit
and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions
payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the
year and contributions actually paid are shown either as accruals or
prepayments in the balance sheet.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less
provisions for impairment where a permanent diminution in value
has been identified.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Debt instruments
Borrowings are stated at net proceeds received after deduction of
issue costs. The issue costs of debt instruments are amortised over the
life of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have
originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an
obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future,
with the following exceptions:
(i) provision is made for tax on gains arising from fair value
adjustments of fixed assets or gains on disposal of fixed assets that
have been rolled over into replacement assets only to the extent
that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to
dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made
where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet
date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled
over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the
replacement assets are sold;
(ii) provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance
of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and
joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date,
dividends have been accrued as receivable; and
(iii) deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it
is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable
taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences
can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and
laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Share-based payment
The Company operates various equity-settled and cash-settled share
schemes. For equity-settled share options, the services received from
employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share
options. The fair value is calculated at grant date using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model and recognised in the profit and loss
account together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity,
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate
of the number of options that will eventually vest. Vesting conditions,
other than market conditions, are not taken into account when
estimating the fair value. Market conditions are those conditions that
are linked to the share price of the Company.
For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is calculated
based on the share price at the grant date and, where applicable, any
market vesting conditions, and expensed over the vesting period based
on the number of shares expected to vest. No expense is recognised
for awards that do not ultimately vest, with the exception of awards
where vesting is conditional upon a market condition; these are
treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition
is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are met.
For cash-settled share awards, the services received from employees
are measured at the fair value of the liability and recognised in the
profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and
at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the
profit and loss account. 118 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007
1 Loss attributable to the Parent company
The loss dealt with in the accounts of the Parent company, Invensys plc, is £252 million (2006: loss of £76 million). In accordance with the
exemption granted under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been presented.
2 Auditors’ remuneration
Fees paid to the Company’s auditors for the audit of the financial statements were £0.1 million (2006: £0.1 million).
Fees paid to the Company’s auditors for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the Parent company financial statements of
Invensys plc because the company’s Group financial statements are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.

9 Pensions and post-retirement benefits
(i) Pensions and post-retirement benefits
The Company operates one unfunded defined benefit pension scheme. The last full valuation of the scheme has been updated to 31 March 2007.
The Company also belongs to the Invensys Pension Scheme, which is the principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees. The Invensys
Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme. However, the Company is unable to separately identify its share of the underlying assets
and liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit scheme to which it participates on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore accounts for this
scheme as a defined contribution scheme, in accordance with the provisions of FRS 17. The scheme is currently in deficit. Details of the deficit are
included in Note 25 to the Group financial statements. Pension costs in respect of the Invensys Pension Scheme represented contributions payable
in the year and amounted to £1 million (2006: £1 million). At 31 March 2007, there was £nil of outstanding contributions included in creditors
(2006: £nil). NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

On 10 July 2006, 2,274,914,324 ordinary shares of 1p each with an aggregate nominal value of £23 million were issued and fully paid for cash of
£342 million in a fully underwritten two for five Rights issue.
Subsequent to the Rights issue, the Company’s ordinary shares have been consolidated on the basis of one new ordinary share of 10p each for
every 10 existing ordinary shares of 1p each on 7 August 2006. On that date, the total number of shares in issue therefore reduced from
7,962,222,990 ordinary shares of 1p each to 796,222,299 ordinary shares of 10p each.
Shares reserved for issue under share options and awards
As a consequence of the Rights issue, with effect from 15 June 2006 all options granted under the various share option schemes operated by the
Company and awards granted under the Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) have, in accordance with the rules of the
respective schemes and as approved by the HM Revenue and Customs (where appropriate), been adjusted as follows: (a) the number of shares in
respect of which options have been granted have been adjusted by the application of a multiplication factor of 1.07058 and the exercise price
has been adjusted by a multiplication factor of 0.93406; and (b) the number of shares in each LTIP award has been adjusted by a multiplication
factor of 1.07058. Subsequently, as a consequence of the Share consolidation, with effect from 7 August 2006, the number of shares comprised
in each option and award were divided by 10 and the exercise option prices were multiplied by 10.
All figures presented in the section below for the number of share options and awards, and the amounts for exercise prices and average prices
have been restated to take into account the effects of the Rights issue and Share consolidation as noted above.
During the year the Company issued 16,414 ordinary shares of 10p each pursuant to the exercise of options under the Invensys Savings Related
Share Option Scheme.
On 1 June 2006, 3 July 2006, 11 August 2006, 14 August 2006, 5 October 2006, 15 November 2006, 30 November 2006, 14 February 2007 and
21 March 2007 conditional awards over 4,523,636 shares, 90,454 shares, 496,220 shares, 164,364 shares, 83,624 shares, 19,695 shares, 85,719
shares, 263,318 shares and 21,823 shares respectively were granted under the LTIP. The awards are subject to a three year performance period
from the date of grant after which 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirement will be released at that time
with the other 50% being deferred for one year. Outstanding awards under the LTIP at 31 March 2007, which, subject to satisfaction of the
performance requirement and any appropriate holding period, will be released at various dates between 2008 and 2011, were 19,644,641
(2006: 21,596,351).
As at 31 March 2007, outstanding executive share options exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance condition, at
various dates between 2007 and 2014 and at various prices between 154.59p and 3,419.55p per ordinary share, and at an average price of
1,194.10p per ordinary share, were 3,110,465 (2006: 6,667,958).
Outstanding options under the Company’s various savings related share option schemes at 31 March 2007, exercisable at various dates between
2007 and 2010 and at various prices between 130.77p and 2,386.96p per ordinary share, and at an average price of 273.19p per ordinary share,
were 1,135,664 (2006: 1,928,560).
In addition, as at 31 March 2007, no options were outstanding over the Invensys International Holdings Limited (formerly BTR plc) ordinary shares
under the BTR Savings Related Share Option Scheme (2006: 28,443). All outstanding options lapsed on 1 July 2006. NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

13 Share-based payment plans
Where applicable figures presented in this note for the number of share options and awards and the amounts for exercise prices and fair values
have been restated to take into account the effects of the Rights issue and Share consolidation as detailed in Note 10.
The Company operates various share schemes under which relevant awards have been granted and are outstanding as detailed below:
Plans for senior employees
Executive share options
Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme
Grant details
An executive share option scheme under which options have been granted to directors and senior executives at no cost. Options are exercisable
between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant date at a price equal to the average middle market quoted price of the Company’s shares
over the five dealing days which precede the date of grant. Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or in the case of awards granted as
share appreciation rights, in cash.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: (a) for grants made prior to 25 July 2001, earnings per share (EPS) performance of RPI + 12% over a three year period
to be applied each year until the earlier of when the condition is met or the measurement period the last financial year of which is the year
preceding that in which the option will lapse; (b) for grants made between 25 July 2001 and 16 June 2002 EPS of RPI + 12% in the three years
after grant or EPS of RPI + 16% in the four years after grant or EPS of RPI + 20% in the five years after grant, failing which the option will lapse;
and (c) for grants made on 17 June 2002 and after, total shareholder return (TSR) performance against a peer group of the FTSE100 over a
performance period of three, four or five years commencing on the date of grant. 40% will be exercisable if the median position is achieved,
rising to 100% if upper quartile position is achieved. Between these two points the option will vest on a straight-line basis. If the performance
condition is not met in full at the first measurement then it will be retested against the fixed base in years four and five. If the median position
is not achieved by the end of the fifth year the option will lapse.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be exercisable
for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The Company does not propose to operate the Scheme, except in the case of recruitment situations, where it may be considered appropriate.
Hence no options were granted during the years ended 31 March 2007 or 31 March 2006.
Details of executive share options outstanding under this scheme including the option granted to Mr Henriksson under a separate arrangement
on 1 June 2004, are as follows:

The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.7 years (2006: 7.2 years) and the range of
exercise prices was between 154.59p and 1,530.08p. NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
13 Share-based payment plans (continued)
Long-term incentives
Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Grant details
A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to directors and senior executives at no (or nominal) cost. Depending on the country
in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: (a) a nominal price option award which
is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment (unless the Company determines otherwise); (b) a conditional share award; or (c) a cash award
(granted in respect of a notional number of shares). Awards are normally subject to a three year performance period, commencing on the date of
award, followed by a retention period. For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 the retention period was two years; for awards made on or after
22 July 2005, 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements will be released at the end of the performance period with
the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements:
TSR test
TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (with no retesting opportunities). TSR must rank
at the median position (when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR) in order for 25% of the shares subject to the award to be
available (subject to the retention period), rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is achieved. Between these positions, the
number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis. If at least median position is not achieved the whole award will lapse. The peer groups
selected for the relevant awards are as follows:
• awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of grant; and
• awards granted on or after 22 July 2005: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, Schneider, Siemens,
Smiths Group and Yokogawa.
Overall performance test
The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that: (a) for awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 there has been a sustained delivery over
the performance period, regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds and reduction in Group indebtedness;
(b) for awards granted on or after 22 July 2005 that two underpins have been met: (1) achievement of stretching internal free cash flow targets;
and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items; and (c) for awards granted on or after 1 June 2006 that two underpin tests have been met:
(1) relating to the successful completion of the 2006 Refinancing and in addition that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying
financial performance of the Company; and (2) efficient management of legacy liability items.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released
in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee after the completion of the first two years of the
performance period.
Scheme use
Given that no further awards can be granted under the LTIP after July 2008 it has been decided that a new share-based long-term incentive plan,
to be known as the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP) should be established. Implementation of the LTIP is subject to the approval of
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Grants made during the years ended 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2006 are detailed below:

Grant details
A restricted share plan whereby awards, to be satisfied by the transfer of existing issued shares or in cash, are granted to certain senior employees

cases shares are subject to a holding period historically of one or two years following vesting.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released in defined
good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.

Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan (TBOP)
Grant details
The Company introduced the Turnaround Bonus Overlay Plan (TBOP) in 2005/06 under which executives have the opportunity to receive
a supplemental bonus of up to 100% of their base salary in respect of any financial year to be paid in shares upon reaching specified target levels
of performance. The TBOP operates in addition to the existing Executive Bonus Plan (EBP). Any bonuses earned under the TBOP (the Overlay
Bonus) are payable in shares with 50% of the shares awarded being released following the first anniversary of those shares being awarded and
the other 50% being released following the second anniversary.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: the amount of the Overlay Bonus (which in turn determines the level of the award) is set by reference to the
performance targets specified for the executive in the EBP.
Service requirements: release of the shares is generally subject to continued employment at the relevant date although shares may be released
early in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use
The first grant under the TBOP was made on 1 June 2006. It was originally anticipated that the TBOP would be operated up to and including the
financial year 2007/08. However, as a result of the changes being made to the annual incentive arrangements for 2007/08 onwards (as detailed in
the Remuneration report), the TBOP will cease to be operated one year early. It is anticipated that the awards for the financial year 2006/07 will
be granted in June 2007.
Grants made during the year ended 31 March 2007, the first year during which TBOP awards were granted, are detailed below:

Invensys Savings Related Share Option Scheme
Grant details
The Scheme operates in the UK, is based on a savings plan and is offered to eligible full and part-time employees. Options may be granted at up
to a 20% discount to the market price of the Company’s shares immediately preceding the date of invitation. The vesting period for the options is
three, five or seven years.
Vesting requirements
Performance requirements: the Scheme operates in the UK within specific tax legislation and is therefore not subject to performance conditions
other than that a participant is required to complete the savings contract in order to exercise their options.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be exercisable
for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases.
Scheme use
The use of the Scheme and potential future launches are reviewed on a regular basis. No options were granted under this Scheme during the years
ended 31 March 2007 or 31 March 2006.
Details of relevant options outstanding during the year are as follows:

The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.0 years (2006: 1.3 years) and the exercise
price is 130.77p.
Measurement of fair value
The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to calculate the fair value of options granted. An ‘adjusted market value’ method of
valuation, based on market value at grant date, adjusted for expected forfeitures and market-based performance conditions has been used to
calculate the fair value of all other awards (i.e. LTIP and RSP awards).
Expected volatility was based on both historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous ten years and on the implied volatility
of traded options of the Company’s shares. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for
the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Share-based payment expense
The Company recognised total expenses of £3 million (2006: £3 million) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during
the year.

Notes
(i) The income statements for 2007, 2006 and 2005 are presented under IFRS and for years 2004 and 2003 under UK GAAP. Therefore for 2007, 2006 and 2005 all income
statement line items from revenue to profit/(loss) after taxation relate to continuing operations and the result from discontinued operations is separately disclosed on the
face of the income statement. For 2004 and 2003 all line items relate to total Group.
(ii) The nature of the main adjustments that would make the years 2004 and 2003 comply with IFRS are as follows:
(a) reclassification of the income statement on a line by line basis for discontinued operations and disclosing the total amount for discontinued operations on the line
entitled ‘Profit after taxation – discontinued operations’ in compliance with IFRS 5;
(b) reversal of goodwill amortisation, and of amounts in respect of recycling of goodwill in reserves related to businesses disposed in the period;
(c) capitalisation of development costs that would be capitalised on the balance sheet under IAS 38 criteria; and
(d) recognition of foreign exchange gains and losses on unhedged net debt (recorded directly in equity under UK GAAP).
(iii) The balance sheets for 2004 and 2003 are presented under UK GAAP. The nature of the main adjustments that would make these periods comply with IFRS are as follows:
(a) capitalisation of development costs that would be capitalised on the balance sheet under IAS 38 criteria;
(b) recognition of finance leases on the balance sheet, previously treated as operating leases under UK GAAP;
(c) recognition of full provision for vacation pay under IAS 19; and
(d) increase in capitalised goodwill due to reversal of goodwill amortisation in the income statement.

Tips on protecting your shareholding
• Ensure all your certificates are kept in a safe place or hold your
shares electronically in CREST via a nominee.
• Keep all correspondence from the Registrars which shows your
shareholder reference number in a safe place, or destroy
correspondence by shredding.
• If you change address inform the Registrars. If you receive a letter
from the Registrars regarding a change of address and have not
recently moved, please contact them immediately. You may be a
victim of identity theft.
• If you are buying or selling shares, only deal with brokers registered
in your country of residence or the UK.

Warning to Shareholders
Over the last year many companies have become aware that their shareholders have
received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters
which imply a connection to the company concerned. These are typically from
overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what often
turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and a 2006 survey by the
Financial Services Authority (FSA) has reported that the average amount lost by
investors is around £20,000. It is not just the novice investor that has been duped in
this way; many of the victims had been successfully investing for several years.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy
shares at a discount or offers of free reports into the Company.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation and make a
record of any other information they give you, e.g. telephone number, address etc.
• Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved.
You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/register.
• The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are
targeting, or have targeted, UK investors and any approach from such organisations
should be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date and any
other appropriate action can be considered. If you deal with an unauthorised firm,
you would not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme. The FSA can, preferably, be contacted by completing an
online form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml or,
if you do not have access to the internet, on 0845 606 1234.
• Inform the Company’s Registrars on 0870 600 3963. They are not able to
investigate such incidents themselves but will record the details and pass them on
to the Company and liaise with the FSA.
Details of any sharedealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in
company mailings.
